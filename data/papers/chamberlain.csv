Acacia aprica is known from six extant populations and one extinct population. Five of the extant populations are restricted to linear road reserves with the sixth population located in a small native vegetation remnant. Acacia cochlocarpa ssp. cochlocarpa is known from a single population also situated on a road verge. Size class structure, levels of canopy death and an absence of juveniles indicated that all populations are in decline. Flowering intensity and success varied between populations and years in A. aprica and between years in A. cochlocarpa ssp. cochlocarpa. Seed bank analysis indicated that seeds were patchily distributed while experimental ﬁres demonstrated that such events could break seed dormancy and promote germination. Both taxa have similar germination physiologies and showed increased germination after seeds were exposed to heat. Following emergence, however, competition with annual weeds had a negative impact on seedling growth and survival in both taxa. While vertebrate grazing had some inﬂuence, weeds were the major inhibitory inﬂuence on recruitment. Reduced ﬁre frequencies since fragmentation may be responsible for population decline in both taxa but other site speciﬁc factors such as weeds and grazing may aﬀect the establishment of seedlings following ﬁre. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Large odonates reduced species richness in natural tree holes, but did not significantly reduce macroorganism abundance. The presence of larvae of the mosquito Culex urichii and the ceratopogonid midge Bezzia snowi were negatively associated with the presence of large odonate larvae. In natural tree holes, leaf litter addition and removal respectively increased and decreased richness by c. 1 species relative to controls, and macroorganism abundance was greater in litter addition holes than in litter removal holes. Independent effects of predation showed similar patterns in artificial holes, but there was no predator×resource interaction, partly due to the short duration of the experiment. Predators grew faster when litter was abundant, and indirectly reduced litter degradation rates when resources were scarce in artificial holes.

"NCY52WFA","journalArticle","","Tielbörger, Katja; Kadmon, Ronen","Indirect effects in a desert plant community: is competition among annuals more intense under shrub canopies?","","","","","","An unresolved discussion in contemporary ecology deals with the relative importance of competition along environmental gradients. In deserts, local-scale differences in environmental productivity may be caused by the presence of shrubs, which represent a favorable habitat for annual populations within a nutrient-poor matrix. In this study, we attempted to test the hypothesis that facilitation of desert annuals by shrubs increase the intensity of competition among the annual plants. Such negative indirect effects have so far been ignored in studies about plant-plant interactions. We tested our hypothesis by measuring seedling survival and fecundity of four abundant annual plant species with and without neighbors in open areas and under shrub canopies in a sandy desert area. Our ﬁndings did not indicate indirect negative effects of shrubs on their understory annuals. Sensitivity to the presence of neighbors varied between species and surprisingly, the species with the smallest seeds was the only one which was not negatively affected by the presence of neighbors. In contrast to our hypothesis, there was no difference between the habitat types shrubs and openings in absolute and relative competition intensity. Our overall results suggest that negative indirect effects of shrubs are unimportant in determining demographic response of understory annual plants.","","2021-09-30 16:39:51","2021-09-30 16:39:51","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/GEWQ5PTC/Tielbörger and Kadmon - Indirect effects in a desert plant community is c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 1996, 19 clones of each species were selected, and seed-set success by a net-bagging (to exclude insect visitation) and an artiﬁcial pollination (to remove pollen limitation) were compared to by natural pollination. For S. miyabeana, the same experiment was repeated in two populations in 1997. Proportion of seed set through wind pollination dominated in both species in this study. Pollen limitation was common under natural conditions, and S. sachalinensis relied more on insect pollination for seed production than S. miyabeana. Meteorological factors such as precipitation and hours of sunshine during the ﬂowering season inﬂuenced the potential reproductive activity of the willow between years. In the wet and cloudy spring of 1996, clones which obtained high seed set depended more on insect pollination for both species, whereas in the dry and sunny spring of 1997, such clones depended more on wind pollination for S. miyabeana. Because the efﬁciency of wind pollination seemed to be more sensitive to ﬂuctuating weather conditions than insect pollination, insect pollination was considered to play an assurance role for seed production in these willows.","","2021-09-30 16:39:54","2021-09-30 16:39:54","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/MWQQ3CJG/Tamura and Kudo - Wind pollination and insect pollination of two tem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The predators used (Saduria entomon and Crungon crangon) are the major epibenthic crustacean predators of the northern Baltic coastal waters, and the prey organism in the experiments (the bivalve Macoma balthica) is, by frequency of occurrence and by biomass, the dominant infaunal organism among the zoobenthos. In the field the predatory effect of Saduria was tested on the entire infaunal community. The field experiment on direct predation by Saduria on the entire infaunal assemblage significantly reduced the density of the polychaete Manayunkia aestuarina. Aquarium experiments show that although direct predation by Saduriu or physical sediment disturbance alone had little effects on juvenile ( < 3 mm) Macoma, the combined effects of these factors were significant, and more important than the sum of the two single factors, demonstrating synergistic negative effects. Experiments with Saduria and Crungon in relation to adult (7-17 mm) Mucoma showed sublethal effects on length-weight relationships and on a general index of condition in the mussels.

A secondary goal was to assess the effects of crayfish and darters on the basal trophic level (periphyton) in the system. Presence and absence of crayfish and darters were manipulated in situ in wire mesh cages (0.2 m2, 6-mm mesh) using a 2 x 2 factorial, randomized block design. Invertebrates and periphyton (for chlorophyll a analysis) were sampled biweekly for 6 wk from artificial rock substrates within these cages. Neither consumer significantly affected chlorophyll a accumulation. Darters alone had no significant effects on total invertebrate abundance. Crayfish alone caused, on average, a 58% reduction in total invertebrate abundance relative to exclosures, and most common invertebrate taxa were negatively affected. In the presence of darters, however, crayfish reduced invertebrate numbers by only 29% relative to exclosures. Darters apparently modified the ability of crayfish to suppress invertebrate abundance, although the mechanism is unclear.

The net inﬂuence of ants on willow growth will depend on a balance between the beneﬁts ants provide to the plant through predation on herbivores and the costs to the plant through the protection of aphids. Using both ﬁeld observations and experimental manipulations of the densities of ants and tended aphids, I tested the hypothesis that this balance differs between the two willow species. On both observational and experimental willows, I followed the insect densities throughout one growing season and measured leaf damage and willow growth. The results from both data sets suggest that the effects of ants on the herbivory and consequent growth of these willows differ. Especially F. aquilonia had a positive effect on the growth of S. phylicifolia, whereas the effect on S. myrsinifolia was negligible or even slightly negative. These differences can be derived from three factors: (1) the ant-tended aphid Pterocomma salicis L. was very abundant on both willow species, leading to strong negative impact of ants on the willows, (2) S. myrsinifolia harbored lower densities of leaf-chewing insects, which made the positive effect of ants through reduced leaf damage less likely, and (3) the dominant leaf-chewing herbivore on S. myrsinifolia, a leaf beetle Phratora vitellinae L., is chemically defended against predatory ants, being thus less preyed on than the predominating generalist leaf-chewing herbivores on S. phylicifolia. Furthermore, when ants were not attending aphids, they even facilitated P. vitellinae, apparently by removing other predators. This study provides one explanation for the debate of whether ants beneﬁt or harm plants: differences in herbivore resistance of plants may lead to diverging or even opposite results in tritrophic interactions between plants, their herbivores, and predatory ants.","2002","2021-09-30 16:40:05","2021-09-30 16:40:05","","11","","10","83","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/QBEBLYAP/Sipura - 2002 - CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF ANTS ON THE HERBIVORY AND G.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested two hypotheses to explain why some species initially increased and why subsequently some of these (the outbreak species) decreased again. The study was designed around eight phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs), each containing related species with different dynamics. Our ﬁrst hypothesis was that persistent increasers and outbreakers have higher intrinsic rates of natural increase than control species (species without trends), allowing them to spread when interspeciﬁc competition is reduced by drought. This was tested by measuring establishment and seed production of species in ﬁeld experiments, with and without interspeciﬁc competition. Seed production in outbreak species responded more strongly to release from interspeciﬁc competition than it did in either of the other groups of species. Our second hypothesis was that outbreak species eventually declined because they lacked the genetic variation necessary to adapt to the novel habitats to which they had initially spread. We tested this by measuring mating systems and genetic diversity in persistent and outbreak species in the PGE. In seven out of seven PICs tested, the outbreak species was more selﬁng than its persistent relative. There was a signiﬁcant positive correlation between outcrossing rate and gene diversity.

Both species regenerate abundantly after ﬁres: pine through seedlings and holm oak through resprouts. Cumulative nutrient losses caused by frequent ﬁres may have decreased soil nutrient availability in such areas. To assess the role of nitrogen and phosphorus as limiting factors for growth of these species during post-ﬁre recovery, a ﬁeld fertilisation and competition experiment was conducted in a 5-year post-ﬁre shrubland on calcareous soil, where naturally-regenerated saplings of Aleppo pine and resprouts of interior holm oak ͑Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia͒ coexist. Three years after fertilisation, relative basal area increment was 56% greater in pines fertilised with 250 kg P ha–1 than in non fertilised ones. N fertilisation had small or no effects. Interactions between N and P fertilisation were not observed. Growth of Aleppo pine only increased with P fertilisation when neighbours were removed. Hence, the negative effect of neighbours on growth was greater when P availability was enhanced by fertilisation. In contrast, holm oak was able to grow more ͑110%͒ in response to increased P supply even without neighbour removal. A common garden experiment was then conducted with potted seedlings to investigate whether the suggested higher competitive capacity of holm oak for P held under a range of P amendments on different soils and competitive situations. P fertilisation increased seedling biomass yield of both species. When P availability increased, a negative effect of neighbours on growth was observed for holm oak and in 70 a lesser extent for Aleppo pine. In conclusion, in the ﬁeld, holm oak resprouts showed higher competitive ability for P uptake compared to Aleppo pine saplings, but in potted seedlings in common garden conditions this trend was not observed. Therefore holm oak is not always competitively superior to Aleppo pine for P. Potted seedlings of both species had a notable plasticity in shoot/root biomass allocation, but only holm oak increased its proportional allocation to roots when neighbours were present. P availability can be a key factor in growth and competitive relations of these two species, but effects differ depending on soil type, individual age, regeneration type ͑i.e., seedling versus resprouts͒, and competitive situation.","2004","2021-09-30 16:40:10","2021-09-30 16:40:10","2021-09-30 16:40:10","307-319","","2","174","","Plant Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/XCFK7BJZ/Sardans et al. - 2004 - Phosphorus limitation and competitive capacities o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a second experiment using a subset of the plant populations used in the first experiment, we detected significant G×G interactions for both plant and rhizobium fitness. Moreover, the plant population with which rhizobium strains gained the greatest benefit depended on the nitrogen environment. Finally, we found that in a high nitrogen environment, all plant populations had lower fitness when inoculated with a 1 : 1 mixture of strains than with the worse single strain alone, suggesting that nitrogen shifts the exchange of benefits in favour of rhizobia. Our data suggest that genotype, nitrogen and biotic dependency might contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in mutualist quality when coupled with spatial or temporal heterogeneity in the environment.","2007-08-07","2021-09-30 16:40:15","2021-09-30 16:40:15","2021-09-30 16:40:15","1905-1912","","1620","274","","Proc.

Predators were either enclosed in or excluded from replicate benthic cages (20 × 30 × 10 cm). Ruisseau du Cran Carré (RCC) has a normal complement of fish, while Low Hope Creek (LHC) is fishless. In June 1983, two species of fish were manipulated (one fish per cage, five replicate cages per treatment) in RCC, while the salamander Eurycea bislineata was manipulated in LHC. In August 1983, brook trout fry were manipulated in both streams. It was anticipated that the fauna in LHC, having had no previous contact with fish, would be more susceptible to fish predation than the fauna of RCC. Gut analysis revealed that fish did feed in the cages. However, neither fish predation nor salamander predation had significant effects on prey communities in either stream in June. Community parameters (species richness and diversity, and total numbers of individuals) were not influenced by the presence or absence of fish or salamanders. In August, three-quarters of the taxa were more abundant without trout than with trout. However, few individual taxa were significantly affected by the fish. This effect was similar in both streams. By enclosing fish in a fishless stream, this experiment was designed to enhance the possible effects offish predation on the lotic macrobenthic community. This work strengthens the idea that brook trout are not major structuring agents of the macrobenthic communities of small streams.","1986-09-01","2021-09-30 16:40:20","2021-09-30 16:40:20","2021-09-30 16:40:20","1930-1936","","9","64","","Can.

The predatory devil crayﬁsh, Cambarus diogenes Girard functions as an ecosystem engineer constructing extensive burrow systems through aquatic habitats. Despite crayﬁsh posing a serious predation threat, preliminary data indicate that the federally endangered Hines Emerald dragonﬂy larvae, Somatochlora hineana Williamson regularly inhabit crayﬁsh burrows. During late summer, S. hineana larval habitat dries up; leaving crayﬁsh burrows as some of the only wetted habitats. Thus, C. diogenes can affect S. hineana through both direct, negative and indirect positive effects. We examined the positive role of crayﬁsh burrows as drought refuges, and the threat of predation by C. diogenes on S. hineana larvae. Monthly ﬁeld sampling indicated that S. hineana use open channel areas in spring and early summer moving into burrow systems in mid summer when channel areas normally dry. Laboratory experiments and ﬁeld observations conﬁrmed that crayﬁsh prey on S. hineana larvae. Adult crayﬁsh were a larger predation threat than juvenile crayﬁsh. Despite their negative predatory impact, removal of crayﬁsh from burrows in the ﬁeld did not enhance densities of S. hineana larvae. Although S. hineana may face the threat of predation in burrows, they face a greater risk of desiccation if they remain in the open channel. These results lead to the counterintuitive conclusion that the maintenance of a predator is important for conserving an endangered prey species.","2006-07","2021-09-30 16:40:22","2021-09-30 16:40:23","2021-09-30 16:40:22","584-591","","4","130","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/TGZJJT43/Pintor and Soluk - 2006 - Evaluating the non-consumptive, positive effects o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed that thistles with high larval densities of T. horridus (66 per plant) produced more and shorter ﬂower stems, signiﬁcantly fewer ﬂower heads, and delayed ﬂowering by 1 week when compared to uninfested thistles. Also, colonization and oviposition on ﬂower heads by adult R. conicus were as much as three and ﬁve times lower, respectively, on thistles heavily infested with T. horridus than on uninfested thistles. As a result, 63% fewer R. conicus adults developed from T. horridus-infested thistles. Musk thistles that were infested with lower densities of T. horridus larvae (<20 per plant) also produced multiple stems that were usually shorter than uninfested thistles. However, no diﬀerences were observed in ﬂower head production or in the behavioral responses of R. conicus to T. horridus-infested and uninfested plants. In a greenhouse experiment, the mortality rate of R. conicus was higher on musk thistles that were heavily infested by T. horridus, implying a change in musk thistle quality. However, this eﬀect was apparent only at low R. conicus larval densities. T. horridus can indirectly and negatively aﬀect R. conicus through a variety of mechanisms, but only when densities of T. horridus are high. This ﬁnding may have important implications for the continued redistribution of both weevils, which were imported for the classical biological control of musk thistle, a noxious weed in pastures and rangeland.","2004-05","2021-09-30 16:40:26","2021-09-30 16:40:26","2021-09-30 16:40:26","95-109","","1","30","","Biological Control","Indirect effect of early-season infestations of Trichosirocalus horridus on Rhinocyllus conicus (Coleoptera","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/7XCJ5C76/Milbrath and Nechols - 2004 - Indirect effect of early-season infestations of Tr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Guapira trees produce small fruits with a high protein content (28.4%) and low lipid content (0.3%), and the plant is primarily dispersed by birds. Mature fruits of G. opposita can fall spontaneously with the pulp intact, or be dropped by birds with bits of pulp attached. In either case, ground-dwelling ants rapidly remove the fruits to their nest (93% after 12 h). The ponerine ants Odontomachus chelifer and Pachycondyla striata are the main seed vectors among the ants, and together account for 56% (20 of 36) of the ant-fruit interactions recorded on the forest floor. Individual workers of O. chelifer and P. striata transport single fruits to their nests. Bits of pulp are fed to larvae and worker nestmates, and intact seeds are discarded outside the nest. Germination success in Guapira is higher for cleaned seeds (pulp removed) than for seeds coated by pulp. Guapira seedlings and juveniles are more frequent close to Odontomachus nests than at sites without such nests. Soil samples from Odontomachus nests had greater penetrability, and higher concentrations of P, K, and Ca than random soil samples. Field experiments suggest that the association between G. opposita seedlings and O. chelifer nests can potentially render the plant some protection against herbivores. Results indicate that fruit displacement by ponerine ants play an important role in the biology of G. opposita seeds and seedlings in the sandy forest, and illustrate the complex nature of the dispersal ecology of tropical tree species.","2004-05-01","2021-09-30 16:40:27","2021-09-30 16:40:28","2021-09-30 16:40:27","376-382","","3","139","","Oecologia","Interaction between ants and fruits of Guapira opposita (Nyctaginaceae) in a Brazilian sandy plain rainforest","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/D96WKEQE/Passos and Oliveira - 2004 - Interaction between ants and fruits of Guapira opp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent theoretical work suggests that some types of variance in interaction strength may actually promote stability. Here we provide the ﬁrst empirical evidence that highly variable, contextdependent species interaction strengths and resilient community patterns can be two sides of the same coin. Field experiments show that a persistent rocky intertidal seascape is remarkably resilient to multiple sources of environmental stochasticity largely because of scale dependent and variable species interaction strengths. Biological interactions exert a stabilizing effect because their intensity varies systematically with changes in both physical sources of mortality of established species, as well as recruitment of new individuals. Strong variation in species interaction strengths with disturbance size and environmental conditions is ubiquitous in nature. Elucidating when this context dependency will be stabilizing is critical to predict community-level responses to anthropogenic disturbances.","2006-05","2021-09-30 16:40:32","2021-09-30 16:40:32","2021-09-30 16:40:32","526-536","","5","9","","Ecol Letters","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/2QR3M9PC/Navarrete and Berlow - 2006 - Variable interaction strengths stabilize marine co.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that (i) plants associated with the larger ant species (Camponotus abdominalis) produced more fruits than plants associated with the smaller ant species, and (ii) plants associated with ants were subject to lower levels of herbivory, than plants without ants. Consequently, ant presence is not synonymous of plant protection, and the level of protection by ants will depend on the size of the worker ants in a guild of ant visitors.

The effects of competition on colony growth and on gonad production of the ascidian Didemnum perlucidum were studied in southeastern Brazil by experimentally removing surrounding competitors. Colonies of D. perlucidum competing for space exhibited a growth rate 9 times less than that of colonies that were competitor free. Among the colonies subject to competition, growth rates were unrelated to the percentage of colony border that was free of competitors. However, the identity of the competitor was important in the outcome of border contacts. At the beginning of the experiment, most border encounters of D. perlucidum were with solitary organisms, which in most cases were overgrown. These were progressively replaced by colonial ascidians and bryozoans, resulting mostly in stand-off interactions. Besides reducing asexual growth, spatial competition also affected female gonad production. Colonies free of competitors had a significantly higher proportion of zooids with ovaries.

Linkages through the lower (nutrients) and higher (predators) trophic levels are also starting to be recognized across seascapes. Here, we test the potential importance of a subtidalintertidal trophic linkage through predation on mussel recruits by fish in mussel-dominated communities at 2 tidal levels on wave-exposed shores of southern New Zealand. We show that on rocky shores that include both intertidal benches and subtidal reefs, labrid fish move into the intertidal zone during high tide and exert fast and strong predation pressure on small mussels in the low-, and to a lesser extent mid-shore, intertidal levels. Within 1 d, 80 to 95% of small (5 to 15 mm) transplanted mussels were removed from experimental tiles on the low shore when unprotected from fish predation, while 20 to 60% were removed on the mid-shore; in contrast, most fully protected mussels survived for months. Although at a slower pace, predation was also evident in cages that excluded fish but allowed access to large invertebrate predators. This predation occurred mostly at night when large predatory crabs were abundant at the study sites. The combined predation pressure on small mussels by fish and crabs was reflected in the scarcity of larger/older mussel recruits (5 to 15 mm) outside mature beds on the low shore compared to greater abundance on the mid-shore. The number of mussel settlers in artificial collectors and of smaller/younger recruits (< 5 mm) within barnacle patches did not significantly differ between shore heights; thus, we attribute the difference in abundance of late recruits to differential predation rates by subtidal predators. This study clearly demonstrates that highly mobile subtidal predators, particularly fish, can have important impacts on temperate intertidal food webs, especially on early life stages of habitat-dominating invertebrates, such as mussels in New Zealand and probably elsewhere.","2006-12-07","2021-09-30 16:40:48","2021-09-30 16:40:49","2021-09-30 16:40:48","83-93","","","327","","Mar.

The results suggest that active habitat selection by postlarvae and young juvenile crabs determines the habitat-specific distribution of juvenile blue crabs. Densities of blue crab settlers (megalopae and first instar crabs) in caged habitat patches were high and similar in artificial seagrass, live shoal grass Halodule wrightii, and live oyster habitats (on average 69 to 82 settlers m–2), but significantly lower in mud (26 settlers m–2), indicating active selection for any structurally complex habitat at settlement. Second and third instar juvenile blue crabs (J2 and J3 crabs) also colonized the structurally complex habitats in higher numbers (34 to 115 crabs m–2), compared to mud (14 crabs m–2), demonstrating that young juvenile blue crabs are highly mobile and redistribute soon after metamorphosis. Densities of J2 and J3 blue crabs in uncaged treatments were significantly lower in all habitats than in caged treatments (on average 44% loss), suggesting high predation mortality. However, the loss of settlers and juvenile crabs was similar in all habitats, and had no significant effect on the juvenile crab distribution. Densities of potential predators were on average 5 times higher in the structurally complex habitats than in mud. An aggregation of predators in the refuge habitats, coupled with a refuge at low prey densities in unstructured habitats, appears to decrease the proximate effect of predation on the distribution of juvenile crabs. Concurrent high settlement of a small xanthid crab (cf. Eurypanopeus sp.) occurred almost exclusively in the oyster habitat, suggesting that species with a limited ability to redistribute after metamorphosis may display a more specific selection of the adult habitat at settlement.","2006-02-16","2021-09-30 16:40:50","2021-09-30 16:40:50","2021-09-30 16:40:50","165-181","","","308","","Mar.

I measured the response of native species to experimental manipulation of S. muticum in field experiments in the San Juan Islands of Washington State. Native canopy (brown) and understory (red) algae were more abundant in plots from which S. muticum had been removed, and the native kelp Laminaria bongardiana (the most abundant species of brown alga in the absence of S. muticum) grew more than twice as fast in plots where S. muticum was absent. The negative effects of S. muticum on native algae appear to be a result of shading, rather than changes in water flow, sedimentation, or nutrient availability. S. muticum also had a strongly negative indirect effect on the native sea urchin Stronglyocentrotus droebachiensis by reducing abundances of the native kelp species on which it prefers to feed. My results indicate that S. muticum has a substantial impact on native communities in this region, including effects at multiple trophic levels.

We conducted laboratory and field experiments to evaluate the effects of intra- and interspecific interactions on the use of food resources and behavior of the sea stars Leptasterias polaris and Asterias vulgaris, 2 major predators in subtidal communities of the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We demonstrate interference (encounter) competition between the two. For both species, the presence of the other (as detected by both contact and chemical signals) decreased feeding activity and provoked behavioral changes (avoidance, decrease in percentage feeding). These effects were reversible and short-lived, and were more pronounced when there was a shortage of food and when sea stars were exposed to simulated attacks by the other species (involving pedicellarial pinching). L. polaris seemed to be the inferior competitor as (1) it switched to less profitable prey size (smaller mussels, Mytilus edulis) when A. vulgaris was present, and (2) it avoided A. vulgaris and reduced its feeding activity when food was scarce. The dominance of A. vulgaris is possibly attenuated at our study site (near its northern distributional limit) by the reduction of its fitness when water temperatures are low (most of the year) and during the winter when it migrates to deeper water. Competition for food resources seems to occur periodically (mainly summer), in localized areas (patches and beds of mussels) or when sea stars form dense aggregations in which they are likely to interact frequently. Interactions, and thus the chance of competition, are less likely at greater depths. Coexistence seems to be permitted by both the attenuation of the dominance of A. vulgaris and by the great variations in how L. polaris and A. vulgaris interact (strongly affected by variations in prey availability, sea star abundance, and in the patterns of prey use by both sea stars).","2002","2021-09-30 16:40:53","2021-09-30 16:40:53","2021-09-30 16:40:53","149-162","","","232","","Mar.

Green crabs became dominant predators in rocky intertidal habitats of the region and caused ecological and economic harm in the ensuing decades. During the mid-1990s, the rocky intertidal crab fauna of southern New England began to change once again. A reduction in green crab abundance was coincident with the introduction and spread of another exotic crab species, the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus. Less than 10 yr after its appearance in Long Island Sound, H. sanguineus became the numerically dominant brachyuran at several rocky intertidal sites in the region (e.g. 90+% of the crabs were H. sanguineus; densities of H. sanguineus often exceeded 70 crabs m–2). This study examined consequences of the invasion by H. sanguineus and the decline of C. maenas on a shared prey population in the rocky intertidal zone. Both crab species readily consumed native blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and rates of mussel loss (per predator, per species) were quantified during a series of field experiments. While C. maenas consumed more mussels than H. sanguineus on an individual basis, the greater densities of H. sanguineus made it an important predator of juvenile mussels from a population standpoint. In isolation, the decline of C. maenas (a voracious alien predator) would have benefited mussel populations. However, the replacement of C. maenas by H. sanguineus has apparently had a net negative influence on intertidal blue mussel populations.","2002","2021-09-30 16:40:55","2021-09-30 16:40:55","2021-09-30 16:40:55","135-144","","","227","","Mar.

In the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, these filter feeders are usually associated with seagrass. Two simultaneously conducted field experiments (a mussel density manipulation and a mussel predation experiment) were conducted to examine the potential positive interactions between the suspension-feeding mussel Modiolus americanus (Leach) and the seagrass Thalassia testudinum Banks ex König. The mussel density manipulations resulted in a doubling of the total nitrogen and total phosphorus levels of sediments, and a significant reduction in leaf tissue C:N, N:P and C:P ratios, demonstrating that the mussels increased the sediment nutrient content and that these increased nutrients were biologically available to the plant. T. testudinum responded to the presence of mussels by significantly increasing leaf widths and lengths. In addition, productivity significantly increased in the mussel-addition treatments. Another response to the presence of mussels included a significantly reduced epiphytic load on the seagrass leaves. The mussel predation experiment evaluated the effects of seagrass on the survivorship of the associated mussel, M. americanus. Mean survival was significantly greater in vegetated habitats than in unvegetated sediments. Consequently, when mussels are present in seagrass meadows, they elevate seagrass productivity through either increased nutrient resource pools or reduced epiphytic loads on the leaves, while the seagrass increases mussel survivorship. Thus, this study demonstrates the reciprocal positive interactions of these organisms when associated and suggests that seagrass meadows may exist as a mosaic of nutrient and productivity ‘hot spots’ when suspension-feeding organisms are present.

Nursery habitats may play a n irnportant role in mitigating settlement and post-settlement mortality by providing refuge from predation. We examined these relationships in postlarvae and early juvenile stages of the shore crab Carcinus maenas L. in laboratory and field tethering experiments. We studied habitat and size related habitat mortality using postlarvae and young juvenile crabs as prey, and various predators, including juvenile conspecifics, in several habltats common in shallow (0 to 1 m) soft bottom nursery areas on the Swedish west coast. Settling mortality was high in open sand (80 to go%),whereas a significant habitat refuge was obtained in mussel beds, eelgrass and filamentous green algae, the latter yielding the lowest mortality (13 to 1 4 % ) . Small differences in structural complexity of ephemeral macroalgae dramatically affected predation mortality of tirst instar crabs, with a slgniiicant refuge obtaineci oriiy irl d i y d e of medium complexity. Predation rate on tethered crabs in the field was high (52 to 67 X)only on the smallest crabs (<S mm carapace width, CW), which obtained a significant refuge in the eelgrass habitat compared to open sand. Mortality for larger crabs (5to 25 mm CW) was low (<10%) and similar in sand and eelgrass habitats. Our results indicate that predation is an important process that can create a bottleneck for juvenile shore crab populations during settlement and early juvenile stages, mediated by the availability of nursery habitats. Postlarvae obtained refuge from predation in several different habitats, suggesting that the recruitment of juvenile shore crabs will be less affected by temporal and spatial variation of any single habitat type. The strong slze refuge for crabs larger than 4 mm CW indicates that key predators are small. We suggest that cannibalistic juveniles, which caused predation rates similar to or higher than all other investigated predators, are dominant predators on settling postlarvae and young luvenile crabs in nursery areas. We further propose that habitat- and size-specific predation by small epibenthic predators are an important selective force in habitat selection by postlarvae and ontogenetic shifts in habitat use by juveniles.","1998","2021-09-30 16:40:57","2021-09-30 16:40:58","2021-09-30 16:40:57","211-225","","","166","","Mar.

Such quantification is important to assessing risks and impacts of invasives. We quantified the effects of Lonicera maackii, an exotic shrub invasive in many eastern North American forests, on survival, growth, and reproduction of three perennial herbs: Allium burdickii, Thalictrum thalictroides, and Viola pubescens. We predicted that the spring ephemeral, A. burdickii, would be most impacted, due to early leaf expansion of L. maackii. Field experiments were carried out in two deciduous forest stands, one (Gregg’s Woodlot, GW) disturbed and the other (Western Woods, WW) relatively undisturbed. In each stand, individual herbs were transplanted into a blocked design of 60 plots where L. maackii was present, absent, or removed, and monitored for 5 growing seasons. Lonicera maackii did not affect survival of transplants, but reduced growth and final size of individuals of all three species. For two of the species, A. burdickii and V. pubescens, L. maackii reduced the proportion of live plants flowering in both stands, and reduced the seed or fruit number per flowering individual in GW. For T. thalictroides the proportion flowering was not affected, but seed number per flowering plant was reduced by L. maackii in both stands. For all three species, cumulative seed production over the course of the study was reduced by L. maackii. Overall, effects on the spring ephemeral, A. burdickii, were similar to effects on the other herbs. Because mortality of these established individuals was not affected, short-term studies might conclude forest herbs are unaffected by invasive shrubs.","2004-05-01","2021-09-30 16:40:59","2021-09-30 16:40:59","2021-09-30 16:40:59","359-375","","3","139","","Oecologia","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/DBZMN3G8/Miller and Gorchov - 2004 - The invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii , reduces gro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two experiments demonstrated that mycorrhizal infection of the maternal generation had slight but persistent positive effects on offspring leaf expansion in the early stages of growth. In two other experiments, mycorrhizal infection of mother plants had several long lasting effects on their offspring. Offspring produced by mycorrhizal mother plants had greater leaf areas, shoot and root nutrient contents and root:shoot ratios compared to those produced by non-mycorrhizal mother plants. Moreover, mycorrhizal infection of mother plants significantly reduced the weight of individual seeds produced by offspring plants while it increased the P concentrations of the seeds and the number of seeds per spikelet produced by offspring plants. The effects of mycorrhizal infections of maternal plants on the vigor and performance of offspring plants were associated with higher seed phosphorus contents but generally lighter seeds.

Noninfected fescue (Festuea arundinaeea) seeds and seeds infected with the endophytic fungus, Acremonium eoenophialum, were presented to ant colonies in three different polyalations. Infected seeds were harvested less frequently than non-infected seed for the two populations of Pogonomyrmex rugosus but not for the population of Pogonomyrmex occidentalis.

Results of ant exclusion experiments at the two sites showed that ant visitation resulted in decreased herbivore numbers, decreased leaf area loss, increased growth, and at one site decreased plant mortality. However, this reduction in leaf area loss and increase in growth did not translate into seed set differences between plants with and without ants at either site.

At our study site, V. microstachys grows in nonserpentine grasslands dominated by tall invasive grasses, serpentine meadows dominated by short native forbs, and rocky serpentine slopes with a sparse native herb cover. We hypothesized that these three intermixed habitats acted as a gradient of increasing abiotic stress and decreasing aboveground competition, respectively. We further expected that the abundance and performance of V. microstachys would be highest in serpentine meadows, where neither aboveground competition nor abiotic stress were maximal. Soil and biotic variables showed roughly the expected patterns, but V. microstachys did not show the predicted peak in the middle of the gradient. Emergence, seedling survival, and abundance of V. microstachys were highest, and growth and seed production of survivors were lowest, on rocky serpentine slopes. Field experiments revealed that removal of competitors enhanced all demographic parameters, but only in the more productive habitats. An interaction between seed source and habitat, affecting emergence and survival, indicated ecotypic adaptation to the rocky serpentine slope habitat. We conclude that individual variation caused by local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity allows V. microstachys to survive in widely different habitats, none of which are optimal, resulting in considerable variation in demography.","2002-02","2021-09-30 16:41:07","2021-09-30 16:41:07","2021-09-30 16:41:07","555-562","","4","130","","Oecologia","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/5QTKHN5Z/Jurjavcic et al. - 2002 - Abiotic stress, competition, and the distribution .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first study is about growth and seedling emergence responses of a short-lived carnivorous plant, Drosera capillaris, to reduction in below-ground competition and above- plus below-ground competition. The second study deals with growth and survival responses of a long-lived perennial carnivorous plant, Sarracenia alata, to neighbour removal and prey-exclusion to determine if a reduction in nutrient supply increased the intensity of competition in this nutrient-poor system. Results: Fire increased seedling emergence of the short-lived species by reducing above-ground competition through the destruction of above-ground parts of plants and the combustion of associated litter. Prey exclusion did not increase competitive effects of neighbours on the long-lived species. However, because the experiment was conducted in a year without fire, shade reduced nutrient demand, which may have obviated competition for soil nutrients between Sarracenia alata and its neighbours. Conclusion: Repeated fires likely interact with interspecific differences in nutrient uptake to simultaneously reduce both above-ground competition and competition for nutrients in old-growth ground cover communities in pine savannas. Restoration practitioners should consider the possibility that the composition of the plant community is just as important as fire in ensuring that frequent fires maintain species diversity.","2006-05","2021-09-30 16:41:20","2021-09-30 16:41:20","2021-09-30 16:41:20","11-16","","1","9","","Applied Vegetation Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/JKFZLQQY/Brewer - 2006 - Resource competition and fire‐regulated nutrient d.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prevention of tree–grass interactions through root trenching led to increased soil water content indicating that trees took up more water from the topsoil than they exuded via hydraulic lift. Biomass was higher in trenched plots compared to controls probably because of reduced competition for water. Stable isotope analyses of plant and source water showed that grasses which competed with trees used a greater proportion of deep water compared with grasses in trenched plots. Grasses therefore used hydraulically lifted water provided by trees, or took up deep soil water directly by growing deeper roots when competition with trees occurred. We conclude that any facilitative effect of hydraulic lift for neighbouring species may easily be overwhelmed by water competition in (semi-) arid regions.","2004-08","2021-09-30 16:41:33","2021-09-30 16:41:33","2021-09-30 16:41:33","623-631","","8","7","","Ecol Letters","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/EVJ5QLCH/Ludwig et al. - 2004 - Below-ground competition between trees and grasses.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A laboratory experiment, in which L. vulgare was inoculated with three species of AM fungi, showed that the effects on parasitism rates were mycorrhizal species-dependent. Some fungal combinations increased parasitism, some decreased it, while others had no effect.

The results from a controlled mesocosm experiment showed that: (1) at low productivity, snails were dominated by small-vulnerable species (P. gyrina), predator effects were strong and predator effects caused a trophic cascade extending to producers; (2) at high productivity, snails were dominated by large-invulnerable species (H. trivolvis), predator effects were weak and there was no trophic cascade to producers; (3) at intermediate productivity, alternative stable equilibria were implicated, such that depending on initial conditions, snails were dominated by either small-vulnerable or large-invulnerable species and predator effects were either strong or weak.

We conducted an experiment to study the effects of defoliation and soil fungi on interactions between Centaurea melitensis, an invasive annual from Eurasia, and Nassella pulchra, a native Californian bunchgrass. Defoliation of C. melitensis reduced its ®nal biomass in all species±fungicide treatments, except when C. melitensis was grown with both Nassella and non-treated soil fungi at the same time. In this treatment, the biomass of clipped C. melitensis plants was equal to that of unclipped plants, indicating that soil fungi and Nassella promoted a compensatory response in the weed. Overall, the biomass of C. melitensis was 44% lower when soil fungi were reduced. However, in soil not treated with fungicide, the total biomass of C. melitensis increased in the presence of Nassella, but decreased when it was grown alone. When stressed by defoliation, C. melitensis may bene®t from a form of mycorrhizae-mediated parasitism through a common mycorrhizal network, or Nassella may alter the fungal community in a way that enhances the positive direct effects of soil fungi on Centaurea.","2001-09","2021-09-30 16:41:38","2021-09-30 16:41:38","2021-09-30 16:41:38","429-433","","5","4","","Ecol Letters","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/BRZ2KNFV/Callaway et al. - 2001 - Compensatory growth and competitive ability of an .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence shows enhanced ﬁtness of endophyte infected grasses relative to non-infected ones. Some studies of seed germination show endophyte enhancement of plant ﬁtness in various environments, but inconsistent results indicate that further studies are needed. So far, experiments have failed to separate the confounded effects of population origin and seed management. For this reason, we evaluated the effects of endophyte infection on seed dormancy and germination in Lolium multiﬂorum using an experimental design controlling these factors. Depending on the year of seed production, endophyte infection modiﬁed seed response to light quality, affecting predominantly seed dormancy levels. Nevertheless, the endophyte did not affect base temperature or thermal time of germination. We concluded that endophytes were not a strong inﬂuence on germination behaviour. We speculate from our results that the presence of the endophyte changes germination by an indirect effect, in extending growth of the maternal plant during seed development and ripening. The direct effect of hyphae in the seed on seed behaviour was disregarded, because the difference between infected and non-infected seed varied within the year of seed production. Future experiments should focus on effects of the endophyte on the canopy of parent plants during seed production and ripening, and, hence, on subsequent dormancy and germination of the seeds.","2006-09","2021-09-30 16:41:39","2021-09-30 16:41:39","2021-09-30 16:41:39","767-775","","6","31","","Austral Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/KTF7KVYD/Gundel et al. - 2006 - Effects of the Neotyphodium endophyte fungus on do.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We manipulated 160 experimental quadrats by clipping, irrigation and seed addition and assessed recruitment by exotics in an area dominated by perennial grasses and perennial grass recruitment in an area dominated by exotics. Treatment effects differed with season for exotics: their biomass increased with irrigation in autumn and seed addition in winter. However, in both periods other factors, probably soil properties, also had a strong effect. We detected no perennial grass seedlings in the quadrats over 1 year, possibly due to unsuitable environmental conditions or persistent high competition levels. Under controlled conditions the presence of the invasive annual Avena barbata had a strong negative effect on the recruitment of the native perennial Austrodanthonia caespitosa at any moisture and nutrient availability. Avena also germinated faster and more frequently than Austrodanthonia, especially at low soil moisture. During an imposed drought Austrodanthonia seedlings survived longer in the absence of Avena. The results suggest that annual exotics are highly responsive to resources and can quickly invade areas, while the re-colonization of invaded areas by native grasses requires a complex (and less likely) rainfall regime.","2005-09","2021-09-30 16:41:41","2021-09-30 16:41:41","2021-09-30 16:41:41","684-694","","6","30","","Austral Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/55TDPM5G/Lenz and Facelli - 2005 - The role of seed limitation and resource availabil.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental removals of P. novaehollandiae on four 1 ha treatment plots and additions on a further four 1 ha plots show significatii effects of interspecific competition when compared to two I ha unmanipulated control plots. Significant effects of P. novaehollandiae populations on ihe abundance ofM. musculus populations were observed for number of captures/day, abundance/ trapping session and for the recruitment of new individuals over the post-removal period, thus allowing rejection ofthe null hypothesis in each case. There was an apparent ceiling on ihe total rodent abundance which is indicative of a resource limitation. The resource in short supply appears to be space, but it is not clear if ihe competition isfor food or shelter resources contained within such space or for the space per se, but the latter seems less likely. The confirmation of this interspecific competition supports the inferences drawn from a considerable amount of indirect evidence, largely descriptive, obtained from previous studies in the Myall Lakes National Park. This study also shows that competition is one of the mechanisms controlling the replacement of species in the succession following disturbance and lends support to the habitat accommodation model proposed for such succession. These points support previous statements on the importance of interspecific competition as a determinant of the structure of these small-mammal communities.","1984-12","2021-09-30 16:41:44","2021-09-30 16:41:44","2021-09-30 16:41:44","323-334","","4","9","","Austral Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/29SFQISG/Fox and Pople - 1984 - Experimental confirmation of interspecific competi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in photosynthesis in host plants caused by atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment may, therefore, inﬂuence those mutualistic interactions, potentially modifying plant nutrient acquisition and interactions with other coexisting plant species. However, few studies have so far examined the interactive controls of endophytes and mycorrhizae over plant responses to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Using Festuca arundinacea Schreb and Plantago lanceolata L. as model plants, we examined the effects of elevated CO2 on mycorrhizae and endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) and plant nitrogen (N) acquisition in two microcosm experiments, and determined whether and how mycorrhizae and endophytes mediate interactions between their host plant species. Endophyte-free and endophyte-infected F. arundinacea varieties, P. lanceolata L., and their combination with or without mycorrhizal inocula were grown under ambient (400 lmol molÀ1) and elevated CO2 (ambient 1 330 lmol molÀ1). A 15N isotope tracer was used to quantify the mycorrhiza-mediated plant acquisition of N from soil. Elevated CO2 stimulated the growth of P. lanceolata greater than F. arundinacea, increasing the shoot biomass ratio of P. lanceolata to F. arundinacea in all the mixtures. Elevated CO2 also increased mycorrhizal root colonization of P. lanceolata, but had no impact on that of F. arundinacea. Mycorrhizae increased the shoot biomass ratio of P. lanceolata to F. arundinacea under elevated CO2. In the absence of endophytes, both elevated CO2 and mycorrhizae enhanced 15N and total N uptake of P. lanceolata but had either no or even negative effects on N acquisition of F. arundinacea, altering N distribution between these two species in the mixture. The presence of endophytes in F. arundinacea, however, reduced the CO2 effect on N acquisition in P. lanceolata, although it did not affect growth responses of their host plants to elevated CO2. These results suggest that mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes might interactively affect the responses of their host plants and their coexisting species to elevated CO2.","2007-06","2021-09-30 16:42:01","2021-09-30 16:42:01","2021-09-30 16:42:01","1238-1249","","6","13","","Global Change Biol","Plant nitrogen acquisition and interactions under elevated carbon dioxide","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/8SLGJIYL/Chen et al. - 2007 - Plant nitrogen acquisition and interactions under .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C. gibba is widespread, abundant, and possesses characteristics such as fast growth which may confer a competitive advantage over endemic species like the commercial scallop Pecten fumatus Reeve, 1855. Experimental manipulations in the field showed that ambient densities of C. gibba significantly affected the size and growth of juvenile P. fumatus. This effect was greater than the effect of an equivalent number of conspecific scallops. C. gibba did not, however, affect scallop condition or survival in the short term, although the power of the test to detect a 50% decrease in survival was low. The percentage of experimental scallops lost to different sources of mortality was also unaffected by the presence of C. gibba, as was the density of predators found in experimental enclosures. This study is the first to experimentally demonstrate the impact of an introduced marine mollusc on an endemic species in Australia.

The abundance and diversity of the pollinator assemblage of plants excluded from and exposed to mammalian herbivores, and the combined eﬀect of pollinators and herbivores on plant reproduction were determined over a period of 2 years. Pollinator abundance was higher and diversity was lower on plants excluded from herbivores. Furthermore, the experimental exclusions demonstrated that both pollinators and herbivores aﬀected plant ﬁtness, but their eﬀects were not independent. Herbivores only had a detrimental eﬀect on plant ﬁtness when pollinators were present. Similarly, pollinators enhanced ﬁtness only when herbivores were excluded.

We compared the effects of four different combinations of natural enemies-parasitoids, predators, parasitoids plus predators, and no enemies-on caged aphid populations on marsh elder, Ivafrutescens, in west-central Florida. Using starting densities of natural enemies commonly found in the field, we showed that parasitoid wasps reduced aphid population densities more than predatory ladybird beetles. The addition of predators to cages containing parasites reduced the ability of parasitoids to decrease aphid population densities. Because the experiments ran only over the course of one generation, such a reduction in the effectiveness of parasites is likely caused by interference of predators with parasitoid behavior. Parasitism in the cages containing both parasitoids and predators was reduced when compared to percent parasitism in parasitoid-only cages, but this could also be due to predation. Our experiments showed that ladybird beetles prey on parasitized aphids. Thus over the long-term, the effectiveness of parasites is impaired by the interference of predators on ovipositing parasitoids and by the predation of parasitized aphids. The effects of natural enemies in this system are clearly non-additive.","1996-10","2021-09-30 16:42:25","2021-09-30 16:42:26","2021-09-30 16:42:25","375-379","","2","108","","Oecologia","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/SLL4TZ39/Ferguson and Stiling - 1996 - Non-additive effects of multiple natural enemies o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such interactions are generally thought to enhance invasives’ spread and impact (i.e., the ‘‘invasional meltdown’’ hypothesis); however, exotic species might also act indirectly to slow the spread or blunt the impact of other invasives. On the east coast of the United States, the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae, HWA) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa, EHS) both feed on eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Of the two insects, HWA is considered far more damaging and disproportionately responsible for hemlock mortality. We describe research assessing the interaction between HWA and EHS, and the consequences of this interaction for eastern hemlock. We conducted an experiment in which uninfested hemlock branches were experimentally infested with herbivores in a 2 3 2 factorial design (either, both, or neither herbivore species). Over the 2.5-year course of the experiment, each herbivore’s density was ;30% lower in mixed- vs. single-species treatments.

E. waccamawensis did not respond to density manipulations over the annual experimental period; however, its growth was significantly reduced in the presence of L. ochracea during summer at the deeper site. This negative effect on E. waccamawensis is consistent with competition for resources, and a laboratory experiment estimating mussel grazing rates provided supporting evidence. For L. ochracea, density had no effect on annual growth at the deeper site; at the shallow site, however, high density significantly increased growth. Winter data revealed both negative and positive density-dependence. L. ochracea in high density treatments grew significantly less at the deep site but demonstrated increased growth at the shallow location.

It represents a unique resource where the arrival and establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) within a sown plant community on a low nutrient substrate can be monitored. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi invasion was monitored in a number of ways: by assessing the degree of root colonisation within the roots of plants on the site, by using a successive trap culture technique to determine AMF species richness, and by using sterile substrate bins to determine the extent of wind-borne and rain-dispersed immigration of AMF propagules into the site. Levels of colonisation of indigenous plants by AMF were high in May–June (the pre-ﬂowering phase of growth for many plants) reﬂecting the important role of the mycorrhizal symbiosis in dry, low nutrient soils. Twelve species of AMF were identiﬁed, representing a relatively high diversity for a recently deposited subsoil. An on-site experiment indicated that inoculum of AMF could enter the site within 8 months and that wind dispersal and/or rain were possible vectors. A ﬁeld experiment compared the outplanting performance of commercially-produced Elymus pycnanthus seedlings (in a commercial compost with added nutrients) with seedlings produced in a low nutrient substrate and inoculated with AMF isolated from the site (a mixture of 5 species of Glomus) or left uninoculated. After 14 months in the ﬁeld seedlings, inoculated with the indigenous AMF, had the same tiller production as commercially-produced plants, despite slower initial growth. In contrast, non-mycorrhizal controls grew very poorly with a greater frequency of plant mortality compared with the other treatments. Elymus seedlings inoculated with the indigenous AMF ultimately produced approximately seven times the mean number of seed spikes per surviving plant as commercially-produced seedlings and ﬁve times greater weight of seed spike. A phyto-microbial approach to the revegetation of nutrient-poor soils is proposed to stimulate plant successional processes as a economically-viable sustainable input for landscaping anthropogenic sites.","","2021-09-30 16:42:34","2021-09-30 16:42:34","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/QE88UTK3/Dodd et al. - The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in plant .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When submitted to water stress, no growth reduction of mycorrhizal seedlings was observed. Mycorrhizal seedlings were more sensitive to drought than non-mycorrhizal ones in terms of carbon assimilation, but not with regard to stomatal closure. In contrast to previous studies on temperate tree seedlings, this result precludes a mycorrhizal effect on the hydraulic properties of this species.

We tested this hypothesis for the invasive forb Rorippa austriaca (Brassicaceae). Regeneration from root fragments, subsequent vegetative spread and allocation patterns in relation to varied nutrient supply and intensity and pattern of interspeciﬁc competition were analyzed in container experiments. Regeneration success from root fragments was 100% and clonal spread was rapid but vegetative performance was strongly reduced under unfertilized conditions and, particularly, when interspeciﬁc competition was present. While the ratio of above- to belowground bio-mass did not differ considerably between treatments, R. austriaca allocated a high amount of resources to belowground growth resulting in low aboveground but high belowground biomass at harvest time relative to the matrix vegetation. Differences in shoot number or biomass between simulated gaps and densely vegetated quadrants in the containers were (relatively) weak. Reproductive effort was less reduced under low resource levels, and the clones did not set seed at all, irrespective of the treatment. Our results show that clonal growth by lateral roots and plasticity in clonal growth patterns in R. austriaca promote both exploitation of gaps and nutrient-rich microsites and resistance to competitors. Such plasticity, combined with its ability to regenerate from widely-dispersed root fragments, contribute to the ability of the species to invade and persist within disturbed and spatially heterogeneous habitats.","","2021-09-30 16:42:37","2021-09-30 16:42:37","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/CJ729HQQ/Dietz et al. - Regeneration growth of the invasive clonal forb Ro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using N. diversicolor juveniles as prey, we tested the effects of (1) the temperature variations on predatory activity and (2) the predator density (d 5 114 and 342 ind. m22) on prey mortality, on their growth and their escape behaviour. In the ﬁeld, N. diversicolor alone (d 5 13750 ind. m22), and N. hombergii (d 5 114 and 342 ind. m22) and N. diversicolor juveniles together were enclosed in 15-cm dia. PVC cylinders during 12 weeks, from 7 March to 30 May 1995, in a mudﬂat of the Rance Estuary. In the presence of the predator, the biomass of N. diversicolor juveniles declined 8–12 3 more than in control cylinders, whereas their individual weight was increased. Although it had little effect on the biomass of prey, predator density regulated the consumption by N. hombergii. Predation activity was minimal, but effective, at a temperature of 78C, increased between 9 and 118C, and became constant above 118C. In the laboratory, gradual or sudden temperature variations had little effect on predatory activity of N. hombergii, presumably because they were already physiologically active. Reduction in the abundance of infauna may be due to prey emigration as well as predation: beyond their mortality, N. hombergii induced, proportional to its density, the emigration of juveniles. The experimental results suggest that infaunal predation, by regulating recruit densities, should be considered in addition to the interactions between adults as a strong force structuring soft-bottom communities. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Controlled antexclusion experiments revealed that ant presence (seven species) reduces the abundance of G. xiphias’ natural enemies (salticid spiders, syrphid flies, and parasitoid wasps) on the host plant. The data further showed that ant-tending not only increased homopteran survival, but also conferred a direct reproductive benefit to G. xiphias females, which may abandon the first brood to ants and lay an additional clutch next to the original brood. Two years of experimental manipulations, however, showed that the degree of protection conferred by tending ants varies yearly, and that at initially high abundance of natural enemies the ant species differ in their effects on treehopper survival. Ant effects on treehopper fecundity also varied with time, and with shifts in the abundance of natural enemies.

I conducted a factorial experiment to test the hypotheses that colonization by VAM fungi (1) improves soybean (Glycine max) tolerance to grazing by folivorous Mexican bean beetle (Epilachna varivestis), and (2) indirectly aects herbivores by increasing host resistance. Soybean seedlings were inoculated with the VAM fungus Glomus etunicatum or VAM-free ®ltrate and fertilized with high-[P] or low-[P] fertilizer. After plants had grown for 7 weeks ®rst-instar beetle larvae were placed on bagged leaves. Growth of soybean was little aected by grazing larvae, and no eects of treatments on tolerance of soybeans to herbivores were evident. Colonization by VAM fungus doubled the size of phosphorus-stressed plants but these plants were still half the size of plants given adequate phosphorus. High[P] fertilizer increased levels of phosphorus and soluble carbohydrates, and decreased levels of soluble proteins in leaves of grazed plants. Colonization of grazed plants by VAM fungus had no signi®cant eect on plant soluble carbohydrates, but increased concentration of phosphorus and decreased levels of proteins in phosphorus-stressed plants to concentrations similar to those of plants given adequate phosphorus. Mexican bean beetle mass at pupation, pupation rate, and survival to eclosion were greatest for beetles reared on phosphorusstressed, VAM-colonized plants, refuting the hypothesis that VAM colonization improves host plant resistance. VAM colonization indirectly aected performance of Mexician bean beetle larvae by improving growth and nutrition of the host plant.","","2021-09-30 16:42:54","2021-09-30 16:42:54","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/P9BG9ZUI/Borowicz - A fungal root symbiont modi®es plant resistance to.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, interactions between two or more invasive species may be as important in understanding biological invasions, but they have rarely been studied. In this paper, we describe three ﬁeld experiments that investigated interactions between two non-indigenous plant species invasive in the eastern United States, Lonicera japonica (a perennial vine) and Microstegium vimineum (an annual grass). A press removal experiment conducted within a deciduous forest understory community indicated that M. vimineum was a superior competitor to L. japonica. We tested the hypothesis that the competitive success of M. vimineum was because it overgrew, and reduced light available to, L. japonica, by conducting a separate light gradient experiment within the same community. Shade cloth that simulated the M. vimineum canopy reduced the performance of L. japonica. In a third complementary experiment, we added experimental support hosts to test the hypothesis that the competitive ability of L. japonica is limited by support hosts, onto which L. japonica climbs to access light. We found that the abundance of climbing branches increased with the number of support hosts. Results of this experiment indicate that these two invasive species compete asymmetrically for resources, particularly light.","2006-12","2021-09-30 16:42:57","2021-09-30 16:42:57","2021-09-30 16:42:57","1629-1641","","8","8","","Biol Invasions","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/IR9C5TS6/Belote and Weltzin - 2006 - Interactions between two co-dominant, invasive pla.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although heterogeneity in shelter availability obscured the underlying patterns of density dependence in different ways, the combination of habitat and its interaction with density were two to six times more important than density alone in explaining variation in demographic parameters for juveniles.

We investigated the role of several factors in promoting coexistence among the aphids Aphis nerii, Aphis asclepiadis, and Myzocallis asclepiadis that all specialize on common milkweed {Asclepias syriaca). Competitive exclusion is thought to occur when interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition. Consequently, we investigated whether predators, mutualists, or resource quality affected the strength of intra- vs. interspecific competition among aphids in factorial manipulations of competition with exposure to pr?dation, ants, and variable plant genotypes in three separate experiments. In the pr?dation X competition experiment, predators reduced aphid per capita growth by 66%, but the strength of intra- and interspecific competition did not depend on predators. In the ants X competition experiment, ants reduced per capita growth of A. nerii and M. asclepiadis (neither of which were mutualists with ants) by approximately one-half. In so doing, ants ameliorated the negative effects of these competitors on ant-tended A. asclepiadis by two-thirds, representing a novel benefit of ant-aphid mutualism. Nevertheless, ants alone did not explain the persistence of competitively inferior A. asclepiadis as, even in the presence of ants, interspecific competition remained stronger than intraspecific competition. In the plant genotype X competition experiment, both A. asclepiadis and M. asclepiadis were competitively inferior to A. nerii, with the strength of interspecific competition exceeding that of intraspecific competition by 83% and 23%, respectively. Yet these effects differed among milkweed genotypes, and there were one or more plant genotypes for each aphid species where coexistence was predicted. A synthesis of our results shows that predators play little or no role in preferentially suppressing competitively dominant A. nerii. Nonetheless, A. asclepiadis benefits from ants, and A. asclepiadis and M. asclepiadis may escape competitive exclusion by A. nerii on select milkweed genotypes. Taken as a whole, the coexistence of three host-specific aphid species sharing the same resource was promoted by the dual action of ants as antagonists and mutualists and by genetic diversity in the plant population itself.

While P. australis has historically been restricted to the relatively benign upper border of brackish and salt marshes, it has been expanding seaward into more physiologically stressful regions. Here we test a leading hypothesis that the spread of P. australis is due to anthropogenic modification of coastal marshes. We did a field experiment along natural borders between stands of P. australis and the other dominant grasses and rushes (i.e., matrix vegetation) in a brackish marsh in Rhode Island, USA. We applied a pulse disturbance in one year by removing or not removing neighboring matrix vegetation and adding three levels of nutrients (specifically nitrogen) in a factorial design, and then we monitored the aboveground performance of P. australis and the matrix vegetation. Both disturbances increased the density, height, and biomass of shoots of P. australis, and the effects of fertilization were more pronounced where matrix vegetation was removed. Clearing competing matrix vegetation also increased the distance that shoots expanded and their reproductive output, both indicators of the potential for P. australis to spread within and among local marshes. In contrast, the biomass of the matrix vegetation decreased with increasing severity of disturbance. Disturbance increased the total aboveground production of plants in the marsh as matrix vegetation was displaced by P. australis. A greenhouse experiment showed that, with increasing nutrient levels, P. australis allocates proportionally more of its biomass to aboveground structures used for spread than to belowground structures used for nutrient acquisition. Therefore, disturbances that enrich nutrients or remove competitors promote the spread of P. australis by reducing belowground competition for nutrients between P. australis and the matrix vegetation, thus allowing P. australis, the largest plant in the marsh, to expand and displace the matrix vegetation. Reducing nutrient load and maintaining buffers of matrix vegetation along the terrestrial-marsh ecotone will, therefore, be important methods of control for this nuisance species.","2003-10","2021-09-30 16:43:13","2021-09-30 16:43:13","2021-09-30 16:43:13","1400-1416","","5","13","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/CIB2MJZT/Minchinton and Bertness - 2003 - DISTURBANCE-MEDIATED COMPETITION AND THE SPREAD OF.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disruption of these interactions can be dramatic, significantly reducing the reproductive success of the species and even leading to their extinction. On Menorca Island (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean), we examined the consequences of the disruption of the mutualism between two endemic species: a perennial shrub, (Daphne rodriguezii [Texidor]) and a frugivorous lizard (Podarcis lilfordi [Gunther]). The lizard became extinct from this island (as well as from Mallorca) as a result of the introduction of carnivorous mammals, which has continued since Roman times. The relict mutualism between D. rodriguezii and the lizard currently persists only in an islet (60 ha) where P. lilfordi is still abundant. We hypothesized that the absence of this lizardfrom mostMenorcan populations is thefactor causing the regression of this plant, currently considered at risk of extinction. Through observation and experimentation in the field and laboratory, we found strong evidence that a lack of seed dispersal in Menorca is the main cause of the low seedling recruitment. First, the population with greatest seedling recruitment was that in the islet where lizards were abundant. Second, lizards appeared to be the only dispersers of D. rodriguezii. Lizards consumed large amounts of fruits, without affecting either germination or seedling growth, and moved seeds to sites suitable for plant establishment. Seedlings in Menorca, in contrast, recruited almost exclusively under the parent plants. Third, the effect of other factors that may influence plant population growth (a low fruit set and a high postdispersal seed predation) was similar between the islet and the Menorcan populations. To our knowledge, our results are the first that quantitatively show that a biological invasion can cause a disruption of a specialized plant-vertebrate mutualism that sets the plant partner on the road to extinction.","2005-04","2021-09-30 16:43:16","2021-09-30 16:43:16","2021-09-30 16:43:16","421-431","","2","19","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/7BXQLXIF/Traveset and Riera - 2005 - Disruption of a Plant-Lizard Seed Dispersal System.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, it has not been appreciated that these facultative relationships can be mutualistic. I examined the interaction between Phryganoporus candidus, a subsocial Australian spider, and the extrafloral nectary-bearing shrub Acacia ligulata to explore variability in mutualistic interactions over a three-year period. Spiders enhanced seed production by reducing seed predation by heteropterans, wasps, and weevils. Because spider colonies occupy only a fraction of a plant's volume, average benefits ranged from 0.4 to 6% increases in whole-plant seed production. These benefits were strongest in years of low seed production, suggesting that spiders may buffer plants against female reproductive failure. To evaluate benefits for spiders, I established experimental spider colonies on three common hosts. Spider performance (persistence and prey capture rates) on live A. ligulata and live hopbush Dodonaea viscosa exceeded that on dead acacia, suggesting that live hosts are more beneficial than dead hosts. Stable-isotope analyses demonstrated that colonies living on the three hosts differed substantially in diet, providing a possible mechanism for the observed differential suitability of hosts. However, the analyses were unable to establish conclusively that A. ligulata extrafloral nectar was an important reward for spiders. Variability in the A. ligulataP. candidus system suggests that plant-spider associations, like other facultative protection relationships, likely vary along a continuum from antagonism to mutualism.

To test for continued facilitation of established understory shrubs by Prosopis and to determine if established shrubs compete with the Prosopis nucleus, selective removal experiments were conducted and monitored over a 2 - 5 yr period. Short-term (1 - 3 days) and long-term (2 yr) growth and physiological activities (midday net photosynthesis and leaf/shoot water potential) of two common understory shrubs, Zanthoxylum fagara and Berberis trifoliolata, growing with Prosopis, were generally comparable to those of individuals occurring in clusters where Prosopis was removed. Shrubs growing with an intact Prosopis occasionally showed significantly higher leaf-[N] and pre-dawn water potentials than those in clusters lacking a live Prosopis, especially under drought conditions; however, these differences did not translate into greater midday leaf gas exchange or shoot growth. By comparison, removal of understory shrubs elicited large increases in Prosopis net photosynthesis, annual trunk growth in each of the 5 yr monitored, and seed pod production in three of the four years monitored.

We investigated variation in interaction strength between the original keystone predator, the seastar Pisaster ochraceus, and its primary prey, mussels (Mytilus ca/ifornianus and M. trossulus). The study was prompted by differences in community structure at two low zone sites along the central Oregon coast, Boiler Bay (BB) and Strawberry Hill (SH). Predators, especially seastars, were larger and more abundant at SH than at BB. Further, sessile animals were more abundant and macrophytes were less abundant at SH. Predators were more abundant at wave-exposed sites at both sites, and at SH, sessile invertebrates were more abundant at the wave-exposed location and sand cover was high at the wave-protected location. To test the hypothesis that variation in predation strength explained some of these differences, we examined the seastar-mussel interaction at locations with high and low wave exposure at both sites. Predation intensity was quantified by determining the survival of mussels in clumps (50 mussels per clump, shell length 4-7 em) transplanted to large plots (18-163 m2) with or without seastars in the low intertidal zone. Predation effects were quantified by determining prey recolonization rates in marked quadrats in the same large plots. Spatial variation in interaction strength was quantified by examining predation at scales of metres (among transplants within plots), lO's of metres (between replicate plots within each exposure at each site), 1OO's of metres (between wave exposures within locations), and 10 OOO's of metres (between sites). Temporal variation was evaluated by performing the experiments in 1990 and 1991. The relation between prey (mussel) recruitment and growth to differences in community structure was evaluated by quantifying recruitment density in plastic mesh balls (collectors) and growth of individually marked transplanted mussels, respectively, at each site x exposure x tide level combination each month for 4 yr.","1994-08","2021-09-30 16:43:48","2021-09-30 16:43:48","2021-09-30 16:43:48","249-286","","3","64","","Ecological Monographs","The Keystone Species Concept","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/JHNBKK8V/Menge et al. - 1994 - The Keystone Species Concept Variation in Interac.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"I6TYT9YS","journalArticle","2021","Wellborn', Gary A","Trade-Off between Competitive Ability and Antipredator Adaptation in a Freshwater Amphipod Species Complex","","","","","","Body size influences many physiological and ecological processes, and thus adaptive change in body size may hold diverse consequences for individuals. For amphipods in the Hyalella azteca species complex, divergence in body size appears to be driven by adaptation to disparate regimes of size-biased mortality experienced in different habitat types. Here I ask how size and size-related traits influence competitive ability of largebodied and small-bodied species. I examined competitive ability in both species using a factorial experiment in which the performance of each species was assessed in all combinations of the presence and absence of the heterospecific amphipod species crossed with the presence and absence of a snail species. Results demonstrated that the large and small Hyalella species differ substantially in competitive ability, with the large species being the superior general competitor. The competitive effect of the large species on the small species was substantial and caused significant reductions in abundance, body size, and fecundity of the small species. In contrast, performance of the large species was not affected significantly by presence of the small species. This competitive asymmetry was also seen in competitive interactions with snails. The small species appears to ""trade off"" competitive ability in order to survive in habitats with predatory fish, whereas the large species, which is able to obtain a size refuge from predation, has traits that confer strong competitive ability.

The results indicated that these habitats are characterized by low soil moisture and low nutrient availability; densities of C. lanceolata were negatively correlated with densities of other species. The second study was a transplant garden experiment in which three levels of nutrients and two levels of competition were manipulated. One garden was adjacent to a natural population and the second was in a more productive area where C. lanceolata did not occur. Plants grew, survived and reproduced better in the area where C. lanceolata did not occur if competitors were removed. Nutrient effects were transient and only affected growth soon after application.

Treatments included tree removal, herb-shrub removal or NPK fertilization on 12 x 12 m plots established within a 20-ha clear-cut. A reciprocal increase in primary productivity following tree or herb-shrub removal suggests competition between these vegetation components. Black locust (Robinia pseudo-acacia) exhibited greater growth following herb-shrub removal. Aster and Solidago biomass increased significantly in the absence of trees. Herbaceous and tree productivity both increased following fertilization, indicating nutrient limitation during early succession. Tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and red maple (Acer rubrum) had significantly greater productivity in fertilized areas than in control areas; other tree species were unaffected. In contrast, the occurrence of blackberry (Rubus spp.) in the 2nd yr of succession was restricted to fertilized plots. The vigorous growth of Rubus in fertilized areas apparently limited Robinia production. Herbs such as fireweed (Erechtites hieracifolia) and pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) were important in woody removal plus fertilization treatments. These findings suggest that competition and nutrient limitation interact in controlling species composition, relative productivity and time of species occurrence during early succession in the Southern Appalachians.","1993-01","2021-09-30 16:43:55","2021-09-30 16:43:55","2021-09-30 16:43:55","1","","1","129","","American Midland Naturalist","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/NDNCH29M/Wilson and Shure - 1993 - Plant Competition and Nutrient Limitation during E.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective was to test theoretical predictions about the site-dependence of biotic mechanisms of plant population regulation. Biomass ranged from a mean of 64 to 776 g/m2 at the eight study sites, which included six old fields and two herbaceous plant communities near water. To measure effects of competition, 4-5 wk old plants of a perennial grass (Poa compressa) were transplanted into plots where neighboring plants were either left intact or removed and after 4 mo the shoot mass of transplants was compared in the two treatments. Transplants were caged in both treatments to exclude herbivores. Removing neighbors increased transplant shoot mass significantly at all sites, indicating that transplants experienced less competition for resources when their neighbors were removed. Regression analysis indicated that the increase in shoot mass due to neighbor removal was significantly greater at sites with higher biomass. This result supports theories that predict competition should increase with increasing biomass. To measure effects of herbivory, the growth of caged and uncaged plants was compared. Caging transplants did not increase their shoot mass significantly at the two sites with the lowest biomass. However, shoot mass was significantly greater for caged transplants than for uncaged transplants at all other sites. Caged transplants lost less tissue to herbivores such as small mammals and molluscs. Regression analysis indicated that the increase in shoot mass due to caging was significantly greater at sites with higher biomass. The combined effect of herbivory and competition was measured by comparing transplant growth in plots where transplants were caged and neighbors were removed with the growth of transplants in plots where transplants were not caged and neighbors were left intact. Transplant shoot mass was significantly greater where herbivores were excluded and neighbors were removed, especially at sites with high biomass. Our results indicate that competition and herbivory each have a greater effect on plant growth at sites with higher biomass and that herbivory has less effect than competition on plant growth at sites with relatively low biomass.","1995-10","2021-09-30 16:44:07","2021-09-30 16:44:07","2021-09-30 16:44:07","2176-2183","","7","76","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/E3ZKX3AB/Bonser and Reader - 1995 - Plant Competition and Herbivory in Relation to Veg.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I estimated the effects of intra- and interspecific competition, additional food, and virus infection on both the survival of P. scaber and the prevalence of the virus. In uninfected populations, intraspecific and interspecific competition negatively affected isopod survival, although food resources had no effect. In infected treatments, interspecific competition produced higher levels of virus prevalence than did intraspecific competition. Virus infection and reduced food interacted to produce higher overall mortality in interspecific competition treatments than in intraspecific competition treatments. The lack of significant effect of food on competition suggests that interference interactions rather than resource competition predominated. This mechanism is supported by a laboratory study in which total food availability was controlled. These results indicate that competition and parasitism interacted to produce the observed mortality patterns, and that ignoring mortality due to the virus would produce apparent interspecific competition.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of fungal parasitism and insect herbivory, alone and in concert, on plant competitive interactions. The effects of fungal endophyte (Acremonium spp.) infection and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) herbivory on competitive interactions in one- and two-species mixtures ofthe grasses tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), red fescue (F. rubra), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were examined in greenhouse experiments. In general, herbivory reduced plant biomass whereas endophyte infection increased plant biomass. Endophyteinfected (E+) plants were less damaged by herbivory than uninfected (E-) plants of the same species. Studies on fall armyworm larval feeding and choice tests with the five grass species were generally consistent with the outcome of the competition experiments; E+ plants were less nutritious and less preferred than E- plants of the same species. There were significant interactions among factors so that the outcome of competition depended on the species identities and the presence or absence of endophytes and herbivores. In competition with Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), E+ and E- perennial ryegrass produced similar biomass in the absence of herbivory, but E+ perennial ryegrass had nearly twice the biomass ofE- plants when herbivores were present. E+ and E- tall fescue were poor competitors with orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata) when herbivores were absent, but E+ tall fescue was a better competitor thanE- plants and orchard grass when herbivores were present. This study indicates that competitive hierarchies among grasses are altered by interactions with insect herbivores and fungal endophytes, which have typically been ignored in past studies.","1993-09","2021-09-30 16:44:30","2021-09-30 16:44:30","2021-09-30 16:44:30","1767-1777","","6","74","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/N6ZBFA2Y/Clay et al. - 1993 - Effects of Insect Herbivory and Fungal Endophyte I.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the field, lycaenids persisted only on those host plants that ants subsequently colonized. In the laboratory, lycaenid larvae reared with ants were 31-76% heavier, developed 37% faster, and commonly completed one or two fewer instars than larvae reared without ants. Ant tending also resulted in 20% heavier pupae, 69% shorter pupal duration, and 5% larger adults as measured by forewing length; adults were not significantly different as measured by body length. We hypothesize that these positive effects occurred largely because ant-tended lycaenid larvae spent more time feeding than did untended larvae. Field data documented that ants colonized host plants only after lycaenid larvae were present, indicating that ants actively maintained the association. In laboratory experiments, 40% more ant workers survived when lycaenid larvae were present than when they were absent, although ant mass was not significantly affected. We hypothesize that the survivorship effects occurred because ants consumed the lycaenid's nectary gland secretions, which contained considerable amounts of glucose and amino acids. Our results show that lycaenids can benefit from ants in ways other than, or in addition to, protection from natural enemies and that they incur minimal developmental costs from associating with ants.","1994-06","2021-09-30 16:44:32","2021-09-30 16:44:32","2021-09-30 16:44:32","1031-1041","","4","75","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/YE6SFU2T/Cushman et al. - 1994 - Assessing Benefits to Both Participants in a Lycae.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considerable annual variation in fish density occurred in the stream over the 10-yr period, particularly in pool habitats. Increased fish density was associated with increased stream discharge and creation of beaver ponds downstream from the study site. Weir traps used to monitor directional (upstream vs. downstream) fish movement during the last 4 yr of the study indicated annual changes in fish density were associated with the amount of fish dispersal occurring along the stream segment. Downstream fish movement, out of an upstream beaver pond occurred primarily during periods of elevated stream discharge. Upstream movement, out of a downstream beaver pond, occurred over a broader range of discharge conditions. A controlled, ""split-stream,"" experiment examining the effect of very low vs. elevated discharge on upstream fish movement indicated, however, that upstream movement of fish out of beaver ponds was also reduced by very low discharge conditions. Movement data for individual fish species revealed considerable variation among the taxa in the tendency for downstream vs. upstream movement, due to variation in the morphology of upstream vs. downstream beaver ponds and its subsequent effect on the composition of fish dispersing from these source areas. Most fish movement occurred over relatively brief time periods, suggesting life history and developmental processes were critical in influencing the timing of dispersal. Size structure of fishes captured in the stream indicated predominantly older age classes (>age I) of fish were dispersing along the stream. However, based on the occurrence of age 0 individuals only I of 12 species, the creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), routinely reproduced in the stream.","1995-04","2021-09-30 16:44:34","2021-09-30 16:44:34","2021-09-30 16:44:34","908-925","","3","76","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/2TBENAEZ/Schlosser - 1995 - Dispersal, Boundary Processes, and Trophic-Level I.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both scales preferentially colonize the young needles of the lower hemlock crown, which intensifies competition between them when food and space become limiting at high scale densities. Studies conducted for 2 yr in the greenhouse and in a hemlock forest located in Darien, Connecticut, demonstrated that summer generations of F. externa and T. tsugae compete intraspecifically and interspecifically at densities occurring in the field. F. externa had a greater adverse affect (reduced survival and fecundity) on itself and on T. tsugae than did T. tsugae have either on itself or on F. externa. The superior competitive ability of F. externa over T. tsugae was likely due to its earlier colonization time. Hatching in early June some 2-4 wk prior to its competitor, F. externa is afforded a distinct spatial and nutritional advantage (I) by colonizing young, nitrogen-rich needles at a time during the year when concentrations of foliar nitrogen and water are high, (2) by reducing the amount of foliar nitrogen available to T. tsugae nymphs, and (3) by forcing T. tsugae crawlers to colonize older, nitrogen-poor foliage where they subsequently suffer significantly greater mortality. Aspidiotiphagus citrinus Crawford (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), a primary internal parasitoid of F. externa and T. tsugae, exhibited a density dependent response to both scales in single-species infestation~ in the Darien forest. In mixed infestations, however, the parasitoid did not selectively attack the more abundant species but parasitized each scale in proportion to its frequency. Because it did not discriminate between hosts, A. citrinus did not alter the outcome of the competition between summer generations of the two scales.","1980-12","2021-09-30 16:44:35","2021-09-30 16:44:35","2021-09-30 16:44:35","1391-1401","","6","61","","","Competition Between Exotic Species","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/J4RET9DB/McClure - 1980 - Competition Between Exotic Species Scale Insects .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ants preyed on eggs and small larvae oflepidopteran herbivores. C. fasciculata plants from which ants were excluded had more larvae of the major seed pod predator Phoebis sennae (Pieridae; Lepidoptera), suffered higher pod predation (at one site), and had lower reproductive output (at two sites) than did control plants to which ants had access.

At the site with the lowest density of ants and herbivores, pod set was not significantly different between control and ant exclusion groups. Where they were more numerous, ants had a small but significant positive effect. Only where the abundance of both ants and potential herbivores was high did ants visiting extrafl.oral nectaries strongly increase the reproductive success of individuals of C. fasciculata.

Neither consumer significantly affected chlorophyll a accumulation. Darters alone had no significant effects on total invertebrate abundance. Crayfish alone caused, on average, a 58% reduction in total invertebrate abundance relative to exclosures, and most common invertebrate taxa were negatively affected. In the presence of darters, however, crayfish reduced invertebrate numbers by only 29% relative to exclosures.

CPOM was loaded and maintained at 0.01 ambient, ambient and 4x ambient levels for 19 mo. Fish were excluded from half the segments and maintained at natural densities in the others, in a fully cross-classified design. Neither CPOM loading nor fish predation had significant effects on leafpack breakdown and macrobenthic species richness or diversity in leafpack and sediment samples on all dates. The total abundance of invertebrates was reduced by fish in sediment samples but not in leafpacks. Almost all species were not significantly affected by the CPOM or fish treatments. Only two taxa responded to each treatment in sediments throughout the study, and none responded in leafpacks, i.e., less than 5% of the taxa tested. Interactions between fish and CPOM were rarely significant. This work shows that CPOM loading and fish predation, and their interactions, were not major forces in determining the diversity, richness, or litter breakdown rates of this lotic community. The absence of a fish effect on the animals in leafpacks suggests that leafpacks function as a refuge from fish predation for macrobenthic invertebrates. The effect of fish predation on total individuals but not on populations in sediments suggests that fish feeding has a significant impact on the benthos, but that natural variability in population sizes can obscure this effect.","1991-03","2021-09-30 16:44:47","2021-09-30 16:44:47","2021-09-30 16:44:47","42-56","","1","10","","Journal of the North American Benthological Society","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/ESI6M5AJ/Reice - 1991 - Effects of Detritus Loading and Fish Predation on .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A minimal model of resource competition predicts that the species that reduces the limiting resource R to the lowest level (R∗) will exclude its competitors. Whether this “R∗ rule” is robust to violations of model assumptions remains largely unknown. I conducted a competition experiment with four species of bacterivorous protists in laboratory microcosms and predicted the outcome from each species’ R∗ value. I also examined how the outcome of competition, species abundances, and the effect of protists on bacterial density varied with productivity. Microcosms were unstirred batch cultures containing a variety of bacteria, challenging the robustness of the simplest competition models. Protists with low R∗ values were less affected by competition, although competing protists often coexisted. The values of R∗ can predict competitive dominance, even in the absence of competitive exclusion. Other model predictions were less robust. Contrary to expectation, densities of grazed bacteria increased with productivity, and the effect of some protists on bacterial density did not vary with productivity. Bacterial heterogeneity may account for deviations from model predictions. Further experiments should examine the conditions under which simple rules can be expected to identify dominant species.","","2021-09-30 16:44:50","2021-09-30 16:44:50","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/659KWLIP/Fox - Testing a Simple Rule for Dominance in Resource Co.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the direct and diffuse effects of two salt marsh perennials, Monanthechloe littoralis and Arthrocnemum subterminale, on winter annuals and the perennial herb Limonium californicum in a salt marsh in central California. In permanent plots, Monanthechloe had expanded substantially in the upper marsh over the past 13 yr, while Arthrocnemum and all annual species had decreased. These dynamics suggest that Monanthechloe may directly outcompete most other species in the upper marsh. In contrast, Arthrocnemum is known to facilitate some annual species. In our ﬁeld experiments, Monanthechloe strongly suppressed Arthrocnemum, all four common annual species, and Limonium in direct interactions. In contrast, Arthrocnemum directly facilitated the winter annuals Parapholis incurva and Lasthenia glabrata, competed with Spergularia marina, and did not have a signiﬁcant effect on Limonium. However, when the combined effects of Monanthechloe and Arthrocnemum were tested, Arthrocnemum ameliorated the negative effect of Monanthechloe on all four species. Although isolated Arthrocnemum competed with Spergularia and had no direct effects on Limonium, Arthrocnemum in the presence of Monanthechloe facilitated both species. We hypothesize that Arthrocnemum buffered the strong competitive effects of Monanthechloe on Lasthenia and Parapholis via direct positive effects and beneﬁted Spergularia and Limonium through its competitive effect on Monanthechloe. These ﬁndings add to the growing body of literature emphasizing the importance of diversity and interdependence in the functioning of plant communities.","","2021-09-30 16:44:51","2021-09-30 16:44:51","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/UUXHKL7R/Callaway and Pennings - Facilitation May Buffer Competitive Effects Indir.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interactions between two freshwater protists, Colpidium striatum (the intraguild prey) and Blepharisma americanum (the intraguild predator), in laboratory microcosms support the predictions of intraguild predation theory. Colpidium competitively excluded Blepharisma when bacterial production was low, even though Blepharisma had a potential advantage conferred by its ability to consume Colpidium. In contrast to competitive exclusion at low productivity, Colpidium and Blepharisma coexisted for many generations at higher levels of bacterial production. Theory predicts a similar transition from competitive exclusion to coexistence as productivity increases, if intraguild predators use resources less efficiently than intraguild prey/competitors. Other experiments showed that Colpidium depresses bacterial densities more than Blepharisma, a result consistent with greater efficiency of resource utilization by Colpidium. These results indicate that simple mathematical models can provide important insights into the population dynamics of intraguild predators and prey under different levels of productivity.","2021","2021-09-30 16:44:53","2021-09-30 16:44:53","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/9PQADV8N/Morin' - 2021 - Productivity, Intraguild Predation, and Population.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"FLJLBFAE","journalArticle","","Wissinger, Scott A; Whiteman, Howard H; Sparks, Grace B; Rouse, Gretchen L; Brown, Wendy S","Foraging Trade-Offs along a Predator-Permanence Gradient in Subalpine Wetlands","","","","","","We conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to determine the direct and indirect effects of a top predator, the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum), on larvae of two species of limnephilid caddisflies (Limnephilus externus and Asynarchus nigriculus) in subalpine wetlands in central Colorado. Asynarchus larvae predominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and relatively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander-induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator-predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density-mediated and not trait-mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Limnephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a tradeoff between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus. This and previous work implicate salamanders as keystone predators that exert a major influence on the composition of benthic and planktonic assemblages in subalpine wetlands.","","2021-09-30 16:44:54","2021-09-30 16:44:54","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/PFFCD3KM/Wissinger et al. - Foraging Trade-Offs along a Predator-Permanence Gr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"GMD4MPBM","journalArticle","2021","Stachowicz, John J; Hay, Mark E","Mutualism and Coral Persistence: The Role of Herbivore Resistance to Algal Chemical Defense","","","","","","Because seaweeds uncontrolled by herbivores can overgrow and kill corals, competition can exclude corals from temperate latitudes where herbivores generally fail to control seaweed biomass. In this study, we show that the coral Oculina arbuscula persists on reefs in temperate North Carolina where seaweeds are common by harboring the omnivorous crab Mithrax forceps, which removes seaweeds and invertebrates growing on or near the coral. In the field, corals from which crabs are experimentally removed develop a dense cover of epibionts, exhibiting reduced growth and increased mortality relative to corals with crabs, which remain epibiont-free. This crab is unusual in that it readily consumes all local seaweeds in laboratory choice assays and is not deterred by chemical defenses that suppress feeding by local fishes, sea urchins, and other crabs. This allows Mithrax to defend corals from overgrowth by chemically noxious seaweeds like Dictyota and Sargassum that are avoided by most local herbivores. However, further field manipulations under reduced light conditions demonstrate that the outcome of the crab-coral interaction is context-dependent: crabs only benefit corals in well-lit areas where seaweeds are abundant. Field observations and tethering experiments show that, by living in association with Oculina, Mithrax gains a refuge from predation. Additionally, crabs grow faster when associated with live corals than with structurally equivalent dead corals, apparently because they are able to consume lipid-rich coral mucus. This mucus provides a dietary supplement that may help corals attract and retain low-mobility symbionts such as Mithrax, securing for the coral long-term and predictable protection against competitors.","2021","2021-09-30 16:44:55","2021-09-30 16:44:55","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/E2WAZMH3/Stachowicz and Hay - 2021 - Mutualism and Coral Persistence The Role of Herbi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a combination of netting and perches to manipulate predation by Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) and Belted Kingfishers (Ceryle alcyon), and measured the response in the fish assemblage.

Research was done on a sand dune matorral located on the coast of Veracruz, México. The results show that (i) plants associated with the larger ant species (Camponotus abdominalis) produced more fruits than plants associated with the smaller ant species, and (ii) plants associated with ants were subject to lower levels of herbivory, than plants without ants. Consequently, ant presence is not synonymous of plant protection, and the level of protection by ants will depend on the size of the worker ants in a guild of ant visitors. Moreover, when ants were excluded, wasps and bees increased their visits, exerting a higher level of protection than that offered by the smaller ant species. However, the differential effect of wasps needs further attention.","","2021-09-30 16:44:57","2021-09-30 16:44:58","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/PNAZWAEJ/Torres-Hernández et al. - Effect of nectar-foraging ants and wasps on the re.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When Ardisia seedlings were grown singly in pots without competition, soil phosphorus concentration and light had no effect on seedling growth. Relative growth rates (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR), however, were higher for seedlings inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi isolated from Ardisia roots than those inoculated with single-spore isolates and nonmycorrhizal controls. In the second experiment, an Ardisia seedling was grown in each pot in competition with another conspeciﬁc seedling or with a seedling of Prunus caroliniana, a native subcanopy tree. The identity of the competitor had little effect on seedling RGR of Ardisia, but LAR was signiﬁcantly higher for seedlings in conspeciﬁc competition. Overall, Prunus seedlings had higher RGR than Ardisia, but RGR and survival of Prunus seedlings were signiﬁcantly reduced in competition with Ardisia when mycorrhizal fungi were suppressed by benomyl.

The effect of the ants on the membracids varied considerably among years. When the effect of the ants on the membracids was estimated in ﬁve sites spread over 5 km there was mixed evidence for spatial conditionality in the mutualism. Using repeated surveys of nymph number we found that the effect of the ants on nymph number varied among sites through time. When total new adult production was examined, however, no such interaction between ants and location was evident. Aggregations displayed strong negative density-dependent adult production. Thus, while in some sites ants had a greater positive effect on nymph survivorship, aggregations at those sites produced proportionately fewer adults because of negative density dependence. Density dependence reduced or eliminated spatial differences in the effect of the ants on the membracids. Differences among sites did not explain spatial variation in the effect of ants on nymphs or new adult production.

In this paper, we examined experimentally the effects of geographic variation, population density, and abiotic stress on the outcome of interspeciﬁc competition between two species of larval anurans. Three different populations of natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) were set to compete with common toad (Bufo bufo) in replicated artiﬁcial ponds under different combinations of osmotic stress (freshwater or brackish water) and intraspeciﬁc density (high and low). Among the B. calamita populations used, only one of them is sympatric to B. bufo and inhabits a freshwater environment. The two other populations, allopatric to B. bufo, occupy freshwater and brackish water environments, respectively. Survival, length of the larval period, and size at metamorphosis were analyzed at both the speciﬁc and the populational interaction levels. Intra- and interspeciﬁc competition did occur and generally resulted in a decrease in survival rates, an increase in the duration of the larval period, and a decrease in size at metamorphosis. Water salinity also prolonged the larval period and interacted with intra- and interspeciﬁc density, intensifying its effects. Interspeciﬁc competition was asymmetric, since B. bufo was competitively superior to B. calamita, causing larger effects on B. calamita than those experienced by B. bufo. However, the three populations of B. calamita showed different competitive effects and responses when they were set to compete with B. bufo. The population sympatric to B. bufo had the stronger competitive effect and response, causing a strong impact on survival, growth, and developmental rate of B. bufo. The allopatric population inhabiting the brackish environment also had a marked effect on B. bufo survival, although only at high density. The other allopatric population only had a signiﬁcant effect on the size at metamorphosis of B. bufo. The impact of B. bufo on B. calamita was greater for the allopatric populations than for the sympatric one. This pattern suggests that the nature and outcome of ecological interactions are a function of environmental conditions and population history.","2002-08","2021-09-30 16:45:22","2021-09-30 16:45:23","2021-09-30 16:45:22","2102-2111","","8","83","","Ecology","GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN ASYMMETRIC COMPETITION","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/GQXEMF57/Gómez-Mestre and Tejedo - 2002 - GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN ASYMMETRIC COMPETITION A .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined how resource competition interacts with physical stress to structure salt-marsh plant communities across a natural gradient in tidal stress. First, nutrient additions at naturally occurring species borders at zonal and patch boundaries in two Rhode Island (USA) marshes revealed that competitive outcomes were typically reversed when nutrients were abundant. These results, which are consistent with earlier ﬁndings in a third southern New England marsh, suggest that a nutrientdependent competitive hierarchy is a general characteristic of salt marshes in this region. To test whether these shifts in competitive outcomes occur only at naturally occurring species borders or can lead to more signiﬁcant shifts in zonation patterns, lower marsh species were transplanted into the matrix of each zonal species at higher tidal elevations, and the outcomes of plant competition in fertilized plots and unfertilized plots were compared. Results of this experiment indicate that nutrient effects on the competitive relations of marsh plants were independent of where the interactions took place along the tidal gradient. The stress-tolerant species were consistently the best competitors in fertilized treatments, showing that an increase in nutrient availability can lead to drastic shifts in the distributions of plants across marshes. Finally, a third experiment examined the interaction between nutrient supply and the aboveground and belowground components of plant competition using a reciprocal transplant design coupled with nutrient-addition and neighbor-removal treatments. Results suggest that competition is primarily belowground under ambient marsh conditions but is aboveground at high nutrient levels. Thus the mechanism underlying the nutrient-dependent competitive hierarchy may be driven by a trade-off between belowground and aboveground competitive abilities, although the potential interaction between above- and belowground effects was not examined. Together, the results of these experiments suggest that nutrient supplies may signiﬁcantly affect the competitive dynamics between salt-marsh perennials and their resultant zonation across an environmental gradient in tidal stress. The result that stress tolerators can be dominant competitors is not predicted by any current model of plant competition and must be considered in future empirical and theoretical studies.","2001-09","2021-09-30 16:45:28","2021-09-30 16:45:28","2021-09-30 16:45:28","2471-2485","","9","82","","Ecology","COMPETITION AND SALT-MARSH PLANT ZONATION","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/6LFSIRKG/Emery et al. - 2001 - COMPETITION AND SALT-MARSH PLANT ZONATION STRESS .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seedlings of white spruce (Picea glauca) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) became established more frequently than expected in patches that were dominated by horsetail (Equisetum arvense), and less frequently than expected in patches of bluestem (Calamagrostis canadensis) and other vegetation. Similarly, birch and spruce, whether sown directly or transplanted as seedlings into horsetail-dominated patches generally showed greater survivorship, growth, and nitrogen accumulation (for birch only) than did those transplanted into bluestem or quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) patches. Clipping experiments demonstrated that the presence of aboveground vegetation reduced survivorship (for birch only), growth (for both species), and nitrogen accumulation (for spruce only) in all patch types. Thus, the understory vegetation in all patch types competed with tree seedlings. However, patch ϫ clipping interactions were either absent or could not explain the greater inhibition of seedling establishment by bluestem or aspen than by horsetail. The strong inhibitory effect of bluestem and aspen on the establishment of spruce and birch seedlings is best explained by the unfavorable temperature and moisture microenvironments in these patches, rather than by differential competition in patches of bluestem, horsetail, or aspen. Many asymmetrical species interactions that are thought to drive successional change may result more from the contrasting effects that species have on their environment than from resource competition among species.","2000-04","2021-09-30 16:45:33","2021-09-30 16:45:33","2021-09-30 16:45:33","1086-1099","","4","81","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/M5K8TLXJ/Cater and Chapin - 2000 - DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF COMPETITION OR MICROENVIRO.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied the effects of a pathogenic water mold, Saprolegnia ferax, on competitive interactions between the Cascades frog Rana cascadae and the Paciﬁc treefrog Hyla regilla. Previous studies have shown that outbreaks of Saprolegnia infection in the Cascade mountains of Oregon, USA, result in high embryonic mortality for Rana but not for Hyla. Thus, we examined how infections of Saprolegnia during amphibian embryonic development could inﬂuence larval recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Rana and Hyla. We manipulated the presence of Saprolegnia and embryonic Hyla and Rana in replicated artiﬁcial ponds and determined mean survivorship to hatching per pool from daily observations during embryonic development. Pools were then followed throughout larval development, and we recorded mean mass of tadpoles at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis per pool. The presence of Saprolegnia differentially affected larval recruitment of the two species; larval recruitment of Rana was reduced by 46.2% in the presence of Saprolegnia, whereas Hyla survival was not affected. However, larval Rana that survived Saprolegnia infection developed faster and were larger at metamorphosis compared to individuals not exposed to Saprolegnia. In the absence of Saprolegnia, Rana had strong negative effects on the growth, development, and survival of Hyla. However, in the presence of Saprolegnia, the outcome of competitive interactions between the two species was reversed. Saprolegnia may have positive indirect effects on both Hyla and Rana by regulating both intra- and interspeciﬁc competition. These results suggest that pathogens can have strong effects on species interactions and may ultimately inﬂuence community structure.","1999-10","2021-09-30 16:45:34","2021-09-30 16:45:35","2021-09-30 16:45:34","2442-2448","","7","80","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/AHRFXH2I/Kiesecker and Blaustein - 1999 - PATHOGEN REVERSES COMPETITION BETWEEN LARVAL AMPHI.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess the consequences of the symbiosis at the plant community level, we conducted a 5-yr ﬁeld experiment in tallgrass prairie to investigate the inﬂuence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on plant species composition, relative abundances, and diversity. Replicate plots in which mycorrhizal fungi were suppressed with benomyl application every two weeks during each growing season, were compared to nontreated mycorrhizal control plots on six watershed units at the Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas. Benomyl successfully reduced mycorrhizal colonization to Ͻ25% of mycorrhizal control plots. Mycorrhizal colonization of roots in control plots was inversely related to annual precipitation. Suppression of mycorrhizae resulted in decreases in abundances of the dominant, obligately mycotrophic C4 tall grasses, compensatory increases in abundances of many subordinate facultatively mycotrophic C3 grasses and forbs, but no change in total aboveground biomass, as estimated from canopy density. Suppression of mycorrhizal symbiosis resulted in a large increase in plant species diversity. Two possible mechanisms for mycorrhizal mediation of plant species composition and diversity are: (1) alterations in resource distribution among neighbors via hyphal connections, and (2) differential host species responses to mycorrhizal fungal colonization in communities in which the competitive dominants are more strongly or more weakly mycotrophic than their neighbors. The results of this study demonstrate that mycorrhizal symbiosis can have large effects on plant community structure, and that differential host species response to fungal colonization is a key factor explaining the dominance of warmseason C4 grasses in tallgrass prairie and limiting plant species evenness and diversity. The results also underscore the importance of above- and belowground linkages in tallgrass prairie and indicate that alterations in belowground fungi and rhizosphere processes can have large effects on aboveground ﬂoristic composition and diversity in grasslands.","1999-06","2021-09-30 16:45:36","2021-09-30 16:45:36","2021-09-30 16:45:36","1187-1195","","4","80","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/YQPSFIPW/Hartnett and Wilson - 1999 - MYCORRHIZAE INFLUENCE PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AN.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We took an experimental approach to investigate whether absence of A. carolinensis and A. sagrei from these islands results from the inability of populations to become established and whether the presence of the other species has a negative effect on population density and probability of successful colonization. We introduced propagules of ﬁve lizards of each species, either in allopatry or sympatry, on ﬁve blocks of three islands each. Populations were censused yearly using mark–recapture methods. Anolis sagrei populations thrived on almost all islands, whereas within three years, many A. carolinensis populations had gone extinct, and most others were very small. We conclude that an inability to successfully establish populations on small islands might explain the absence of A. carolinensis from these islands, but not the absence of A. sagrei. Anolis carolinensis was not more likely to become extinct on islands containing A. sagrei, but population densities of A. carolinensis were lower on islands with both species (‘‘sympatric islands’’) compared to ‘‘allopatric islands.’’ In addition, A. carolinensis tended to perch higher, relative to available vegetation, on sympatric islands than they did on allopatric islands. Conversely, the presence of A. carolinensis had little impact on A. sagrei populations. However, inspection of population changes through time suggest that A. carolinensis may have initially had an effect on A. sagrei, but this effect decreased as A. carolinensis populations declined. The observed absence of A. sagrei from these islands may indicate that its dispersal abilities are limited relative to the frequency of devastating hurricanes.","1999-01","2021-09-30 16:45:38","2021-09-30 16:45:38","2021-09-30 16:45:38","252-258","","1","80","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/KTKFKXC5/Losos and Spiller - 1999 - DIFFERENTIAL COLONIZATION SUCCESS AND ASYMMETRICAL.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This might increase their risk of predation by birds. We conducted a pond-scale ﬁeld experiment to test the hypothesis that predation by birds and ﬂounder will have nonadditive effects on spot survival and size. We expected spot to have lower survival in the presence of both predators than expected based on their additive effects (i.e., facilitation among predators). The experiment was a 2 ϫ 2 factorial with and without ﬂounders and bird access. Flounder signiﬁcantly reduced spot survival while birds did not, but there was a signiﬁcant interaction effect. Spot survived better with both predators than expected based on adding separate predator effects. Mean spot growth rate was unaffected by treatment. Spot moved to shallow water in the presence of ﬂounder and aggregated more tightly in the presence of birds. The observed nonadditive effects could have been due to interference between ﬂounder and birds. However, because all the ﬂounder in our experiments survived and their growth was unaffected by birds, we favor the idea that behavioral changes (increased aggregation) by spot to avoid bird predation also further reduced their vulnerability to ﬂounder. Our results suggest that modeling the effects of multiple predators will be more complicated than simply adding up the effects observed in experiments with single predators.","1997-09","2021-09-30 16:45:41","2021-09-30 16:45:41","2021-09-30 16:45:41","1796-1804","","6","78","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/JS8KJ79W/Crowder et al. - 1997 - NONADDITIVE EFFECTS OF TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC PRE.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used manipulative ﬁeld experiments to determine the relative roles of abiotic conditions and biotic interactions in structuring deep-sea (2500 m depth) communities along environmental gradients around hydrothermal vents of the eastern tropical Paciﬁc Ocean (East Paciﬁc Rise, at 9Њ50Ј N). We tested (1) whether predation by crabs and ﬁshes affects the recruitment of benthic species and subsequent community structure and (2) whether the effects of predation vary along the steep gradients of temperature, oxygen, sulﬁde, and metal concentrations near vents. Recruitment substrates (basalt cubic blocks, roughly 10 cm on a side), both uncaged and caged to exclude predators (crabs, ﬁshes, whelks, and octopi), were deployed along a decreasing vent ﬂuid-ﬂux gradient. The exclusion of predators for 8 mo increased the abundance of small mobile gastropods and amphipod crustaceans but decreased the abundance of sessile invertebrates, including juvenile vestimentiferan worms, tubiculous polychaetes, and mussels. Effects of predation were strongest nearest to hydrothermal vents, where abiotic environmental conditions were most extreme but productivity and the overall abundances of benthic invertebrates and mobile predators were the greatest. Additional 5-mo experiments conducted at three different locations showed similar trends at all sites, indicating that these effects of predation on benthic community structure are repeatable. Stomach-content analyses of the most abundant predators found at vents indicated that the zoarcid ﬁsh (Thermarces cerberus) primarily feeds on the vent snail Cyathermia naticoides, the limpet Lepetodrilus elevatus, and the amphipod crustacean Ventiella sulfuris, the very species that showed the greatest increase following predator exclusion. In contrast, brachyuran (Bythograea thermydron) and galatheid (Munidopsis subsquamosa) crab stomachs did not contain small mobile grazers, and crabs presented with arrays of the most common vent invertebrate species preferred mussels and vestimentiferans over limpets. Our results indicate that predation by large mobile predators inﬂuences the structure of hydrothermal vent communities, directly by reducing the abundance of gastropod prey species, and indirectly by reducing gastropod grazing and by bulldozing of recruits of sessile invertebrates.","2002-08","2021-09-30 16:45:42","2021-09-30 16:45:42","2021-09-30 16:45:42","365-382","","3","72","","Ecological Monographs","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/JHV4TTAL/Micheli et al. - 2002 - PREDATION STRUCTURES COMMUNITIES AT DEEP-SEA HYDRO.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only few studies have simultaneously examined these two processes. We investigated whether the root hemiparasite Odontites litoralis ssp. litoralis affects the outcome of competition between two clonal graminoids, the endangered Puccinellia phryganodes and the common species Agrostis stolonifera, and whether simulated grazing affects the interaction among these three species. This study system simulates the community of early successional stages of the Bothnian Bay salt marsh meadows, which are intensively grazed by greylag geese (Anser anser). We conducted a factorial greenhouse experiment to study the effects of interspeciﬁc competition (one or two host species present), hemiparasitic infection (hemiparasite present or not), and simulated grazing (host clipped or not) on Puccinellia and Agrostis. Puccinellia was clearly an inferior competitor to Agrostis, whereas the two species did not differ as hosts for the hemiparasite. Infection by the hemiparasite reduced the aboveground biomass of Puccinellia and Agrostis by 59% and 45%, respectively. Competition with Agrostis decreased the biomass of parasitised Puccinellia by 36% and that of non-parasitised Puccinellia by 56%. Parasitism thus seemed to beneﬁt Puccinellia indirectly by decreasing the relative competitive advantage of Agrostis. Moreover, parasitism increased the relative contribution of Puccinellia to the total aboveground host plant biomass. Simulated grazing decreased the aboveground biomass of Agrostis signiﬁcantly more than that of Puccinellia and thus increased the competitive ability of Puccinellia. Simulated grazing of the two host species did not affect the performance of Odontites. These results suggest that both hemiparasitic plants and herbivory may play a signiﬁcant role in the maintenance of plant species diversity by promoting competitively inferior species.","2008-03","2021-09-30 16:45:45","2021-09-30 16:45:45","2021-09-30 16:45:45","117-125","","2","9","","Basic and Applied Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/MVAYBZ7Z/Niemelä et al. - 2008 - Modification of competition between two grass spec.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared consumer–resource (C–R) and consumer–consumer (C–C) per biomass interaction strengths in both streams using ﬁeld enclosure experiments. Consumer effects on algal resources were strong and equivalent for both snail species in both streams. Invasion success of P. antipodarum could not be attributed to an unusually high rate of resource acquisition at either site because the 2 snails exerted equivalent C–R interaction strengths. However, C–C interactions were asymmetric; the invasive snail signiﬁcantly limited growth of the native snail, whereas the native snail facilitated growth of the invasive snail. These effects were stronger in the stream where P. antipodarum was dominant. Thus, per biomass interaction strengths indicated that asymmetric interactions could be contributing to patterns of dominance by invasive and endemic stream snails.","2008-09","2021-09-30 16:45:48","2021-09-30 16:45:48","2021-09-30 16:45:48","509-520","","3","27","","Journal of the North American Benthological Society","Invasive species impact","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/IDDNTZHX/Riley et al. - 2008 - Invasive species impact asymmetric interactions b.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that competition between plants may also negatively affect the performance of herbivores as well as their top-down effect on the host plant. In such a case, the combined effects of competition and herbivory may be less than expected from a simple multiplicative response. In other words, competition and herbivory may interact antagonistically. In a greenhouse experiment, Poa annua was grown in the presence or absence of a competitor (either Plantago lanceolata or Trifolium repens), as well as with or without a Poaspecialist aphid herbivore. Both competition and herbivory negatively affected Poa growth. Competition also reduced aphid density on Poa. This effect could in part be explained by changes in the biomass and the nitrogen content of Poa shoots. In treatments with competitors, reduced aphid densities alleviated the negative effect of herbivory on above- and belowground Poa biomass. Hence, we were able to demonstrate an antagonistic interaction between plant–plant interspeciﬁc competition and herbivory. However, response indices suggested that antagonistic interactions between competition and herbivory were contingent on the identity of the competitor. We found the antagonistic effect only in treatments with T. repens as the competitor. We conclude that both competitor identity and the herbivore’s ability to respond with changes in its density or activity to plant competition affect the magnitude and direction (synergistic vs. antagonistic) of the interaction between competition and herbivory on plant growth.","2007-06","2021-09-30 16:45:50","2021-09-30 16:45:50","2021-09-30 16:45:50","1490-1498","","6","88","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/FKE7HGYD/Schädler et al. - 2007 - ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PLANT COMPETITIO.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effects of avian predation on highly mobile predators such as crabs, remains practically unstudied in rocky shore ecosystems. The crab, Cancer borealis, is an important component of the diet of gulls (Larus marinus, L. argentatus) at the Isles of Shoals, Maine, USA. C. borealis prey include the predatory gastropod Nucella lapillus L., the herbivore Littorina littorea, and mussels Mytilus edulis L. We hypothesized that gulls reduce abundance of C. borealis in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal, thereby allowing C. borealis prey to persist in high numbers. A study of crab tidal migration showed that C. borealis density nearly doubled at high tide compared to low tide; thus, crabs from a large subtidal source population migrate into the intertidal zone during high tides and either emigrate or are removed by gulls during low tides. Results from a small-scale (1 m2) predator caging experiment in the low intertidal zone indicated that enclosed crabs signiﬁcantly reduced L. littorea abundance when protected from gull predation. In a much larger-scale gull exclusion experiment, densities of C. borealis increased signiﬁcantly during low and high tides in exclosures relative to the controls. C. borealis density was inversely correlated with changes in the abundance of two mesopredators Carcinus maenas and Nucella lapillus, and with the space-occupier M. edulis. There was a similar negative correlation between abundance of C. borealis and the change in abundance of the herbivore L. littorea, but the trend was not signiﬁcant. Mortality of tethered L. littorea was associated with C. borealis density across sites. However, preferred algae did not change in response to L. littorea density during the experiment. Thus, we found suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence for a three-level cascade involving gulls, crabs, and L. littorea. Our studies strongly suggest that gulls, as apex predators, generate three-level trophic cascades in rocky intertidal food webs by preventing the highly mobile subtidal predator, C. borealis, from establishing substantial populations in the low-mid intertidal zone thereby indirectly enhancing densities of two key mesopredators (N. lapillus, Carcinus) and blue mussels (M. edulis).","2007-04","2021-09-30 16:45:52","2021-09-30 16:45:52","2021-09-30 16:45:52","853-863","","4","88","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/SFVPYRI9/Ellis et al. - 2007 - REGULATION OF INTERTIDAL FOOD WEBS BY AVIAN PREDAT.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously, we investigated how hummock formation by Triglochin maritimum in physically stressful salt marsh pannes inﬂuences the plant community that grows only on hummock tops and found that species diversity was dependent on indirect positive effects of T. maritimum engineering. Here we examined how Carex stricta, the tussock sedge, drives superﬁcially similar spatial patterning of plants in relatively benign tidal freshwater marshes at the opposite extreme of an estuarine salinity gradient. In C. stricta marshes, the entire vegetative community is located almost exclusively on top of tussocks while inter-tussock spaces are bare mud buried in C. stricta wrack. We manipulated tussock height, belowground substrate, and aboveground competition for light to investigate the mechanisms by which C. stricta inﬂuences the wetland plant community. We also conducted wrack-removal experiments and phytometer assays to examine the importance of wrack deposition in this community and to investigate the spatial distribution of herbivore pressure, respectively. Transplants of four common species performed well in all treatments, except natural intertussock spaces buried in wrack. Removal of wrack from inter-tussock spaces enabled substantial seedling emergence and vegetative cover within one growing season. C. stricta therefore drives plant distribution primarily through indirect negative impacts of wrack accumulation in inter-tussock spaces. Once tussocks are established, plants obtain a secondary beneﬁt when growing on tussocks, as the inter-tussock spaces become runways for small mammalian herbivores that concentrate feeding in low protected areas. These results differ dramatically from nearby salt marshes where T. maritimum facilitates community diversity by alleviating physical stresses. The mechanisms and outcomes of hummockforming engineers may thus vary predictably across estuarine salinity gradients where hummock formation has facilitative and important impacts in physically stressful environments, but negative and less essential impacts in physically benign environments.","2005-10","2021-09-30 16:45:55","2021-09-30 16:45:55","2021-09-30 16:45:55","2695-2704","","10","86","","Ecology","COMMUNITY IMPACTS OF A TUSSOCK SEDGE","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/MMQTZFES/Crain and Bertness - 2005 - COMMUNITY IMPACTS OF A TUSSOCK SEDGE IS ECOSYSTEM.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exclosure treatments excluded study trees from ungulates, from terrestrial rodents and ungulates or from neither (control). Loss of cones from branches varied by a habitat-time interaction, but was not affected by exclosure type. Loss of cones from containers located under experimental trees varied by a habitat-treatmenttime interaction. In December and January, cone consumption from containers in noexclosure treatments was highest in margins, followed by tallgrass prairie and eastern red cedar habitats. We conclude birds consumed the majority of cones from branches and smalland medium-sized mammals consumed cones on the ground. Both birds and mammals likely contribute to the spread of eastern red cedar but at different scales.

In this paper we investigated how spatial scale might inﬂuence the importance of predation. In doing this we addressed the hypothesis of scale-dependency in predation experiments. The predator studied was the shore crab, Carcinus maenas (L.), and its impact on intertidal macrofauna communities was assessed using a caging experiment. Two different treatments, small and large enclosure cages (of, respectively, 0.25 and 1 m2), were established in a completely randomised design on two different sites, mud and muddy sand, which differed physically but were very similar biologically. The density of crabs per square metre was 48, much larger than the ambient density but comparable with previously published work. The experiment ran for a month and the resulting data and summary statistics were analysed using univariate and multivariate methods.

Habitat segregation seems to be the major factor contributing to the coexistence of these two species: I. baltica is the dominant species among surface drift weed, whereas I. emarginata occurs mainly on the sea bed among accumulations of broken decaying algae. In laboratory cultures with food in excess, there is intense intra- and interspeciﬁc competition through direct interference. Singlespecies cultures of both species thrive and rapidly attain an equilibrium population size which is about four times greater in I. emarginata than in I. baltica. In mixed-species cultures, I. baltica lacks a ‘realized niche’; independent of starting densities, I. baltica is competitively excluded by I. emarginata within a short period of time. The crucial behavioural mechanism of interference is cannibalism (intraspeciﬁc competition) and mutual predation (interspeciﬁc competition). Both intra- and interspeciﬁc interference occur mainly through density-dependent control of juvenile mortality by cannibalistic / predatory adults. Experiments on the relative strengths of intra- and interspeciﬁc interference revealed strong asymmetries in competitive relationships: Intraspeciﬁc inhibitory effects in I. baltica are much greater than in I. emarginata; I. emarginata exerts much more inhibition on I. baltica than on itself, whereas I. baltica exerts much more inhibition on itself than on its congener I. emarginata. These asymmetries account for a complete competitive dominance of I. emarginata over I. baltica, and (according to the Lotka–Volterra model of interspeciﬁc competition) inevitably result in competitive exclusion of I. baltica by I. emarginata. All types of asymmetry are due to the fact that juveniles of I. emarginata are much better protected from being cannibalized and preyed upon by conspeciﬁcs and heterospeciﬁcs, respectively, than juveniles of I. baltica. This protection is probably based on an active chemical defense mechanism that becomes ineffective immediately after death. The possibility is discussed that current interference competition is an important factor in maintaining habitat segregation in I.","1998-09","2021-09-30 16:46:01","2021-09-30 16:46:01","2021-09-30 16:46:01","1-21","","1","227","","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","Mechanisms and consequences of intra- and interspecific interference competition in Idotea baltica (Pallas) and Idotea emarginata (Fabricius) (Crustacea","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/DZ7WIWVJ/Franke and Janke - 1998 - Mechanisms and consequences of intra- and interspe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dominant species were the barnacle Balanus eburneus (Gould), which recruited in all three seasons, but at highest densities in the spring; the oyster Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin), which recruited only in fall, and the bryozoan Membranipora savartii, which recruited in spring and fall. Thus, the species that recruited varied with the season, as in earlier studies of colonization of free space in intertidal fouling assemblages. However, unlike previous studies, barnacle abundances or oyster and bryozoan percentage cover tended to decrease with length of immersion. To determine if these post-settlement decreases were caused by predation, we enclosed tiles in mesh cages to exclude predators, and replicated experiments at both coastal and estuarine sites to determine site-speciﬁc differences in recruitment. Barnacles recruited at higher rates at coastal sites and oysters at estuarine sites, as predicted by the literature. For barnacles, densities after one month of colonization were lower on open or partially caged tiles than on caged tiles, supporting the hypothesis that predators, like blue and mud crabs, or southern oyster drills, may regulate barnacle abundance. Caging did not increase the percentage cover of either oysters or bryozoans. Oyster abundance may be limited by larval supply, as oyster recruitment never reached above 5% cover. Small predators, like ﬂatworms, which were not excluded by cages, may also be important for the latter two prey. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","1998-07","2021-09-30 16:46:02","2021-09-30 16:46:03","2021-09-30 16:46:02","107-121","","1","225","","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/RGBHZKGC/Brown and Swearingen - 1998 - Effects of seasonality, length of immersion, local.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Throughout a growing season, we enriched an experimental creek on each flooding tide to 70 μM NO3− and 4 μM PO4−3 (a 10× increase in loading above background), and we reduced Fundulus heteroclitus density by 60% in a branch of the fertilized and a reference creek. Macroinfauna and meiofauna were sampled in creek (mudflat and creek wall), marsh edge (tall-form Spartina alterniflora) and marsh platform (Spartina patens and stunted S. alterniflora) habitats before and after treatments were begun; responses were tested with BACIdesign statistics. Treatment effects were most common in the mid-range of the inundation gradient. Most fertilization effects were on creek wall where ostracod abundance increased, indices of copepod reproduction increased and copepod and annelid communities were altered. These taxa may use epiphytes (that respond rapidly to fertilization) of filamentous algae as a food source. Killifish reduction effects on meiobenthic copepod abundance were detected at the marsh edge and suggest predator limitation. Fish reduction effects on annelids did not suggest top-down regulation in any habitat; however, fish reduction may have stimulated an increased predation rate on annelids by grass shrimp. Interactions between fertilization and fish reduction occurred under S. patens canopy where indirect predator reduction effects on annelids were indicated. No effects were observed in mudflat or stunted S. alterniflora habitats. Although the responses of infauna to fertilization and predator removal were largely independent and of similar mild intensity, our data suggests that the effects of ecological stressors vary across the marsh landscape.","2008-03","2021-09-30 16:46:04","2021-09-30 16:46:05","2021-09-30 16:46:04","20-34","","1","357","","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/8PLV6FAJ/Fleeger et al. - 2008 - Top-down and bottom-up control of infauna varies a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this experiment, the separate impact of each predator group increased with increasing prey productivity. However, the relative impact of each predator group did not diverge with increasing prey productivity. Unlike previous studies that suggested with increasing prey productivity the relative effect of two predator groups should diverge, this experiment suggested that communities can have more redundant predator groups than originally thought. The results of an analysis using a proportional hazards model suggested that despite increasing prey productivity, birds and the sea star were equal in their ability to curb population increases by M. californianus.

We report the effects of herbivory and competition on the growth of the branching scleractinian coral Porites cylindrica Dana and the creeping foliose brown alga Lobophora variegata (Lamouroux) Womersley, on an inshore fringing reef of the central Great Barrier Reef. L. variegata overgrows branches of P. cylindrica from the base up, forming a distinct boundary between the alga and the coral tissue. The experiment used exclusion cages to test for effects of herbivores, and removal of algae and coral tissue, at their interaction boundary, to test for inhibition of the competitors by each other. Comparisons of coral branches with the algae present or removed showed that the presence and overgrowth of the alga caused significant coral tissue mortality. Comparisons of branches with coral tissue unmanipulated or damaged showed that the coral inhibited the overgrowth by L. variegata, but that the algae were markedly superior competitors. Importantly, reduced herbivory resulted in faster algal growth and consequent overgrowth and mortality of coral tissue, demonstrating the critical importance of herbivory to the outcome of the competitive interaction.

This hypothesis was tested using experimental exclusion cages and partial cages at two sites at two distances at two different rocky reefs. Undisturbed uncaged assemblages of macrofauna close to the rocky reefs were generally different from those in the partial cages and full cages. However, caging artifacts could not be detected and there were no strong correlations between the macrofauna and the proportions of different grain size and organic content. The structure of the macrofaunal assemblages close to the rocky reefs was, nevertheless, different from those far from the reefs and the sediments were ﬁner far from than close to the rocky reefs. The results indicated that factors other than predation or grain size caused the differences in the macrofauna. For the spatial and temporal scales used in this study, it was clear that, although predation maybe intense, on its own it cannot explain the differences in the structure of the assemblages close and far from rocky reefs.

Seeds were planted, the seedlings were then transplanted and individual performance was evaluated with respect to: (1) competition with plant neighbours and (2) resource addition. Senecio inaequidens had higher rates of seedling establishment and a shorter pre-reproductive period. Competition with neighbours had a considerable impact on S. malacitanus, delaying ﬂowering time and reducing growth and reproduction. S. pterophorus showed inefﬁcient seedling establishment compared to the other two species, but performed better in terms of growth and reproduction. The two alien species were markedly more competitive than the native one. However, differences in competitiveness among S. malacitanus and the two aliens varied depending on resource availability. Thus, Senecio inaequidens and S. pterophorus were more affected by competition in subplots with resource addition and by competition in those without addition, respectively. The latter showed a greater capacity to respond to additional resources in competitive environments and, in addition, its reproductive effort was unrelated to habitat conditions. The invasive potential of the alien species was higher than that of the native. This was a result of various biological characteristics and speciﬁc interactions between invader and environment, which made the invasiveness of alien species unpredictable.","2004-12","2021-09-30 16:46:16","2021-09-30 16:46:16","2021-09-30 16:46:16","167-178","","3","26","","Acta Oecologica","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/LBRB2CQV/Sans et al. - 2004 - Life-history traits of alien and native senecio sp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inter-speciﬁc competition effects on P. halepensis were experimentally analysed by a shrub thinning-out treatment carried out 1 year after ﬁre. The extension of the recorded period conﬁrmed (i) a signiﬁcant increase in height, and (ii) the lack of variation in density of P. halepensis saplings when the shrub layer was removed. In contrast, the increase in relative growth rate in height (RGRh) and the decrease in mortality recorded during early post-ﬁre stages for treated units did not persist in subsequent years. These two treatment-induced effects disappeared 1 year after the shrub clearing (29 months after ﬁre). It is hypothesised that this time should represent a culminating point in the inter-speciﬁc competition established between Cistus and Pinus saplings simultaneously colonising recently disturbed areas and be a critical period for pine sapling survival. After this time, a reduction in relatively short-lived Cistus populations and an increase in P. halepensis abundance should be expected in the community. It is concluded that a shrub-clearing treatment could be recommendable if the initial post-ﬁre pine sapling density is not high enough to successfully face the early critical competitive period.

In a fully factorial design, herbivory was reduced by insecticide spraying and competition was reduced by removal of neighbouring plants. The effects of herbivory and competition were species-dependent. Bromus, a stress-tolerant species, was strongly affected by competition, but not by herbivory. In contrast, the more competitive species, Brachypodium, was negatively affected by herbivory, but only when neighbouring vegetation was removed. The greatest herbivory pressure on isolated targets of Brachypodium is likely to be due to the indirect effects of experimental gaps, i.e. more favourable microclimatic and foraging conditions for grasshoppers. This suggests that herbivory by insects may be a confounding factor in many plant removal experiments. Field experiments designed to study the combined effects of competition and herbivory should take into account the indirect effects induced by experimental gaps.","2003-07","2021-09-30 16:46:19","2021-09-30 16:46:19","2021-09-30 16:46:19","139-146","","3","24","","Acta Oecologica","Insect herbivory and grass competition in a calcareous grassland","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/simontye/Zotero/storage/SB2JNYE6/Corcket et al. - 2003 - Insect herbivory and grass competition in a calcar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
