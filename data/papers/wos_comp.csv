We investigated the short-term behavioral and developmental responses of the strict sit-and-wait antlion predator Myrmeleon hyalinus to sand disturbance (i.e., quantification of the impact of severe sand throwing), and to con- and hetero-specific competition by a larger sit-and-pursue antlion species Lopezus fedtschenkoi. We found that antlions subjected to sand disturbances reduced their pit construction activity and relocated less often. Furthermore, the reduction in pit construction activity was stronger among antlions subjected to disturbances prior to feeding. Almost no death occurred during the sand disturbance experiment, but as expected, disturbances caused reductions in the relative growth rates of antlions. This negative effect was stronger in the group exposed to sand disturbances prior to feeding. The presence of the sit-and-pursue competitor led to reductions both in pit construction and in relocation activities of M. hyalinus. Although the per-capita food supply was identical in both experiments, only 48% of M. hyalinus larvae survived the competition experiment, and this pattern was consistent between the con- and hetero-specific treatments. However, in the presence of hetero-specific competitors, the relative growth rate of surviving larvae was significantly lower than that measured in the presence of con-specific competitors. Our study demonstrates that investigating the different components of complex biotic interactions can markedly improve our understanding of how these different factors interact to influence the behavior and life history of organisms.

One of the core issues involved is that of who rates subjects' personality traits in studies. The present studies (N = 135 in Study 1, N = 232 in Study 2) surpassed the examinations performed in previous studies by obtaining information regarding one of the key personality traits, preference for competition, using a framework developed via experimental economics rather than subjective ratings. Despite the fact that the two studies involved different types of task, we consistently observed that older sisters exerted a significant impact on their younger siblings in both studies. In particular, having an older sister was negatively associated with men's competitive preferences. We also obtained suggestive evidence that having an older sister was positively associated with women's competitive preferences. Our results support sibling hypotheses from the perspective of experimental economics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

I use a quasi-experimental identification strategy exploiting exogenous variation from global oil price shocks that affect Colombian municipalities to different degrees depending on local oil endowments. I find significant spatial interaction in taxes but no significant interaction concerning budget balance and total public spending.

This study further explores potentially harmful effects of communication, by addressing the questions of (1) asymmetric communication and (2) the endogenous emergence of communication. Our theoretical analysis provides testable hypotheses regarding the effect of communication on competitive behavior and efficiency. We test these predictions using a laboratory experiment. The experiment shows that although asymmetric communication is not as harmful as symmetric communication, it leads to more aggressive competition and lower efficiency relative to the case when neither group can communicate. Moreover, groups vote to endogenously establish communication channels even though they would earn higher payoffs if jointly they chose to restrict within-group communication.","[Cason, Timothy N.] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Sheremeta, Roman M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Dept Econ, 11119 Bellflower Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Sheremeta, Roman M.] Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, One Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Zhang, Jingjing] Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Cason, TN (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.",cason@purdue.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-0721019],"We thank Jordi Brandts, Subhasish Chowdhury, David Cooper, Martin Dufwenberg, Enrique Fatas, Anya Samek, Marta Serra-Garcia, two anonymous referees, seminar participants at University of New South Wales, University of Technology, Sydney, Chapman University, Purdue University and participants at the Thurgau Experimental Economics Conference, the International Economic Science Association Meetings, the North-American Economic Science Association Meetings, the European Economic Science Association Meetings, and the workshop in honor of John Van Huyck for helpful discussions and comments.

Playback experiments, currently limited to interactions involving group-living large carnivores, demonstrate that attending to cues indicative of the immediate presence of heterospecific competitors plays a substantial role in influencing competition among these species. Group-living species vocalize regularly to signal to one another, and competitors can readily eavesdrop on these acoustic cues. Solitary large carnivores also vocalize to conspecifics, but much less frequently, reducing the ease with which heterospecific competitors can eavesdrop. Eavesdropping could nonetheless play a substantive role in mediating competition among solitary large carnivores if the benefits of responding to the acoustic cues of heterospecific competitors (reducing risk or locating resources) are sufficiently large. Behavioral interactions between solitary large carnivore species are almost never observed, and there have been no experimental tests of their reactions to cues indicative of the immediate presence of other solitary large carnivores. We used an automated playback system to test the responses of a solitary large carnivore (black bear, Ursus americanus) to vocalizations of their similarly solitary competitor (cougar, Puma concolor), presenting both cougar and control vocalizations to free-living bears foraging along shorelines in British Columbia, Canada. Both mothers with cubs and solitary bears were significantly more likely to advance and vocalize toward cougar than control playbacks, mothers producing one or both of two distinct vocalizations and solitary bears producing just one. Cougars could either represent a potential risk to bears (particularly cubs), or a source of resources, as bears are known to regularly scavenge cougar kills. Our results are consistent with bears eavesdropping on cougars for both these reasons. As with group-living species, eavesdropping may be common among solitary large carnivores, and may be an important driver of competition between these species.","[Suraci, Justin P.; Clinchy, Michael; Roberts, Devin J.; Zanette, Liana Y.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Suraci, Justin P.] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC, Canada","Suraci, JP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",justin.suraci@gmail.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC),,40,1,1,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,SEP,2017,123,9,,,,,593,599,,10.1111/eth.12631,,,7,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FD9EB,WOS:000407824500002,,,,,2021-09-30,

Our results indicate that providing matching funds for all donations does increase donations from 23% to 33% of the endowment. While individual competition for matching funds had nearly the same effectiveness as matching all donations, by far the most effective approach was to form (anonymous) teams that competed for matching funds; this led to donations of 47% of the endowment. We appeal to the notion of group identity to explain our results-participants seemed to be reluctant to let down their team in a competition. Our results can be seen as providing support for the notion that combining group identity and competition creates a motivation that can potentially be harnessed effectively for prosocial purposes.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Holder, Patrick] Brattle Grp, Boston, MA 02108 USA","Charness, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",charness@econ.ucsb.edu; holder@umail.ucsb.com,"LI, DONGLIN/AAS-1210-2020",,,,,37,9,9,1,20,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",0025-1909,1526-5501,,MANAGE SCI,Manage.

If socially recognized, the latter yields a ranking in terms of social status. The rivalry for resources resulting from competitive incentives has been found to negatively affect women's performance relative to that of men. However, little is known about gender differences in the performance consequences of social-status ranking. In our experiments we introduce a novel design that allows us to isolate the effects of status ranking from those caused by a rivalry for resources. Subjects do a time-limited task where they need to search for numbers and add them up. Performance is straightforwardly measured by the number of correct summations. When there is no status ranking we find no gender differences in the number of attempted summations or in performance. By contrast, when there is status ranking men significantly increase the number of attempted summations as well as the number of correct summations. Remarkably, when women are subjected to status ranking, they significantly decrease the number of attempted summations. The net result is striking. With status ranking men attempt more summations and correctly solve many more than women. These differences are markedly large and statistically highly significant. Our results suggest that increased participation in competitive environments could harm women's labor market success along a hidden channel.","[Schram, Arthur] EUI, Robert Schumann Ctr Adv Studies, Fiesole, Italy; [Schram, Arthur] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, CREED, POB 15867, NL-1001 NU Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brandts, Jordi] CSIC, Inst Anal Econ, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Brandts, Jordi] Barcelona GSE, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Gerxhani, Klarita] European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Via Roccettini 9, I-50014 Fiesole, FI, Italy","Schram, A (corresponding author), EUI, Robert Schumann Ctr Adv Studies, Fiesole, Italy.; Schram, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, CREED, POB 15867, NL-1001 NU Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Schram@uva.nl; Jordi.Brandts@iae.csic.es; Klarita.Gerxhani@eui.eu,"Gerxhani, Klarita/K-2446-2018","Schram, Arthur/0000-0002-1767-4998; Gerxhani, Klarita/0000-0002-9056-4920",Research Priority Area Behavioral Economics of the University of Amsterdam; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2014-59302-P]; Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in RD [SEV2015-0563]; Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2014 SGR 510],"Much of the work reported in this paper was done while the first and third authors were visiting the University of Pompeu Fabra and the Institut d'Analisi Econmica in Barcelona.

Commonly, different classes have different competitive abilities, e.g., due to differences in body size, suggesting that inter-class competition may be important and largely asymmetric. However, experimental evidence states that inter-class competition, which is important, is rare and restricted to marine fish. Here, we manipulated the adult density in six semi-natural populations of the European common lizard, Zootoca vivipara, while holding juvenile density constant. Adult density affected juveniles, but not adults, in line with inter-class competition. High adult density led to lower juvenile survival and growth before hibernation. In contrast, juvenile survival after hibernation was higher in populations with high adult density, pointing to relaxed inter-class competition. As a result, annual survival was not affected by adult density, showing that differences in pre- and post-hibernation survival balanced each other out. The intensity of inter-class competition affected reproduction, performance, and body size in juveniles. Path analyses unravelled direct treatment effects on early growth (pre-hibernation) and no direct treatment effects on the parameters measured after hibernation. This points to allometry of treatment-induced differences in early growth, and it suggests that inter-class competition mainly affects the early growth of the competitively inferior class and thereby their future performance and reproduction. These results are in contrast with previous findings and, together with results in marine fish, suggest that the strength and direction of density dependence may depend on the degree of inter-class competition, and thus on the availability of resources used by the competing classes.","[San-Jose, Luis M.; Fitze, Patrick S.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Penalver-Alcazar, Miguel] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Huyghe, Katleen] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Breedveld, Merel C.; Fitze, Patrick S.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Breedveld, Merel C.; Fitze, Patrick S.] CSIC, MNCN, Inst Pirenaico Ecol, Ntra Senora Victoria 22700, Jaca, Spain; [Fitze, Patrick S.] Fdn Araid, Edificio CEEI Aragon,Maria de Luna 11, Zaragoza 50018, Spain","San-Jose, LM (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",luis.sanjosegarcia@unil.ch,"Fitze, Patrick S/A-4719-2011; Fitze, Patrick S./C-1377-2011; Garcia, Luis San-Jose/AAC-5620-2019","Fitze, Patrick S/0000-0002-6298-2471; Fitze, Patrick S./0000-0002-6298-2471; Garcia, Luis San-Jose/0000-0003-1351-4679; Penalver-Alcazar, Miguel/0000-0002-7449-4862","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2005-01187, CGL2008-01522]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PPOOP3_128375]","The work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (CGL2005-01187, CGL2008-01522) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (PPOOP3_128375) to P.

Species in a community exert a selection pressure on other species and may drive them to extinction. We know, however, very little about the influence of unsuccessful or ghost species on the evolutionary dynamics within the community. Methods: Here we report the long-term influence of a ghost competitor on the performance of a more successful species using experimental evolution. We transferred the spider mite Tetranychus urticae onto a novel host plant under initial presence or absence of a competing species, the congeneric mite T. ludeni. Results: The competitor species, T. ludeni, unintentionally went extinct soon after the start of the experiment, but we nevertheless completed the experiment and found that the early competitive pressure of this ghost competitor positively affected the performance (i.e., fecundity) of the surviving species, T. urticae. This effect on T. urticae lasted for at least 25 generations. Discussion: Our study suggests that early experienced selection pressures can exert a persistent evolutionary signal on species' performance in novel environments.","[Bisschop, Karen; Etienne, Rampal] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Bisschop, Karen; Mortier, Frederik; Bonte, Dries] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Ghent, Belgium","Bisschop, K (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Groningen, Netherlands.; Bisschop, K (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Ghent, Belgium.",kbisschop.evo@gmail.com,"Etienne, Rampal S./F-5835-2012; Bonte, Dries/AAH-3913-2021","Etienne, Rampal S./0000-0003-2142-7612; Bonte, Dries/0000-0002-3320-7505; Bisschop, Karen/0000-0001-7083-2636",NWONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [865.13.00]; Special Research Fund (BOF) of Ghent UniversityGhent University; Ubbo Emmius sandwich programme of the University of Groningen; FWO network EVENET [W0.003.16N]; FWOFWO [G018017N],"This work was supported by the NWO (No. 865.13.00), the Special Research Fund (BOF) of Ghent University, the Ubbo Emmius sandwich programme of the University of Groningen, the FWO network EVENET (No. W0.003.16N) and the FWO (No. G018017N).

The properties of a host can influence the behavioural, morphological and life-history traits of associated parasites, including traits that mediate competition within the host. For seed parasites, host size may be an especially important determinant of competitive ability. Using the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, we performed replicated, reciprocal host shifts to examine the role of seed size in determining larval competitiveness and associated traits. Populations ancestrally associated with either a small host (mung bean) or a large one (cowpea) were switched to each other's host for 36 generations. Compared to control lines (those remaining on the ancestral host), lines switched from the small host to the large host evolved greater tolerance of co-occurring larvae within seeds (indicated by an increase in the frequency of small seeds yielding two adults), smaller egg size and higher fecundity. Each change occurred in the direction predicted by the traits of populations already adapted to cowpea. However, we did not observe the expected decline in adult mass following the shift to the larger host. Moreover, lines switched from the large host (cowpea) to the small host (mung bean) did not evolve the predicted increase in larval competitiveness or egg size, but did exhibit the predicted increase in body mass. Our results thus provide mixed support for the hypothesis that host size determines the evolution of competition-related traits of seed beetles. Evolutionary responses to the two host shifts were consistent among replicate lines, but the evolution of larval competition was asymmetric, with larval competitiveness evolving as predicted in one direction of host shift, but not the reverse. Nevertheless, our results indicate that switching hosts is sufficient to produce repeatable and rapid changes in the competition strategy and fitness-related traits of insect populations.","[Fox, C.

We report an experiment in which two groups compete in a weakest-link contest by expending costly efforts. Allowing intra-group communication leads to more aggressive competition and greater coordination than control treatments without any communication. On the other hand, allowing inter-group communication leads to less destructive competition. As a result, intra-group communication decreases while inter-group communication increases payoffs. Our experiment thus provides an example of an environment where communication can either enhance or damage efficiency. This contrasts sharply with experimental findings from public goods and other coordination games, where communication always enhances efficiency and often leads to socially optimal outcomes.

Surveys of politicians are complementary to traditional empirical analyses and can be used to extract beliefs of policymakers. There is much heterogeneity across and also within parties. Often ideology plays an important explanatory part in the beliefs of policymakers, even for questions that appear to be nonideological. Furthermore, I report on a classroom experiment, in which student subjects play a simple tax competition game. In one treatment subjects know about the political preferences of other players. In contrast to simple Nash predictions, left-leaning students choose significantly higher tax rates on capital.","[Janeba, Eckhard] Univ Mannheim, CESifo, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Janeba, Eckhard] ZEW, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany","Janeba, E (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, CESifo, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",janeba@uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,42,2,2,0,9,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,SEP,2014,70,3,,,,,345,373,,10.1628/001522114X684493,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics",Business & Economics,AR4AD,WOS:000343529500002,,,,,2021-09-30,

Yet, the number of tournament winners is often unclear to competitors. While it is hard to measure how this uncertainty affects work performance and willingness to compete in the field, it can be studied in a controlled lab experiment. We present a novel experiment where subjects can compete against each other, but the number of winners is either uncertain (but with known probabilities) or ambiguous (with unknown probabilities for different numbers of winners). We compare these two conditions to a control treatment with a known number of winners. We find that ambiguity induces a significant increase in the performance of men who choose to compete, while we observe no change for women. Men also increase their willingness to enter competition in the presence of ambiguity. Overall, both effects contribute to men winning the tournament significantly more often than women under uncertainty and ambiguity. These findings suggest that management should make tournament conditions transparent and information available in order to prevent gender disparities from increasing under uncertainty and ambiguity.

We then study various policy interventions, obtained by manipulating various aspects of the competitive environment and the contractual arrangement, e.g., the Transparency of the contracts offered, the Risk Sharing component in the contract linking portfolio managers to investors, etc. While all these interventions would induce portfolio managers, at equilibrium, to efficiently invest funds in safe assets, we find that, in the lab, Transparency is most effective in incentivising managers to do so. Finally, we document a behavioral Other People's Money effect in the lab, where portfolio managers tend to invest the funds of their investors in a more risky manner than their Own Money, even when it is not in either the investors' or the managers' interest to do so.","[Agranov, Marina] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Bisin, Alberto; Schotter, Andrew] NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA","Agranov, M (corresponding author), CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",magranov@hss.caltech.edu,,,,,,25,20,21,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This paper studies cognitive performance in a high-stakes competitive environment. The analysis takes advantage of a natural experiment that randomly allocates different emotional states across professional subjects competing in a cognitive task. The setting is a chess match where two players play an even number of chess games against each other alternating the color of the pieces. White pieces confer an advantage for winning a chess game and who starts the match with these pieces is randomly decided. The theoretical analysis shows that in this setting there is no rational reason why winning frequencies should be better than 50-50 in favor of the player drawing the white pieces in the first game. Yet, we find that observed frequencies are about 60-40. Differences in performance are also stronger when the competing subjects are more similar in cognitive skills. We conclude that the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that psychological elements affect cognitive performance in the face of experience, competition, and high stakes.

I use data on 44,799 amateur tennis players, who are randomly paired in repeated competitions, to study the causal effect of losing on the time to the next tournament participation. Results show that individuals wait on average 10% longer to enroll again after losing. Furthermore, losing against relatively weaker opponents leads to a discontinuously larger effect than losing against relatively stronger opponents, indicating that individuals do not rationally update beliefs about winning probabilities but instead use their ranking as reference point when evaluating defeats.

It has long been recognized - at least since Darwin's On the Origin of Species - that a harsh climate strengthens competition and thus sets species range limits. Using thorough field manipulations along a large elevation gradient, we show the mechanisms by which temperature determines competition type, resulting in a transition from interference to exploitative competition from the lower to the upper elevation limits in burying beetles (Nicrophorus nepalensis). This transition is an example of Darwin's classic hypothesis that benign climates favor direct competition for highly accessible resources while harsh climates result in competition through resources of high rivalry. We propose that identifying the properties of these key resources will provide a more predictive framework to understand the interplay between biotic and abiotic factors in determining geographic range limits.","[Chan, Shih-Fan; Chang, An-Yu; Shen, Sheng-Feng] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Shih, Wei-Kai; Chen, I-Ching] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Chang, An-Yu] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei 10617, Taiwan","Shen, SF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.; Chen, IC (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",shensf@sinica.edu.tw; chenic@mail.ncku.edu.tw,"Shih-Fan, Chan/AAU-3609-2020; CHEN, I-CHING/Y-1535-2019","Shih-Fan, Chan/0000-0003-2955-9433; CHEN, I-CHING/0000-0002-1909-7290; Shen, Sheng-Feng/0000-0002-0631-6343","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [103-2621-B-001 -003 -MY3, 101-2313-B-001 -008 -MY3, 104-2311-B-006-006-MY3]; Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica - Taiwan [AS-SS-106-05]","We thank Noah Last for editing the English in this manuscript.

While data competitions have become quite popular and prevalent, particularly in supervised learning formats, their implementations by the host are highly variable. Without careful planning, a supervised learning competition is vulnerable to overfitting, where the winning solutions are so closely tuned to the particular set of provided data that they cannot generalize to the general underlying problem of interest to the host. This article outlines important considerations for strategically designing relevant and informative data sets to maximize the learning outcome from hosting a competition. These include: 1. precisely defining the scope of the problem, 2. encouraging participation by competitors from diverse technical backgrounds, 3. specifying the most interesting solution space in order to encourage improvement and distinguish between competitors, 4. strategically generating data sets that enable testing for interpolation and extrapolation to new scenarios of interest, 5. leveraging design of experiment principles for strategic data design while preventing unintentional artifacts in the competition data sets that competitors could exploit without addressing the real problem of interest, and 6. carefully designing the leaderboard scoring metric to select top solutions that closely match the overall competition goals. The methods are illustrated with a recently completed competition in the context of urban radiological search to evaluate algorithms capable of detecting, identifying, and locating radioactive materials. Simulated data were used in the urban search competition.

We compare four different designs: the uniform yardstick, the unweighted uniform yardstick, the discriminatory yardstick, and the best-practice yardstick. The effect of a specific design on prices depends on two separate mechanisms, one which affects the incentive power to increase productive efficiency and another which affects the risk of collusion. We show theoretically that for the best-practice yardstick, which is widely applied in several industries in a number of countries, these two mechanisms point in the same direction (high prices), which is confirmed by the experiment. Both the theoretical analysis as well as the economic experiment show that the discriminatory yardstick results in lower prices than the unweighted uniform yardstick. The theory, however, does not give a clear answer on the relative performance of the discriminatory versus the weighted uniform yardstick. In the experimental analysis, we find that the advantage of the discriminatory yardstick in terms of giving incentives to improve productive efficiency exceeds the disadvantage of a relatively higher risk of collusion. This conclusion appears to be robust for different degrees of heterogeneity of the industry. Hence the discriminatory yardstick yields the lowest prices for consumers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Little is known, however, about how and whether such rules emerge endogenously in groups of potentially affected subjects. We experimentally investigate whether subjects vote for affirmative action rules, against, or abstain. If approved by the vote, a quota rule is implemented that favors women in one treatment, but members of an artificially created group based on random color assignment in another treatment. We find that quota rules based on gender are implemented frequently and do not affect the performance of men and women in a contest. Quota rules based on an arbitrary criterion, however, are less often approved and lead to strong individual reactions of advantaged and disadvantaged group members and to efficiency losses. These results show that the effects of affirmative action policies largely depend on whether these policies are viewed favorably within the affected groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A mechanism to limit the development of unequal cooperation is inequity aversion, the negative reaction to unequal treatment. While inequity aversion has been studied extensively across many animal species, it remains unclear whether inequity aversion elicited in experimental settings is directed to the cooperative partner animal or rather to the experimenter distributing the rewards unequally. In the current study we aimed to further investigate whether the presence of an experimenter distributing rewards is essential in order to elicit inequity aversion in dogs. We tested 22 dog dyads in an inequity task, requiring dyads to alternately press a buzzer in order to receive rewards of equal or unequal value. We manipulated the extent of the experimenter's involvement in the task: in the experimenter-present version an experimenter gave a command to the dogs to press the buzzer and delivered the rewards by pushing the bowls into the dogs' enclosure. In contrast, in the experimenter-absent version, no experimenter was visible and the buzzer and bowls were moved from behind a curtain. We found that dogs did not respond to the unequal treatment regardless of the experimenter's involvement in the task. Nonetheless, we found that dogs based their behavior on frustration and social facilitation in the experimenter-absent version of the task, suggesting that a social interaction with an experimenter may be one aspect necessary to elicit inequity aversion. One potential explanation for the absence of inequity aversion in the experimenter-present version of the task might be the reward delivery method. Using separate sets of reward bowls for each dog instead of a shared bowl could have removed a potentially important competitive aspect (i.e., shared resource) from the inequity paradigm. In addition, delivering the rewards via bowls, rather than directly handing the rewards to the dogs, might have caused dogs to perceive the task as less cooperative. These results suggest that both the presence of an experimenter causing inequity and the inclusion of a competitive or cooperative element in the task may be basic requirements for eliciting inequity aversion.","[Brucks, Desiree; Marshall-Pescini, Sarah; Essler, Jennifer L.; McGetrick, Jim; Huber, Ludwig; Range, Friederike] Univ Vienna, Univ Vet Med Vienna, Med Univ Vienna, Comparat Cognit Unit,Messerli Res Inst, Vienna, Austria","Brucks, D (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Univ Vet Med Vienna, Med Univ Vienna, Comparat Cognit Unit,Messerli Res Inst, Vienna, Austria.",desiree.brucks@vetmeduni.ac.at,"Brucks, Desiree/AAF-6788-2020","Brucks, Desiree/0000-0003-3146-5110; Marshall-Pescini, Sarah/0000-0002-5944-4701; Range, Friederike/0000-0003-3127-5536",Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [P24840]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 24840] Funding Source: researchfish,"We want to thank dogs and dog owners for participation in this study.

It is hard to build but easy to destroy. In this paper, we explore the fragility of trust in a stylized laboratory environment. We ask whether transgression outside a direct send-and-return relationship destroys trust and, if so, whether a competition against outsiders or an apology for misdeeds helps restore it. We find that transgression significantly reduces trust and that the broken trust can be greatly restored by group competition. Communication via an apology, impersonal or not, has an insignificant impact. By contrast, offering explanations for misbehavior is as effective as group competition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The experiments focus on the analysis of solute breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained after injection of an aqueous solution containing similar concentrations of the two metal ions into a soil column fully saturated with double deionized water. Transport of the competing ions is tested for the same soil under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Measurements show that the species with lower affinity for the soil, , migrates occupying all available adsorption sites, and is then progressively replaced by the ion with higher affinity, . The two ions are displaced in the system with different effective retardation. The slowest species replaces the sorbed ions, resulting in observed concentrations that display a non-monotonic behavior in time and which, for a certain period, are larger than the concentration supplied continuously at the inlet. In the absence of a complete geochemical characterization of the system, we show that the measured concentrations of both metals can be interpreted through simple models based on a set of coupled partial differential and algebraic equations, involving a small subset of aqueous and adsorbed species that are present in the system. Depending on the model considered, the relationship between aqueous and adsorbed ion concentrations is described at equilibrium by a Gaines-Thomas (GT) formulation, a competitive Sheindorf-Rebhun-Sheintuch (SRS) isotherm, or an Extended Langmuir (EL) isotherm, respectively. The GT formulation provides the best interpretation of the observed behavior among the models tested. We find that employing these simple models, which account only for the main governing reactive processes, allows reasonable estimation of the observed BTCs in experiments where only partial geochemical datasets are available.","[Janetti, Emanuela Bianchi; Riva, Monica; Guadagnini, Alberto] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Dror, Ishai; Berkowitz, Brian] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Environm Sci & Energy Res, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Sanchez-Vila, Xavier] Univ Politecn Catalunya Barcelona Tech, Dept Geotech Engn & Geosci, Barcelona 08034, Spain","Janetti, EB (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Piazza L Da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",emanuela.bianchi@mail.polimi.it,"Riva, Monica/A-9974-2015; BERKOWITZ, BRIAN/K-1497-2012","BERKOWITZ, BRIAN/0000-0003-3078-1859; Riva, Monica/0000-0002-7304-4114; Bianchi Janetti, Emanuela/0000-0003-4086-851X; Sanchez-Vila, Xavier/0000-0002-1234-9897","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CSD2009-00065, GCL2009-1114]; Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [221/11]; Politecnico di Milano","X.

Meanwhile, many people experience competitive contexts as stressful. We use two laboratory experiments to investigate whether factors related to stress can help explain individual differences in tournament entry. Experiment 1 studies whether stress responses (measured as salivary cortisol) to taking part in a mandatory tournament predict individual willingness to participate in a voluntary tournament. We find that competing increases stress levels. This cortisol response does not predict tournament entry for men but is positively and significantly correlated with choosing to enter the tournament for women. In Experiment 2, we exogenously induce physiological stress using the cold-pressor task. We find a positive causal effect of stress on tournament entry for women but no effect for men. Finally, we show that although the effect of stress on tournament entry differs between the genders, stress reactions cannot explain the well-documented gender difference in willingness to compete.","[Buser, Thomas] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Buser, Thomas] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Dreber, Anna] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mollerstrom, Johanna] George Mason Univ, Res Inst Ind Econ, ICES, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden","Dreber, A (corresponding author), Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",t.buser@uva.nl; anna.dreber@hhs.se; jmollers@gmu.com,,,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation (Handelsbankens Forskningsstiftelser); Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Speerpunt Behavioural Economics of the University of Amsterdam,"We are grateful to comments from Johannes Haushofer, Magnus Johannesson, Pranjal Mehta and participants at seminars at the ASSA 2016 Meetings, the ESA North America Meetings 2014, University of Amsterdam, University of Toulouse, and the Interdisciplinary Center for Economic Science at George Mason University.

For the same degree of competition (identical aggregate demand and supply), we can observe different demand structures. Do they have an impact on the auction efficiency and revenue-raising properties? It is essential to understand better the impact of competition structure on performance in order to draw recommendations for the design of multi-unit auctions. Theoretical results demonstrate on a simple case contrasting a uniform-price auction of two bidders with a demand of 6 units each, and an auction of 6 bidders with a demand of two units each, that there are multiple equilibria leading to different performance outcome. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of these two auctions. Results support that with a constant competition degree, the seller gets higher expected revenue with a lower variance when he faces a large number of bidders with small individual demands. We show that this result is attained with no significant effect on allocative efficiency.","[Preget, Raphaele] INRA, LAMETA, UMR 1135, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Preget, Raphaele] INRA LAMETA, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Thoyer, Sophie] Montpellier SupAgro, LAMETA, UMR 1135, F-34000 Montpellier, France","Preget, R (corresponding author), INRA, LAMETA, UMR 1135, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",preget@supagro.inra.fr; thoyer@supagro.inra.fr,,,,,,19,0,0,0,9,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

While compelling, the underling mechanism of the finding remains elusive. We conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate how inequality influences people's behavior in a sharing game. We test varying causes of inequality to see how people share payoffs with others when inequality is caused respectively by chance, competition, and choice. The experiment result shows that the rich give less than the poor only when inequality is self-chosen. Yet, different from findings in previous studies, increasing inequality does not reinforce, but instead mitigates the negative relationship of income and giving. Our study suggests that research on the consequences of inequality should be careful on discerning whether self-choice of inequality could account for the spurious effect of inequality on people's prosocial behavior.","[Chiang, Yen-Sheng] Acad Sinica, Inst Sociol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Chen, Jacqueline Chen] South China Agr Univ, Dept Sociol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Chiang, YS (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Sociol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.; Chen, JC (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Dept Sociol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",chiangys@gate.sinica.edu.tw,,,Faculty of the Social Sciences of the Chinese University of Hong Kong,We appreciate the financial support of the Direct Grant provided by the Faculty of the Social Sciences of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.,,50,2,2,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0303-8300,1573-0921,,SOC INDIC RES,Soc.

Yet all organisms live in diverse communities containing many hundreds of species. This review discusses how species interactions influence the evolution of constituent species across whole communities. When species interactions are weak or inconsistent, evolutionary dynamics should be predictable by factors identified by single-species theory. Stronger species interactions, however, can alter evolutionary outcomes and either dampen or promote evolution of constituent species depending on the number of species and the distribution of interaction strengths across the interaction network. Genetic interactions, such as horizontal gene transfer, might also affect evolutionary outcomes. These evolutionary mechanisms in turn affect whole-community properties, such as the level of ecosystem functioning. Successful management of both ecosystems and focal species requires new understanding of evolutionary interactions across whole communities.","[Barraclough, Timothy G.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Barraclough, TG (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",t.barraclough@imperial.ac.uk,,"Barraclough, Timothy/0000-0002-8084-2640",,,,123,74,74,8,118,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1543-592X,1545-2069,978-0-8243-1446-0,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

Recent doping scandals in sports as well as forgery and plagiarism scandals in academia have been partially explained by competitive pressures, which suggests a link between competition and cheating. In our experiment subjects conduct a task where they have the possibility to make use of illegitimate tools to better their results. We find that women react much stronger to competitive pressure by increasing their cheating activity while there is no overall sex difference in cheating. However, the effect of competition on women's cheating behavior is entirely due to the fact that women, on average, are doing worse with respect to the assigned task. Indeed we find that it is the ability of an individual to conduct a particular task and not sex that crucially affects the reaction to competition. Poor performers significantly increase their cheating behavior under competition which may be a face-saving strategy or an attempt to retain a chance of winning. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that individuals misreport in the same proportion and to the same extent by inflating their outcome or by decreasing their opponent's outcome, except when any possible scrutiny by the experimenter is removed. Regardless of the possibility of scrutiny by the experimenter, misreporting is affected neither by the competitor's group identity nor by the individual's beliefs about others' misreporting behavior.

Evidence from a unique field experiment,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fundraising; Competition; Direct mailing; Field experiment,IMPURE ALTRUISM; DIRECT MAILINGS; WARM-GLOW; DONATIONS,"Charitable organizations send out large volumes of direct mailings, soliciting for money in support of many good causes. Without any request, donations are rarely made, and it is well known that each request for money by a charity likely generates at least some revenues. Whether a single request from a charity increases the total amount donated by an individual is however unknown. Indeed, a response to one request can hurt responses to others. The net effect is therefore not easily observable, certainly not when multiple charities address the same individuals. In this paper we alleviate these observational difficulties by carrying out a field experiment in which five large charities cooperate. With the unique data that we collect, we study the impact of sending more requests on total donations. The results indicate that there is a negative competitive effect on requests from other charities, but this effect dies out rapidly. Soon after the mailing has been sent, it is only a strong cannibalization of the charity's own revenues that prevails. This empirical finding suggests the important conclusion that not much coordination across charities is needed to increase revenues. We also demonstrate that charities need sophisticated evaluation tools that do not ignore the effects of cannibalization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The binding of BP(OH)2 at the two primary drug-binding sites on HSA (Sudlows sitesI and II) is explored by a competitive-binding study and monitored by considering the green-light emission from its diketo tautomer. Warfarin is used as a marker for siteI and dansyl-L-proline (DP) as a competitor for siteII. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements affirm that neither of Sudlows sites is the binding locus of BP(OH)2. To gain an idea regarding the probable binding site of BP(OH)2, we perform molecular-docking studies, which reveal a close proximity of the probe to Trp-214 in subdomain IIA of HSA. Confirmation of this contention is achieved by studying the quenching of the fluorescence of Trp-214 in the presence of BP(OH)2. Moreover, static quenching seems to be responsible for the depletion of the fluorescence of Trp-214, as manifested by the invariance of the intrinsic fluorescence lifetime of Trp-214, as a function of the concentration of BP(OH)2. Based on displacement and quenching studies, supported by molecular docking, we propose that BP(OH)2 binds in a cleft that separates subdomains IIIA and IIB, which is in close proximity to Trp-214.","[De, Dipanwita; Kaur, Harpreet; Datta, Anindya] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India","Datta, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",anindya@chem.iitb.ac.in,,"De, Dipanwita/0000-0002-4605-4894",SERC; DSTDepartment of Science & Technology (India); CSIRCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India,This work was supported by the SERC and the DST.

In this paper, we consider a game in which the individual decision to be tax compliant is affected both by strategic competition between taxpayers and the psychological cost of being detected (i.e., shame). We ran a laboratory experiment using a sample of 138 students at the Centro di Economia Sperimentale A Roma Est (CESARE) to evaluate the efficiency of random versus targeted audit rules and to verify the interaction between strategic competition and shame.

However, how the interplay between the type of dispersal and the scale of competition simultaneously affects these traits in sub-divided populations is rarely considered. We investigated sex allocation and sexual conflict evolution in meta-populations of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae evolving under budding (pairing females from the same patch) or random (pairing females from different patches) dispersal and either local (fixed sampling from each subpopulation) or global (sampling as a function of subpopulation productivity) competition. Females evolving under budding dispersal produced less female-biased offspring sex ratios than those from the random dispersal selection regimes, contradicting theoretical predictions. In contrast, the scale of competition did not strongly affect sex allocation. Offspring sex ratio and female fecundity were unaffected by the number of mates, but female fecundity was highest when their mates evolved under budding dispersal, suggesting these males inflict less harm than those evolving under random dispersal. This work highlights that population structure can impact the evolution of sex allocation and sexual conflict. Moreover, selection on either trait may reciprocally affect the evolution of the other, for example via effects on fecundity.","[R.

However, it is thought that root competition may be less important than shoot competition due to greater size symmetry belowground. Because direct experimental tests on the importance of root competition are scarce, we aim at elucidating whether root competition may have direct or indirect effects on community structure. Indirect effects may occur by altering the overall size asymmetry of competition through root-shoot competitive interactions. Methods We used a phytometer approach to examine the effects of root, shoot and total competition intensity and importance on evenness of experimental plant communities. Thereby two different phytometer species, Festuca brevipila and Dianthus carthusianorum, were grown in small communities of six grassland species over three levels of light and water availability, interacting with neighbouring shoots, roots, both or not at all. Important Findings We found variation in community evenness to be best explained if root and shoot (but not total) competition were considered. However, the effects were species specific: in Dianthus communities increasing root competition increased plant community evenness, while in Festuca communities shoot competition was the driving force of this evenness response. Competition intensities were influenced by environmental conditions in Dianthus, but not in Festuca phytometer plants. While we found no evidence for root-shoot interactions for neither phytometer species root competition in Dianthus communities led to increased allocation to shoots, thereby increasing the potential ability to perform in size-asymmetric competition for light. Our experiment demonstrates the potential role of root competition in structuring plant communities.","[Weiss, Lina; Schalow, Linda; Jeltsch, Florian; Geissler, Katja] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Muhlenberg 3, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Weiss, Lina; Jeltsch, Florian] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Jeltsch, Florian] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany","Weiss, L (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Muhlenberg 3, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",weissl@uni-potsdam.de,,,Leibniz Centre of Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF e.V.); BMBFFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LC1501B],This study was supported by the Leibniz Centre of Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF e.V.) and by the BMBF in the framework of the BIBS project (01LC1501B).,,59,2,3,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

In four experiments, we examined the role of constituency communication in terms of their attitudes towards (un)ethical and competitive conduct on negotiators' willingness and actual use of unethical tactics. We find that the mere presence of a constituency already increased representatives' willingness to engage in unethical behavior (Experiment 1). More specifically, a constituency communicating liberal (vs. strict) attitudes toward unethical conduct helps negotiators to justify transgressions and morally disengage from their behavior, resulting in an increased use of unethical negotiation tactics (Experiment 2-3). Moreover, constituents' endorsement of competitive strategies sufficed to increase moral disengagement and unethical behavior of representative negotiators in a similar fashion (Experiment 4ab). Our results caution organizational practice against advocating explicit unethical and even competitive tactics by constituents: it eases negotiators' moral dilemma towards unethical conduct.","[Aaldering, Hillie] Univ Amsterdam, Work & Org Psychol, Nieuwe Achtergracht 129B, NL-1018 WT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Zerres, Alfred] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Steinel, Wolfgang] Leiden Univ, Social Econ & Org Psychol, Leiden, Netherlands","Aaldering, H (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Work & Org Psychol, Nieuwe Achtergracht 129B, NL-1018 WT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",H.Aaldering@uva.nl,,,,,,54,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0926-2644,1572-9907,,GROUP DECIS NEGOT,Group Decis.

We investigate how subjects decide on prices and quantities in response to signals from the firms' internal conditions, i.e., individual profits, excess demand, and excess supply, and the market environment, i.e., aggregate price level. We find persistent heterogeneity in individual behavior, with about 46% of market followers, 28% profit-adjusters and 26% demand adjusters.

Starting from a multi-armed bandit problem, we tested the bridging tie hypothesis experimentally by studying the outcomes of social learning for different network positions (in terms of local clustering and closeness centrality) with and without competition. We found a positive effect of bridging ties, but only within one's direct network (i.e., when local clustering is lower), in competitive contexts, and for choices characterized by higher uncertainty. This stresses the importance of outlining more clearly the scope in which the bridging tie hypothesis applies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While psychologists typically use self-reported psychometric scales, economists tend to use behavioral measures obtained from economic experiments, where subjects confronted with specific paid tasks have to select into either a competitive or a piece-rate payment scheme. Both measurement approaches have remained largely isolated from one another. We demonstrate that a standard behavioral measure and a psychometric scale of individual competitiveness are positively associated, but distinguishable with respect to the role of personal development motives. While self-reported competitiveness also emerges from personal development motives, the behavioral measure does not reflect such motives. The distinction between both measures is validated based on divergent associations with personality and interests in a competitive career. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the determinants of the decision to enter competitions are still not fully understood. The aim of this paper is twofold. We first evaluate how participants update their beliefs after receiving feedback informing them of whether their performance is below or above the median performance. Second, we are interested in how men and women react to this information in terms of competitive entry. Our first result is that participants, and women in particular, react more strongly to the feedback they receive than would a Bayesian agent. As far as entry into competition is concerned, below-median participants adjust their entry decision according to the competition they expect to face, while above median participants do not. However, the behaviour behind these results is quite different for men and women: women mainly react to information on their own performance, while men seem to respond more to their beliefs over the competition they will face. Moreover, most of the effect of feedback and the information regarding the level of the competition on the decision to compete seems to operate via beliefs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In a typical SPR experiment, chip-bound DNA is exposed to increasing concentrations of protein; the resulting binding data are used to calculate a dissociation constant for the interaction. However, in cases in which knowledge of the specificity of the interaction is required, a large set of DNA variants has to be tested; this is time consuming and costly, in part because of the requirement for multiple SPR chips. We have developed a new protocol that uses steady-state binding levels in SPR competition experiments to determine protein-binding dissociation constants for a set of DNA variants. This approach is rapid and straightforward and requires the use of only a single SPR chip. Additionally, in contrast to other methods, our approach does not require prior knowledge of parameters such as on or off rates, using an estimate of the wild-type interaction as the sole input. Utilizing relative steady-state responses, our protocol also allows for the rapid, reliable, and simultaneous determination of protein-binding dissociation constants of a large series of DNA mutants in a single experiment in a semiquantitative fashion. We compare our approach to existing methods, highlighting specific advantages as well as limitations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Recent empirical studies suggest that money illusion may persist, distorting real prices in a variety of economic environments, including the housing market and the stock market. In this paper, we explore the emergence and persistence of nominal illusion in an experimental entry game where firms must choose which local market to enter, and then compete in prices. All local markets are equivalent in real terms and they only differ in the currency the price competition is run under. Our experimental results show a positive, persistent and monotone effect of the nominal exchange rate on market prices, statistically significant for large enough exchange rate.

In brief, they are all evaluated for qualities such as: creativity and advance in theoretical background, as well as the reliability of the constructed machine to work without human help.

This paper studies the decision of party supporters to join political campaigns. We present a framework that incorporates supporters' instrumental and expressive motives and illustrates that party competition can either increase or decrease party activism. To distinguish between these competing predictions, we implemented a field experiment with a European party during a national election. In a seemingly unrelated party survey, we randomly assigned 1,417 party supporters to true information that the canvassing activity of the main competitor party was exceptionally high. Using unobtrusive, real-time data on party supporters' canvassing behavior, we find that respondents exposed to the high-competition treatment are 30% less likely to go canvassing. To investigate the causal mechanism, we leverage additional survey evidence collected two months after the campaign. Consistent with affective accounts of political activism, we show that increased competition lowered party supporters' political self-efficacy, which plausibly led them to remain inactive.","[Hager, Anselm] Humboldt Univ, Int Polit, Berlin, Germany; [Hermle, Johannes] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hermle, Johannes] Inst Lab Econ, Bonn, Germany; [Hensel, Lukas] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Roth, Christopher] Univ Cologne, Econ & Management, Cologne, Germany; [Roth, Christopher] Ctr Econ & Policy Res, Washington, DC USA","Hager, A (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Int Polit, Berlin, Germany.",anselm.hager@hu-berlin.de; j.hermle@berkeley.edu; lukas.hensel@pku.edu.cn; roth@wiso.uni-koeln.de,,,,,,67,0,0,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3816,1468-2508,,J POLIT,J.

For this, we use a controlled laboratory experiment where subjects decided on the level of treatment quality as head of a hospital. We find that the post-merger average quality is significantly lower than the average pre-merger quality. However, for merger insiders and outsiders, average quality choices are significantly higher than predicted for pure profit-maximising hospitals. This upward deviation is potentially driven by altruistic behaviour towards patients. Furthermore, we find that in the case where sufficient cost synergies are realised by the merged hospitals, there is a significant increase in average quality choices compared to the scenario without synergies.

We want to explore whether the effect of knowledge and social interaction between players modifies the cooperative and competitive behavior observed in similar experiments run in a lab. Our hypothesis is that players are socially influenced. Hence, individuals adjust behavior in a dynamic way aimed at maximizing profits, but also according to social pressures. Overall, we obtain different learning processes across academic levels and also slightly different behavior from that predicted by economic theory. We argue that students' utility function depends not only on profit levels but also on social relationships.

A quantitative decrease in cooperation was observed in all populations, but as expected, cooperation was maintained at a higher level in the viscous environment. Mutants that are resistant against but not producing the toxin were identified at a low frequency in a few populations from the viscous environment and at a high frequency in all the populations from the nonviscous environment. The underlying mutations were identified. Relative fitness of the cooperator and mutant genotypes were obtained with bacteria that were isogenic, except for the identified mutations. Competition experiments indicated that cooperation is not favored by environmental viscosity as imposed in our system and suggested that when it comes to cooperation, environmental viscosity should be considered not only in terms of individual movement, but also in terms of the distribution of the public good.","[Le Gac, Mickael; Doebeli, Michael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Le Gac, M (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",legac@zoology.ubc.ca,"Doebeli, Michael/D-5391-2012","Le Gac, Mickael/0000-0001-6451-5781",NSERC (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Human Frontier Science Program (EU)Human Frontier Science ProgramEuropean Commission,"We thank B.

A population comprises two unequally sized groups. Each individual allocates effort between a 'majority' skill and a 'minority' skill; it is cheaper to invest in the skill of one's own group. Individuals are subsequently pairwise-matched in an environment that encourages either competition or coordination. We find, both theoretically and experimentally, that under competition, the minority players earn more than the majority players when the share of the minority group is sufficiently small, as players acquire more of the majority skill to maximize the chance of winning against a majority opponent. Moreover, when there are no theoretical predictions for a relatively large share of the minority, we find experimentally that the minority players still enjoy an advantage, and the advantage is smaller. Under coordination, in contrast, payoffs are reversed both theoretically and experimentally: players are more likely to coordinate on the majority skill, and this yields a minority disadvantage; the minority disadvantage grows with the imbalance in the size of the two groups.

In a 2 x 2 design, we vary the credibility of announcements and the efficiency of the contributions to the public fund. We find that sellers' donations are strictly positive independently of the credibility of the announcements, and their donations are higher if announcements are credible and efficiency is high. However, market outcomes in terms of prices and profits do not differ significantly in any treatment that allows for contributions to a public fund. Analysis of buyer decisions reveals that prices are the main driver of purchase decisions while higher donations only affect purchase decisions when they are credible and price differences are negligible. Our results indicate that under intense competition the possibility of attracting customers through corporate social responsibility activities is limited, although the constant positive level of contributions suggests that norms lead to a certain minimum level of corporate social responsibility.

With the aim to determine the effects of different incentive schemes (piece rate, competition, choice between piece rate and competition, social or increased monetary incentives) on performance of young and older subjects, we look at behavior of a group of younger and older adults on a well-established real effort task. Based on the theory of Social Production Functions, we hypothesize age effects that depend on the incentive schemes used. We show that older adults are less productive than younger adults in all conditions, but that different incentive schemes exert similar influences on productivity in both age groups. While we do not find a significant age difference in competitiveness and reject the age-related predictions of the Social Production Functions Theory, we replicate the gender difference in competitiveness found in the literature. Social incentives in men have an at least as strong or even stronger effect on performance than increased monetary incentives. Women do not show an increase in performance with social incentives.

Allelochemicals can be immediately effective after being released but can also persist in soils, resulting in a legacy effect. However, to our knowledge there are no studies which distinguish between allelopathic legacy and immediate allelopathy of invasive species and also test for their relative importance and possible interdependence. We used eleven invasive species and tested whether they show immediate allelopathy and allelopathic legacy effects in a factorial pairwise competition experiment using field-collected soil (invaded/non-invaded) and activated carbon to neutralize allelochemicals. We grew two native and the invasive species in both monocultures and pairwise mixtures. In monocultures, the native species did not experience an allelopathic legacy effect of the invasives, suggesting that invaders generally lack persistent allelochemicals. However, the effects of invader allelochemicals were modulated by competitive interactions. In competition, immediate allelopathy decreased competitive ability of natives, while allelopathic legacy positively affected the natives. Moreover, immediate allelopathic and allelopathic legacy effects were strongly negatively correlated. Our results suggest that both immediately released allelochemicals and the allelochemical legacy of invasive species are important for plant performance under natural conditions, and that natives should be able to recover once the invaders are removed. To test whether immediate allelopathy is responsible for plant invasion success, further studies should compare allelopathic effects between invasive and closely related native species.","[Del Fabbro, Corina; Prati, Daniel] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Physiol, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland","Del Fabbro, C (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Physiol, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",corina.delfabbro@ips.unibe.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation SNSFSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A_127561],"We would like to thank Judith Hinderling, Christine Heiniger, Madalin Parepa, Stefan Blaser, Juliane Preukschas, Judith Minker, Gabriella Del Fabbro and Thomas Kuster for help during the experiments, Petr Dostal for soil and seeds from the Czech Republic and Pete Manning for helpful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

In contrast, the congener D. middendorffiana was able to persist only in ponds where H. septentrionalis became established. The fact that Daphnia middendorffiana could not successfully colonize ponds that did not contain H. septentrionalis indicates that this predator was necessary for D. middendorffiana to thrive. These results suggest that D. pulex is able to outcompete D. middendorffiana when H. septentrionalis is absent. Pond size was a key determinant of colonization success, in that H. septentrionalis and D. middendorffiana were able to persist only in ponds with volumes greater than 10 m(3).

In any proportion, the mortality rate of T. melanocephalum reached over 80%, higher than that of S. invicta. S. invicta colonies were of equal worker biomass and number recruited more workers for colony-level interference competition and used more resources.

However, it is difficult to correct data of missing plants. The overall objective of this study was to analyze yield losses in agronomic trials and to develop a function that satisfactorily adjusts plot yields affected by a varying number of missing plants. Eight clones were initially evaluated in different locations for five consecutive years. For every genotype, mean plot yields decreased as the number of missing plants increased. Average losses ranged from 10.6 to 78.8% by removing from one to eight plants, respectively. Yields per plant increased significantly when more than four plants were removed due to a compensatory growth effect. Graphic analyses showed that the power function was the best explaining the relationship between fresh root yield and number of harvested plants. A model that properly adjusted yield for all varieties but one is proposed. Hopefully, this formula to adjust yields will help to improve the quality of cassava trials worldwide.","[Perez, J.

Yet, experimental evidence that competition drives spatial segregation of closely related species on elevational gradients is rare. To test whether competition limits elevational ranges of tropical songbirds, we conducted reciprocal playback experiments on 2 pairs of species with adjacent but nonoverlapping (parapatric) distributions and 1 pair of sympatric species. We found asymmetric interspecific aggression in one parapatric pair (Pycnonotidae) and a complete absence of interspecific aggression in the other (Zosteropidae). We also found asymmetric interspecies aggression in a pair of sympatric flycatchers (Muscicapidae). Our results indicate that interspecific aggression may set range limits in some cases, but it is not a prerequisite for parapatry. Furthermore, the presence of interspecific aggression between co-occurring relatives suggests that while competition may play a role in limiting species distributions, interspecific aggression alone is not sufficient evidence to assert that competition is the primary driver of parapatric distributions.","[Boyce, Andy J.] Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Forestry 108, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Boyce, Andy J.; Martin, Thomas E.] Univ Montana, US Geol Survey, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Nat Sci Room 205, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Boyce, Andy J.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, 1500 Remount Rd, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA","Boyce, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Forestry 108, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.; Boyce, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Montana, US Geol Survey, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Nat Sci Room 205, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.; Boyce, AJ (corresponding author), Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, 1500 Remount Rd, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA.",andyjboyce@gmail.com,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867; Boyce, Andy/0000-0003-3508-6599","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1241041, DEB-1651283, IOS-1656120]; AOU Graduate Student Research Grant; Wesley M.

We argue that market conditions in previous studies were unfavorable for collusion which may have been responsible for not finding such a focal-point effect. Our design aims at maximizing the likelihood of a focal-point effect. Nevertheless, our results again fail to support the focal-point hypothesis. Collusion is as unlikely in markets with a price ceiling as in markets with unconstrained pricing. Overall, static Nash equilibrium predicts the data fairly accurately.

At one extreme, a subject's probability of winning a prize is equal to her share of the total expenditures. At lower levels of competition, a subject's probability of winning is affected more by her own expenditures than by the expenditures of others. Predicted expenditure levels are positively associated with higher levels of competition. Consistent with previous rent seeking experiments, we find that subjects spend significantly more than the Nash equilibrium prediction at all levels of competition. However, expenditure patterns generally follow the Nash prediction; expenditures decrease as the level of competition decreases. Our experimental design also includes a lottery choice experiment to control for subjects' risk preference.

Borkh) and the latest blight resistant American chestnut x Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) hybrids. Planted seedlings of chestnut, tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and chestnut oak (Quercus prinus L.) were subjected to two levels of light and two soil types in parallel field and greenhouse studies. The field study took place in the Appalachian ridge and valley province of Virginia. Growth and survival were quantified after three growing seasons. The interaction between light levels and topographic position (soil type) was significant for growth rates in the field and greenhouse. Species were significantly different from each other although hybrid varieties were not significantly different from each other or from pure American chestnut. Tulip poplar showed the greatest growth rates under all treatments in the field. Both tulip poplar and chestnut had the greatest growth rates in large gaps within mesic, mid and lower slope (MML) sites in the field. In contrast to growth, optimal conditions for survival differed among species. Tulip poplar had the greatest survival (71%) within large gaps in MML sites while chestnuts and oaks had the greatest overall survival (64%) in small gaps within xeric, upper slope and ridge (XUR) sites. In the greenhouse, tulip poplar did not outperform chestnut. Discrepancies in field and greenhouse studies were accounted for by uncontrolled factors, such as rodent predation. We conclude that optimal sites for planting American chestnut hybrids are in small gaps located within XUR sites.","[Griscom, H. P.] James Madison Univ, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Griscom, B.

Interference interactions are frequently asymmetric, whereby one species wins the majority of interactions; however, the effect of this asymmetry on the diet of subordinate species has not received the same attention as the impact of interference on habitat use. Here we experimentally evaluated whether release from asymmetric interference led to increased use of a preferred dietary resource by subordinate species, using coral-feeding butterflyfishes as a model system. Following experimental removal of the behaviourally dominant species, we found no change in diet breadth or foraging on the preferred resource by subordinate species. Our results suggest that release from asymmetric interspecific interference does not necessarily result in changes to subordinate species' diets, at least not over the course of our study. Rather, consistently asymmetric interactions may contribute to behavioural conditioning of subordinate species, meaning that even in the absence of dominants, subordinate individuals maintain established feeding patterns. Additionally, our results suggest that antagonistic interactions between butterflyfishes may have contributed to niche partitioning and conservatism over evolutionary time scales.","[Blowes, Shane A.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Blowes, Shane A.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Blowes, Shane A.] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Blowes, SA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Blowes, SA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Blowes, SA (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",sablowes@gmail.com,"Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020; Connolly, Sean/E-7773-2011","Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Blowes, Shane/0000-0001-6310-3670; Connolly, Sean/0000-0003-1537-0859",James Cook University; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Queensland Smart State Ph.D. fellowship,"We thank James Cook University and the Australian Research Council for financial support; SAB was also supported by a Queensland Smart State Ph.D. fellowship.

Contemporaneously, a different clone of CRKP caused an easily contained outbreak in a paediatric long-term care facility (LTCF) in Jerusalem. While previously identified host-related risk factors for colonization by these organisms undoubtedly contributed to these outbreaks, it is very likely that bacterial factors might be crucial in explaining the striking differences in transmissibility between the implicated strains. We therefore sought bacterial factors associated with these different epidemiological behaviours. Seven CRKP isolated at our hospital and the LTCF during 200809 were examined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and PFGE, and further analyses of these two clones was done using multilocus sequence typing and competition experiments. Plasmids were analysed by conjugation, restriction mapping, PCR and sequencing. Both clones were multidrug resistant and harboured identical plasmids carrying the bla(KPC-3) gene. The hyper-transmissible epidemic clone carried additional antibiotic resistance genes and hosted an additional plasmid. The clone from the LTCF did not demonstrate hyper-transmissible properties despite its presence in an institution of a type commonly plagued by the epidemic clone. Competition assays showed the more easily contained strain to be fitter. These findings suggest that neither the presence of the plasmid carrying the bla(KPC-3) gene nor relative survival fitness account for the hyper-transmissibility of the epidemic strain. The role of patient age in susceptibility to colonization by the epidemic strain should be investigated.","[Benenson, Shmuel; Warburg, Gabriela; Hidalgo-Grass, Carlos; Temper, Violeta; Moses, Allon E.; Block, Colin; Strahilevitz, Jacob] Hadassah Hebrew Univ, Dept Clin Microbiol & Infect Dis, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel","Strahilevitz, J (corresponding author), Hadassah Ein Kerem, Dept Clin Microbiol & Infect Dis, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel.",jstrahilevitz@hadassah.org.il,"Hidalgo-Grass, Carlos J/J-6488-2016",,Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [Morasha 1833/07],This work was supported in part by grant Morasha 1833/07 from the Israel Science Foundation to J.

In our benchmark case, each principal is matched with one agent of unknown type. In our second treatment, a principal can select one of three agents, while in a third treatment an agent may choose between the contract menus offered by two principals. We first show theoretically how different ratios of principals and agents affect outcomes and efficiency. Informational asymmetries generate inefficiency. In an environment where principals compete against each other to hire agents, these inefficiencies may disappear, but they are insensitive to the number of principals. In contrast, when agents compete to be hired, efficiency improves dramatically, and it increases in the relative number of agents because competition reduces the agents' informational monopoly power. However, this environment also generates a high inequality level and is characterized by multiple equilibria. In general, there is a fairly high degree of correspondence between the theoretical predictions and the contract menus actually chosen in each treatment. There is, however, a tendency to choose more 'generous' (and more efficient) contract menus over time. We find that competition leads to a substantially higher probability of trade, and that, overall, competition between agents generates the most efficient outcomes.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Cabrales, Antonio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Villeval, Marie Claire] Univ Lyon, CNRS, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Villeval, Marie Claire] GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, F-69130 Ecully, France","Charness, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",antonio.cabrales@uc3m.es; charness@econ.ucsb.edu; villeval@gate.cnrs.fr,"Villeval, Marie Claire/H-7773-2017; Cabrales, Antonio/AAC-1805-2020","Villeval, Marie Claire/0000-0001-8578-5449; Cabrales, Antonio/0000-0003-0209-0399",,,,46,12,12,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

However, there has been no discussion about how manipulating cooperation and competition could influence environmental action experimentally. The current study filled this gap in previous literature by manipulating cooperation and competition in a group of 155 participants and comparing their respective environmental actions. Participants were randomly placed into one of three conditions and primed by writing a short passage regarding a significant personal experience where they acted cooperatively, competitively, or neutrally. It was found that those in the cooperative priming group scored significantly higher on environmental participatory action than people in the competitive priming group. However, no difference was found on environmental leadership action. The results indicated that participatory environmental actions are relatively easier to change, as the threshold for interest in them is much lower than leadership environmental actions.","[Curtin, Daniel; Jia, Fanli] Seton Hall Univ, Dept Psychol, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA","Jia, FL (corresponding author), Seton Hall Univ, Dept Psychol, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.",danielcurtin85@gmail.com; fanli.jia@shu.edu,"Jia, Fanli/J-7368-2017","Jia, Fanli/0000-0002-7149-455X",,,,49,3,3,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2020,12,3,,,,,,,1249,10.3390/su12031249,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LB8SF,WOS:000524899604030,,gold,,,2021-09-30,

More intense competition corresponds to an increase in the number of firms or a switch from Cournot to Bertrand competition. We carry out experiments for two-stage games, where R&D investment choices are followed by product market competition. An increase in the number of firms from two to four reduces investments, whereas a switch from Cournot to Bertrand increases investments, even though theory predicts a negative effect in the four-player case. The results arise both in treatments in which both stages are implemented and in treatments in which only one stage is implemented.

The decision of whether to promote competition or equality is often debated in societies and organizations. With heterogeneous endowments, we let subjects collectively choose between a public good that most benefits the less endowed and a lottery contest in which only one individual in a group receives a prize. Unlike standard theoretical predictions, the majority of subjects, including a substantial number of subjects who believe that their expected payoffs are better in the contest, vote for the public good. Our data suggest that people's collective institutional choices may be driven by inequality-averse concerns.

These so-called killer viruses may provide competitive benefits to their host, but also incur metabolic costs associated with viral replication, toxin production and immunity. Mechanisms responsible for the stable maintenance of these endosymbionts are insufficiently understood. Here, we test whether co-adaptation of host and killer virus underlies their stable maintenance in seven natural and one laboratory strain of the genus Saccharomyces. We employ cross-transfection of killer viruses, all encoding the K1-type toxin, to test predictions from host-virus co-adaptation. These tests support local adaptation of hosts and/or their killer viruses. First, new host-virus combinations have strongly reduced killing ability against a standard sensitive strain when compared with re-constructed native combinations. Second, viruses are more likely to be lost from new than from original hosts upon repeated bottlenecking or the application of stressful conditions. Third, host fitness is increased after the re-introduction of native viruses, but decreased after the introduction of new viruses. Finally, rather than a trade-off, original combinations show a positive correlation between killing ability and fitness. Together, these results suggest that natural yeast killer strains and their viruses have co-adapted, allowing the transition from a parasitic to a mutualistic symbiosis.","[Pieczynska, M.

After a decade of co-circulation of genotypes VI and VII, genotype VII emerged as the single dominant genotype since 2001. To derive possible explanations for such epochal evolution dynamics, in vitro intergenotype growth competition experiments involving both co- and superinfection regimes were conducted. Coinfection of BHK-21 cells demonstrated abrupt loss in the genotype VI viral load with commensurate increase in the load of genotype VII as measured by the genotype differentiating ELISA, RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. The superinfection dynamics was shaped by temporal spacing of infection, where the invading genotype VII took more number of passages than coinfection to eventually overtake the resident genotype VI. It was speculated that such superior replicative fitness of genotype VII could have been a possible factor for the ultimate dominance of genotype VII in nature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Reduction of coffee growth and macronutrient content, except P that increased, started when the coexistence occurred with sourgrass plants in a density of 1 plant per plot. In general, macronutrient content was reduced by 18-50%, while growth characteristics were reduced by 9-41%, when coffee plants coexisted with 16 plants of sourgrass.

That putting teams into competition with each other can mitigate this problem is an important recent insight. However, we know little about how inequality in endowment between teams might influence this beneficial effect from competition. We address this question with an experiment where teams contribute to a public good that then determines their chances of winning a Tullock contest with another team. The boost to efforts from competition disappears when inequality is high. This is mainly because the 'rich' disengage': they make no more contribution to a public good than they would when there is no competition. There is evidence that the 'poor' respond to moderate inequality 'doggedly', by expending more effort compared to competition with equality, but this 'doggedness' disappears too when inequality is high.

Previous research has shown that, without competition, physicians deviate from patient-optimal treatment under payment systems like capitation and fee-for-service. Although competition might reduce these distortions, physicians usually interact with each other repeatedly over time and only a fraction of patients switches providers at all. Both patterns might prevent competition to work in the desired direction. To analyze the behavioral effects of competition, we develop a theoretical benchmark that is then tested in a controlled laboratory experiment. Experimental conditions vary physician payment and patient characteristics. Real patients benefit from provision decisions made in the experiment. Our results reveal that, in line with the theoretical prediction, introducing competition can reduce overprovision and underprovision, respectively. The observed effects depend on patient characteristics and the payment system, though. Tacit collusion is observed and particularly pronounced with fee-for-service payment, but it appears to be less frequent than in related experimental research on price competition.","[Brosig-Koch, Jeannette; Kokot, Johanna] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Hlth Econ Res Ctr CINCH, Essen, Germany; [Hehenkamp, Burkhard] Paderborn Univ, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Paderborn, Germany","Brosig-Koch, J (corresponding author), Res Ctr CINCH, Fac Econ & Business Adm & Hlth Econ, Berliner Pl 6-8, D-45127 Essen, Germany.",,,,"Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [BR 2346/2-1, SFB 901]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: BR 2346/2-1 and SFB 901",,52,4,4,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2017,26,,,3,SI,,6,20,,10.1002/hec.3583,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FT6WK,WOS:000423294300002,29285872,"Bronze, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-30,

Theory predicts that link costs lead to less competitive networks, with one link rather than two links, and that link costs do not affect the bargaining outcomes conditional on the network. We find support for the first but not the second prediction. 2-link networks form less frequently when there are link costs. Given that a 2-link network forms, however, a seller on average offers a smaller share of the pie to the buyers in the presence than in the absence of link costs. This impact of link costs can be explained by a disutility for (advantageous) inequality on the part of the seller. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We furthermore explored intrinsic motivation as a motivational mediator and trait competitiveness as an individual difference moderator of the effect of competition on brainstorming performance. Principal Results: Adding competition to a brainstorming task improved both the creativity (d = 0.371) and quantity (7.72 additional ideas; d = 0.563) of brainstorming in comparison to a control group. Trait competitiveness did not moderate this relationship, such that a person's competitiveness did not change the effectiveness of competition. Intrinsic motivation also did not mediate the relationship between the game element and performance. Major Conclusions: Competition, even implemented as the sole game element in gamification, can improve human performance. This effect in this study did not depend upon a population containing highly competitive performers. Furthermore, we argue that the primary motivational effect of competition must have either occurred via an unconscious influence (i.e., increasing amotivation) or by impliticly creating extrinsic rewards for increased effort.","[Landers, Richard N.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Collmus, Andrew B.] Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Williams, Hayden] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Landers, RN (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, 75 East River Pkwy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",rlanders@umn.edu,,"Landers, Richard/0000-0001-5611-2923",,,,68,7,7,2,18,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",1071-5819,1095-9300,,INT J HUM-COMPUT ST,Int.

Products such as Cola-Cola, Tide laundry detergent, and Chapstick lip balm are the prototypical products in their respective categories. For more than three decades, research in consumer psychology has accumulated evidence on how prototypicality influences memory, shapes the composition of consideration set, and affects purchase decision. Yet there is no research on how it changes the competitive behavior of firms in a horizontally differentiated market. For example, some prototypical products are priced lower than other products in their category, whereas in certain other categories the prototypical product is priced higher. We propose a novel model of spatial competition, where the prototypicality of a product influences the probability of the product being included in consumers' consideration sets without affecting its valuation. Using the model, we examine theoretically the impact of prototypicality on the pricing decisions of competing firms. Our analysis shows that when consumer valuations are low, the prototypical product is priced lower than a nonprototypical product and earns more profits. However, when consumer valuations are high, the rank order of the prices of the prototypical product and a nonprototypical product is reversed, but not the order of profits. We subject these predictions to an empirical test. The experimental results lend support for the qualitative predictions of the model.","[Amaldoss, Wilfred] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [He, Chuan] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [He, Chuan] Cheung Kong Grad Sch Business, Beijing 100738, Peoples R China","Amaldoss, W (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",wilfred.amaldoss@duke.edu; che@ckgsb.edu.cn,"HE, CHUAN/AAJ-2793-2020","HE, CHUAN/0000-0001-5053-245X",,,,28,7,7,2,35,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",0732-2399,1526-548X,,MARKET SCI,Mark.

The relationships between growth rate, survival, and temperature may thus be important for predicting biological responses to climate change. Although it is well known that growth rates and survival are affected by competition and predation in addition to temperature, the combined effect of these factors on growth rates, survival, and size structure has rarely been investigated simultaneously in the same ecological system. To address this question, we conducted experiments on the larvae of two species of damselflies and determined the temperature dependence of growth rate, survival, and cohort size structure under three scenarios of increasing ecological complexity: no competition, intraspecific competition, and interspecific competition. In one species, the relationship between growth rate and temperature became steeper in the presence of competitors, whereas that of survival remained unchanged. In the other species, the relationship between growth rate and temperature was unaffected by competitive interactions, but survival was greatly reduced at high temperatures in the presence of interspecific competitors. The combined effect of competitive interactions and temperature on cohort size structure differed from the effects of these factors in isolation. Together, these findings suggest that it will be challenging to scale up information from single-species laboratory studies to the population and community level.","[Nilsson-Ortman, Viktor; Johansson, Frank] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Nilsson-Ortman, Viktor] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, BE-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Johansson, Frank] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Nilsson-Ortman, V (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",viktor.j.nilsson@gmail.com,"Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020","Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",FWOFWO; KULeuven research fundKU Leuven; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas,"Financial support to R.

We experimentally examine how the level of internal conflict, and whether such conflict is transparent to other teams, affects teams' ability to compete vis-a-vis each other, and, consequently, market outcomes. Participants took part in a repeated Bertrand duopoly game between three-player teams which had either the same or different levels of internal conflict (uniform vs. mixed). Profit division was either private-pay (high conflict; each member received her own asking price) or equal-pay (low conflict; profits were divided equally). We find that internal conflict leads to (tacit) coordination on high prices in uniform private-pay duopolies, but places private-pay teams at a competitive disadvantage in mixed duopolies. Competition is softened by transparency in uniform markets, but intensified in mixed markets. We propose an explanation of the results and discuss implications for managers and policy makers.

Competition among proteins for binding to signaling hubs is often at the basis of the information transmission across signaling networks in every organism. Changes in affinity towards one or more partners, as well as changes of the relative concentration of the competing partners, can determine pathways alterations that lead to pathological consequences. Overall, the knowledge of the interaction hierarchy of the multiple partners to a single signaling hub can lead to new therapeutic strategies. Smith and Ikura (Nat Chem Biol 10:223-230, 2014) have recently proposed pairwise competition NMR experiments to determine the binding hierarchy in network interactions.

We propose an interpretation based on the existence or the nonexistence of a Nash equilibrium in the market structure used in the experiments. We show that the first experiments did not take into consideration this dimension. Therefore, their predictive power is greatly diminished. Subsequent experiments propose indeed a formal analysis of the existence of the Nash equilibrium. But the design protocols for these experiments lack uniformity. Thus, their results are hardly comparable. We conclude this article by preparing the ground for a future, uniform research.","[Parvulescu, Raluca] IESEG Sch Management, LEM CNRS 8179, F-59000 Lille, France; [Vaneecloo, Nicolas] Univ Lille 1, CLERSE, UMR CNRS 8019, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France","Parvulescu, R (corresponding author), IESEG Sch Management, LEM CNRS 8179, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France.",r.parvulescu@ieseg.fr; nicolas.vaneecloo@univ-lille1.fr,,,,,,120,0,0,0,12,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

However, much of the knowledge originates from empirical studies that examined the effects of competition. For instance, many studies were focused on the effects of the presence of herbaceous species on the development of tree seedlings or the decrease in individual tree growth with increases in stand density. Several models that incorporate competitive effects have been developed to predict tree and stand growth, but with simplified representations of competitive interactions. While these studies provided guidance useful for forest management, they contributed only partially to furthering our understanding of competitive mechanisms. Also, most competition studies were conducted in single-species stands. As competitive interactions occurring in mixed stands are characterized by a higher degree of complexity than those in single-species stands, a better understanding of these mechanisms can contribute to developing optimal management scenarios. The dynamics of forest stands with at least two species may be affected not only by competition, but also by facilitation or complementarity mechanisms. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms may provide insight into the relative importance of intra-versus inter-specific competition and whether competition is symmetric or asymmetric. Special attention to the implementation of field experimental designs is warranted for mixed stands. While traditional spacing trials are appropriate for single-species stands, the examination of competitive interactions in mixed stands requires more complex experimental designs to examine the relative importance of species combinations. Forest productivity models allow resource managers to test different management scenarios, but again most of these models were developed for single-species stands. As competitive interactions are more complex in mixed stands, models developed to predict their dynamics will need to include more mechanistic representations of competition.","[Larocque, Guy R.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Stn Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada; [Luckai, Nancy; Adhikary, Shailendra N.] Lakehead Univ, Fac Nat Resources Management, Thunder Bay, ON P7J 1B4, Canada; [Groot, Arthur] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Canadian Wood Fibre Ctr, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada; [Bell, F.

We examine how cognitive capabilities affect competitive performance, drawing on two constructs rooted in psychology and economics. A familiar one is analytic skill, the ability to solve abstract problems. To that, we add strategic intelligence the ability to anticipate competitors' behavior and preempt it. Using incentivized experiments, we measure the constructs in participants, then let them compete for cash in a highly competitive market. Although the market is designed to eliminate any advantages, whether from market structure or strategic resources, some profit much more than others. We trace performance differences to heterogeneity in analytic skill and strategic intelligence, and show how the two fuel superior performance, even against tough competition.Managerial summary: Why do some entrepreneurs outperform others? How can companies succeed against tough competition? Certainly, some benefit from unique resources, such as patents, and others can winnow competition, as through mergers. But some have entered highly competitive markets, lacking obvious resources, yet managed to achieve impressive success: think Under Armour, Wal-Mart or Home Depot. Here we test how advantage can stem from managerial cognition. We measure two kinds of cognitive skill in market participants, and then let them vie for cash in intensely competitive markets. Some end up with far more profit than others. Tracing the root of high performance, we find it is predicted by a combination of analytic skills, the ability to solve abstract problems, and strategic intelligenceability to anticipate competitors' behavior and preempt it.

Consumers arrive at the market one at a time and remain there for a single period. Each consumer compares the two simultaneously posted prices, one by each retailer, and then decides probabilistically whether to purchase the good from Retailer 1, from Retailer 2, or not purchase it at all. The competing retailers are assigned to one of three between-subject experimental conditions. In one condition they start each session with equal inventories and in two other conditions with unequal inventories. Following a short learning period, equilibrium best-response solutions, which serve as benchmarks for our analysis, account well for the mean posted prices; however, small but systematic deviations from equilibrium play significantly diminish the retailers' profits. These deviations decrease considerably in size with experience.","[Gisches, Eyran J.; Rapoport, Amnon] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Qi, Hang] Hubei Univ Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Becker, William J.] Virginia Tech Univ, Blacksburg, VA USA","Gisches, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",eyran@email.arizona.edu,,"Becker, William/0000-0002-4648-4122","National Foundation of China [71571132, 71431005]; China Scholarship Council ProgramChina Scholarship Council","Hang Qi acknowledges financial support from the National Foundation of China (No. 71571132, 71431005) and from China Scholarship Council Program.

Among females, far less is known. Recent nonexperimental studies suggest that women are intolerant of attractive females and use indirect aggression to derogate potential rivals. In Study 1, an experimental design was used to test the evolutionary-based hypothesis that women would be intolerant of sexy women and would censure those who seem to make sex too readily available. Results provide strong empirical support for intrasexual competition among women. Using independent raters, blind to condition, we found that almost all women were rated as reacting negatively (bitchy) to an attractive female confederate when she was dressed in a sexually provocative manner. In contrast, when she was dressed conservatively, the same confederate was barely noticed by the participants. In Study 2, an experimental design was used to assess whether the sexy female confederate from Study I was viewed as a sexual rival by women. Results indicated that as hypothesized, women did not want to introduce her to their boyfriend, allow him to spend time alone with her, or be friends with her.

This prediction requires that consumers (receivers) hold correct beliefs and, in equilibrium, make adverse inferences about non-disclosed information. Previous research finds that receivers are naive and do not sufficiently infer non-disclosure as bad news, leading to the failure of complete unravelling. This paper experimentally examines whether competition between senders increases unravelling and decreases receivers' naivety about non-disclosed information. We find that while complete unravelling fails to occur, competition between senders significantly increases unravelling and receivers' overall welfare. Receivers' welfare increases despite no significant difference in their guesses or beliefs about non-disclosed information relative to the treatment without competition, and this is driven by higher rates of disclosure by senders. We conclude that competition between senders positively affects disclosure of information and receivers' welfare. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that when Serratia marcescens evolve in multispecies communities, their growth rate exceeds the growth rate of the bacteria that evolved alone, whereas the biomass yield gets lower. In addition to the community effects per se, we found that few species in the communities caused strong effects on S. marcescens evolution. The results indicate that evolutionary responses (of a focal species) are different in communities, compared to species evolving alone. Moreover, selection can lead to very different outcomes depending on the community structure. Such context dependencies cast doubt on our ability to predict the course of evolution in the wild, where species often inhabit very different kinds of communities.","[Ketola, Tarmo; Mikonranta, Lauri; Mappes, Johanna] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Ctr Excellence Biol Interact, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Ketola, T (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Ctr Excellence Biol Interact, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",tketola@jyu.fi,"Mappes, Johanna/AAZ-3627-2021; Ketola, Tarmo/AAD-2609-2019","Ketola, Tarmo/0000-0001-5151-7980; Mappes, Johanna/0000-0002-1117-5629",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [278751]; Academy of Finland (Centre of Excellence in Biological Interactions)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [252411],"We are grateful to E.

Goldenrods (Solidago and Euthamia species) are considered among the most injurious invaders of grasslands in Central Europe. We tested the hypothesis that native grass species are able to outcompete the invasive goldenrods. A replacement series experiment was established to determine levels of interference between native grass taxa and goldenrods. In the experiment, four alien goldenrod species (Solidago altissima, Solidagocanadensis, Solidagogigantea and Euthamia graminifolia) and one native species (Solidago virgaurea) were studied. The native grasses were represented by Lolium perenne (forage and turf varieties) and Festuca pratensis (forage variety). Total biomass was higher in the mixture of species compared with that in monoculture. The higher total biomass was due to higher productivity of the goldenrod species, whereas that of the grasses was reduced. These results demonstrated the high competitiveness of alien goldenrods compared with native grass species.","[Szymura, M.; Wolski, K.; Swierszcz, S.] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Agroecol & Plant Prod, Grunwaldzki Sq 24A, PL-53363 Wroclaw, Poland; [Szymura, T.

On the premise that males of high genetic quality are more successful in sperm competition, it has been suggested that females may benefit from polyandry by accruing 'good genes' for their offspring. Laboratory studies have shown that multiple mating can increase female fitness through enhanced embryo viability, and have exposed how polyandry influences the evolution of the ejaculate. However, such studies often do not allow for both female mate choice and male-male competition to operate simultaneously. Here, I took house mice (Mus domesticus) from selection lines that had been evolving with (polygamous) and without (monogamous) sperm competition for 16 generations and, by placing them in free-ranging enclosures for 11 weeks, forced them to compete for access to resources and mates. Parentage analyses revealed that female reproductive success was not influenced by selection history, but there was a significant paternity bias towards males from the polygamous selection lines. Therefore, I show that female house mice benefit from polyandry by producing sons that achieve increased fitness in a semi-natural environment.","Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Sch Anim Biol M092, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia","Firman, RC (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Sch Anim Biol M092, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",rcfirman@cyllene.uwa.edu.au,"Firman, Renee/C-3256-2013",,UWA,This research was funded by a UWA Research Development Award and approved by the UWA Animal Ethics Committee (approval no. 3/100/299).,,45,17,17,0,32,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Since the pioneer Gause, many studies have used protist microcosm systems to study competitive exclusion. We explored a two-species system with the testate-amoebae: (Arcella intermedia and Pyxidicula operculata), where competitive exclusion is expected to occur. We determined their growth curves individually and under competitive interaction. We used a state-space model to represent system dynamics and calculated posterior population sizes simulating competition dynamics. Contrarily to our expectation, Arcella and Pyxidicula showed similar growth rates (1.37 and 1.46 days(-1) respectively) and only different carrying capacity (1,997 and 25,108 cells cm(-2) respectively). The maximum number of cells of both species when growing in competition was much lower if compared to the monospecific cultures (in average, 73% and 80% less for Arcella and Pyxidicula respectively). However, our competition experiments always resulted in coexistence. According to the models, the drop in growth rates and stochasticity mainly explains our coexistence results. We propose that a context of ephemeral resources can explain these results. Additionally, we propose generating factors of stochasticity as intraspecific variation, small population effects, toxicity of waste products and influence of the bacterial community.","[Ribeiro, Giulia Magri; Pereira Junior, Samuel; Porfirio-Sousa, Alfredo L.; Lahr, Daniel J.

Territorial damselfishes can influence the foraging patterns of roving herbivores by excluding them from their territories, altering the benthic assemblage. However, the impacts depend on the intensity of aggression and which taxonomic groups of roving herbivores are being excluded. Here we document the foraging activity of roving herbivores (Acanthuridae, Scaridae, Siganidae) and the extent to which they are subject to aggression by Pomacentrus adelus, the most abundant territorial damselfish in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. We then conducted experimental removals (220 m(2) plots on the reef flat) of P. adelus to examine its impact on roving herbivores and the benthic community structure. We hypothesized that the removal of P. adelus would lead to an increase in roving herbivore abundance and foraging activity and a decline in algal cover. The relative abundance (MaxN) and foraging activity (bite rate) of each taxa were examined pre and post-removal using video quadrats. The overall relative abundance of roving herbivores was not influenced by the removal of P. adelus. No changes in foraging patterns were observed for parrotfish, the family that received the highest rate of agonistic interactions, and rabbitfish. The removal of P. adelus resulted in a significant decrease in surgeonfish feeding, suggesting P. adelus alters foraging patterns indirectly through territorial maintenance and not aggression. The only measurable benthic impact of the P. adelus removal was an increase in sediment, while all other substratum types remained constant. These results indicate that P. adelus does not have a negative impact on all roving herbivores and instead may contribute to surgeonfish foraging indirectly through the removal of sediment. The generalisation that territorial damselfish reduce foraging rates of roving herbivores may not be applicable in all systems or for all species.","[Eurich, Jacob G.; Shomaker, Simone M.; McCormick, Mark, I; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Marine Biol & Aquaculture, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Eurich, JG (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Marine Biol & Aquaculture, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",jacob.eurich@my.jcu.edu.au,"Eurich, Jacob G./K-8598-2019; Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; McCormick, Mark/J-8301-2014","Eurich, Jacob G./0000-0003-1764-7524; Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; McCormick, Mark/0000-0001-9289-1645","Mahonia Na Dari Research and Conservation Centre; Walindi Plantation Resort; Australian Research Council through the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; College of Science and Engineering, James Cook University","The authors would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the Tamare-Kilu reefs for allowing access to the reefs, D.

I use a laboratory experiment to determine the effect of winning and losing in a competition on the willingness to seek further challenges. Participants compete in two-person tournaments in an arithmetic task and are then informed of their score and the outcome of the competition. Participants then have to decide on a performance target for a second round: the higher the target, the higher the potential reward, but participants who do not reach the target earn nothing. Conditional on the score, winning or losing is exogenous. I find that, conditional on first-round scores, losers go for a more challenging target. Losers also perform worse, leading to lower earnings and a higher probability of failure. These results are driven by gender-specific reactions to winning and losing: men react to losing by picking a more challenging target while women lower their performance. These findings could have important implications for our understanding of individual career paths. Early outcomes could alter the probability of success and failure in the long term.","[Buser, Thomas] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Econ, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands","Buser, T (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sch Econ, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.buser@uva.nl,,,niversity of Amsterdam through the Speerpunt Behavioural Economics,"The author thanks Jeroen van de Ven for invaluable discussion and for many useful comments.

We introduce a semi-anonymous experiment (the Social Strategy Game) designed to simulate resource competition among women. Information concerning dyadic social relationships and demographic data were collected to identify variables influencing resource competition intensity, as measured by the number of beads one woman took from another. Relationship variables are used to test how the affiliative or competitive aspects of dyads affect the extent of prosociality in the game. Using a mixed-modeling procedure, we find that women compete with those with whom they are quarreling over accusations of meat theft, mate competition, and rumor spreading. They also compete with members of their social network and with those who were designated as cooperative helpers or as close kin. Women take fewer beads from desired friends, neighbors, and from those viewed as enemies. We interpret favoritism toward enemies as resulting from fear of retribution. Our results suggest that social relations among women are multifaceted and often cannot be simplified by exclusive focus on genetic relatedness, physical proximity, or reciprocity. We argue that a complex understanding of cooperation and competition among women may require important contextual information concerning relationship history in addition to typical features of resource ecology.","[Rucas, Stacey L.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Social Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 USA; [Gurven, Michael] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Anthropol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Kaplan, Hillard] Univ New Mexico, Dept Anthropol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Winking, Jeffrey] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Anthropol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Rucas, SL (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Social Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 USA.",srucas@calpoly.edu; gurven@anth.ucsb.edu; hkaplan@unm.edu; jwinking@tamu.edu,,"Gurven, Michael/0000-0002-5661-527X; Kaplan, Hillard/0000-0002-7398-7358",NIA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [P01 AG022500-06A15556] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [P01AG022500] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,55,14,14,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1045-6767,1936-4776,,HUM NATURE-INT BIOS,Hum.

We present three experiments with a total of 1,570 subjects, ages three to 18 years, to investigate the origins of this gender gap. In a between-subjects design we find that boys are more likely to compete than girls as early as kindergarten and that this gap prevails throughout adolescence. Re-examining the behavior of 316 subjects in a within-subjects design two years later, we show that these gender differences also largely persist over a longer time period and can thus be considered stable. Controlling for subjects' abilities in the different tasks, their risk attitudes, and expected performance, the gender gap in the willingness to compete is estimated in the range of 10-20 percentage points.

Although studies have documented that the provision of these types of measures can benefit performance, theory from economic and accounting literature suggests that it may be optimal for firms to direct employees' attention to some types of measures by omitting others. In line with this theory, we find that relative performance information alone yields the best performance effects in our setting-that is, that a subset of information (relative performance information) dominates the full information set (absolute and relative performance information together) in boosting performance. In cross-sectional and survey-data analyses, we do not find that restricting the number of measures shown per se benefits performance. Rather, we find that restricting the type of measures shown to convey only relative information increases involvement in peer-performance comparison, benefitting performance.

The e-management system E-CHO has been developed at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Ljubljana, Slovenia and is already widely used in different educational, business and academic applications, however, this is its first use in control design. The system is used for the communication with the users and the performance of the remote virtual (simulated) and/or real-time experiments using a laboratory pilot plant. The environment allows testing, design and evaluation of various modelling and control techniques. The system has now been used three times as an e-learning and e-competition game in 2007/2008, 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 and has been accepted very well among the students. In students' opinion the idea of e-learning competition introduces a novel, alternative approach to the study, enables more freedom in work organization, increases learning efficiency and stimulates students' interest. Since the presented system is very adaptable, direct extensions are possible in the sense of virtual and remote experiments with different models and real pilot plants. (C) 2010 IMACS.

While previous research was mostly concerned with the influence of exogenous feedback mechanisms, this study considers the endogenous emergence of reputation through deliberate information sharing among actors and the role of barriers in hindering information exchange. Using a repeated investment game, we analyze the effects of competition and transfer costs on players' willingness to share information with each other. While transfer costs are a direct cost of the information exchange, competition costs represent an indirect cost that arises when the transfer of valuable information to competitors comes at the loss of a competitive advantage. We show that barriers to information exchange not only affect the behavior of the senders of information, but also affect the ones about whom the information is shared. While the possibility of sharing information about others significantly improves trust and market efficiency, both competition and direct transfer costs diminish the positive effect by substantially reducing the level of information exchange. Players about whom the information is shared anticipate and react to the changes in the costs by behaving more or less cooperatively. For reputation building, an environment is needed that fosters the sharing of information. Reciprocity is key to understanding information exchange. Even when it is costly, information sharing is used as a way to sanction others.","[Hoffmann, Roman] Univ Vienna, Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demography,VID OAW, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog,Global Human Capital,IIASA, Vienna, Austria; [Hoffmann, Roman] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Kittel, Bernhard] Univ Vienna, Dept Econ Sociol, Vienna, Austria; [Larsen, Mattias] United Nations Ind Dev Org UNIDO, Dept Agri Business, Vienna, Austria","Hoffmann, R (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demography,VID OAW, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog,Global Human Capital,IIASA, Vienna, Austria.",roman.hoffmann@oeaw.ac.at,,"Hoffmann, Roman/0000-0003-3512-1737","Department of Economic Sociology; Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [FWF: Z171-G11]; International Climate Initiative (IKI) - German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); Projekt DEAL","Funding for this work was provided by the Department of Economic Sociology.

While estimates from growth curves are simple and allow high throughput, they are inaccurate and do not account for interactions between costs and benefits accruing over different parts of a growth cycle. For this reason, pairwise competition experiments are the current gold standard for accurate estimation of fitness. However, competition experiments require distinct markers, making them difficult to perform between isolates derived from a common ancestor or between isolates of nonmodel organisms. In addition, competition experiments require that competing strains be grown in the same environment, so they cannot be used to infer the fitness consequence of different environmental perturbations on the same genotype. Finally, competition experiments typically consider only the end-points of a period of competition so that they do not readily provide information on the growth differences that underlie competitive ability. Here, we describe a computational approach for predicting density-dependent microbial growth in a mixed culture utilizing data from monoculture and mixed-culture growth curves.

Palfrey (1984) famously argued that if third candidate entry is expected after the two main candidates choose their platforms, the unique equilibrium is such that the two main candidates locate substantially far from each other. By conducting a laboratory experiment, we put this popular idea to test, for the first time. We allow entry to take place with four different probabilities and find that, indeed, the degree of polarization of the two main candidates' platforms increases as third candidate entry becomes more likely to occur, providing strong evidence in support of Palfrey (1984)'s formal results and underlying intuition.

This is favored because it promotes sperm competition, which decreases the risk to females of producing highly female-biased broods and to their offspring of inheriting the selfish gene. Here, we show that non-SR males in these SR populations evolved an increased ability to suppress female remating in response to the higher female remating rates, indicating male female coevolution. This occurred even though SR was rare in the populations. This was further supported by a correlation between females' remating propensity and males' ability to suppress female remating across populations Thus SR can generate sexual conflict over female remating rate between females and the noncarrier males that make up the majority of the males, promoting evolution of increased ability of males to suppress female remating","[Price, Tom A.

Nonetheless, unicellularity is ubiquitous, and there have been multiple cases of evolutionary reversal to a unicellular organization. In this article, we explore some of the costs of multicellularity as well as the possibility and dynamics of evolutionary reversals to unicellularity. We hypothesize that recently evolved multicellular organisms would face a high cost of increased competition for local resources in spatially structured environments because of larger size and increased cell densities. To test this hypothesis we conducted competition assays, computer simulations, and selection experiments using isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that recently evolved multicellularity. In well-mixed environments, multicellular isolates had lower growth rates relative to their unicellular ancestor because of limitations of space and resource acquisition. In structured environments with localized resources, cells in both multicellular and unicellular isolates grew at a similar rate. Despite similar growth, higher local density of cells in multicellular groups led to increased competition and higher fitness costs in spatially structured environments. In structured environments all of the multicellular isolates rapidly evolved a predominantly unicellular life cycle, while in well-mixed environments reversal was more gradual. Taken together, these results suggest that a lack of dispersal, leading to higher local competition, might have been one of the main constraints in the evolution of early multicellular forms.","[Rebolleda-Gomez, Maria; Travisano, Michael] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Rebolleda-Gomez, Maria; Travisano, Michael] Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Ctr Philosophy Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Travisano, Michael] Univ Minnesota, Inst Biotechnol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Rebolleda-Gomez, M (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",rebol004@umn.edu,"Travisano, Michael/AAI-4809-2020; Rebolleda-Gomez, Maria/P-2137-2019","Rebolleda-Gomez, Maria/0000-0002-3592-4479",Interdisciplinary Center for the Study of Global Change; graduate school at the University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System; Interdisciplinary Doctoral Fellowship; John Templeton Foundation; ICGC fellowship at the University of Minnesota; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1051115],"We thank Allison Shaw and everyone at the University of Minnesota biological theory group for advice on simulations.

Methods of fitness measurement are most accurate when incorporating an individual's survival and fecundity, as well as accounting for any ecological interactions or environmental effects experienced by the organism. Here, we describe a protocol for measuring the relative mean fitness of Caenorhabditis elegans populations, or strains, through an assay that accounts for individual survival, fecundity, and intraspecific competitive ability in the presence of a bacterial parasite. In this competitive fitness assay nematodes from a focal population or strain are mixed with a GFP-marked tester strain in equal proportions, the mixture of nematodes are then exposed to a parasite, and the relative competitive fitness of the focal strain is determined by measuring the change in the ratio of focal nematodes to GFP-marked nematodes after one generation. Specifically, this protocol can be implemented to measure changes in nematode host fitness after experimental evolution by determining the relative competitive fitness of evolved versus ancestral nematode populations.","[Penley, McKenna J.; Morran, Levi T.] Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Morran, LT (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",levi.morran@emory.edu,,,Emory University; NIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR),"This protocol was adapted from previous work (Morran et al., 2009; Morran et al., 2011; Morran et al., 2014; Parrish et al., 2016; Penley et al., 2017).

The design allows us to study and derive clean measures of different forms of counterproductive behaviour in a controlled but non-obtrusive manner. We ask participants to complete a specific task (identify euro coins) and to report their output. Participants can engage in various forms of counterproductive behaviour, none of them being offered to them explicitly. They can make mistakes in the identification task, lie in their report or even steal coins. We present an application of the design to study the effects of different pay schemes (competition, fixed pay and piece rate) on counterproductive behaviour. On average counterproductive behaviour amounts to 10 percent of the average productivity, almost all arising through mistakes and overreporting of output. We find essentially no evidence of theft. Moreover, we find that both productive and counterproductive behaviour are significantly higher under competition than under the two other pay schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Two environments are tested, in which the size of the spillover between advertising expenditures is varied. The results indicate that both degrees of collusion are correlated: a high degree of collusion on advertising functions as a signalling device triggering a significantly higher degree of price collusion by the opponent.

I argue that the lag in fungal community ecology was largely due to the microscopic nature of fungi that makes observing species and counting their numbers difficult. Thus the basic patterns of fungal occurrence were, until recently, largely invisible. With the development of molecular methods, especially high-throughput sequencing, fungal communities can now be seen, and the field has grown dramatically in response. The results of these studies have given us unprecedented views of fungal communities in novel habitats and at broader scales. From these advances we now have the ability to see pattern, compare it to existing theory, and derive new hypotheses about the way communities are assembled, structured, and behave. But can fungal systems contribute to the development of theory in the broader realm of community ecology? The answer to this question is yes! In fact fungal systems already have contributed, because in addition to many important natural fungal communities, fungi also offer exceptional experimental communities that allow one to manipulate, control, isolate and test key mechanisms. I discuss five well-developed systems and some of the contributions they have made to community ecology, and I briefly mention one additional system that is amenable to development.

It has been suggested that females benefit from polyandry when better-quality males are successful in sperm competition and sire high-quality offspring. Indeed, studies of experimental evolution have confirmed that sperm competition selects for both increased ejaculate quality and elevated offspring viability. Fewer investigations have explored whether these fitness benefits are evident beyond early life-history stages. Here, I used house mice (Mus domesticus) from selection lines that had been evolving for 25 generations under either polygamy or monogamy to test whether females preferred males from lines that had evolved with sperm competition. Males from the polygamous lines had previously been shown to achieve a fitness advantage under semi-natural conditions, deeming them to be of high genetic quality and leading to the a priori expectation that females would prefer males that had evolved with sperm competition compared with males that had not. Contrary to expectation, the data showed that sexually receptive females spent more time associating with males from the monogamous lines. This unexpected but interesting result is discussed in relation to sperm competition theory that predicts a trade-off between male investment in pre- and post-copulatory sexually selected traits.","Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol M092, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia","Firman, RC (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol M092, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",renee.firman@uwa.edu.au,,,Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,This research was funded by the Australian Research Council.,,25,6,6,0,47,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

Using a crowdsourced survey experiment with German participants, we find asymmetrical perceptual biases. Partisan respondents perceive negative campaigning from or about a party they favour, as less negative than non-partisans. The discounting effect applies particularly for voters with stronger preferences and for messages that are more strongly negative. Partisan preferences only weakly influence the perception of neutral or positive campaign statements. The discounting biases found for negative statements point at limits of negative campaigning effects in electoral contests. Different effects for weakly and strongly worded messages substantiate concerns that dichotomous approaches to negative campaigning could miss important variation in party communication and its effects.","[Haselmayer, Martin] Univ Vienna, Dept Govt, Rooseveltpl 3-1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Hirsch, Lisa] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Jenny, Marcelo] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Polit Sci, Innsbruck, Austria","Haselmayer, M (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Govt, Rooseveltpl 3-1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",martin.haselmayer@univie.ac.at,,"Haselmayer, Martin/0000-0002-7765-5158",Wiener Hochschuljubilaeumsstiftung [H-304565/2015],This work was supported by Wiener Hochschuljubilaeumsstiftung [grant number H-304565/2015].,,73,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,2474-736X,,POLIT RES EXCHANGE,Polit.

On the one hand, more active search behaviour may allow the animal to find patches with slightly better, or more, food; on the other hand, such active foraging is energetically costly, and thus may be opposed by selection for energetic efficiency. Here, we test these alternative hypotheses in Drosophila larvae. We show that populations which experimentally evolved improved tolerance to larval chronic malnutrition have shorter foraging path length than unselected control populations. A behavioural polymorphism in foraging path length (the rover-sitter polymorphism) exists in nature and is attributed to the foraging locus (for). We show that a sitter strain (for(s2)) survives better on the poor food than the rover strain (for(R)), confirming that the sitter foraging strategy is advantageous under malnutrition. Larvae of the selected and control populations did not differ in global for expression. However, a quantitative complementation test suggests that the for locus may have contributed to the adaptation to poor food in one of the selected populations, either through a change in for allele frequencies, or by interacting epistatically with alleles at other loci. Irrespective of its genetic basis, our results provide two independent lines of evidence that sitter-like foraging behaviour is favoured under chronic larval malnutrition.","[Vijendravarma, Roshan K.; Narasimha, Sunitha; Kawecki, Tadeusz J.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Vijendravarma, RK (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",roshan.vijendravarma@unil.ch; tadeusz.kawecki@unil.ch,"Vijendravarma, Roshan/E-9985-2013; Kawecki, Tadeusz/K-5466-2015; Vijendravarma, Roshan K/E-7746-2018","Kawecki, Tadeusz/0000-0002-9244-1991; Vijendravarma, Roshan K/0000-0002-3274-0682; Vijendravarma, Roshan Kumar/0000-0002-4930-3040",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission,"This work has been supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

We use the Big Five personality factors, where especially neuroticism has been related to performance in achievement settings. We first test whether scores on the Big Five are related to performance in our experiment, and second how this is related to incentives. We can show that the sex difference in the willingness to enter a competition is mediated by neuroticism and further that neuroticism is negatively related to performance in competiton. This raises the possibility that those women who do not choose competitive incentives know that they should not. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The approach has been further strengthened during the last decade with advances in modern computational chemistry. This allows for the calculation of a theoretical KIE that can often be compared directly to the experimental value. This combined experimental/theoretical approach can be particularly useful in cases where the value of the experimental KIE is not directly associated with one particular reaction step (e.g., in a catalytic reaction). The approach is highlighted by using recent examples from both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions, homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, and enzyme catalysis to illustrate the expected accuracy and utility of this approach.","[Christensen, Niels Johan; Fristrup, Peter] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Fristrup, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem, Kemitorvet Bldg 207, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",pf@kemi.dtu.dk,"Fristrup, Peter/A-7211-2008; Christensen, Niels Johan/J-3820-2014","Fristrup, Peter/0000-0001-7175-3796; Christensen, Niels Johan/0000-0001-9588-2656",,,,53,13,13,1,36,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0936-5214,1437-2096,,SYNLETT,Synlett,MAR,2015,26,4,,,,,508,513,,10.1055/s-0034-1380097,,,6,"Chemistry, Organic",Chemistry,CC0WI,WOS:000350059200014,,,,,2021-09-30,

Collectively, these techniques are continuing to provide fresh and important insights into the genetic basis of evolutionary change, and are now being employed to investigate mating behaviour. Here, we focus on how selection techniques can reveal the genetic basis of post-mating adaptations to sexual selection and sexual conflict. Alteration of the operational sex ratio of adult Drosophila over just a few tens of generations can lead to altered ejaculate allocation patterns and the evolution of resistance in females to the costly effects of elevated mating rates. We provide new data to show how male responses to the presence of rivals can evolve. For several traits, the way in which males responded to rivals was opposite in lines selected for male-biased, as opposed to female-biased, adult sex ratio. This shows that the manipulation of the relative intensity of intra- and inter-sexual selection can lead to replicable and repeatable effects on mating systems, and reveals the potential for significant contemporary evolutionary change. Such studies, with important safeguards, have potential utility for understanding sexual selection and sexual conflict across many taxa. We discuss how artificial selection studies combined with genomics will continue to deepen our knowledge of the evolutionary principles first laid down by Darwin 150 years ago.","[Edward, Dominic A.; Fricke, Claudia; Chapman, Tracey] Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Chapman, T (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",tracey.chapman@uea.ac.uk,"Edward, Dominic/B-4074-2010; Chapman, Tracey/E-5100-2011; Fricke, Claudia/M-6536-2014","Fricke, Claudia/0000-0002-0691-6779",Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/H008047/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/C510516/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"Thanks to Mike Bonsall and Brian Charlesworth for the invitation to participate in this discussion meeting; to the two referees and to Brian Charlesworth for their constructive comments; to the Royal Society and the Genetics Society for organizing the meeting; and to the Royal Society, BBSRC and NERC for funding.",,81,34,34,1,80,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

Protists are excellent experimental models for investigating fundamental and applied questions in ecology and evolution, but studying intraspecific variation remains a challenge due to a lack of molecular resources to aid in quantifying and distinguishing strains during experiments. Here we present a molecular method, quantitative microsatellite genotyping, to accurately quantify strain-specific frequencies from microcosm experiments of the marine flagellate Oxyrrhis marina, both between many pairs of strains and between strains in a multistrain mixture. We find that for pairs of strains, the method is effective for relative frequencies as low as 002 and with around 99% accuracy. The method is able to quantify four strains reasonably well, though less accurate than for pairs (range 92-97% accuracy). This makes accessible a cheap and easy-to-implement method for quantifying strain (or allele) frequencies and is suitable for use in a broad range of single-celled eukaryotes (protists) where copy number should correlate well with number of individuals (i.e. cells). This opens up the possibility of examining the role of intraspecific variation using experimental protist microcosms.","[Minter, Ewan J.

To confirm the hypothesis, seed-sowing experiments were conducted in a post-mined peatland, northern Japan. Seeds on three grasses (Rhynchospora alba, Moliniopsis japonica and Phragmites australis) were sown in four vegetation sites: bareground, R. alba grassland, M. japonica grassland, and grassland mixed with three examined species. R. alba is the earliest colonizer, and M. japonica and P. australis are the later ones. Seedling emergence, survival, growth and resource allocation were monitored for two growing seasons. The seedling emergence of all the species was lowest on bareground. The emergence of R. alba and P. australis was high in R. alba and mixed grasslands, but was low in M. japonica grassland. M. japonica seedlings emerged more in vegetation with moderate plant cover and litter. R. alba seedlings yielded the highest biomass on bareground, and the biomass decreased with increasing shading. R. alba did not change resource allocation of height to above-ground biomass between vegetation types. The seedling biomass of M. japonica was affected little by shading, probably because M. japonica adjusted resource allocation with shading. In the two summers, R. alba and M. japonica seedlings survived more when the neighboring seedlings emerged more. P. australis seedlings failed in overwintering. The seedling characteristics of each species explained the species replacement, i.e., R. alba invaded bareground and facilitated the establishment of late colonizer, M. japonica, by the shelter effects of the overstory and seedling.","[Egawa, Chika; Tsuyuzaki, Shiro] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan","Egawa, C (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",cegawa@ees.hokudai.ac.jp,"Egawa, Chika/B-8085-2014; Tsuyuzaki, Shiro/F-9090-2012","Egawa, Chika/0000-0002-4561-2137; Tsuyuzaki, Shiro/0000-0003-3010-8699","Japan Society of Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank A.

Sorption properties of native and acid-treated Sargassum muticum have been studied. Effect of pH, initial mercury concentration and contact time studies provided fundamental information about the sorption process. This information was used as the reference values to analyse mercury sorption under competition conditions. Saline effect has shown little influence in sorption, when only electrostatic modifications took place upon salt addition. On the contrary, if mercury speciation dramatically changed owing to the addition of an electrolyte, such as in the case of chloride salt, very large modifications in mercury sorption were observed. Competition with other divalent cations or organic compounds has shown little or none effect on mercury, indicating that a different mechanism is taking place during the removal of these pollutants. Finally, continuous flow experiments have clearly shown that a reduction process is also taking place during mercury removal. This fact is not obvious to elucidate under batch sorption experiments. Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis of the surface of the materials show deposits of mercury(I) and metallic mercury which is indicative of the reduction process proposed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It is hypothesized here that the entrant firm's home market profits influence the entrant's competitive behavior even when entry is costless and completely reversible. In the experiment, entrants and incumbents tacitly collude when each has its own monopoly market. In contrast, an entrant from a competitive market practices hit-and-run entry whenever such opportunities exist, forcing the incumbent monopolist to price at average cost. The experiment results suggest that the usefulness of hit-and-run competitive threat in a contestable environment depends crucially on the relative profits in the entrant's and the incumbent's home and entry markets.","Franklin & Marshall Coll, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA","Dasgupta, U (corresponding author), Franklin & Marshall Coll, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",utteeyo.dasgupta@fandm.edu,"Dasgupta, Utteeyo/AAX-6127-2021","Dasgupta, Utteeyo/0000-0003-4187-0494",,,,64,1,1,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The pegmatitic melts are synthetic and enriched in flux elements: 0.7-1.3 wt% Li2O, 2-5.5 wt% F, 2.8-4 wt% P2O5 and 0-2.8 wt% B2O3, and their aluminum saturation index ranges from peralkaline to peraluminous (ASI(Li) = Al/[Na + K + Li] = 0.8 to 1.3) with various K/Na ratios. Dissolution and crystallization experiments were conducted at temperatures varying between 700 and 1,150A degrees C, at 200 MPa and nearly water-saturated conditions. For dissolution experiments, pure synthetic, end member manganotantalite and zircon were used in order to avoid problems with slow solid-state kinetics, but additional experiments using natural manganotantalite and zircon of relatively pure composition (i.e., close to end member composition) displayed similar solubility results. Zircon and manganotantalite solubilities considerably increase from peraluminous to peralkaline compositions, and are more sensitive to changes in temperature or ASI of the melt than to flux content. A model relating the enthalpy of dissolution of manganotantalite to the ASI(Li) of the melt is proposed: a dagger H (diss) (kJ/mol) = 304 x ASI(Li) - 176 in the peralkaline field, and a dagger H (diss) (kJ/mol) = -111 x ASI(Li) + 245 in the peraluminous field. The solubility data reveal a small but detectable competitivity between Zr and Ta in the melt, i.e., lower amounts of Zr are incorporated in a Ta-bearing melt compared to a Ta-free melt under the same conditions. A similar behavior is observed for Hf and Ta. The competitivity between Zr (or Hf) and Ta increases from peraluminous to peralkaline compositions, and suggests that Ta is preferentially bonded to non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) with Al as first-neighbors, whereas Zr is preferentially bonded to NBOs formed by excess alkalies. As a consequence Zr/Ta ratios, when buffered by zircon and manganotantalite simultaneously, are higher in peralkaline melts than in peraluminous melts.","[Van Lichtervelde, Marieke; Holtz, Francois] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Mineral, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Hanchar, John M.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Earth Sci, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada","Van Lichtervelde, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Mineral, Callinstr 3, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",vmarieke@yahoo.fr,"Van Lichtervelde, Marieke/G-1020-2010","Holtz, Francois/0000-0002-2043-8603",German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ho 1337/20],"This work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG project Ho 1337/20).

However, less is known about the moderating role of external forces such as market competition. Our theory posits that competition generates two counteracting effects-the residual market and competitor response effects-that vary with competition and jointly generate a curvilinear relationship between PfP effectiveness and competition. Weak competition discourages effort response to PfP because there is little residual market to gain from rivals, whereas strong competition weakens incentives because an offsetting response from competitors becomes more likely. PfP hence has the strongest effect under moderate competition.

The simplest linear Lotka-Volterra competition equations (LLVCE) for S species require S-2 parameters to solve for equilibrium abundances. The same order of experiments are required to estimate these parameters, namely the carrying capacities (from monoculture experiments) and the competition coefficients (from biculture or pairwise experiments in addition to monoculture ones). For communities with large species richness S it is practically impossible to perform all these experiments. Therefore, with an incomplete knowledge of model parameters it seems more reasonable to attempt to predict aggregated or mean quantities, defined for the whole community of competing species, rather than making more detailed predictions, like the abundance of each species. Here we test a recently derived analytical approximation for predicting the Relative Yield Total (RYT) and the Mean Relative Yield (MRY) as functions of the mean value of the interspecific competition matrix a and the species richness S. These formulae with only a fraction of the model parameters, are able to predict accurately empirical measurements covering a wide variety of taxa such as algae, vascular plants, protozoa. We discuss the dependence of these global community quantities on the species richness and the intensity of competition and possible applications are pointed out.","[Fort, H.] Univ Republica, Fac Sci, Inst Phys, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay","Fort, H (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Fac Sci, Inst Phys, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay.",hugo@fisica.edu.uy,,,ANII-Uruguay [ERANET-LACRI2016-1005422],Work supported in part by ANII-Uruguay (SNI and project ERANET-LACR&I2016-1005422).,,15,0,0,0,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",1585-8553,1588-2756,,COMMUNITY ECOL,Community Ecol.,DEC,2018,19,2,,,,,199,202,,10.1556/168.2018.19.2.12,,,4,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV5ZA,WOS:000446184200012,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-30,

Competition participants were provided with a dataset collected from human-subjects experiments and were asked to develop an agent-based model that replicated behavioral patterns reflected in the data with the goal of using the model to predict behavioral changes in a slightly modified experimental treatment. The data were collected in a resource foraging experiment in which human subjects moved avatars on a computer screen to harvest tokens in a common pool resource. In the original experiments, on which the competition participants based their models, the subjects possessed full information about the state of the resource and the actions of the other group members sharing the resource. The competition challenged participants to predict what would happen if the experimental subjects had limited vision. Using only the data from the original experiment, participants had to design a model that would predict the behavioral changes that would be observed in the new experiment treatment. We compared the models on their assumptions about speed, direction, and harvesting decisions agents make. All the submitted models underestimated the amount of resources harvested.

A simultaneous experimental test of both mechanisms is however lacking. Here, we experimentally investigate how population dynamics and local adaptation to a new host plant in a model species, the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), are affected by dispersal from a stock population (no-adapted) and competition with an already adapted spider mite species (Tetranychus evansi). For the population dynamics, we find that competition generally reduces population size and increases the risk of population extinction. However, these negative effects are counteracted by dispersal. For local adaptation, the roles of competition and dispersal are reversed. Without competition, dispersal exerts a negative effect on adaptation (measured as fecundity) to a novel host and females receiving the highest number of immigrants performed similarly to the stock population females. By contrast, with competition, adding more immigrants did not result in a lower fecundity. Females from populations with competition receiving the highest number of immigrants had a significantly higher fecundity than females from populations without competition (same dispersal treatment) and than the stock population females. We suggest that by exerting a stronger selection on the adapting populations, competition can counteract the migration load effect of dispersal. Interestingly, adaptation to the new host does not significantly reduce performance on the ancestral host, regardless of dispersal rate or competition. Our results highlight that assessments of how species can adapt to changing conditions need to jointly consider connectivity and the community context.","[Alzate, A.; Bisschop, K.; Etienne, R.

The Hong Kong government overestimated post-1997-Handover mainland Chinese immigration and local births, creating excess capacity in many school districts. In 2003, with student enrollment falling to new lows (increasing cost per student), the government announced that it would close schools that were unable to recruit enough students. Since schools compete for students within their own district, the accidental excess capacity created closure threats that varied by district. Difference-in-differences analyses show that after initiation of this policy, student scores in heavily overbuilt districts were lower than scores in other districts and lowest in districts with the fewest students per class. Although closure threats were counterproductive for improving performance, the school closures eventually improved overall school quality, as typically, the lowest performing schools in each district closed.","[Joh, Sung Wook] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 151916, South Korea; [Chiu, Ming Ming] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Khoo, Lawrence] Chinese Univ Hong Kong Shenzhen, Sch Management & Econ, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Joh, SW (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 151916, South Korea.",chiu23@purdue.edu; swjoh@snu.ac.kr; lawrencekhoo@cuhk.edu.cn,,"Chiu, Ming/0000-0002-5721-1971","Institute of Finance and Banking at Seoul National University; Seoul National University; Institute of Management Research, Seoul National University","This work was funded by the Institute of Finance and Banking at Seoul National University, Seoul National University Research Grant (for Humanities and Social Sciences), and Institute of Management Research, Seoul National University.",,51,1,1,1,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Here, we used the model invasive plant Solidago canadensis to test a hypothesis that enhanced production of allelopathic compounds results in greater competitive ability of invasive plants in the invaded range rather than in the native range. We also examined the degree to which the allelopathy contributes increased competitive ability of S. canadensis in the invaded range. Methods We compared allelochemical production by S. canadensis growing in its native area (the USA) and invaded area (China) and also by populations that were collected from the two countries and grown together in a 'common garden' greenhouse experiment. We also tested the allelopathic effects of S. canadensis collected from either the USA or China on the germination of Kummerowia striata (a native plant in China). Finally, we conducted a common garden, greenhouse experiment in which K. striata was grown in monoculture or with S. canadensis from the USA or China to test the effects of allelopathy on plant plant competition with suitable controls such as adding activated carbon to the soil to absorb the allelochemicals and thereby eliminating any corresponding allopathic effects. Important findings Allelochemical contents (total phenolics, total flavones and total saponins) and allelopathic effects were greater in S. canadensis sampled from China than those from the USA as demonstrated in a field survey and a common garden experiment. Inhibition of K. striata germination using S. canadensis extracts or previously grown in soil was greater using samples from China than from the USA. The competitive ability of S. canadensis against K. striata was also greater for plants originating from China than those from the USA. Allelopathy could explain about 46% of the difference. These findings demonstrated that S. canadensis has evolved to be more allelopathic and competitive in the introduced range and that allelopathy significantly contributes to increased competitiveness for this invasive species.","[Yuan, Yongge; Wang, Bing; Zhang, Shanshan; Tang, Jianjun; Chen, Xin] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang Provin, Peoples R China; [Tu, Cong; Hu, Shuijin] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Pathogen, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Yong, Jean W.

By the former Forstlichen Bundesversuchsanstalt two experimental sites with spruce were installed after the recommendations for thinning trials, whereby the release of the central trees takes place in accordance with the programme after A-Values 4, 5 and 6. After approximately 20 years of observation clear diameter differences between the three treatment variants show up, gradated according to A-Value.

However, the indirect effects of such biological interactions are poorly known because of the difficulties in measuring predation risk in nature. We addressed this issue by assessing the effect of asymmetrical competition among brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and two superior non-piscivorous competitors, creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and white sucker (Catostomus commersonii), on the predation risk of a brook trout prey, northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos). We determined the spatio-temporal patterns of relative predation risk of dace with tethering experiments in 11 lakes containing either only brook trout and dace (n = 5), or brook trout, dace, chub, and sucker (n = 6). The diel pattern of the relative predation risk and the overall relative predation risk of dace were not significantly different in lakes with or without brook trout competitors. However, we observed a significant shift in the relative predation risk from the lower pelagic to the upper pelagic and littoral zones in the presence of brook trout competitors. This study highlights the fact that the outcome of interactions can vary in space and that care should be used when extrapolating the results of small-scale experiments or coarse-scale estimates to the whole ecosystem.","[Dupuch, Angelique; Bertolo, Andrea; Magnan, Pierre] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Interact Bassins Versants Ecosyst Aquat, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; [Dill, Lawrence M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Evolutionary & Behav Ecol Res Grp, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Dupuch, A (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",angelique.dupuch@uqo.ca,"Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019","Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163; Bertolo, Andrea/0000-0002-6018-816X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Canada Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs,"We thank Julie Adams, Maryse Blanchette, Come Garceau, Annie Jacob, Kathy-Andree Laplante-Albert, Maxime Leveille, Rachel Massicotte, Aurore Perot, Daniel Pouliot, Raphael Proulx, Evelyne Roy, and Sylvain Theleme for their assistance at various stages of this research as well as Daniel Boisclair, Laure Devine, and Jim Grant for their comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Specifically, we use controlled laboratory experiments to evaluate the differences in profits between a behavioral competitor (where a human places orders), and a management science-driven competitor (where orders are placed according to one of several plausible policies based on existing literature and managerial practice). Unlike the full-information game-theoretic models that assume rational decision-makers, these policies mimic practical situations by using less information and do not assume that their human competitors make fully rational decisions. Most prior literature focuses on non-competitive settings, where behaviorally biased deviations from optimal order quantities result in small expected profit losses. In contrast, under competition, we find that human decision-makers receive a substantially lower profit than the equilibrium expected profit, even as their competitors receive substantially higher profit.","[Quiroga, Bernardo F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago Rm, Chile; [Moritz, Brent] Penn State Univ, Mary J & Frank P Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ovchinnikov, Anton] Queens Univ, Stephen JR Smith Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Ovchinnikov, Anton] INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France","Quiroga, BF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago Rm, Chile.",bfquirog@puc.cl; bmoritz@psu.edu; anton.ovchinnikov@queensu.ca,"Quiroga, Bernardo F./W-2712-2018","Quiroga, Bernardo F./0000-0002-0465-0460",Pennsylvania State University's Smeal College of Business,"All experimental sessions took place in the Laboratory for Economics, Management and Auctions (LEMA) at Penn State.

Recently, there is growing evidence the congeneric invasive barred owl (Strix varia) may be responsible for the continued decline primarily by excluding spotted owls from their preferred habitat. We used a long-term demographic study for spotted owls in coastal northern California as the basis for a pilot barred owl removal experiment. Our demography study used capture-recapture, reproductive output, and territory occupancy data collected from 1990 to 2013 to evaluate trends in vital rates and populations. We used a classic before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental design to investigate the demographic response of northern spotted owls to the lethal removal of barred owls. According to the best 2-species dynamic occupancy model, there was no evidence of differences in barred or northern spotted owl occupancy prior to the initiation of the treatment (barred owl removal). After treatment, barred owl occupancy was lower in the treated relative to the untreated areas and spotted owl occupancy was higher relative to the untreated areas. Barred owl removal decreased spotted owl territory extinction rates but did not affect territory colonization rates. As a result, spotted owl occupancy increased in the treated area and continued to decline in the untreated areas. Prior to and after barred owl removal, there was no evidence that average fecundity differed on the 2 study areas. However, the greater number of occupied spotted owl sites on the treated areas resulted in greater productivity in the treated areas based on empirical counts of fledged young. Prior to removal, survival was declining at a rate of approximately 0.2% per year for treated and untreated areas. Following treatment, estimated survival was 0.859 for the treated areas and 0.822 for the untreated areas. Derived estimates of population change on both study areas showed the same general decline before removal with an estimated slope of -0.0036 per year. Following removal, the rate of population change on the treated areas increased to an average of 1.029 but decreased to an average of 0.870 on the untreated areas. The results from this first experiment demonstrated that lethal removal of barred owls allowed the recovery of northern spotted owl populations in the treated portions of our study area. If additional federally funded barred owl removal experiments provide similar results, this could be the foundation for development of a long-term conservation strategy for northern spotted owls.

Here, using techniques adapted from microbial experimental evolution, we investigate the evolution of tumour spreading - a precursor for metastasis and tissue invasion - in environments with varied resource supply. Evolutionary theory predicts that competition for resources within a population will select for individuals to move away from a natal site (i.e. disperse), facilitating the colonisation of unexploited resources and decreasing competition between kin. Results: After approximately 100 generations in environments with low resource supply, we find that MCF7 breast cancer spheroids (small in vitro tumours) show increased spreading. Conversely, spreading slows compared to the ancestor where resource supply is high. Common garden experiments confirm that the evolutionary responses differ between selection lines; with lines evolved under low resource supply showing phenotypic plasticity in spheroid spreading rate. These differences in spreading behaviour between selection lines are heritable (stable across multiple generations), and show that the divergently evolved lines differ in their response to resource supply. Conclusions: We observe dispersal-like behaviour and an increased sensitivity to resource availability in our selection lines, which may be a response to selection, or alternatively may be due to epigenetic changes, provoked by prolonged resource limitation, that have persisted across many cell generations. Different clinical strategies may be needed depending on whether or not tumour progression is due to natural selection. This study highlights the effectiveness of experimental evolution approaches in cancer cell populations and demonstrates how simple model systems might enable us to observe and measure key selective drivers of clinically important traits.","[Taylor, Tiffany B.; Wass, Anastasia V.; Johnson, Louise J.; Dash, Phil] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England; [Taylor, Tiffany B.] Univ Bath, Milner Ctr Evolut, Claverton Rd, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Taylor, Tiffany B.] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Claverton Rd, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Taylor, TB (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England.; Taylor, TB (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Milner Ctr Evolut, Claverton Rd, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.; Taylor, TB (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Claverton Rd, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",t.b.taylor@bath.ac.uk,"Taylor, Tiffany/V-4814-2019","Taylor, Tiffany/0000-0002-5274-7806; Dash, Phil/0000-0002-6029-4560",Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [F/00239/AL]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission [DH150169]; University of Reading studentship,This research was funded by the Leverhulme Trust (LJJ; F/00239/AL) and the Royal Society (TBT; DH150169).

This is particularly the case for communities with large species richness S since it is practically impossible to perform the S monoculture experiments (to obtain the species carrying capacities) plus the S x (S - 1)/2 pairwise experiments (required to estimate the entire set of interspecific interaction coefficients of the interaction or community matrix). However quantitative predictive tools are vital for understanding the fate of ecological communities. Here we derive an analytical approximation for predicting the relative yield total (or equivalently the mean relative yield) as a function of the mean intensity of the interspecific competition and the species richness. The rationale is that with incomplete information on model parameters it seems more reasonable to attempt to predict macroscopic or mean quantities, defined for the whole community of competing species, rather than making detailed microscopic predictions, like species abundances. This method, with only a fraction of the model parameters (carrying capacities and competition coefficients), is able to predict accurately empirical measurements covering a wide variety of taxa algae, plants, protozoa, etc. Our aim with this approach is to contribute in making community ecology a more quantitative and predictive science. We argue that such parsimonious modeling is preferable than more realistic/complex theories involving additional parameters which can be very difficult to measure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our work is highly relevant across many domains of social life where competitions are prevalent, as it is typical in a competition that the competitors are far outnumbered by these noncompetitors. In our field experiment involving pay-what-you-want entrance at a German zoo (n = 22,886), customers who were aware of a competition over entrance payments, but did not participate in it, paid more than customers who were unaware of the competition. Further experiments provide confirmatory and process evidence for this contagion effect, showing that it is driven by heightened social comparison motivation due to mere awareness of the competition. Moreover, we find evidence that the reward level for the competitors could moderate the contagion effect on the noncompetitors. Even if an individual does not participate in a competition, their behavior can still be influenced by it, and this influence can change with the characteristics of the competition in an intriguing way.","[Raghabendra, P.

Clonal growth by stolons or rhizomes enables plants to spread laterally and to share resources among interconnected ramets; therefore, clonal growth represents an important trait that likely affects the competitive ability of species. We tested the effect of different clonal growth forms on the relative performance of plant species in communities of the Jena Biodiversity Experiment over a ten-year period. Clonal growth form did not have a significant effect on relative performance in early stages of the communities. Surprisingly, none of the clonal growth forms gained dominance over time, but the species with long rhizomes generally performed slightly better than the other species, particularly in communities of low diversity. The stoloniferous species performed better in communities with a higher proportion of nonclonals, suggesting complementarity of the light exploitation strategies of stoloniferous and nonclonal species. Our re-sults show the importance of clonal growth traits for the competitive abilities of plants in the context of com-munity development, species diversity and community composition, as well as the necessity of distinguishing among different clonal growth forms.","[Duchoslavova, Jana; Herben, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Herben, Tomas] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic","Duchoslavova, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic.",vinsovaj@natur.cuni.cz; herben@site.cas.cz,,,Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [19-13231S],"We are grateful to Christiane Roscher, Alexandra Weigelt and Jitka Klimesova for the valuable comments on previous versions of the manuscript and to Jitka Klimesova for her fundamental help with identification of the clonal growth form.

The experimental data confirm that intra-play communication after capacity but before price choices fosters collusion only for capacity levels exceeding these thresholds. If communication is abandoned, prices nevertheless remain high.

However, conditions that favour altruistic dispersal also mediate selection for other social behaviours, such as public goods cooperation, which in turn is likely to mediate dispersal evolution. Here, we investigate - both experimentally (using bacteria) and theoretically - how social habitat heterogeneity (i.e. the distribution of public goods cooperators and cheats) affects the evolution of dispersal. In addition to recovering the well-known theoretical result that the optimal level of dispersal increases with genetic relatedness of patch mates, we find both mathematically and experimentally that dispersal is always favoured when average patch occupancy is low, but when average patch occupancy is high, the presence of public goods cheats greatly alters selection for dispersal. Specifically, when public goods cheats are localized to the home patch, higher dispersal rates are favoured, but when cheats are present throughout available patches, lower dispersal rates are favoured. These results highlight the importance of other social traits in driving dispersal evolution.","[Taylor, T. B.; Rodrigues, A. M.

Programs to control invaders are common but gauging the effectiveness of such programs using carefully controlled, large-scale field experiments is rare, especially at higher trophic levels. Experimental manipulations coupled with long-term demographic monitoring can reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of interspecific competition among apex predators and suggest mitigation options for invasive species. We used a large-scale before-after control-impact removal experiment to investigate the effects of an invasive competitor, the barred owl (Strix varia), on the population dynamics of an iconic old-forest native species, the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Removal of barred owls had a strong, positive effect on survival of sympatric spotted owls and a weaker but positive effect on spotted owl dispersal and recruitment. After removals, the estimated mean annual rate of population change for spotted owls stabilized in areas with removals (0.2% decline per year), but continued to decline sharply in areas without removals (12.1% decline per year). The results demonstrated that the most substantial changes in population dynamics of northern spotted owls over the past two decades were associated with the invasion, population expansion, and subsequent removal of barred owls. Our study provides experimental evidence of the demographic consequences of competitive release, where a threatened avian predator was freed from restrictions imposed on its population dynamics with the removal of a competitively dominant invasive species.","[Wiens, J.

However, these conclusions are based largely on studies of the song of male birds in north-temperate species. We investigate female song in a Neotropical wren, Thryophilus pleurostictus, using observations and experiments to test the function of female song. Female banded wrens sang much less often than males, their songs were shorter, and their repertoire of song types was smaller. Females did not seem to sing for same-sex competition for resources or mates: female song rate did not increase in response to simulated intrusion, and females sang in response to less than one-third of playbacks simulating territorial intrusion by either unpaired or paired females. Territorial defense is important for both survival and reproduction in species that occupy all-purpose territories year-round, but female involvement in territorial defense was limited. Females were more likely to approach simulated intruders when their partner approached more closely, and were closer to their partner during playback simulating a pair of intruders, perhaps contributing to defense jointly with their partner. Females did not appear to use song to attract males for mating: only 25% of females sang in response to playback simulating an unpaired male during the nest-building period, and they were less likely to sing shortly before laying when they were more likely to be fertile. Female song in banded wrens seemed to be used primarily for communicating with their breeding partner: female songs overlapped or began within 1 s of a song by their partner more often than expected by chance, and male vocal behavior changed in response to song by their partner. However, the low rate of female song in banded wrens suggests this function does not select for song elaboration, consistent with the view that same-sex competition is the main driver of female song elaboration.","[Hall, Michelle L.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Bldg 147, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Rittenbach, Maria R.

The performance deterioration from the first to the second stage allows to estimate the dishonesty in the unmonitored first stage (mostly in the form of being helped by the parents or older siblings). We also analyze dishonesty using a set of 3-4 problems that appeared in both tests. Contrary to much of the literature on gender effects in dishonesty, in our data girls were not more honest than boys. The sample consists of children in second to sixth grades, and we find that older children are significantly more honest. A stronger socio-economic level of the city was associated with more cheating. Children from religious schools tended to be more honest than children from secular schools. We also discuss other potential reasons for differences between performance in the two stages, such as pressure and stress, but conclude that they are secondary to the effects of dishonesty.

Information about ranking and income before the game is played varies across three different treatments. We find that competition per se does not affect the amount of contribution.

Non-necrotic PVYO-139, necrotic PVYN-605 and point mutated versions of PVYN-605 (PVYKRED, PVYKR and PVYED) were used in mixtures to inoculate two Nicotiana hosts which express (N. tabacum cv. Xanthi) or not (N. clevelandii) necrosis symptoms in response to infection by PVYN group members. The comparison during serial passage experiments of proportions of PVY genotypes produced in mixed infected plants with those of the inocula was used to describe: (i) complementation between PVYKR and PVYN and between PVYKRED and PVY genotypes: (ii) exclusion of the PVYKRED genotype, previously described as fitter, during mixed infections in the presence of one of the less fit PVYN, PVYED and PVYKR genotypes and (iii) the prevalence of the non-necrotic PVYKR genotype in the presence of PVYN parental sequence. These results indicate that the role of both A/G(2213) and A/C-2271 nucleotides in the fitness of PVY genotypes depends on other genetic information in the viral genome that has not yet been identified. Moreover, the collected data indicate that mutation of the nucleotide 2213 in the PVYN-605 sequence could lead to the prevalence, both in N. tabacum cv.

Laboratory studies suggest their impact may be further magnified in the presence of cues from predators. Despite their importance for ecological risk assessment, synergisms between pesticides and predator cues have not been confirmed under semi-natural outdoor conditions. We evaluated how the presence of predator cues and the presence of a non-corixid community affect the pesticide sensitivity of five water bug (Corixidae) species in an outdoor, multi-species container experiment. The experiment employed a full factorial design with two pesticide treatments, two predator cue treatments and two (non-corixid) community treatments (absence versus presence of Cloeon dipterum mayfly larvae, Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae and Physa acuta snails). The pesticide treatment negatively affected survival in Cymatia coleoptrata, and to a lesser extent, Sigara lateralis, but not in the other three Corixidae species (Hesperocorixa linnaei, Sigara iactans and Sigara striata). The addition of pesticides did not significantly affect body mass in the latter four species, unless combined with predator cues. To our knowledge this is the first report of this synergism under semi-natural, outdoor conditions. Neither lethal nor sublethal pesticide effects in the Corixidae depended on the community context, yet the presence of the non-corixid community when combined with predator cues reduced survival and body mass. Our results suggest that the here documented synergism between pesticides and predator cues may occur in nature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Several different empirical methods have been proposed for quantifying ND and RFD in order to make predictions about coexistence between pairs of species, yet it remains unclear which method(s) are appropriate for a given empirical study and whether or not those methods yield the same information. Here we compare six different empirical methods and provide a practical guide to help empiricists determine which method(s) are best for their study system. We show that there are important tradeoffs between mechanistic methods, which require detailed understanding of species' resource use and physiology but are more tractable experimentally, and phenomenological methods which do not require this detailed information but can be impractical for some study designs. Finally, we show that the methods do not always yield the same values and therefore we caution against future syntheses that compile these estimates from different empirical studies.","[Godwin, Casey M.; Chang, Feng-Hsun; Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Godwin, Casey M.; Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Godwin, CM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Godwin, CM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",cgodwin@umich.edu,"Chang, Feng-Hsun/AAY-6710-2021; Godwin, Casey/E-6892-2014","Chang, Feng-Hsun/0000-0002-8202-6364; Godwin, Casey/0000-0002-4454-7521",,,,78,3,4,5,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2020,129,8,,,,,1109,1127,,10.1111/oik.06957,,JUN 2020,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MS1LT,WOS:000539776900001,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-30,

We hypothesized that the dominant tussock grass Festuca rupicola negatively affects forb establishment in semi-dry grasslands where it has recently expanded into. Moreover, we expected that seedling recruitment is affected by grass density and seed size, with larger seeded forbs being more successful in areas of higher grass density. In a garden experiment, we sowed seven forb individuals of differing seed size (smallest to largest: Veronica spicata < Dianthus carthusianorum < Plantago media < Biscutella laevigata < Filipendula vulgaris < Scabiosa ochroleuca < Sanguisorba minor) into pots with zero, one, two and three grass individuals, and assessed germination, survival and growth over one year. As expected, increasing grass density negatively affected germination, survival and growth of forbs; however, contrary to our expectation, seed size did not influence any of parameters measured. The response of each individual species varied from zero or weak to strong with respect to grass density. Festuca rupicola therefore acts as a strong competitor against the establishment of forbs, irrespective of their seed size, and its spread lowers species diversity in semi-dry grasslands.","[Partzsch, Monika; Faulhaber, Maria; Meier, Tim] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot, Kirchtor 1, D-06118 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Partzsch, Monika; Faulhaber, Maria; Meier, Tim] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06118 Halle, Saale, Germany","Partzsch, M (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot, Kirchtor 1, D-06118 Halle, Saale, Germany.; Partzsch, M (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06118 Halle, Saale, Germany.",monika.partzsch@botanik.uni-halle.de,,,,,,69,1,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1211-9520,1874-9348,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,MAR,2018,53,1,,,,,103,113,,10.1007/s12224-017-9298-8,,,11,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,GB5RX,WOS:000429124900008,,,,,2021-09-30,

It moves beyond describing to what extent discrimination occurs by examining the role of individuals' interethnic contacts, education and religion in shaping their behavior towards ethnic minority job applicants. We derive expectations from theories from the interethnic attitudes literature. Data are collected via (1) a laboratory experiment in which student participants (n = 272) reviewed r,sum,s of fictitious applicants who varied regarding ethnicity, gender, education and work experience and (2) a survey amongst the same participants. During the experiment, participants assess applicants' suitability for a job and select applicants for an interview. Additionally, participants complete a questionnaire including questions on several personal and background features. Results show that individuals who have more positive interethnic contacts, higher educational levels and higher educated parents are less likely to discriminate against ethnic minority applicants. Individuals whose parents are church members are more likely to discriminate, as are males. We find interesting differences regarding the role of decision makers' features between different stages of the recruitment process. First assessments of applicants' suitability for a job are predominantly affected by applicants' features. Differences between decision makers here are relatively small. Eventual choices about which applicants to invite for a job interview, however, are affected by both applicants' and decision makers' features; here differences between decision makers are more pronounced. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.","[Blommaert, Lieselotte; van Tubergen, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Coenders, Marcel] Univ Utrecht, Dept Migrat & Ethn Relat, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands","Blommaert, L (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, Padualaan 14, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands.",l.blommaert@uu.nl,"van Tubergen, Frank/B-7885-2013; Coenders, Marcel/F-6812-2013; Blommaert, Lieselotte/M-9189-2019","van Tubergen, Frank/0000-0002-6415-2877; Coenders, Marcel/0000-0002-5625-2114; ",,,,73,9,9,0,67,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0303-8300,1573-0921,,SOC INDIC RES,Soc.

However, very little is known about possible adaptation responses of Campylobacter that lead to reduced susceptibility to organic acids. Here we investigated the adaptive responses of Campylobacter field isolates to organic acids and estimated the fitness costs. Methods and Results Exposure of two Campylobacter jejuni and one Campylobacter coli isolate to subinhibitory concentrations of propionic acid or sorbic acid resulted in twofold to fourfold increased minimal inhibitory concentration values for the adapted variants. With one exception, the decreased susceptibility was stable in at least 10 successive subcultures without selection pressure. Growth competition experiments revealed a reduced fitness of adapted variants compared to the wild-type isolates. A linear regression model allowed an estimation of the fitness cost. Growth kinetics experiments showed significantly prolonged lag phases in five of six adapted isolates while there was not a direct correlation in the maximum growth rates compared to the wild-type isolates. Conclusions The results of the study showed that a stepwise adaptation of Campylobacter to organic acids is possible, but at the detriment of changes in growth behaviour and reduced fitness. Significance and Impact of the Study The study contributes to the understanding of adaptive responses of Campylobacter to organic acids treatments, for example, as part of risk mitigation strategies.","[Peh, E.; Kittler, S.] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Food Qual & Food Safety, Hannover, Germany; [Seinige, D.] Lower Saxony State Off Consumer Protect & Food Sa, Wardenburg, Germany; [Valero, A.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Agrifood Campus Int, Cordoba, Spain; [Kehrenberg, C.] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Vet Food Sci, Frankfurter Str 92, D-35392 Giessen, Germany","Kehrenberg, C (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Vet Food Sci, Frankfurter Str 92, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",corinna.kehrenberg@vetmed.uni-gies-sen.de,"Valero Diaz, Antonio/K-6777-2014","Valero Diaz, Antonio/0000-0001-8597-0740",Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [IP5/01Kl1725C],This work was partly funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the framework of the consortium `PAC-Campy' (IP5/01Kl1725C).,,47,0,0,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-5072,1365-2672,,J APPL MICROBIOL,J.

To confirm this hypothesis and understand the role of these elements in C. barbinervis, we conducted a hydroponic split-root experiment using Ni and Co solutions. We found that the bioconcentration factor (BCF; metal concentration of each tissue/metal concentrations of each treatment solution) of Ni and Co did not significantly differ in the roots, but the BCF for Co was higher than that for Ni in the leaves. The leaves of C. barbinervis accumulated Ni or Co at high concentrations. We also found the simultaneous accumulation of Ni and Co by the multiple heavy metal treatments (Ni and Co) at high concentrations similar to those for the single treatments (Ni or Co). Elevated sulfur concentrations occurred in the roots and leaves of Co-treated seedlings but not in Ni. This result indicates that S was related to Co accumulation in the leaves. These results suggest that C. barbinervis distinguishes between Ni and Co during transport and accumulation in the leaves but not during root uptake.","[Yamaguchi, Tsuyoshi; Tomioka, Rie; Takenaka, Chisato] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Yamaguchi, T (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",yamaguchi.tsuyoshi@j.mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp; tomiokar@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp; chisato@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,,,,34,6,6,0,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1422-0067,,,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

Quota are often advocated as an instrument to reduce this gender gap, but it remains unclear at what step of the career ladder they more effectively foster women's reaching the top. Many factors may affect quota's success or failure, such as how they would in turn affect teamwork and trust between members within organizations or coordination in applying for promotions. In this paper, by means of a laboratory experiment implementing a two-stage tournament, we evaluate the impact of three different interventions in affecting individual decision to climb the career ladder, abstracting away from other possible confounding factors. We find that, compared with no intervention, a gender quota introduced in the initial stage of competition was ineffective in encouraging women to compete for the top; quotas introduced in the final stage of competition or at both stages increased women's willingness to compete for the top, without distorting the performance of the winners.

Our key interest is to better understand which of these two remedies is more effective at enhancing competition. Allaz and Vila (1993) theorized that forward markets can have a pro-competitive effect under linear production costs. Le Coq and Orzen (2006) and Brandts et al. (2008) investigated this and related issues experimentally. All three experiments (including ours) support the prediction by Allaz and Vila (1993) that introducing a forward market does indeed intensify competition. The results of the present study, however, differ from previous experimental results in that we find the forward market to be the more effective remedy. Brandts et al. (2008) increase the number of competitors by entry, which thus increases the aggregate stock of production assets and makes output cheaper. In contrast, we increase the number of competitors by divestiture, which leaves the aggregate stock of production assets constant. Our results address an important policy issue and provide tentative evidence on the competition-enhancing effect of forward markets, which can be considered a behavioral remedy.

Since numbers of plant invasions continue to increase globally, it is crucial to investigate the effects of multiple co-occurring alien species on native communities. Furthermore, priority effects due to the earlier emergence of certain species affecting fitness of later arriving species can shape community structure and affect native species performance. We investigate in a common garden pot experiment the interactions among five alien-native species pairs. First we focus on the effect of growing with either one or two alien neighbour species on a native plant, second we alter the arrival time of the alien or native neighbour by 3 weeks. Generally, native species performance decreased when surrounded by two alien species compared to only one, although the magnitude of this effect varied depending on species, with one species even performing better with alien neighbours than in monoculture. Species performance greatly decreased when arriving second in the pot, for both native and alien species. In contrast, alien species tended to benefit more from arriving early. Given that we studied annual ruderal species, their potentially lower competitive ability might explain why we detected negative effects of late arrival. We highlight the need to further elucidate underlying mechanisms of small-scale invasion dynamics to achieve generalisations concerning the response of multiple alien and native plants given their species-specific differences in response to neighbour species and arrival time.","[Ferenc, Viktoria; Merkert, Christian; Zilles, Frederik; Sheppard, Christine S.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany","Ferenc, V (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",viktoria.ferenc@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Ferenc, Viktoria/0000-0003-4116-0089; Sheppard, Christine S./0000-0002-7847-2310",Baden-Wurttemberg Stiftung within the Eliteprogramme for Postdocs,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Competition experiments between an allylic alkenyl alcohol and two substrates with differing chain lengths revealed that the allylic alcohol reacts 3-4 times faster in either case. Competition between di- and trisubstituted alkenyl alcohols provided an interesting scenario, in which the disubstituted alkene was consumed first followed by reaction of the trisubstituted alkene. Consistent with this observation, the transition structures for the migratory insertion of the aryl group into the di- and trisubstituted alkenes were calculated with a lower barrier for the former. An internal competition between a substrate containing two alcohols with differing chain lengths demonstrated the catalyst's preference for migrating toward the closest alcohol. Additionally, it was observed that increasing the electron-density in the arene boronic acid promotes a faster reaction, which correlates with Hammett sigma(p) values to give a rho of -0.87.

We show further that a self-competition experiment, where the DNA probe and competitor are chemically the same species, can be used as a complement to a direct titration to determine the fraction of protein that is correctly folded for specific DNA binding.

Herein, quantum mechanical calculations were used to predict the narrow experimental domain in which it is possible to detect the presence of an exotic ternary trihalogen anion, IAtBr-, and thus to guide a series of experiments. By analyzing the outcomes of competition experiments, we show that IAtBr- exists and can even predominate in aqueous solution. The equilibrium constant associated with the reaction At++I-+Br-IAtBr- was determined to be 10(7.5 +/- 0.2), which is in fair agreement with that predicted by density functional theory (10(6.9)). This system not only constitutes the very first example of a ternary trihalogen species that involves the element astatine but is also the first trihalogen species reported to predominate in solution. Moreover, we show that the oxidation number of At is zero in this species, as in the other molecules and anions that At+ can form with Cl-, Br-, and I- ligands.","[Guo, Ning; Sergentu, Dumitru-Claudiu; Teze, David; Champion, Julie; Montavon, Gilles; Maurice, Remi] Univ Nantes, Mines Nantes, IN2P3, UMR CNRS 6457,SUBATECH, 4 Rue Alfred Kastler,BP 20722, F-44307 Nantes 3, France; [Sergentu, Dumitru-Claudiu; Galland, Nicolas] Univ Nantes, UMR CNRS 6230, CEISAM, 2 Rue Houssiniere,BP 92208, F-44302 Nantes 3, France","Maurice, R (corresponding author), Univ Nantes, Mines Nantes, IN2P3, UMR CNRS 6457,SUBATECH, 4 Rue Alfred Kastler,BP 20722, F-44307 Nantes 3, France.; Galland, N (corresponding author), Univ Nantes, UMR CNRS 6230, CEISAM, 2 Rue Houssiniere,BP 92208, F-44302 Nantes 3, France.",nicolas.galland@univ-nantes.fr; remi.maurice@subatech.in2p3.fr,"Maurice, Remi/ABD-4413-2020; Montavon, Gilles/O-1225-2017; teze, david/F-3217-2016; Galland, Nicolas/AAB-8895-2020; Sergentu, Dumitru-Claudiu/Y-4857-2019","Montavon, Gilles/0000-0002-3049-0106; teze, david/0000-0002-6865-6108; Galland, Nicolas/0000-0001-5618-226X; Sergentu, Dumitru-Claudiu/0000-0001-6570-5245","French National Agency for ResearchFrench National Research Agency (ANR); Investissements O'Avenir [ANR-11-EQPX-0004, ANR-11-LABX-0018]; GENCI-CINES/IDRIS [2015-c2015085117]","This work was supported by grants funded by the French National Agency for Research with Investissements O'Avenir (ANR-11-EQPX-0004, ANR-11-LABX-0018).

At a larger scale, such asymmetry may also drive shifts in geographic distributions. The pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor) is an endangered Amazonian primate species with a small natural range. In recent decades further reduction of its range has been observed coincident with the expansion of the range of the red-handed tamarin's (Saguinus midas), which appears to be encroaching into the area otherwise occupied by the pied tamarin. Here we test if, at range boundaries, red-handed tamarin produces more aggressive vocalizations than the pied tamarin. We performed a series of 96 playback trials presenting both congeneric and conspecific long calls to sixteen groups of red-handed tamarins and fourteen of pied tamarins. We recorded their territorial, agonistic, alarm vocalizations, and the duration of their calling displays after broadcasts. In doing so, we assessed whether agonistic displays were more likely to occur in response to congeneric than conspecific calls in areas of sympatry. We found that the red-handed tamarin was more likely to emit more territorial calls when listening to pied tamarins than to its own species in sympatric areas, but found no differences in vocal responses from either species in relation to agonistic calls or duration of display in sympatric and allopatric areas. Furthermore, the red-handed tamarin emitted more alarm calls when listening to pied tamarin, independently of the geographic circumstances. Overall, we found that acoustic displays may be mediating species interaction in areas of sympatry. Together, these observations are suggestive of behavioral interference, including the competitive displacement of pied tamarin by red-handed tamarins.","[Sobroza, Tainara, V; Barnett, Adrian P.

I conducted two playback experiments to measure interspecific aggression between two sympatric Australo-Papuan robin species that inhabit the understorey of montane New Guinean forests: Slaty Robin Peneothello cyanus and Ashy Robin Heteromyias albispecularis. The first experiment, at a location where both species were present, demonstrated strong asymmetric interspecific aggression; the larger Ashy Robin responded as aggressively to Slaty Robin playback as to conspecific playback, but Slaty Robins did not respond to Ashy Robin playback. In contrast, in the second experiment, which took place at a nearby site where Slaty Robins were absent, Ashy Robins did not respond aggressively to Slaty Robin playback. Thus, Ashy Robin interspecific aggression appears to be a learned response to the presence of Slaty Robins, and may reflect resource competition between these two sympatric species.","[Freeman, Benjamin G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Freeman, Benjamin G.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY USA","Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA.; Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY USA.",bgf27@cornell.edu,,,Athena Fund of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology; Atkinson Sustainable Biodiversity Fund; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [2011083591],"I thank many YUS residents, A.

There has been considerable debate on the importance of competition in ecological communities, but its importance in structuring ant assemblages has often been uncritically accepted. Here, we briefly review field experiments examining competition in ant assemblages and use a removal experiment to test the effect of the classical territorial dominant ant, Formica aquilonia. Ants of this species group are thought to structure communities through a dominance hierarchy. 2. First, we used pitfall traps to compare the abundance of other ants in replicated sites with low and high densities of F. aquilonia. We found differences in community composition, in particular, Camponotus herculeanus was more common in low-density sites, in accordance with predictions. Differences in ant assemblages were not owing to differences in measured habitat variables. 3. We removed F. aquilonia from a set of high-density sites, using physical and chemical methods, and repeated these procedures at procedural control sites. One year after removal, abundances of F. aquilonia at removal sites were similar to those at low-density sites. However, the composition of other species did not change in response to F. aquilonia removal. Replication rates were identical in the mensurative and experimental components of this study, so this is unlikely to be owing to the analysis being insufficiently powerful. 4. We suggest three possibilities for the lack of difference. First, the study may have been too short term or small scale to detect differences. However, previous studies have shown effects on smaller spatial- and temporal-scales. Second, priority effects may be important in the successful colonisation by F. aquilonia. Thirdly, boreal ant assemblages may be too depauperate for redundancy in ecological roles and for competition to play an important structuring role. 5. We thus recommend that long-term large-scale experiments be considered essential if we are to distinguish between competing hypotheses in community ecology.","[Gibb, Heloise] La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Gibb, Heloise; Johansson, Therese] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Gibb, H (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",h.gibb@latrobe.edu.au,"Gibb, Heloise/B-8338-2013","Gibb, Heloise/0000-0001-7194-0620; Johansson, Therese/0000-0002-5864-2669",Formas (the Swedish Research Council)Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas,"We thank Ake Nordstrom, Melanie Monroe, Jenny Landin, Jon Andersson, Tim Dempster and Ylva Nordstrom for their valuable help with fieldwork.

Pennisetum setaceum is an invasive perennial grass found along roadsides and other disturbed sites in South Africa. The performance of this grass in response to competition, habitat characteristics and resources was experimentally tested in three biomes (Karoo, Fynbos and Savanna) of South Africa. A total of 846 young P. setaceum seedlings were translocated to study sites in May 2007. The seedlings were grown in 94 plots along random transects, of which alternate halves were cleared of vegetation. Despite a variety of environmental hazards at these sites, over 30% of the transplanted seedlings survived over 15 months. Competition from resident vegetation was a major factor limiting the establishment of seedlings. However, under adequate rainfall and historical disturbance (mine dump), competition effects were overridden. Survival of seedlings was greatest in the Karoo National Park, possibly because of summer rainfall that occurred shortly after translocation. Despite differences in the survival and growth rates, seedlings remained alive at all sites, especially if they survived the first six months after translocation. P. setaceum is capable of persisting across a broad range of environmental conditions. Management efforts should aim to reduce seed production and establishment along roadsides that act as conduits into protected sites. This could be best achieved by maintaining as much indigenous cover along road verges as possible, as seeds survive best where competition is low. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, empirical evidence in global change experiments is lacking to support this prediction. Here, we present findings from an 8-year long-term global change experiment with warming and altered precipitation manipulation (double and halved amount). First, we observed a temporal shift in species composition over 8 years, resulting in a transition from an annual C-3-dominant plant community to a perennial C-4-dominant plant community. This successional transition was independent of any experimental treatments. During the successional transition, the response of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) to precipitation addition magnified from neutral to +45.3%, while the response to halved precipitation attenuated substantially from -17.6% to neutral. However, warming did not affect ANPP in either state. The findings further reveal that the time-dependent climate sensitivity may be regulated by successional change in species composition, highlighting the importance of vegetation dynamics in regulating the response of ecosystem productivity to precipitation change.","[Shi, Zheng; Xu, Xia] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Co Innovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern Chin, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shi, Zheng; Wilcox, Kevin R.; Souza, Lara; Yuan, Mengting; Guo, Xue; Wu, Liyou; Zhou, Jizhong] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Lin, Yang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jiang, Lifen; Jung, Chang Gyo; Luo, Yiqi] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Jiang, Jiang] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry South, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Ecol Restorat Ji, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Mengting; Wu, Liyou; Zhou, Jizhong] Univ Oklahoma, Inst Environm Genom, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Guo, Xue] Cent South Univ, Sch Minerals Proc & Bioengn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jizhong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jizhong] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci, Berkeley, CA USA","Shi, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Co Innovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern Chin, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zheng.shi@ou.edu,"Jiang, Jiang/H-1080-2012; Lin, Yang/E-4079-2010; 吴, 昊/AAB-1620-2020; Wilcox, Kevin/D-7281-2013","Jiang, Jiang/0000-0001-5058-8664; Lin, Yang/0000-0001-7923-0789; shi, zheng/0000-0002-5067-9977; Wilcox, Kevin/0000-0001-6829-1148; Jung, Chang Gyo/0000-0002-9845-7732","United States Department of Energy, Biological Systems Research on the Role of Microbial Communities in Carbon Cycling ProgramUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0004601, DE-SC0010715]; US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0743778, DEB 0840964, DBI 0850290, EPS 0919466]; Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Oklahoma","This study is financially supported by the United States Department of Energy, Biological Systems Research on the Role of Microbial Communities in Carbon Cycling Program (DE-SC0004601 and DE-SC0010715), by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) (DEB 0743778, DEB 0840964, DBI 0850290, and EPS 0919466), and by the Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Oklahoma.",,57,10,12,1,106,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Our analysis shows how these equilibrium configurations depend on the relative interests in power (resp., ideology) and the uncertainty about voters' preferences.

We conduct seven different treatments of such markets, varying the number of firms, demand rationing, subject matching, and subjects' knowledge about the market mechanism. We find that only the number of firms has a persistent effect on capacity choices, whereas price choices are affected by both the number of firms and the rationing scheme. From the outset, subjects in the high-knowledge condition behave in the same way as subjects with low knowledge do in later periods after gaining experience. In all treatments, conduct is more competitive than the Cournot outcome, irrespective of the Nash equilibrium prediction. Nevertheless, the Cournot model does pack some predictive power. Under efficient demand rationing where the Cournot outcome is predicted, exact Cournot choices are more likely for both capacities and prices.","[Jacobs, Martin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany","Jacobs, M (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",jacobs@economics.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

However, how one quantifies the outcome of competitive interactions is frequently debated. Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of the target-neighbor design, a type of additive design where one of the competing species is reduced to a single individual and where controls and analyses are used for the target, but not for the neighbors. We conducted a literature review to determine how the target-neighbor design has been typically used and analyzed. We found that historically, targets were often smaller than neighbors and introduced after neighbor establishment; thus, targets would have little effect on neighbors. However, as co-establishment of targets and neighbors of similar size is now common, the target is more likely to affect the neighbors than in its earlier usage. This can be problematic, because if targets have a significant effect on neighbor performance, bias is introduced into the assessment of the target results. As target treatment controls are necessary to determine the absolute effect of neighbors on target growth, we advocate that analysis of the neighbor competitive response serves as a necessary control for unexpected target x neighbor interactions.","[Barry, Kevin J.; Dudash, Michele R.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Barry, Kevin J.] W Virginia Univ, Dept Biol, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Barry, KJ (corresponding author), W Virginia Univ, Dept Biol, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",kevin.barry@mail.wvu.edu,,,Blandy Experimental Farm Graduate Research Award; Washington Biologists' Field Club,"The authors thank Renee Poutous Barry and Stephen Murphy for research assistance We thank Richard Reynolds, Charlie Fenster, David Inouye, Iry Forseth, Frank Stearns, and Abby Kula for comments on the manuscript.

However, defining the range of environmental conditions suitable for the most severely endangered species is challenging, since few wild populations remain for study. Experimental reintroductions of these species can achieve multiple conservation goals by improving our understanding of habitat and management requirements while simultaneously establishing new populations. We demonstrate this with Arenaria paludicola, a critically endangered wetland plant species now known from a single wild population in coastal California. Before transplanting, we tested salinity tolerance in the greenhouse, and found tolerance of a broader range of soils than expected based on the current distribution. We then transplanted A. paludicola in three different habitat types, with and without neighbor removal. Success of A. paludicola transplants differed dramatically between the three habitat types, indicating the importance of variation at the habitat and microhabitat level. The best practices for transplant management are context-dependent: neighbor removal may promote the growth of A. paludicola, but neighbors may also facilitate transplant establishment in unstable substrates. After one year, A. paludicola continued to thrive in habitats dominated by Oenanthe sarmentosa with open canopies and moist soil. This habitat differs from that of the remaining wild population. Our discovery of an additional habitat type suitable for A. paludicola will allow more effective selection of future transplant sites.","[Bontrager, Megan; Webster, Kelsey; Parker, Ingrid M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Elvin, Mark] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Ventura Off, Ventura, CA 93003 USA","Bontrager, M (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, 3529-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",mgbontrager@gmail.com,"Parker, Ingrid M./ABH-2014-2020","Parker, Ingrid M./0000-0002-4847-1827",United States Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service,"We would like to thank Connie Rutherford of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Tim Hyland of California State Parks, and Jim Velzy and Denise Polk from the University of California, Santa Cruz greenhouses, and Chris Muir for statistical advice.

For simultaneous hermaphrodites with sperm competition, including Serranus tortugarum a small coral reef fish, proportional male allocation (testis in total gonad) is often greater where local density or mating group size is higher. We tested whether S. tortugarum reduced male allocation when transplanted from a higher density site to a lower density site. After 4 months, transplants mirrored the sex-allocation patterns of the resident population on their new reef. Transplants had significantly lower male allocation than representatives from their source population, largely as a result of reduced testis mass relative to body size.","[Hart, M.

F. Schultz, Myosotis palustris (L.) L. subsp. laxiflora (Reichenb.) Schubler et Martens, and Myosotis nemorosa Besser) in a 3-year reciprocal transplant experiment. Plants from two populations of each species were transplanted into five experimental localities where one of the three Myosotis species was resident. Young plants were planted into three types of competitive microsites as follows: gap, sparse vegetation, and dense vegetation. The experiment demonstrated differences among the species. It also showed large differences among populations within a species. The relative success of the species differed among individual localities and among different microsites, and the favorableness of microsites differed among localities. The Myosotis species typically had an advantage in localities where the species was resident. Myosotis caespitosa exhibited the highest mortality of its clones, particularly under competition, which corresponds well to its habitat preferences (disturbed and short-term sites), but it also exhibited the ability to spread in gaps by secondary rosettes. Myosotis palustris subsp. laxiflora spreads best clonally, but its clonal spread was most suppressed by competition. This was consistent with its ability to colonize quickly vegetation-free sites along water, but with weak competitiveness in later stages of succession. Myosotis nemorosa exhibited the highest survival rate, which fits with its preference for permanent wet grasslands.","[Koutecka, Eva; Leps, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Koutecka, Eva] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic; [Leps, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Ctr Biol, Inst Entomol, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Leps, J (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Branisovska 31, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",eva.egi@seznam.cz; suspa@prf.jcu.cz,"Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013","Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Koutecka, Eva/0000-0001-9012-6093", [GACR 206/09/1471];  [LC 06073],The study was supported by grants GACR 206/09/1471 and LC 06073.

The IPD-MD game enables group members to make a costly contribution to either a within-group pool that benefits fellow ingroup members, or a between-group pool, which, in addition, harms outgroup members. We found that when group members were put in a disadvantaged position, either by previous actions of the outgroup (Experiment 1) or by random misfortune (Experiment 2), they contributed substantially more to the competitive between-group pool. This destructive behavior both minimized inequality between the groups and reduced collective efficiency. Our results underscore the conditions that lead group members to care about relative (rather than absolute) group outcomes and highlight the need to differentiate between the motivation to get ahead and the motivation not to fall behind: the latter, it appears, is what motivates individual participation in destructive intergroup competition.","[Halevy, Nir] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Management & Org, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Halevy, Nir] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cohen, Taya R.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Bornstein, Gary] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Psychol, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Bornstein, Gary] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Study Rat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel","Halevy, N (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Management & Org, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",n-halevy@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Cohen, Taya R./F-7505-2012","Cohen, Taya R./0000-0001-7325-793X",,,,65,37,42,4,54,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1368-4302,,,GROUP PROCESS INTERG,Group Process Intergroup Relat.,NOV,2010,13,6,,,SI,,685,700,,10.1177/1368430210371639,,,16,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,672KQ,WOS:000283582300002,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-30,

This assumption is questioned in non-complexing and non-reductive aqueous solutions by means of high-pressure anion-exchange chromatography. Contrary to what is usually believed, astatide is found to be a minor species at pH=11. A different species, which also bears a single negative charge, becomes predominant when the pH is increased beyond 7. Using competition experiments, an equilibrium constant value of 10(-6.9) has been determined for the formation of this species from AtO(OH) with the exchange of one proton. The identification of this species, AtO(OH)(2)(-), is achieved through relativistic quantum mechanical calculations, which rule out the significant formation of the AtO2- species, while leading to a hydrolysis constant of AtO(OH) in excellent agreement with experiment when the AtO(OH)(2)(-) species is considered. Beyond the completion of the Pourbaix diagram of astatine, this new information is of interest for the development of At-211 radiolabeling protocols.","[Sergentu, Dumitru-Claudiu; Teze, David; Sabatie-Gogova, Andrea; Guo, Ning; Maurice, Remi; Champion, Julie; Montavon, Gilles] Univ Nantes, EMN Nantes, SUBATECH,IN2P3, EMN Nantes,UMR CNRS 6457, 4 Rue Alfred Kastler,BP 20722, F-44307 Nantes 3, France; [Sergentu, Dumitru-Claudiu; Teze, David; Bassal, Fadel; Deniaud, David; Galland, Nicolas] Univ Nantes, CEISAM, CNRS, UMR 6230, 2 Rue Houssiniere,BP 92208, F-44322 Nantes 3, France; [Alliot, Cyrille] 1 Rue Aronnax,CS 10112, F-44817 St Herblain, France; [Da Silva, Isidro] CNRS, CEMHTI, UPR 3079, Site Cyclotron CS30058 3 Rue Ferolerie, F-45071 Orleans 2, France","Montavon, G (corresponding author), Univ Nantes, EMN Nantes, SUBATECH,IN2P3, EMN Nantes,UMR CNRS 6457, 4 Rue Alfred Kastler,BP 20722, F-44307 Nantes 3, France.; Galland, N (corresponding author), Univ Nantes, CEISAM, CNRS, UMR 6230, 2 Rue Houssiniere,BP 92208, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",nicolas.galland@univ-nantes.fr; gilles.montavon@subatech.in2p3.fr,"Maurice, Remi/ABD-4413-2020; teze, david/F-3217-2016; Sergentu, Dumitru-Claudiu/Y-4857-2019; Montavon, Gilles/O-1225-2017; Galland, Nicolas/AAB-8895-2020","teze, david/0000-0002-6865-6108; Sergentu, Dumitru-Claudiu/0000-0001-6570-5245; Montavon, Gilles/0000-0002-3049-0106; Galland, Nicolas/0000-0001-5618-226X; Maurice, Remi/0000-0003-2889-6518; Champion, Julie/0000-0002-6683-3334; BASSAL, Fadel/0000-0001-6372-3925","French National Agency for ResearchFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-2010-BLAN-0807]; Investissements d'AvenirFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-EQPX-0004, ANR-11-LABX-0018]; Region Pays de la Loire (NUCSAN project)Region Pays de la Loire; GENCI-CINES/IDRIS grant [2015-c2015085117]","This work was supported by grants funded by the French National Agency for Research (ANR-2010-BLAN-0807), with Investissements d'Avenir (ANR-11-EQPX-0004, ANR-11-LABX-0018), and by the Region Pays de la Loire (NUCSAN project).

Since first discovered in 1997, ecological information about the Jocotoco Antpitta has begun to accrue; however, much remains to be learned about this rare species in its limited native range. The observations described here advance our knowledge of the behavioral ecology of this elusive species and contribute more broadly to our knowledge of interspecific competition in antpittas in general. We show that in avian systems in which playback experiments fail to detect competition, competition may still be prevalent, in this case manifesting in a nonvocal, physically aggressive interaction. We also raise new questions about the potential for temporal variation in interspecific competition in grallariids due to increased resource demands during nestling provisioning.","[Snow, Samuel S.; Musser, Jacob M.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Snow, Samuel S.; Field, Daniel J.; Musser, Jacob M.] Yale Univ, Div Vertebrate Zool, Peabody Museum Nat Hist, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Field, Daniel J.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Field, Daniel J.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Amer Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA","Snow, SS (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 208106, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",samuel.snow@yale.edu,,"Field, Daniel/0000-0002-1786-0352; Snow, Samuel/0000-0003-2890-4717",Yale University; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Smithsonian Predoctoral FellowshipSmithsonian Institution; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1122492],"We would like to thank our friends at the Fundacion de Conservacion Jocotoco and the Tapichalaca Biological Reserve for their admirable work to conserve these fascinating birds.

Most invasive species are more competitive than native species, with the strongest competition expected between species that share similar niches and/or those that are closely related. Because many habitats can be invaded by several non-native species, the competition between alien plants has an increasing importance. The American-origin goldenrods (Solidago and Euthamia) are exceptionally successful invaders in Europe. A replacement series experiment was performed, to identify the interactions between goldenrods in their invasive range. We determined what type of interferences dominated between the examined taxa by comparing the total yield of plants in mixtures and as a monoculture. Four alien goldenrods [Solidago altissima L., Solidago canadensis L., Solidago gigantea Aiton and Euthamia graminifolia (L) Nutt] were studied and compared with native species (Solidago virgaurea L. and Tanacetum vulgare L) that co-occur with them in natural conditions. The results show that the invasive Solidago species had similar competitive abilities. The invasive species that were examined, out-competed the native taxa. These results highlight the high competitiveness of E. graminifolia, which reduced the biomass of the other species. Such competitive abilities were related to underground competition. These results suggest the necessity to monitor this species as a potentially invasive taxon. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

However, these networks differ markedly on how they advertise their user base. Some highlight the number of sellers, some emphasize the number of buyers, and others disclose both. We use field experiment data from a business-to-business website to examine the efficacy of these different display formats. Before each potential seller posted a listing, the website randomized whether to display the number of buyers and/or sellers, and if so, how many buyers and/or sellers to claim. We find that when information about both buyers and sellers is displayed, a large number of sellers deters further seller listings. However, this deterrence effect disappears when only the number of sellers is presented. Similarly, a large number of buyers is more likely to attract new listings when it is displayed together with the number of sellers. These results suggest the presence of indirect network externalities, whereby a seller prefers markets with many other sellers because they help attract more buyers.","[Tucker, Catherine E.; Zhang, Juanjuan] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Tucker, CE (corresponding author), MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",cetucker@mit.edu; jjzhang@mit.edu,"Zhang, Juanjuan/B-4649-2012; Tucker, Catherine E/H-4878-2011",/0000-0002-1847-4832,,,,22,60,63,4,57,INFORMS,HANOVER,"7240 PARKWAY DR, STE 310, HANOVER, MD 21076-1344 USA",0732-2399,,,MARKET SCI,Mark.

Here we show, using soil bacterial communities, that evolving in the presence of a competitor constrained abiotic adaptation. Specifically, Pseudomonas fluorescens evolved alone was fitter than P. fluorescens evolved alongside Pseudomonas putida, when P. putida was absent. Genome analyses indicated this was due to mutation of the acetate scavenger actP, which occurred exclusively, and almost universally, in single-species-evolved clones. actP disruption was associated with increased growth in soil compared with wild-type actP, but this benefit was abolished when P. putida was present, suggesting a role for carbon scavenging transporters in species interactions, possibly through nutrient competition. Our results show that competitive species interactions can limit the evolutionary response to abiotic selection, because the fitness benefits of abiotic adaptive mutations were negated in more complex communities.","[Hall, James P.

It further aims to test whether preferences differ by age and health status. Evidence is provided by a discrete choice experiment conducted in 2014 using the six most important attributes in sickness fund competition and ten random generated choice sets per participant. Price is found to be the most important attribute followed by additional benefits, managed care programmes, and distance to nearest branch. Other positive attributes of sickness funds are found to balance out a higher price, which would allow a sickness fund to position itself as high quality. However, significant differences in preferences were found between age and health status group. In particular, compromised health is associated with higher preference for illness-related additional benefits and less distance to the lowest branch, but lower preference for a lower price. Based on these differences, a distinct sickness fund offer could be constructed that would allow passive risk selection.","[Pendzialek, Jonas B.; Simic, Dusan; Stock, Stephanie] Univ Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany","Pendzialek, JB (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",jonas.pendzialek@gmail.com,,,,,,51,3,3,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Geographical variation in female preferences has been linked to ecology in several studies, but much less is known about patterns of geographical variation in male competition. I asked whether male aggressive territorial behaviour varied among three breeding populations of a ring species, the greenish warbler, Phylloscopus trochiloides. I measured aggressive response to playbacks of conspecific song at multiple time points to determine how territorial behaviour varied throughout the breeding season both within and between populations. Differences in the abundance and timing of resources necessary for raising offspring can shape male competitive strategies, and competition may consequently vary as a function of resource availability. I therefore combined assays of temporal variation in aggressive behaviour with season-long measures of food abundance, population density and parental provisioning rates. I found that the populations differed in intensity of aggressive response, the seasonal pattern of territoriality and the traits used in territorial responses. Overall intensity of aggression was lowest but most prolonged in the population with the lowest food abundance and highest population density, and males responded to playback primarily by singing. By contrast, birds in the two populations that experienced high food abundance and low population density exhibited a burst of aggressive display behaviour only when females were fertile. The results suggest that territorial strategies vary geographically and respond to limited resources, switching in function from season-long food defence where food is scarce to mate guarding where mates are scarce. Interactions between sexual selection and ecology across large geographical scales may ultimately lead to population divergence. The geographical variation in territorial behaviour observed in the greenish warbler implies that male competition may be an important diversifying force in this system.

An examination of a 70 year record at the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, indicated that although species abundances have primarily changed as expected under natural succession, some unexpected results were also detected. This included a significant decline in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) abundance driven by reduced regeneration and increases in red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) at the expense of sympatric balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and hardwoods at upper elevations. In contrast with accepted stand development models, biomass continues to accrue on these mid-to late-successional forests. Importantly, biomass accumulated at even greater rates in recent decades compared with historical norms.

Consequently, there is great interest in predicting species complementarity and their competitive differences from their functional traits as dissimilar species may compete less and result in more complete use of resources. Here we assessed the role of trait dissimilarities for species complementarity and competitive disparities within an experimental gradient of plant species richness and functional trait dissimilarity. Communities were assembled using three pools of grass and forb species based on a priori knowledge of traits related to (1) above- and below-ground spatial differences in resource acquisition, (2) phenological differences or (3) both. Complementarity and competitive disparities were assessed by partitioning the overyielding in mixed species communities into species complementarity and dominance effects. Community overyielding and the underlying complementarity and competitive dominance varied strongly among the three plant species pools. Overyielding and complementarity were greatest among species that were assembled based on their variation in both spatial and phenological traits. Competitive dominance was greatest when species were assembled based on spatial resource acquisition traits alone. In communities that were assembled based on species variation in only spatial or phenological traits, greater competitive dominance was predicted by greater differences in SLA and flowering initiation respectively, while greater complementarity was predicted by greater dissimilarity in leaf area and flowering senescence respectively. Greater differences in leaf area could also be linked to greater species complementarity in communities assembled based on variation in both phenological and spatial traits, but trait dissimilarity was unrelated to competitive dominance in these communities. Our results indicate that complementarity and competitive disparity among species are both driven by trait dissimilarities. However, the identity of the traits that drives the complementarity and competitive disparity depends on the trait variation among species that comprise the community. Moreover, we demonstrate that communities assembled with the greater variation in both spatial and phenological traits show the greatest complementarity among species.

This research examines with a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) the conditions, including gender, that relate to competition preferences and the different paths that may lead to a decision to enter competition. The results of the economic experiment show that no single condition but combinations of characteristics explain preferences for competition. Furthermore, results show that experience in competitive sportsrelates to a higher self-confidence and increases the willingness to enter in competitive systems. Interestingly, one of the causal paths leading to enter competition is being a risk-averse woman with experience in competitive sports. These results provide insights to guide policy interventions to reduce the gender gap in preferences for competition and, therefore, to rise the percentage of women in top-level positions.

Recent research has shown that GS influences plant abundance, and plant competition. There are also tantalizing reports that herbivores may select plants as food dependent on their GS. To test the hypothesis that GS plays a role in shaping plant communities under herbivore pressure, we exploit a grassland experiment that has experimentally excluded herbivores and applied nutrient over 8 years. Using phylogenetically informed statistical models and path analyses, we show that under rabbit grazing, plant species with small GS generated the most biomass. By contrast, on mollusc and insect-grazed plots, it was the plant species with larger GS that increased in biomass. GS was also shown to influence plant community properties (e.g. competitive strategy, total biomass) although the impact varied between different herbivore guilds (i.e. rabbits versus invertebrates) and nutrient inputs. Overall, we demonstrate that GS plays a role in influencing plant-herbivore interactions, and suggest potential reasons for this response, which include the impact of GS on a plant's response to different herbivore guilds, and on a plant's nutrient quality. The inclusion of GS in ecological models has the potential to expand our understanding of plant productivity and community ecology under nutrient and herbivore stress.","[Guignard, Maite S.; Kovalenko, Dasha; Nichols, Richard A.; Trimmer, Mark; Leitch, Andrew R.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Guignard, Maite S.; Leitch, Ilia J.] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England; [Crawley, Michael J.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Fac Nat Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Leitch, AR (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.; Leitch, IJ (corresponding author), Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England.",a.r.leitch@qmul.ac.uk; i.leitch@kew.org,"Leitch, Ilia J/X-5449-2019; Leitch, Andrew R/J-6385-2014","Leitch, Ilia J/0000-0002-3837-8186; Leitch, Andrew R/0000-0001-8574-302X; Guignard, Maite/0000-0002-0339-3458",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [196468/v40]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/J012106/1],This study was supported by funding from the Research Council of Norway (196468/v40) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) (NE/J012106/1).,,67,2,3,0,23,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

This was demonstrated on a full-scale Pt/gamma-alumina DOC (o.d. = 106 mm; length = 114 mm), connected to a Ford 2.0 L diesel engine. The engine was operated at a constant speed of 2000 rpm, and by varying the engine torque, experiments were performed at fixed gas inlet temperatures to the DOC, e.g. 150, 320 degrees C, and at each setting a constant background level of exhaust emissions was obtained. Then, a known quantity of pollutant (e.g. CO, propane) was injected into the exhaust, so as to create an approximated pulse input into the DOC (e.g. with peak CO concentration = 3000 ppm). The transient response of the system was monitored. So as to examine more closely local changes in response to a change in inlet conditions, experiments were also performed with a short 5 mm thin-slice of DOC (o.d. = 106 mm). These techniques enable better control to be achieved over such experiments, and provide valuable data to support mathematical modelling. It was interesting to note, that in the examples studied, there was no evidence of any significant competition between CO and THCs for the active sites. The DOC was also characterised, and it was shown that key properties can have different values depending on the location from which the sample was taken - and this would also have important implications on modelling work.

Theory has shown that the distances over which these interactions occur may have important consequences for population and community dynamics. In particular, if intraspecific competition occurs over longer distances than interspecific competition (heteromyopia), coexistence can be promoted. We examined how intraspecific and interspecific competition scales with neighbor distance in a target-neighbor greenhouse competition experiment. Individuals from co-occurring forbs from calcareous grasslands were grown in isolation and with single conspecific or heterospecific neighbors at distances of 5, 10, or 15 cm (Plantago lanceolata vs. Plantago media and Hieracium pilosella vs. Prunella grandiflora). Neighbor effects were strong and declined with distance. Interaction distances varied greatly within and between species, but we found no evidence for heteromyopia. Instead, neighbor identity effects were mostly explained by relative size differences between target and neighbor. We found a complex interaction between final neighbor size and identity such that neighbor identity may become important only as the neighbor becomes very large compared with the target individual. Our results suggest that species-specific size differences between neighboring individuals determine both the strength of competitive interactions and the distance over which these interactions occur.","[Vogt, Deborah R.; Stoll, Peter] Univ Basel, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Murrell, David J.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Vogt, DR (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",deborah.vogt@unibas.ch,"Murrell, David/AAG-3916-2019; Murrell, David/B-7833-2010; Vogt, Deborah/D-7536-2012; Stoll, Peter/A-8881-2010; Vogt, Deborah/AAA-6583-2020","Murrell, David/0000-0002-4830-8966; Stoll, Peter/0000-0003-1509-1702; Vogt, Deborah/0000-0002-0668-5675","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [3100A0-112523]; Natural Environment Research Council (United Kingdom)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/D009367/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/D009367/2, NE/D009367/1] Funding Source: researchfish","We thank C.

Consequently, to determine the ecological risk of Lepomis gibbosus in case of introduction to a small stream, experimental approach was used to predict its competitive interaction with a poorly studied endemic fish, Capoeta aydinensis. The aim was to test whether L. gibbosus has an adverse effect on native species using an experimental design under allopatric and sympatric context with temperature regimes of 15 and 24oC. The results indicated that temperature and fish proportion had effects on the growth of C. aydinensis while these factors were not important for L. gibbosus. These results provided little evidence of L. gibbosus presence being detrimental for endemic C. aydinensis, but nevertheless steps should be taken to avoid their further co-habitation in the wild.","[Top-Karakus, Nildeniz; Tarkan, Ali Serhan] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-48000 Mentese, Mugla, Turkey; [Tarkan, Ali Serhan] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Lodz, Poland","Top-Karakus, N (corresponding author), Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-48000 Mentese, Mugla, Turkey.",tnildeniz@gmail.com,"Tarkan, Ali Serhan/AAT-7207-2021","Tarkan, Ali Serhan/0000-0001-8628-0514; TOP-KARAKUS, NILDENIZ/0000-0001-8490-6261",Mugla Sitki Kocman UniversityMugla Sitki Kocman University,Scientific Research Projects; Mugla Sitki Kocman University,,52,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

In this experiment, participants made sequential choices between two competing airlines in a stylized frequent traveler task for which an optimal dynamic decision policy can be numerically computed. The authors find that, on average, participants are able to partially realize the long-term benefits from loyalty programs, though most are sensitive to price. They also find that participants' preferences and levels of bounded rationality depend on the nature of the competitive environment, the particular state of each decision scenario, and the type of optimal action. Accordingly, the authors use an approximate dynamic programming model to incorporate boundedly rational decision making. The model classifies participants into five segments that exhibit variation in their performance and decision strategies. Importantly, they find that participants are able to adapt their decision strategies to the environment they face, and thus the overall market outcome and the performance of each firm are influenced by both the competitive environment and the assumption on the extent of consumer optimality.","[Liu, Jia] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Mkt, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ansari, Asim] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, Mkt Div, Mkt, New York, NY 10027 USA","Liu, J (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Mkt, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jialiu@ust.hk; maa48@columbia.edu,,", Jia/0000-0002-0279-724X",,,,46,2,2,5,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-2437,1547-7193,,J MARKETING RES,J.

We test this hypothesis through an experiment with adults in China (n = 358). Data show that, once the incentives are switched from monetary to child-benefitting, gender differences disappear.

(2003), we examined whether morphological traits (organismal response), tolerance and competitive effect (specific process response) were associated with grass dominance (abundance response) on burning, mowing, fertilization and soil depth gradients in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. Location University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Methods Using several pot experiments involving 29 grass species in total, we determined the vegetative traits, competitive effect and response, and tolerance to shading for grasses common in closed, tufted mesic grassland in KZN. Results The primary axis of grass-trait variation was most strongly related to a negative correlation (trade-off) between growth rate and specific leaf area (SLA), with broad-leaved, rapidly-growing grasses (high SLA) occupying one extreme and narrow-leaved, slow-growing grasses (low SLA) the other extreme of the first principal component. The low SLA, slow-growth strategy was found to be a relatively general strategy among grasses dominant in undisturbed, high litter grassland, as well as those adapted to moisture-stressed habitats. In contrast, grasses dominant in highly productive habitats with some form of disturbance, e.g. mowing, had a broad-leaved, rapid-growth strategy. Intermediate combinations of the SLA-growth rate trade-off were common among grasses dominant under other combinations of disturbance and soil resource availability. Conclusions Distinct patterns of organismal (SLA, growth rate) and specific process (competitive effect and response, as well as tolerance of shading) responses appeared to be associated with grasses dominant on gradients of burning, mowing, fertilization and soil depth. These organismal and specific process responses were similar to those for North American and European grasses dominant under the same environmental influences, suggesting that some general trait-environment patterns exist at an inter-continental scale. This general trait-environment relationship appears to be driven by functional adaptive selection along the SLA-environment continuum and its unavoidable trade-off with growth rate.","[Fynn, Richard] Univ Botswana, Okavango Res Inst, Maun, Botswana; [Morris, Craig] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Agr Res Council, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Ward, David; Kirkman, Kevin] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa","Fynn, R (corresponding author), Univ Botswana, Okavango Res Inst, Private Bag 285, Maun, Botswana.",rfynn@orc.ub.bw; morris@ukzn.ac.za; ward@ukzn.ac.za; kirkmank@ukzn.ac.za,"Kirkman, Kevin P/F-4160-2010","Kirkman, Kevin P/0000-0001-9580-5191",NRF of South Africa,We thank Jerry Naiken for his help in the setting up and maintenance of all the experiments.

Thus, competitor introductions may modify the niches of the resident competitors, but empirical studies are rare. The extent of niche modification might further depend on the species' trophic specialisation along the specialists-to-generalists axis. In this study, we performed a semi-natural experiment by introducing a trophically specialised piscivorous fish (pikeperch) to the resident predator guild of a trophic generalist (perch) and a trophic specialist (pike) in a temperate freshwater lake. Individual diet data were used to calculate total niche hypervolume and inter- and intraspecific dietary niche overlap to evaluate strength of competitive interactions before and after pikeperch introduction. In both pike and perch, there was a moderate niche compression in response to pikeperch stocking. Furthermore, whereas perch diet hypervolume did not overlap at all with that of pikeperch, the intersection of niche space between the two trophic specialists was highly asymmetrical in favour of pike due to its less specialised diet composition in comparison with pikeperch. The intraspecific dietary niche overlap between perch size classes reflected an enhanced partitioning, whereas that of pike size classes was found almost unchanged in response to pikeperch stocking. These empirical results corroborate that competitive interactions and the degree of specialisation may strongly shape the success of introductions of top-predators in freshwater ecosystems. The most specialised species may persist only if the competitors belong rather to the generalists along the specialisation continuum. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Here, we demonstrate how it can benefit woodland caribou, which became the first large mammal extirpated from the contiguous United States in recent history. The continental scale of forest alteration and extended time needed for forest recovery means that relying only on habitat protection and restoration will likely fail. Therefore, population management is also needed as an emergency measure to avoid further extirpation. Reductions of predators and overabundant prey, translocations, and creating safe havens have been applied in a design covering >90,000 km(2). Combinations of treatments that increased multiple vital rates produced the highest population growth. Moreover, the degree of ecosystem alteration did not influence this pattern. By coordinating recovery involving scientists, governments, and First Nations, treatments were applied across vast scales to benefit this iconic species.","[Serrouya, Robert] Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, Caribou Monitoring Unit, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Serrouya, Robert] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Seip, Dale R.] British Columbia Minist Environm, Conservat Sci Sect, Prince George, BC V2L 3H9, Canada; [Hervieux, Dave; Steenweg, Robin] Alberta Environm & Pk, Resource Management Operat Div, Grande Prairie, AB T8V 6J4, Canada; [McLellan, Bruce N.] British Columbia Minist Forests Lands & Nat Resou, Res Branch, Darcy, BC V0N 1L0, Canada; [McNay, R.

The dominant bacterial strains were identified, and their toxicity and pathogenicity, in addition to their competitiveness with other pathogenic bacteria, were measured to ascertain how bacteria on the surface of American pine wood nematodes might be used to prevent and control pine wilt disease. The bacterial isolates show that the dominant bacteria carried by the two samples of pine wood nematodes are US4, US5, Smal-007 and Rrad-006. Based on routine staining, morphological observation and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, the four strains were identified as Delftia lacustris, Pseudomonas putida, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Rhizobium nepotum. The incubation of four dominant bacterial strains and Chinese dominant bacterial strains on the surface of aseptic nematodes and in nutrient broth showed that Smal-007 and Rrad-006 have strong competitiveness on the surface of pine wood nematodes. Using a bacterial culture medium to measure the propensity of pine seedlings to wilt, all the American dominant bacterial strains were shown to be less toxic than the Chinese dominant strains. If pine seedlings are inoculated with both bacterial and aseptic pine wood nematodes, American dominant bacterial strains present less pathogenicity than the Chinese dominant bacterial strains. In particular, Smal-007 and Rrad-006 show the lowest pathogenicity. If pine seedlings are inoculated with both bacterial and wild pine wood nematodes, American dominant bacterial strains significantly reduce the pathogenicity of wild pine wood nematodes isolated from Zhejiang Province, China. The effects of Smal-007 and Rrad-006 are confirmed as the most prominent. The American dominant strains Smal-007 and Rrad-006 satisfy two main requirements: excellent repulsion performance and low pathogenicity. Therefore, they can be used as candidate strains for biocontrol bacteria.","[Liu, Kan-Cheng; Han, Zheng-Min] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Fei-Li] Chunan Cty Forestry Bur, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ben, Ai-Ling] Nanjing Xiaozhuang Univ, Sch Food Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Han, ZM (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zmhan@njfu.edu.cn,,,State Forestry Administration of China [201204501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30872026]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"State Forestry Administration of China, Grant/Award Number: 201204501; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Grant/Award Number: 30872026; A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)",,32,7,7,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-1785,1439-0434,,J PHYTOPATHOL,J.

Recently, such pot experiments provided inconsistent estimates of the impact and allelopathic potential of invasive knotweed, one of the world's most successful plant invaders. We suspected that the inconsistencies may be explained by the use of different substrates in different experiments. To test this, we conducted an experiment in which knotweed competed pairwise with five common native European species in several different substrates: two compost-based potting substrates and two natural soils, with or without extra fertilizer added. To test for allelopathy, we added activated carbon to half of the pots. We found that knotweed was generally much more successful, and there was much more evidence for its allelopathy, when tested in artificial potting substrates than in natural soils. Furthermore, addition of extra fertilizer decreased the dominance of knotweed and changed patterns of allelopathy. The physicochemical properties of potting soil, such as lower bulk density, higher pore space, permeability and nitrogen content may better allow rhizomes to penetrate and/or allelochemicals to be produced and diffused. If artificial substrates generally exaggerate dominance and allelopathy also in other invasive plants, then many previous studies may have overestimated the potential impact of invaders, and the results of these experiments should be interpreted with caution. To avoid misleading results, experiments that test the competitive or allelopathic impact of invasive plants should be done with natural soils, preferably from the targeted habitats.","[Parepa, Madalin; Bossdorf, Oliver] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Parepa, Madalin; Bossdorf, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Plant Evolutionary Ecol, Morgenstelle 5, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Parepa, M (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",madalin.parepa@uni-tuebingen.de,"Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008","Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [31003A_122408],We thank Steffen Boch for helpful comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

The intensity and frequency of male-male competition for fertilization opportunities is thought to be an important contributor to this conflict. The nematode genus Caenorhabditis provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis because the frequency of males varies widely among species with different mating systems. Results: We find evidence that there is strong inter- and intra-sexual conflict within C. remanei, a dioecious species composed of equal frequencies of males and females. In particular, some C. remanei males greatly reduce female lifespan following mating, and their sperm have a strong competitive advantage over the sperm of other males. In contrast, our results suggest that both types of conflict have been greatly reduced within C. elegans, which is an androdioecious species that is composed of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and rare males. Using experimental evolution in mutant C. elegans populations in which sperm production is blocked in hermaphrodites (effectively converting them to females), we find that the consequences of sexual conflict observed within C. remanei evolve rapidly within C. elegans populations experiencing high levels of male-male competition. Conclusions: Together, these complementary data sets support the hypothesis that the intensity of intersexual conflict varies with the intensity of competition among males, and that male-induced collateral damage to mates can evolve very rapidly within populations.","[Palopoli, Michael F.; Woo, Caitlin; Akiha, Ken] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Peden, Colin; Ary, Megan; Cruze, Lori; Anderson, Jennifer L.; Phillips, Patrick C.] Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Phillips, PC (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",pphil@uoregon.edu,"Anderson, Jennifer L/I-5435-2012","Anderson, Jennifer L/0000-0002-0713-6897","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0641066, DEB-1120417]; National Center for Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [5P20RR016463-12]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences from National Institutes of Health [8 P20 GM103423-12]; HHMI Undergraduate Science Program; Bowdoin College; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P20RR016463] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P20GM103423] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1120417] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Support for this research was provided by National Science Foundation grants DEB-0641066 and DEB-1120417 to PCP.

The impact of severe drought stress on trees' vitality with regard to growth has often been analysed using traditional, easy-to-measure variables, such as diameter at breast height (d(1.3)). Another commonly used tree-vitality indicator is crown transparency, which is not directly measurable and has to be determined qualitatively by well-trained field experts. In this study, we focused on tree dimensions, as potential vitality indicators, that are difficult to measure. The new approach for the efficient monitoring of tree vitality introduced here revealed three-dimensional change of tree shape due to drought stress. The unique drought stress experiment Kranzberg Forest Roof Experiment (KROOF) was used as a basis for scanning and analysing the growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) under progressively limiting water reserves. Before the start of the experiment in the winter of 2012/2013, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was performed and repeated in the winter of 2018/2019. One sample of 21 trees was trenched and roofed (treatment), while additional 26 trees served as untreated reference (control). Using the TLS-point clouds of the two subsequent surveys, structural tree modifications within the 6-year period can be directly visualised, computed and linked to drought stress. Drought stress led to significantly smaller crown size and lower height growth for both tree species. The crowns of Norway spruce trees increased significantly in transparency and roughness. In addition, high competition combined with drought stress significantly reduced the roughness and increased the compactness of the crown. The periodic annual change in crown projection area (pac(cpa)) as well as the periodic annual height increment (pai(height)) differed significantly between control and treatment for both tree species. Under drought conditions, pac(cpa) changed by -0.74 m(2) yr(-1) and -0.42 m(2) yr(-1) for spruce and beech trees respectively, whereas the control trees showed a growth of 0.17 m(2) yr(-1) and 0.62 m(2) yr(-1) respectively. This means that crowns became considerably smaller under dry conditions. Under drought, the paiheight was 0.09 m yr(-1) less for spruce and 0.17 m yr(-1) less for beech compared with normal growing conditions. The periodic annual change in crown roughness (pac(roughness)) was -9.5% yr(-1) if local competition increased by one. Our results show that TLS can offer new opportunities for identifying structural features in trees. Iterative TLS-surveys may extend existing measuring campaigns on common long-term experimental plots, in order to analyse general changes or monitor tree vitality.","[Jacobs, Martin; Rais, Andreas; Pretzsch, Hans] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl V Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Jacobs, M (corresponding author), Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Room 1-2-2-10,Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",martin.jacobs@tum.de,,"Rais, Andreas/0000-0001-8305-8678",,,,56,2,2,13,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Engineering design is often carried out under competition from other designers or firms, where each competitor invests effort with the hope of getting a contract, attracting customers, or winning a prize. One such scenario of design under competition is crowdsourcing where designers compete for monetary prizes. Within existing literature, such competitive scenarios have been studied using models from contest theory, which are based on assumptions of rationality and equilibrium. Although these models are general enough for different types of contests, they do not address the unique characteristics of design decision-making, e.g., strategies related to the design process, the sequential nature of design decisions, the evolution of strategies, and heterogeneity among designers. In this paper, we address these gaps by developing an analytical model for design under competition, and using it in conjunction with a behavioral experiment to gain insights about how individuals actually make decisions in such scenarios. The contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, a game-theoretic model is presented for sequential design decisions considering the decisions made by other players. Second, an approach for synergistic integration of analytical models with data from behavioral experiments is presented. The proposed approach provides insights such as shift in participants' strategies from exploration to exploitation as they acquire more information, and how they develop beliefs about the quality of their opponents' solutions.","[Panchal, Jitesh H.] Purdue Univ, Sch Mech Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sha, Zhenghui] Univ Arkansas, Dept Mech Engn, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Kannan, Karthik N.] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Panchal, JH (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Mech Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",panchal@purdue.edu; zsha@uark.edu; kkarthik@purdue.edu,,,"National Science Foundation through NSF CMMI Grant [1400050]; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact InnNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1400050] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Science Foundation through NSF CMMI Grant No. 1400050.

The potential of using growth rings as markers of plant growth response to more ecological phenomena such as periodic disturbance still remains mostly untapped. By monitoring the 2016 growth increment of 64 individuals of a common milkweed species (Asclepias viridis) from the US tallgrass prairie system we investigate plant response to factorial treatments of early season shoot removal and neighbor thinning. These treatments simulate bouts of herbivory, grazing, and dormant-season fire, each of which should have differential effects on plant growth. Neighbor thinning had the strongest effects of the study, moderately increasing ring widths. Conversely, ring widths were moderately decreased by shoot removal. Individual age had negative effects on ring width. These results are the first evidence of herbaceous annual ring sensitivity to sudden amelioration of resources as well as a significant loss of aboveground biomass. Herb-chronology could be useful in future studies monitoring the effects of disturbance on plant growth, increasing our understanding of these phenomena and their overall effect on grassland composition.","[Dee, Justin R.; Palmer, Michael W.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Plant Biol Ecol & Evolut, 301 Phys Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Dee, JR (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Plant Biol Ecol & Evolut, 301 Phys Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jrdee@okstate.edu,,,,,,55,1,1,2,11,TREE-RING SOC,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, TREE-RING LABORATORY, BLDG 58, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1536-1098,2162-4585,,TREE-RING RES,Tree-Ring Res.,JAN,2019,75,1,,,,,14,24,,10.3959/1536-1098-75.1.14,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,HX4TQ,WOS:000467393700002,,,,,2021-09-30,

Partly this can be explained by methodological limitations of the existing approaches to analyzing these categories. But the issue cannot be limited to merely a theoretical debate, as the choice of interpretation influences the ways in which antitrust policy is implemented. The issue in question is of special importance in cases of bilateral monopoly. The article aims at providing an approach to differentiate between market power and bargaining power based on results of theoretical differentiating and experimental empirical studies. Such an approach allows us to define bargaining power in a wide and narrow sense, revealing the role of institutional factors and chosen strategies. Bargaining power in its narrow sense excludes the aspects related to market power and represents the institutional characteristics of exchange as well as firms' individual strategies of dealing with counterparts on the market. To analyze the different ways in which market power and bargaining power can correspond we study cases of symmetrical and asymmetrical bargaining power without market power, as well as with market power on both sides. We demonstrate that the effects of market power - in terms of both coordination and distribution - can be similar to the effects of asymmetrical bargaining power, which serves as one of the reasons for confusing between the two. The existing trends in Russian antitrust policy demonstrate the need for a balanced approach to assessing actions that disrupt competition and actions explained by asymmetrical bargaining power in the narrow sense.","[Shastitko, A.; Pavlova, N.] MSU, RANEPA, Moscow, Russia","Shastitko, A (corresponding author), MSU, RANEPA, Moscow, Russia.",,"Shastitko, Andrey/N-1121-2013","Pavlova, Natalia/0000-0002-9416-4086; Shastitko, Andrey/0000-0002-6713-069X",,,,25,3,3,1,2,CONSAS CONFERENCE,MOWBRAY,"VAN DER STERR BLDG, RHODES DR, MOWBRAY, 7785, SOUTH AFRICA",2221-2264,,,ZH NOVAYA EKON ASSOT,Zh.

Yet there is hardly any information on how to adapt game design elements to improve learning outcomes and promote learner engagement. To address this issue, we focus on a popular game design element, competition, and specifically examine the effects of different competitive structures, i.e., whether a person faces a higher-skilled, lower-skilled or equally-skilled competitor, on learning and engagement. We study a gamified training design for databases, where trainees play a trivia-based mini-game with a competitor after each e-training module. Trainees who faced a lower-skilled competitor reported higher self-efficacy beliefs and better learning outcomes, supporting the effect of peer appraisal, a less examined aspect of social cognitive theory. Yet trainees who faced equally-skilled competitors reported higher levels of engagement, supporting the balance principle of flow theory. Our study findings indicate that no one competitive structure can simultaneously address learning and engagement outcomes. The choice of competitive structures depends on the priority of the outcomes in training. Our findings provide one explanation for the mixed findings on the effect of competitive gamification designs in technology mediated training.","[Santhanam, Radhika] Univ Oklahoma, Price Coll Business, Div Management Informat Syst, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Liu, De] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Informat & Decis Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Shen, Wei-Cheng Milton] Univ Alabama, Dept Accounting, Coll Business Adm, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA","Santhanam, R (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Price Coll Business, Div Management Informat Syst, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",radhika@ou.edu; deliu@umn.edu; milton.shen@uah.edu,,"Liu, De/0000-0002-9430-9732",,,,72,65,67,7,155,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",1047-7047,1526-5536,,INFORM SYST RES,Inf.

The action of drive genes is often hidden, making detection and identification inherently difficult. Yet drive genes can have profound evolutionary consequences for the populations that harbour them: most known drivers are detrimental to organismal gamete development, reproduction and survival. In this study, we identified the presence of a well-known drive gene called t haplotype post hoc in eight replicate selection lines of house mice that had been evolving under enforced monandry or polyandry for 20 generations. Previous work on these selection lines reported an increase in sperm competitive ability in males evolving under polyandry. Here, we show that this evolutionary response can be partly attributed to gene drive. We demonstrate that drive-carrying males are substantially compromised in their sperm competitive ability. As a consequence, we found that t frequencies declined significantly in the polyandrous lines while remaining at stable, high levels in the monandrous lines. For the first time in a vertebrate, we thus provide direct experimental evidence that the mating system of a species can have important repercussions on the spread of drive genes over evolutionary relevant timescales. Moreover, our work highlights how the covert action of drive genes can have major, potentially unintended impact on our study systems.","[Manser, Andri] Univ Liverpool, Inst Integrat Biol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Manser, Andri; Lindholm, Anna K.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Simmons, Leigh W.; Firman, Renee C.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci M092, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia","Manser, A (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Inst Integrat Biol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",andri.manser@liverpool.ac.uk,"Lindholm, Anna K/E-5207-2012; Simmons, Leigh W/B-1815-2011","Lindholm, Anna K/0000-0001-8460-9769; Simmons, Leigh W/0000-0003-0562-1474","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [138389, 161970]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP1094845]","Swiss National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 138389, 161970; Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP1094845",,47,20,20,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

It is thought to be a consequence of learned behavior or misdirected intraspecific aggression. In the former case birds acquire the ability to identify individuals of other species by social learning of species-specific traits during interactions with heterospecifics in a shared habitat. I conducted a two-choice song playback experiment to investigate the role of associating signals from two sensory modalities, auditory and visual, in shaping the agonistic response of male Eurasian Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) to simulated male Garden Warbler (S. borin) intruders. I measured focal males' response to playbacks to the song of a Blackcap or a Garden Warbler while giving them a choice between stuffed male models of both species presented in their territories. The experiments were carried out in early spring, before the arrival of Garden Warblers from Africa. I found that male Blackcaps were able to associate species-specific songs with species-specific plumage types. The ability to associate signals characterized not only experienced after-second-year old males, but also second-year old males that had not had the opportunity to defend breeding territories against heterospecifics. This suggests that second-year old male Blackcaps acquire the ability to associate Garden Warbler song with plumage before they use this skill when defending territory during their first breeding episode. Male Blackcaps do not mistake male Garden Warblers for males of their species, but rather learn these associations during the first months of life. However, the possibility that these associations are innate cannot be excluded.","[Matyjasiak, Piotr] Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ Warsaw, Inst Biol Sci, Woycickiego 1-3, PL-01938 Warsaw, Poland","Matyjasiak, P (corresponding author), Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ Warsaw, Inst Biol Sci, Woycickiego 1-3, PL-01938 Warsaw, Poland.",pmatyjasiak@wp.pl,"Matyjasiak, Piotr/AAT-8660-2021","Matyjasiak, Piotr/0000-0003-0384-2935","Foundation for Polish ScienceFoundation for Polish ScienceEuropean Commission; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of PolandMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [2P04F07030]",This work was supported by grants from the Foundation for Polish Science and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland under Grant No. 2P04F07030.,,64,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Physical fighting is costly but relatively rare in this species. Instead, disputes are frequently resolved using displays that include loud, repetitive wahoo (two-syllable bark) vocalizations. We previously found that males of all ranks adjust their contest behavior based on the relative fighting ability of opponents and that length of the second syllable (hoo duration), calling rate, and fundamental frequency reliably indicate fighting ability. To test whether males indeed attend to hoo duration when assessing opponents, we designed two sets of playback experiments in which call sequence pairs were identical except for this single modified feature. In experiment 1, we used calls recorded from high-ranking males unfamiliar to all subjects. In experiment 2, callers were familiar rivals that ranked one position below subjects in the dominance hierarchy. In paired analyses, subjects in both experiments responded more strongly to sequences with more intense signal features (most commonly associated with high-quality males) compared to sequences with relatively less exaggerated features (most often associated with low-quality males). Results suggest that males can use acoustic features to both indirectly evaluate strangers and to monitor the changing condition of those rivals that present the biggest intragroup threat to their position in the dominance hierarchy. Taken together with our previous research, baboons appear to follow a classic assessor strategy-signal features related to rank and condition are salient to males and directly affect their propensity to respond to rivals.","[Kitchen, D.

This behavioral pattern, that we call mate-copying, was reported in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster where females choosing between 2 males of contrasting phenotypes can build a preference for males of the phenotype they previously saw being chosen by a demonstrator female. As sex ratio is known to affect mate choice, our goal was to test whether mate-copying is also affected by encountered sex ratios. Thus, we created a gradient of sex ratio during demonstrations of mate-copying experiments by changing the number of females observing from a central arena 6 simultaneous demonstrations unfolding in 6 peripheral compartments of a hexagonal device. We also tested whether the sex ratio experienced by females during demonstrations affected their choosiness (male courtship duration and double courtship rate) in subsequent mate-choice tests. Experimental male: female sex ratio during demonstrations did not affect mate-copying indices, but positively affected the proportion of both males courting the female during mate-choice tests, as well as male courtship duration, the latter potentially explaining the former relationship. As expected, the sex ratio affected female choosiness positively, and Drosophila females seem to have evolved a mate-copying ability independently of sex ratio, and a capacity to adapt their choosiness to male availability. This suggests that, as in many animal species, individuals, especially females, can adapt their mate choice depending on the current sex ratio.","[Monier, Magdalena; Danchin, Etienne] Univ Toulouse, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol EDB, CNRS, IRD,UMR 5174, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France; [Nobel, Sabine; Isabel, Guillaume] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, CBI, CRCA, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France","Nobel, S (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, CBI, CRCA, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France.",sabine.noebel@univ-tlse3.fr,"Danchin, Etienne/AAB-2091-2021","Danchin, Etienne/0000-0002-5013-9612; Nobel, Sabine/0000-0002-1850-8895",Laboratoires d'Excellence (LABEX) TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41]; ANR funded Toulouse Initiative of Excellence IDEX UNITIFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR11-IDEX-0002-02]; Soc-H 2 ANR projectFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-BSV7-0007-01]; French ministry of higher education and research; Soc-H2; Marie Curie PRESTIGE grant [PRESTIGE-2014-1-0005],"We would like to thank Nathalie Parthuisot for help in fly care.

Many studies have demonstrated significant effects of either type of factor on aspects of exotic success, but few have considered their relative effects on population growth rate, a more holistic measure of success. To quantify the relative effects of environment and direct competition on an exotic ascidian, Botrylloides violaceus, I manipulated direct contact interactions at four sites with different abiotic environments and tracked individual colonies over 3 years. I tested site and contact treatment effects on survival, growth and fecundity, and then conducted a life table response experiment on a periodic, size-structured population matrix model to test their effects on population growth rate. Both site and contact interaction were important to explaining variation in survival and growth. Contact interactions decreased the survival and growth of larger colonies but unexpectedly increased the survival of small colonies at some sites, which led to relatively weaker and spatially variable effects on overall population growth rates. Site effects on population growth rates were an order of magnitude larger than contact effects, and site variation in winter vital rates made the largest contributions to changes in population growth rate. The results of this study suggest that the abiotic environment plays a larger role in the success of B. violaceus. Thus, environmental variables, such as temperature and salinity, could be used to predict this exotic species' success under different environmental scenarios, including global climate change.","Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Grey, EK (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 400 Lindy Boggs Bldg, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",egrey@tulane.edu,,"Grey, Erin/0000-0001-5883-0013",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Chicago Hinds Fund,"Many thanks to Lopez Island Marine Center, John Wayne Marina and Pleasant Harbor Marina, Makah Marina and the Makah Nation for permission to conduct this experiment and for their hospitality, to Allie Weill and Beth Leach for photo-analysis assistance, to Friday Harbor Marine Laboratories, and to Cathy Pfister, Tim Wootton, Ole Shelton, Scott Lidgard and Greg Dwyer for helpful comments.

Using experimental evolution with microalgae, we investigated if competition influences adaptation to an abiotic stressor, and vice versa, if adaptation to abiotic change influences competition. In a first set of experiments, we propagated monocultures of five species with and without increasing salt stress for approximately 180 generations. When assayed in monoculture, two of the five species showed signatures of adaptation, that is, lines with a history of salt stress had higher population growth rates at high salt than lines without prior exposure to salt. When assayed in mixtures of species, however, only one of these two species had increased population size at high salt, indicating that competition can alter how adaptation to abiotic change influences population dynamics. In a second experiment, we cultivated two species in monocultures and in pairs, with and without increasing salt. While we found no effect of competition on adaptation to salt, our experiment revealed that evolutionary responses to salt can influence competition. Specifically, one of the two species had reduced competitive ability in the no-salt environment after long-term exposure to salt stress. Collectively, our results highlight the complex interplay of adaptation to abiotic change and competitive interactions.","[Limberger, Romana] Univ Innsbruck, Res Dept Limnol, Mondsee, Austria; [Limberger, Romana; Fussmann, Gregor F.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Limberger, Romana] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Limberger, R (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Res Dept Limnol, Mondsee, Austria.; Limberger, R (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Limberger, R (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",romana.limberger@ieu.uzh.ch,,,Erwin-Schrodinger scholarship of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J3265-B16]; NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"This work was supported by an Erwin-Schrodinger scholarship of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), grant no.

However, liana removal studiesmay be one of the most common experimental manipulations in tropical forest ecology. In this review, we synthesize data from 64 tropical liana removal experiments conducted over the past 90 yr. We explore the direction and magnitude of the effects of lianas on tree establishment, growth, survival, reproduction, biomass accretion, and plant and animal diversity in ecological and forestry studies. We discuss the geographical biases of liana removal studies and compare the various methods used to manipulate lianas. Overall, we found that lianas have a clear negative effect on trees, and trees benefitted from removing lianas in nearly every study across all forest types. Liana cutting significantly increased light and water availability, and trees responded with vastly greater reproduction, growth, survival, and biomass accumulation compared to controls where lianas were present. Removing lianas during logging significantly reduced damage of future merchantable trees and improved timber production. Our review demonstrates that lianas have an unequivocally detrimental effect on every metric of tree performance measured, regardless of forest type, forest age, or geographic location. However, lianas also appear to have a positive contribution to overall forest plant diversity and to different animal groups. Therefore, managing lianas reduces logging damage and improves timber production; however, the removal lianas may also have a negative effect on the faunal community, which could ultimately harm the plant community.","[Estrada-Villegas, Sergio; Schnitzer, Stefan A.] Marquette Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Estrada-Villegas, Sergio; Schnitzer, Stefan A.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado Postal 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama","Estrada-Villegas, S (corresponding author), Marquette Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.; Estrada-Villegas, S (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado Postal 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama.",estradavillegassergio@gmail.com,,"Schnitzer, Stefan/0000-0002-2715-9455","Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion COLCIENCIASDepartamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF DEB-1019436, DEB-1258070, IOS-1558093]","This work was partially supported by a fellowship to SE-V from the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion COLCIENCIAS and by funding from the US National Science Foundation to S.A.

One of the instruments easily accessible to policy-makers is innovation contests; however, there is ambiguous empirical evidence concerning how such contests should be designed. Our experimental study provides evidence by analyzing the effects of two different innovation contests on subjects' innovativeness: a prize for the cumulative innovativeness and a prize for the best innovation. We implement a creative real effort task simulating a sequential innovation process, whereby subjects determine royalty fees for their created products, which also serve as a measure of cooperation. We find that both contest conditions reduce the willingness to cooperate between subjects compared to a benchmark condition without an innovation contest. While both contests have similar effects, the most sophisticated innovation is significantly more valuable when there is a prize for the best innovation. However, the total innovation activity is not influenced by introducing innovation contest schemes. From a policy perspective, the implementation of state-subsidized innovation contests in addition to the existing intellectual property rights system should be questioned. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, little attention has been given to their pre-copulatory role with respect to sexual selection and sexual conflict. Males of the fruitfly Drosophila pachea have a pair of asymmetric external genital lobes, which are primary sexual structures and stabilize the copulatory complex of female and male genitalia. We wondered if genital lobes in D. pachea may have a role before or at the onset of copulation, before genitalia contacts are made. Results We tested this hypothesis with a D. pachea stock where males have variable lobe lengths. In 92 mate competition trials with a single female and two males, females preferentially engaged into a first copulation with males that had a longer left lobe and that displayed increased courtship vigor. In 53 additional trials with both males having partially amputated left lobes of different lengths, we observed a weaker and non-significant effect of left lobe length on copulation success. Courtship durations significantly increased with female age and when two males courted the female simultaneously, compared to trials with only one courting male. In addition, lobe length did not affect sperm transfer once copulation was established. Conclusion Left lobe length affects the chance of a male to engage into copulation. The morphology of this primary sexual trait may affect reproductive success by mediating courtship signals or by facilitating the establishment of genital contacts at the onset of copulation.","[Lefevre, Benedicte M.; Catte, Diane; Courtier-Orgogozo, Virginie; Lang, Michael] Univ Paris, CNRS, UMR7592, Team Evolut & Genet,Inst Jacques Monod, 15 Rue Helene Brion, F-75013 Paris, France","Lang, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris, CNRS, UMR7592, Team Evolut & Genet,Inst Jacques Monod, 15 Rue Helene Brion, F-75013 Paris, France.",michael.lang@ijm.fr,,"Lang, Michael/0000-0002-2297-5680","CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)European Commission; European Research Council under the European CommunityEuropean Research Council (ERC) [337579]; pre-doctoral fellowship Sorbonne Paris Cite of the Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot; fellowship Initiatives d'excellence of the Labex Who Am I? project [Idex ANR18-IDEX-0001, ANR-11-LABX-0071]","This study was supported by the CNRS and by a grant of the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013 Grant Agreement no. 337579) given to VCO.

PSF and its temporal development can also be modified by external biotic and abiotic factors such as competition and resource availability, yet most PSF research is conducted in simple experimental settings without considering temporal changes. Here I have studied the effect of different competitive settings (intraspecific, interspecific, and no competition) and nutrient addition on the magnitude and direction of biomass-based PSF (performance in conspecific relative to heterospecific inoculum) across 46 grassland species, estimated at the 4th, 10th, and 13th month of the response phase. I also examined whether conspecific inoculum had a long-term effect on plant survival at the 36th month, and whether biomass-based PSF may predict survival-based PSF effects. PSF pooled across all treatments and time points was negative, but a significant overall temporal trend or differences among competitive settings were missing. PSF developed unimodally for interspecific competition across the three time points, whereas it declined gradually in case of intraspecific and no competition. Nutrient addition attenuated negative biomass-based PSF and eliminated negative effects of conspecific inoculum on survival. Interspecific differences in biomass-based PSF were related to survival-based PSF, but only after nutrient addition. This study demonstrates that PSF is dynamic and modulated by external abiotic and biotic factors. PSF research should consider the temporal dynamics of focal communities to properly estimate how PSF contributes to community changes, preferably directly in the field.","[Dostal, Petr] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic","Dostal, P (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic.",petr.dostal@ibot.cas.cz,,"Dostal, Petr/0000-0002-2342-6632",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-09119S]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939],"This study was supported by grant No. 15-09119S awarded by the Czech Science Foundation, and by the long-term research development project RVO 67985939 of the Czech Academy of Sciences.",,55,0,0,23,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2021,196,1,,,,,185,194,,10.1007/s00442-021-04919-6,,APR 2021,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SF9EK,WOS:000639715700001,33847804,,,,2021-09-30,

Theory predicts that males facing risk of sperm competition should evolve traits to secure their reproductive success. If those traits are costly to females, the evolution of such traits may also increase conflict between the sexes. Conversely, under the absence of sperm competition, one expectation is for selection on male competitive traits to relax thereby also relaxing sexual conflict. Experimental evolution studies are a powerful tool to test this expectation. Studies in multiple insect species have yielded mixed and partially conflicting results. In this study, we evaluated male competitive traits and male effects on female costs of mating in Drosophila melanogaster after replicate lines evolved for more than 50 generations either under enforced monogamy or sustained polygamy, thus manipulating the extent of intrasexual competition between males. We found that in a setting where males competed directly with a rival male for access to a female and fertilization of her ova polygamous males had superior reproductive success compared to monogamous males. When comparing reproductive success solely in double mating standard sperm competition assays, however, we found no difference in male sperm defense competitiveness between the different selection regimes. Instead, we found monogamous males to be inferior in precopulatory competition, which indicates that in our system, enforced monogamy relaxed selection on traits important in precopulatory rather than postcopulatory competition. We discuss our findings in the context of findings from previous experimental evolution studies in Drosophila ssp. and other invertebrate species.","[Wensing, Kristina U.; Koppik, Mareike; Fricke, Claudia] Univ Munster, Inst Evolut & Biodivers, Munster, Germany; [Wensing, Kristina U.] Univ Munster, Muenster Grad Sch Evolut, Munster, Germany","Wensing, KU (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Inst Evolut & Biodivers, Munster, Germany.",kristina.wensing@uni-muenster.de,"Fricke, Claudia/M-6536-2014","Fricke, Claudia/0000-0002-0691-6779; Koppik, Mareike/0000-0002-3433-7248",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [FR2973/1-1],"DFG, Grant/Award Number: FR2973/1-1",,81,4,4,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In contrast, nothing is known about plastic responses to the density of competitors, which could signal the potential for food limitation or predation risk. We studied effects on trophic morphology of culturing sand dollar pluteus larvae with limiting or saturating food and at low or high density using 1 of 3 potential competitors: feeding conspecifics, feeding heterospecifics, and non-feeding heterospecifics. We hypothesized that feeding competitors would induce a morphological response similar to limiting food, while the effect of non-feeders would depend on whether larvae respond directly to higher density or indirectly to food reduction. Plutei cultured with limited food grew longer feeding arms and shorter stomachs, though only in higher density treatments. Whereas the response to food involved a tradeoff between skeleton and stomach growth, larvae responded to high density by in creasing in vestment in both, reflecting a more complex set of energetic tradeoffs. Similar responses to the presence of feeding and non-feeding larvae implicate a sensory mechanism involving signals from potential competitors rather than a food decline. Patterns in 2 literature surveys of laboratory experiments and field studies suggest that culture density is a critical but neglected aspect of experimental design in the study of early life-history stages. Larvae are most likely exposed to densities sufficient to induce plasticity following synchronous spawning, highlighting the importance of natural history in understanding density-dependent effects on developmental plasticity.","[Kacenas, Suzanne E.; Podolsky, Robert D.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Grice Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA","Podolsky, RD (corresponding author), Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Grice Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.",podolskyr@cofc.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0621467],"We thank R.

This poses new challenges to the service matching between supply-side and demand-side. In order to meet this challenge, it is necessary to conduct a complexity analysis of social manufacturing. Traditional researches mainly rely on data statistics and macro analysis, in which there are difficulties in clearly identifying the links between various impact factors and macro evolution phenomena. In order to change such a situation, this paper proposes a modeling framework of social manufacturing from the aspect of social learning evolution (SLE), including individual evolution model, organizational learning model, and social learning model.

Trees compete above and below ground with neighbours, but the extent of such a neighbourhood and the relative importance of above- or below-ground neighbours in determining tree growth rates remain poorly understood. We combined terrestrial laser scans and a root excavation campaign in the tropical planted Sardinilla forest experiment with annual diameter-at-breast height measurements to test how the crowns and root systems of five tropical tree species (N = 128) varied with biotic neighbourhood and abiotic environmental characteristics. Crown and root system extent were compared, and the Hegyi competition index calculated at three spatial scales was regressed on focal tree biomass. We identified which neighbourhood and environmental variables explained most of the variation in mean crown and root system extent and compactness (a measure of morphological homogeneity) at the plot level and for species separately. Root systems were 2.6 +/- 1.1 times wider than crowns on average and focal tree biomass was the best predicted by competition with near neighbours. At the plot level, more variation in crown and root system traits was explained by biotic than abiotic characteristics (65.8 and 26.0%, respectively). More intense competition in the near neighbourhood reduced crown extent of one study species (Anacardium excelsum) and root system extent of 4 out of 5 study species, and it also led to more compact crowns and root systems of Tabebuia rosea. After accounting for spatial autocorrelation in focal tree location, soil nitrogen concentration was not found to significantly affect the studied morphological traits. These results emphasize the role of competition in determining tree morphology generally, while also supporting the claim that competition operates distinctly above and below ground.","[Madsen, Christopher; Potvin, Catherine] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Ave Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Kunz, Matthias; von Oheimb, Goddert] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Pienner Str 7, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany; [von Oheimb, Goddert] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv HalleJena, Deutsch Pl 5E, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Hall, Jefferson; Sinacore, Katherine; Turner, Benjamin L.; Potvin, Catherine] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama","Madsen, C (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Ave Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",madsen.chris26@gmail.com,"Turner, Benjamin L/E-5940-2011","Turner, Benjamin L/0000-0002-6585-0722","NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [223445]; Canada Research ChairNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs; NSERC Create Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Sustainability (BESS) program fellowship; Centre Detude de la Foret; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv); Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute","This work was supported by the NSERC Discovery Grant to CP (grant number 223445); Canada Research Chair to CP; NSERC Create Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Sustainability (BESS) program fellowship to CM; Centre Detude de la Foret funding to CM; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) to MK; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for long-term support of the Sardinilla plantation.",,72,0,0,3,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Location Seminatural meadow in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. Methods We used biomass fluctuation data from a 13-year removal experiment. The plots used for this study contained, following experimental removal of other species, either mycorrhizal grasses only, mycorrhizal forbs only, or their mixture (grass monocultures, forb monocultures, and mixtures, respectively). Yearly peak aboveground biomass was available from ten blocks; biomass of the mixture plots was sorted into forbs and grasses. Temporal variability was characterized by coefficient of variation (CV) and synchrony by correlation coefficient, both calculated from the time series data. Results The variability of grass monocultures was higher than the variability of forb monocultures, which was slightly lower than the variability of mixtures. The variability of both grasses and forbs was higher in the mixture, where they are in competition with the other group, than in each of their respective monocultures. The correlation coefficients between the biomass of grass and forb monocultures within blocks were mostly positive, indicating that both groups tend to have similar physiological responses to weather fluctuations. The average correlation coefficient between the forbs and grasses in the mixture plots was significantly negative, thus reflecting the effect of competition between these two community components. The CV of the sum of forb and grass monocultures was similar to the CV of mixture plots. Conclusions Only competition between grasses and forbs leads to their negative mutual correlation, i.e., to compensatory dynamics. Our results support the hypothesis that competition has a destabilizing effect on individual community components (functional groups in our case) and increases asynchrony of their fluctuations. We have not found its stabilizing effect on the total biomass.","[Leps, Jan; Smilauerova, Marie] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Leps, Jan] Biol Ctr Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Smilauer, Petr] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Ecosyst Biol, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Leps, J (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",suspa@prf.jcu.cz,"Smilauer, Petr/D-7277-2016; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013","Smilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [GACR 17-05506S],The research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GACR 17-05506S).,,38,0,0,6,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

More and more practitioners are employing this strategy, given the increasing availability of technologies that enable coordination across advertising channels in real time. However, very little is known about the instant impact of TV advertising on the effectiveness of search advertising. We take advantage of a unique opportunity for causal estimation in this research area by leveraging large exogenous variation in TV advertising expenditure over a long period, while at the same time having access to granular consumer search data under relatively stable sponsored search advertising strategies. Utilizing this novel setup, we provide the first empirical evidence that TV-moment-based search advertising could be effective for optimizing sponsored search advertising for both TV-advertised brands and their competitors. We also document the mechanisms driving such cross-channel advertising effects. Specifically, TV advertising can change the quality of online search traffic (e.g., who searches, where they search, and how they search) in the moments following a TV ad, so that an average searcher responds differently to subsequent search results.","[Liu, Jia] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hill, Shawndra] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA","Liu, J (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jialiu@ust.hk; shawndrahill@gmail.com,,,Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong GovernmentHong Kong Research Grants Council [26500019]; Microsoft Research,This work was supported by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Government [Grant 26500019].

Natural selection on codon usage to increase translation accuracy and efficiency has long been known to affect gene sequences. Such selection is stronger on highly, compared with lowly expressed genes, resulting in higher levels of codon bias within genes with higher expression levels. Additionally, selection on translation accuracy affects more strongly codons encoding conserved amino acids, since these will more often affect protein folding and/or function. By applying tests of selection on the gene sequences of the bacterium Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that both highly and lowly expressed genes display signals of selection on codon usage. Such signals are found for both conserved and less conserved amino acid positions, even within the 10% of E. coli genes expressed at the lowest levels. We further demonstrate experimentally that single synonymous codon replacements within a lowly expressed, essential gene can carry substantial effects on bacterial fitness. Combined, our results demonstrate that even within genes expressed at relatively low levels there is substantial selection on codon usage and that single synonymous codon replacements within such genes can have a marked effect on bacterial fitness.","[Yannai, Adi; Katz, Sophia; Hershberg, Ruth] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rachel & Menachem Mendelovitch Evolutionary Proc, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Ruth & Bruce Rappaport Fac Med, Haifa, Israel","Hershberg, R (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rachel & Menachem Mendelovitch Evolutionary Proc, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Ruth & Bruce Rappaport Fac Med, Haifa, Israel.",ruthersh@technion.ac.il,,,Leonard and Diane Sherman Interdisciplinary Graduate School Fellowship; ISF grant [756/17]; Rappaport Family Institute for Research in the Medical Sciences,"This work was supported by a Leonard and Diane Sherman Interdisciplinary Graduate School Fellowship (to A.Y.), by an ISF grant (No. 756/17, to R.H.) and by the Rappaport Family Institute for Research in the Medical Sciences (to R.H.).

This provides the historical context for three 'thought experiments' about other aspects of the development of academic capitalism. The first involves a reductio ad absurdum argument about different potential steps in the economization, marketization and financialization of education and research and is illustrated from recent changes in higher education. The second maps actual strategies of the entrepreneurial university and their role in shaping academic capitalism. The third speculates on possible forms of 'political' academic capitalism and their changing places in the interstices of the other trends posited in these thought experiments.

Breakthrough curves using natural sediments under different competitive conditions were generated and resulting sorption coefficients were compared. For the cationic species of atenolol (at pH = 8), the existence and dominating role of cation exchange processes were demonstrated by varying calcium concentrations. No effect of atenolol concentration on its retardation was observed within a wide concentration range. The breakthrough curve comparison of atenolol and the more hydrophobic metoprolol under constant conditions showed a significantly stronger retardation for metoprolol than for atenolol. However, additional non-polar interactions cannot explain the observed differences as they are determined to be negligible for both compounds. Due to the dominating role of cation exchange processes for the cationic species on overall sorption, a simple prediction of beta-blocker transport in the subsurface by using K-OC values derived from log K-OW-log K-OC correlations is not feasible.

In order to explore the internal mechanism behind natural succession of abandoned farmland, we test the effect of plant-soil interaction on plant growth and competitive ability through performing a pot experiment, which included three grasses in different successional stages on the Loess Plateau of China (Setaria viridis, Stipa bungeana, and Bothriochloa ischaemum) in monoculture and all possible two- and three-way combinations, along with a plant-free control pot. The plants were harvested after about 4 months, and the rhizospheric soil was collected. The bacterial communities of the soils were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Plant competition affected richness of bacterial communities. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were generally higher and Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria were lower in relative abundance in the mixed treatments associated with B. ischaemum. Photosynthetic bacterium, Genus Rhodobacter family Rhodospirillaceae, affected the growth condition and increased the competitive ability of B. ischaemum. Differences in the amounts of soil organic carbon, water-soluble organic carbon and nitrate nitrogen and available phosphorus drove the differences in bacterial communities.

In the experimental protocol with random matching of team members across decision periods, team members are found to over-contribute relative to the theoretical prediction. This result is linked to team members' beliefs that their team has lower contributions than the competing team.

Evidence from laboratory experiments with shared rents, symmetric players and either a simultaneous or a sequential move order suggests that it is an inherent advantage to move second rather than first. The reason is that first movers face strategic uncertainty, while second movers have the power to ultimately determine the outcome through their investment choices. Many first movers acknowledge this power and decrease investments below the standard prediction which is interpreted as an attempt to collude. This strategy leads to higher absolute payoffs for the first-movers compared to a situation where they do not try to establish collusion. However, relative payoffs are low since collusive outcomes are typically asymmetric to the advantage of the second mover. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A phytoplankton bloom was initiated by daily additions of mineral nutrients (ammonium and phosphate) to all mesocosm units. The addition of silicate and glucose, forming a factorial design (+Si/+C, +Si/-C, -Si/+C, -Si/-C), was intended to produce different types of growth rate limitation for the bacterial community. We here focus on the response in bacterial community composition to different nutrient situations. Phytoplankton, bacteria and viruses were enumerated by flow cytometry, while denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to track changes in the bacterial community composition. Our results showed that both glucose and silicate addition affected the bacterial community composition, with the largest effect from glucose. The initial increase in bacterial abundance was most pronounced in the glucose units. After silicate addition, highest bacterial abundance was observed in the silicate treatments where mineral nutrient competition by diatoms was expected to be highest. The major effect of glucose was expressed by the significant separation of the +C and the -C samples at the end of the experiment, while silicate addition resulted in a more stable bacterial community structure. In the unit, given both silicate and glucose, the diatoms were totally outcompeted by the bacterial community. The competitive success of the heterotrophic bacteria in C-replete situations allows the conclusion that the bacteria were not more negatively affected by low temperatures than phytoplankton.","[Topper, Birte; Larsen, Aud; Thingstad, Tron Frede; Thyrhaug, Runar; Sandaa, Ruth-Anne] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5006 Bergen, Norway","Topper, B (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Thormohlens Gate 53 B, N-5006 Bergen, Norway.",birte.topper@bio.uib.no,"Thingstad, Tron Frede/B-2254-2008","Thingstad, Tron Frede/0000-0002-5593-819X","Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [175939/S30]; strategic institution project [158936/I10]; Bjerknes Centre of Climate Research [146003/V30, 178441/S40, 184860/S30]; Norsk Hydro Produksjon AS [5404889]; Svalbard Science Forum","This work was financed by the Research Council of Norway through the International Polar Year project 175939/S30 'PAME-Nor' (IPY activity ID no. 71), with additional support from the strategic institution project 158936/I10 'Patterns in microbial diversity', Bjerknes Centre of Climate Research, Centre of Excellence Project 146003/V30, project 178441/S40 'Interact' and project 184860/S30 'MERCLIM'.

Biotic interactions should drive local adaptation when they impose consistent divergent selection; if this is common, we expect transplant experiments to detect more frequent and stronger local adaptation when biotic interactions are left intact. We tested this hypothesis using a meta-analysis of transplant experiments from >125 studies (mostly of plants). Overall, local adaptation was common, and biotic interactions affected fitness. Nevertheless, local adaptation was neither more common nor stronger when biotic interactions were left intact, either between experimental treatments within studies (control vs. biotic interactions experimentally manipulated) or between studies that used natural versus biotically altered transplant environments. However, the effect of ameliorating negative interactions varied with latitude, suggesting that interactions may promote local adaptation more often in tropical than in temperate ecosystems, although few tropical studies were available to test this. Our results suggest that biotic interactions often fail to drive local adaptation even though they strongly affect fitness, perhaps because temperate biotic environments are unpredictable at the spatiotemporal scales required for local adaptation.","[Hargreaves, Anna L.; Persi, Joshua] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Ave Dr Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Germain, Rachel M.; Bontrager, Megan; Angert, Amy L.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, 2212 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Germain, Rachel M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 2212 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bontrager, Megan; Angert, Amy L.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, 2212 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bontrager, Megan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Hargreaves, AL (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Ave Dr Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",anna.hargreaves@mcgill.ca,,,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies,"We thank the authors who made their raw data open access or provided unpublished data that enabled us to include their published studies; colleagues who helped extract data for the original Bontrager et al. database, particularly Liz Kleynhans, Devin Gamble, and Ken Thompson; and Patrick Thompson for code to help start phylogenetic analyses.

There is a wealth of such equations developed to incorporate the effects of multitude forms of foraging behaviour including intra-specific interference competition. However, there has been no attempt to include inter-specific behaviours beyond the obvious consumer-resource relationship, and thus, mechanistic models of communities and ecosystems remain limited in their incorporation of individual behaviour. In this paper we extend existing functional response models to account for both intra- and inter-specific interference behaviours. Together with response surface experiments, these can be used to investigate the role of both types of interference for a given species' resource acquisition efficiency. We illustrate this with data from foraging trials of guppies Poecilia reticulata in the presence and absence of a competitor species. Hart's killifish Rivulus hartii. Our results show that in the studied example, intra-specific interference is important and stronger than inter-specific competition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A number of studies have failed to find strong support for this assumption, thus challenging the utility of phylogenetic approaches. This gap might highlight the fact that the PDED relationship is not useful for community assembly, but it is difficult to know because the lack of a relationship might also be due to a number of biological or methodological reasons, including inappropriate phylogenies, skewed distributions of phylogenetic distances, the lack of consideration of models of trait evolution, or the absence of sufficient niche space in experimental and observational venues. Each of these limitations, separately or combined, may confound recent experimental or observational results that examine relationships between phylogenetic distance and ecological differences. Notably, common evolutionary models can support alternative conclusions about the relationship between evolutionary distances and ecological differences than typically assumed and can change interpretations of community-based phylogenetic analyses. Here we review a number of issues that may lead to confounded effects in community phylogenetic analyses. In light of these potential pitfalls, we provide a number of guidelines for researchers to follow and stress that they need to address methodological shortcomings before concluding that ecological differences are unrelated to phylogenetic distances.","[Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Higher Educ Inst, Coll Ecol & Evolut,Higher Educ Inst, State Key Lab Biocontrol,Key Lab Biodivers Dynam, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Davies, T.

(ii) If so, to whom? (iii) How much of a response? (iv) And on which products? The answers require unbiased measures of price elasticity as well as accurate estimates of competitor significance and the extent to which consumers compare prices across retailers. There are two key challenges to quantify these factors empirically: first, the endogeneity associated with almost any type of observational data, where prices are correlated with demand shocks observable to pricing managers but not to researchers, and second, the absence of competitor sales information, which prevents efficient estimation of a full consumer-choice model. We address the first issue by conducting a field experiment with randomized prices. We resolve the second issue by exploiting the retailer's own and competitors' stockouts as a source of variation to the consumer choice set, in addition to variations in competitors' prices. We estimate an empirical model capturing consumer choices among substitutable products from multiple retailers. Based on the estimates, we propose and test a best-response pricing strategy through a carefully controlled live experiment that lasts five weeks. The experiment documents an 11% revenue increase while maintaining a margin above a retailer-specified target.","[Fisher, Marshall] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gallino, Santiago] Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Li, Jun] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Fisher, M (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",fisher@wharton.upenn.edu; santiago.gallino@tuck.dartmouth.edu; junwli@umich.edu,,,Wharton Global Initiatives program; Fishman-Davidson Center at the Wharton School of Business,The financial support of the Wharton Global Initiatives program and the Fishman-Davidson Center at the Wharton School of Business is gratefully acknowledged.,,34,31,32,4,77,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",0025-1909,1526-5501,,MANAGE SCI,Manage.

This vocal behaviour is highly contagious, travelling from one neighbouring group to the next, until a wide forest area is covered by calling monkeys. Chorusing usually occurs up to 2 h before dawn, sometimes more than once, unless the preceding night was cold and wet. We conducted a series of playback experiments, which showed that guerezas' chorusing was difficult to elicit experimentally, suggesting that callers took several variables into account before responding to other monkeys' predawn calls. Acoustic analyses showed that morning calls were individually distinct, but we found no evidence that callers took individual identity into account in their decision to participate in chorusing. The only way to reliably elicit chorusing in our study area was to broadcast recordings of morning choruses for longer than 30 s and at a time when a chorus simultaneously emerged in a distant part of the forest.","[Schel, Anne Marijke] Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Schel, Anne Marijke; Zuberbuehler, Klaus] Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Schel, Anne Marijke; Zuberbuehler, Klaus] Budongo Conservat Field Stn, Masindi, Uganda","Schel, AM (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",annemschel@gmail.com,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X",European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Schure Beijerinck Poppink Fonds and Dobberke Stichting from the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie vanWetenschappen (KNAW),"We thank the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland for providing core funding for the Budongo Conservation Field Station.

Some evidence from experimental economics suggests that one reason for this imbalance is that women shy away from competition. However, most of these studies have focused on competition systems that pit individuals against each other. We present an economic laboratory experiment that compares competition against others with competition against a set target. The crucial difference is that whereas the former involves competing against opponents, the latter does not. Our results show that significantly more women are willing to compete against a set target than against others. Furthermore, there is no reduction in men's participation and no general efficiency reduction. Our findings suggest that firms that aim at value co-creation and sustainability through a gender-neutral promotion mechanism should introduce competition against a set target and reduce competition against others.

To test whether these effects also hold true for the invader establishment phase beyond the seedling stage, we studied survival and performance of Centaurea jacea L. (brown knapweecl) planted into experimental grassland communities of varying plant biodiversity over three consecutive years. Moreover, we analysed the role of insect herbivory and biomass of the recipient community for mediating diversity effects. Methods In 2005, seedlings of Centaurea were transplanted into experimental grassland communities (the Jena Experiment) covering a species richness (1-60) and functional group richness (1-4) gradient. Half of these transplants and the community surrounding them in each plot were sprayed with insecticide while the other half served as control. In 2006 and 2007 (during the second and third year after transplantation), we recorded survival, growth-related (e.g. transplant biomass, height) and reproduction-related traits (e.g. number of flower heads). Annual data on community aboveground biomass served as covariate to investigate mediating effects of aboveground competition with the recipient community. Important Findings Species richness was the most important factor responsible for Centaurea limitation. Higher levels of diversity decreased survival and all performance traits in both years. These diversity effects were partly driven by community biomass, but not fully explained by that covariate, suggesting the importance also of further processes. The influence of functional group richness was strong in the second year after transplantation and weaker in the third year. Among the particular functional groups, only the presence of legumes showed strong negative effects on Centaurea survival and weak negative effects on growth and reproduction, the latter two being mediated by biomass. Insect herbivore reduction considerably benefited Centaurea in sprayed monocultures, where it grew significantly larger than in all other diversity levels and than in the control subplots. We conclude that effects of plant community properties on invading individuals change in the course of establishment, that plant species richness effects are also important during later stages of establishment, and that biomass (especially at high diversity) and herbivory (especially at low diversity) of the recipient community are important in mediating community effects on invaders.","[Nitschke, Norma; Ebeling, Anne; Scherber, Christoph; Creutzburg, Sylvia; Weigelt, Alexandra; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Ebeling, Anne; Scherber, Christoph; Tscharntke, Teja] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Rottstock, Tanja; Fischer, Markus] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Middelhoff, Cornelius] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol 1, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland","Nitschke, N (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",norma.nitschke@uni-jena.de,"Scherber, Christoph/B-6611-2009; Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014; Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014","Scherber, Christoph/0000-0001-7924-8911; Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Nitschke, Norma/0000-0002-4351-0735",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 456 WE 2618/6-1],FUNDING Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG (FOR 456 WE 2618/6-1 to WWW).,,55,11,11,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Forest ecosystems, for example, are subject to a change in species composition due to the invasion of exotic species. Specifying the attributes that cause the strong competitiveness of several exotic species may improve the ability to understand and effectively manage plant invasions in the future. In this study the following hypotheses were tested: (1) biomass production of below- and aboveground plant components of the exotic tree species is higher than that of the natives, resulting in a higher competitiveness of the exotics; (2) the exclusion of root competition has a positive effect on the biomass production of the inferior native species; and (3) mixtures of native and exotic species yield a higher biomass production than the respective monocultures. A pot experiment, containing about 2000 tree seedlings, was established. We investigated the biomass productivity and growth reactions of two native (Quercus robur L., Carpinus betulus L.) and two exotic tree species (Prunus serotina Ehrh., Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in different intra- and interspecific, competitive situations with and without the influence of root competition. The biomass production of both exotic species was significantly higher and led to a strong competitive advantage, resulting in a biomass decrease of the less competitive native species. The high belowground biomass of both exotic species had a negative effect on the biomass production. The competitive pressure of exotic tree seedlings on the native ones was largely driven by root competition. Furthermore, mixtures of native and exotic tree species had a higher productivity than their growth in monocultures would have predicted. Competition was lower for exotic species in mixtures with the less productive native species compared to the competition in monocultures or in mixture with the other highly productive exotic species. Accordingly, both highly competitive exotic species produced less biomass in mixture with each other compared to monocultures. Despite the significantly higher biomass of P. serotina in all mixtures and in monoculture, R. pseudoacacia seemed to be the dominating species. Due to its strong root competition, R. pseudoacacia significantly reduced the biomass production of P. serotina.","[Kawaletz, Heike; Annighoefer, Peter; Ammer, Christian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Moelder, Inga] Energieagentur Reg Gottingen eV, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Zerbe, Stefan; Terwei, Andre] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy","Kawaletz, H (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",hkawale@gwdg.de,"Ammer, Christian/ABG-4629-2020; Annighofer, Peter/AAS-8418-2021; Ammer, Christian/ABG-7360-2020","Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135; Annighofer, Peter/0000-0001-8126-5307; ",Marianne and Dr. Fritz-Walter Fischer Foundation within the Stifterverband fur die Deutsche Wissenschaft; DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) VIGONI programDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"We would like to thank the Marianne and Dr. Fritz-Walter Fischer Foundation within the Stifterverband fur die Deutsche Wissenschaft for funding our research and the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) VIGONI program for supporting project-based exchange.

Hemiparasites can reduce host biomass, and in this way considerably affect the whole plant community. To investigate these effects, we carried out two experiments in an oligotrophic meadow with a native population of Rhinanthus minor. In the first experiment, removal of R. minor was combined with fertilization in a factorial design, and in the second one, we manipulated R. minor density by thinning. The presence of R. minor decreased the biomass of its host community, mostly by suppressing grasses. In this way, the species was able to counterbalance the effect of fertilization, which increased community biomass and in particular that of grasses. Neither the presence of R. minor nor fertilization affected the total number of species or the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') of the host community. However, H' of grasses was higher and H' of forbs (non-leguminous dicots) was lower in the presence of R. minor. Reduction of grasses by R. minor favored mainly the dominant forb Plantago lanceolata, which partly acquired the role of a competitive dominant. Effects of R. minor on community diversity seem to be highly dependent on the relative sensitivities of dominant and subordinate species. Fertilization increased the mortality of seedlings, resulting in a lower number of flowering plants. However, surviving individuals on average produced more flowers. Thinning resulted in lower mortality of R. minor plants. This indicates that intraspecific competition in R. minor populations results in negative density dependence.","[Mudrak, Ondrej; Leps, Jan] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Mudrak, Ondrej] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, Sect Plant Ecol, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic; [Leps, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Ctr Biol, Inst Entomol, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Mudrak, Ondrej] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Ctr Biol, Inst Soil Biol, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Mudrak, O (corresponding author), Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Branisovska 31, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",ondrej.mudrak@centrum.cz,"Mudrak, Ondrej/H-1614-2014; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013","Mudrak, Ondrej/0000-0001-7775-0414; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429", [GAAV IAA601410805];  [AV0Z60660521];  [AV0Z60050516];  [MSMT 6007665801],"The research was supported by grants GAAV IAA601410805, AV0Z60660521, AV0Z60050516, and MSMT 6007665801.

Parker recognized that because female animals frequently mate with more than one male, sexual selection would continue after mating and impose strong selection on sperm cells to maximize fertilization success. Comparative analyses among species have revealed a general relationship between the strength of selection from sperm competition and the length of sperm cells and their constituent parts. However, comparative analyses cannot address causation. Here, we use experimental evolution to ask whether sexual selection can drive the divergence of sperm cell phenotype, using the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus as a model. We either relaxed sexual selection by enforcing monogamy or allowed sexual selection to continue for 20 generations before sampling males and measuring the total length of sperm cells and their constituent parts, the acrosome, nucleus, and flagella. We found differences in the length of the sperm cell nucleus but no differences in the length of the acrosome, flagella, or total sperm length. Our data suggest that different sperm cell components may respond independently to sexual selection and contribute to the divergent evolution of these extraordinary cells.","[Simmons, Leigh W.; Garcia-Gonzalez, Francisco] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci M092, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Crawley 6009, Australia; [Garcia-Gonzalez, Francisco] Donana Biol Stn CSIC, C Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain","Simmons, LW (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci M092, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Crawley 6009, Australia.",leigh.simmons@uwa.edu.au; paco.garcia@ebd.csic.es,"Simmons, Leigh W/B-1815-2011","Simmons, Leigh W/0000-0003-0562-1474",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,This research received funding from the Australian Research Council.,,71,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4409,,CELLS-BASEL,Cells,MAY,2021,10,5,,,,,,,1227,10.3390/cells10051227,,,11,Cell Biology,Cell Biology,SI2JS,WOS:000654652800001,34067752,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-30,

Sexual selection is generally believed to be responsible for these patterns of evolutionary divergence, although empirical support for the sexual selection hypothesis comes mainly from studies of insects. Here we show that sexual selection is responsible for an evolutionary divergence in baculum morphology among populations of house mice Mus domesticus. We sourced mice from three isolated populations known to be subject to differing strengths of postcopulatory sexual selection and bred them under common-garden conditions. Mice from populations with strong postcopulatory sexual selection had bacula that were relatively thicker compared with mice from populations with weak selection. We used experimental evolution to determine whether these patterns of divergence could be ascribed to postcopulatory sexual selection. After 27 generations of experimental evolution, populations of mice subjected to postcopulatory sexual selection evolved bacula that were relatively thicker than populations subjected to enforced monogamy. Our data thereby provide evidence that postcopulatory sexual selection underlies an evolutionary divergence in the mammalian baculum and supports the hypothesis that sexual selection plays a general role in the evolution of male genital morphology across evolutionary diverse taxonomic groups.","[Simmons, Leigh W.; Firman, Renee C.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol M092, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Simmons, LW (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol M092, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",leigh.simmons@uwa.edu.au,"Simmons, Leigh W/B-1815-2011","Simmons, Leigh W/0000-0003-0562-1474",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"The authors thank F.

We recently showed that populations of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta subjected to extreme larval crowding evolved greater competitive ability without evolving higher feeding rates, primarily through a combination of reduced larval duration, faster attainment of minimum critical size for pupation, greater efficiency of food conversion to biomass, increased pupation height and, perhaps, greater urea/ammonia tolerance. This was a very different suite of traits than that seen to evolve under similar selection in D. melanogaster and was closer to the expectations from the theory of K-selection. At that time, we suggested two possible reasons for the differences in the phenotypic correlates of greater competitive ability seen in the studies with D. melanogaster and the other two species. First, that D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta had a very different genetic architecture of traits affecting competitive ability compared to the long-term laboratory populations of D. melanogaster used in the earlier studies, either because the populations of the former two species were relatively recently wild-caught, or by virtue of being different species. Second, that the different evolutionary trajectories in D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta versus D. melanogaster were a reflection of differences in the manner in which larval crowding was imposed in the two sets of selection experiments. The D. melanogaster studies used a higher absolute density of eggs per unit volume of food, and a substantially larger total volume of food, than the studies on D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta. Here, we show that long-term laboratory populations of D. melanogaster, descended from some of the populations used in the earlier studies, evolve essentially the same set of traits as the D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta crowding-adapted populations when subjected to a similar larval density at low absolute volumes of food. As in the case of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta, and in stark contrast to earlier studies with D. melanogaster, these crowding-adapted populations of D. melanogaster did not evolve greater larval feeding rates as a correlate of increased competitive ability. The present results clearly suggest that the suite of phenotypes through which the evolution of greater competitive ability is achieved in fruitflies depends critically not just on larval density per unit volume of food, but also on the total amount of food available in the culture vials. We discuss these results in the context of an hypothesis about how larval density and the height of the food column in culture vials might interact to alter the fitness costs and benefits of increased larval feeding rates, thus resulting in different routes to the evolution of greater competitive ability, depending on the details of exactly how the larval crowding was implemented.","[Sarangi, Manaswini; Nagarajan, Archana; Dey, Snigdhadip; Bose, Joy; Joshi, Amitabh] Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Evolutionary & Organismal Biol Unit, Evolutionary Biol Lab, Jakkur PO, Bengaluru 560064, India; [Nagarajan, Archana] Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, Ctr Organelle Res CORE, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Dey, Snigdhadip] Ecole Normale Super, Dept Biol, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France","Joshi, A (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Evolutionary & Organismal Biol Unit, Evolutionary Biol Lab, Jakkur PO, Bengaluru 560064, India.",ajoshi@jncasr.ac.in,,"Nagarajan, Archana/0000-0002-3895-4200","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of IndiaCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific ResearchDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Department of Science and Technology, Government of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India); J.

Reactions to competition are known to be gendered, as women are significantly more aware of and averse to the potential negative effects of competition-risk and loss-than are men. Participants (n = 1296) completed an experiment involving a non-political competitive task, where they were randomly assigned to receive a negative cue about their individual or gendered group's poor performance. Following this, we assessed their levels of political ambition, efficacy, interest, and sexism. We hypothesize that: (1) negative performance feedback on a competitive task will decrease political ambition, efficacy, and interest among women; and (2) men who receive negative feedback about their performance relative to women will report higher levels of sexism. We use a non-binary measure of masculinity/femininity that helps explain how gender identity affects these outcomes. Evidence does not support the conclusion that negative feedback about competition contributes to women's lower levels of psychological engagement with politics. However, results show that negative performance feedback, particularly when it is relative to women, increases sexism in men. Furthermore, the effect of negative feedback on sexism is larger when men identify more strongly as masculine. We argue that threatening men's relative performance partly explains larger trends of backlash against women in politics.","[Mansell, Jordan] Western Univ, London, ON, Canada; [Mansell, Jordan; Harell, Allison; Gosselin, Tania] Univ Quebec Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Thomas, Melanee] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","Mansell, J (corresponding author), Western Univ, London, ON, Canada.; Mansell, J (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",jmansel3@uwo.ca,,,,,,75,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0190-9320,1573-6687,,POLIT BEHAV,Polit.

In hermaphroditic organisms, such as many plants, sexual conflict may occur both between mating partners (interlocus conflict) and between male and female sex roles within an individual (intralocus conflict). We performed experimental evolution, involving lines that were crossed with either one or two pollen donors (monogamous or polyandrous lines), in the hermaphroditic plant (Collinsia heterophylla) where early fertilizations are associated with female fitness costs (reduced seed set). Artificial polyandry for four generations resulted in enhanced pollen performance and increased female fitness costs compared to the monogamous and source (starting material) lines. Female fitness was also reduced in the monogamous line, indicating a possible trade-off between sex roles, resulting from early pollination. We performed a second experiment to investigate a potential harming effect of pollen performance on seed set. We found that high siring success of early arriving pollen competing with later-arriving pollen was associated with high female fitness costs, consistent with an interlocus sexual conflict. Our study provides evidence for the importance of sexual selection in shaping evolution of plant reproductive strategies, but also pinpoints the complexity of sexual conflict in hermaphroditic species.","[Lankinen, Asa; Hydbom, Sofia; Strandh, Maria] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Deparment Plant Protect Biol, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Hydbom, Sofia; Strandh, Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Lankinen, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Deparment Plant Protect Biol, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",asa.lankinen@slu.se,,,Carl Trygger Foundation; Crafoord Foundation; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Gosta and Anna-Birgit Henriksson Foundation,"This research was supported by the Carl Trygger Foundation, the Crafoord Foundation, the Swedish Research Council to AL, the Gosta and Anna-Birgit Henriksson Foundation to MS.

This competition within the nasal microbial community would add to known host factors that affect colonization. We tested the role of toxin-mediated interference competition in bothstructured and unstructured environments, by culturing S. aureus with toxin-producing or nonproducing Staphylococcus epidermidis nasal isolates. Toxin-producing S.epidermidis invaded S.aureus populations more successfully than nonproducers, and invasion was promoted by spatial structure. Complete displacement of S.aureus was prevented by the evolution of toxin resistance. Conversely, toxin-producing S.epidermidis restricted S.aureus invasion. Invasion of toxin-producing S.epidermidis populations by S.aureus resulted from the evolution of toxin resistance, which was favoured by high initial frequency and low spatial structure. Enhanced toxin production also evolved in some invading populations of S.epidermidis. Toxin production therefore promoted invasion by, and constrained invasion into, populations of producers. Spatial structure enhanced both of these invasion effects. Our findings suggest that manipulation of the nasal microbial community could be used to limit colonization by S.aureus, which might limit transmission and infection rates.","[Libberton, Ben; Horsburgh, Malcolm J.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Integrat Biol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Brockhurst, Michael A.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Libberton, Ben] Karolinska Inst, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden","Libberton, B (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Retzius Vag 8, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",benjamin.libberton@ki.se,,"Brockhurst, Michael/0000-0003-0362-820X; Libberton, Ben/0000-0001-9104-679X",BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/D526529/1],This study was supported by a BBSRC studentship (BB/D526529/1) to B.L. awarded to M.A.B. and M.J.H.,,58,15,15,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1752-4571,,,EVOL APPL,Evol.

In this study, differences in morphological plasticity were investigated using young-of-year pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) from native North American and non-native European populations. Two Canadian populations, isolated from bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus) since the last glaciation, and two Spanish populations, isolated from bluegill since their introduction in Europe, were reared in a common environment using artificial enclosures. Fish were subjected to allopatric (without bluegill) or sympatric (with bluegill) conditions, and differences in plasticity were tested through a MANOVA of discriminant function scores. All pumpkinseed populations exhibited dietary shifts towards more benthivorous prey when held with bluegill. Differences between North American and European populations were observed in body dimensions, gill raker length and pelvic fin position. Sympatric treatments induced an increase in body width and a decrease in caudal peduncle length in native fish; non-native fish exhibited longer caudal peduncle lengths when held in sympatry with bluegill. Overall, phenotypic plasticity influenced morphological divergence less than genetic factors, regardless of population. Contrary to predictions, pumpkinseeds from Europe exhibited lower levels of phenotypic plasticity than Canadian populations, suggesting that European pumpkinseeds are more canalized than their North American counterparts.","[Yavno, Stan; Rooke, Anna C.] Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Fox, Michael G.] Trent Univ, Environm & Resources Studies Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Fox, Michael G.] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada","Yavno, S (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.",stanyavno@trentu.ca,"Rooke, Anna/AAN-8486-2020; Yavno, Stan/C-4051-2008","Rooke, Anna/0000-0001-7258-9094; Yavno, Stan/0000-0002-4079-0647","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities in the form of Ontario Graduate Scholarships","We thank C.

We hypothesised that the native non-pest rodent Rattus everetti may be competitively dominant over the invasive pest rodent Rattus tanezumi within agroforests. We tested this experimentally by using pulse removal for three consecutive months to reduce populations of R. everetti in agroforest habitat, and assessed over 6 months the response of R. tanezumi and other rodent species. RESULTS: Following removal, R. everetti individuals rapidly immigrated into removal sites. At the end of the study period, R. tanezumi were larger and there was a significant shift in their microhabitat use with respect to the use of ground vegetation cover following the perturbation of R. everetti. Irrespective of treatment, R. tanezumi selected microhabitat with less tree canopy cover, indicative of severely disturbed habitat, whereas R. everetti selected microhabitat with a dense canopy. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that sustained habitat disturbance in agroforests favours R. tanezumi, while the regeneration of agroforests towards a more natural state would favour native species and may reduce pest pressure in adjacent crops. In addition, the rapid recolonisation of R. everetti suggests this species would be able to recover from non-target impacts of short-term rodent pest control.

However, it is hypothesized that mutating specific backbone peptide bonds with bioisosters can be exploited not only to enhance the proteolytic stability of parent peptides, but also to tune its receptor subtype selectivity. Towards this end, four [Y](6)-Angiotensin II analogues are synthesized where amide bonds have been replaced by 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole isosteres in four different backbone locations. All the analogues possessed enhanced stability in human plasma in comparison with the parent peptide, whereas only two of them achieved enhanced AT(2)R/AT(1)R subtype selectivity. This diversification has been studied through 2D NMR spectroscopy and unveiled a putative more structured microenvironment for the two selective ligands accompanied with increased number of NOE cross-peaks. The most potent analogue, compound 2, has been explored regarding its neurotrophic potential and resulted in an enhanced neurite growth with respect to the established agent C21.","[Vrettos, Eirinaios, I; Bekas, Nick; Tzakos, Andreas G.; Stylos, Evgenios K.] Univ Ioannina, Dept Chem, Ioannina 45110, Greece; [Hirmiz, Baydaa; Del Borgo, Mark; Aguilar, MarieIsabel; Widdop, Robert E.] Monash Univ, Monash Biomed Discovery Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Hirmiz, Baydaa; Del Borgo, Mark; Aguilar, MarieIsabel] Monash Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Widdop, Robert E.] Monash Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Valverde, Ibai E.; Mascarin, Alba; Mindt, Thomas L.] Univ Basel Hosp, Div Radio Pharmaceut Chem, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; [Valverde, Ibai E.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Inst Chim Mol, UMR 6302, CNRS,Univ Bourgogne ICMUB, 9 Ave Alain Savary, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Mindt, Thomas L.] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Biomed Imaging & Image Guided Therapy, Vienna, Austria; [Mindt, Thomas L.] Gen Hosp Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Inst Appl Diagnost, Vienna, Austria; [Mindt, Thomas L.] Univ Vienna, Inst Inorgan Chem, Fac Chem, Vienna, Austria; [Pallier, Patrick N.; Waqif, Emal; MichaelTitus, Adina T.] Queen Mary Univ London, Ctr Neurosci & Trauma, Blizard Inst, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, 4 Newark St, London E1 2AT, England; [Ghazaly, Essam] Queen Mary Univ London, Ctr Haemato Oncol, Barts Canc Inst, London, England; [Fragai, Marco; Parigi, Giacomo; Luchinat, Claudio] Univ Florence, Ctr Magnet Resonance, CERM, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Syed, Nelofer] Imperial Coll London, John Fulcher Neuro Oncol Lab, Fac Med, London W6 8RP, England; [Crook, Timothy] Oncol Care, 95 Harley St, London W1G 6AF, England; [Grob, Nathalie M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Magnani, Francesca] Univ Pavia, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Lazzaro Spallanzani, Pavia, Italy; [Cerofolini, Linda; Fragai, Marco; Parigi, Giacomo; Luchinat, Claudio] Univ Florence, Consorzio Interuniv Risonanze Magnet MetalloProt, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Shaye, Hamidreza; Cherezov, Vadim] Univ Southern Calif, Bridge Inst, Dept Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Tzakos, AG (corresponding author), Univ Ioannina, Dept Chem, Ioannina 45110, Greece.; Mindt, TL (corresponding author), Univ Basel Hosp, Div Radio Pharmaceut Chem, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.; Mindt, TL (corresponding author), Med Univ Vienna, Dept Biomed Imaging & Image Guided Therapy, Vienna, Austria.; Mindt, TL (corresponding author), Gen Hosp Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Inst Appl Diagnost, Vienna, Austria.; Mindt, TL (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Inst Inorgan Chem, Fac Chem, Vienna, Austria.",thomas.mindt@lbiad.lbg.ac.at; atzakos@uoi.gr,"Valverde, Ibai E./O-2631-2017; Parigi, Giacomo/A-4329-2018; Magnani, Francesca/AAL-9945-2020; Kerwash, Essam Ghazaly/J-5367-2014; Parigi, Giacomo/ABF-5321-2020; Cherezov, Vadim/L-9812-2013","Valverde, Ibai E./0000-0002-5802-4131; Parigi, Giacomo/0000-0002-1989-4644; Magnani, Francesca/0000-0003-0812-9397; Kerwash, Essam Ghazaly/0000-0003-4368-8565; Parigi, Giacomo/0000-0002-1989-4644; Cherezov, Vadim/0000-0002-5265-3914; Grob, Nathalie/0000-0003-1031-5105; Pallier, Patrick/0000-0002-9001-6043","European Union (European Social Fund ESF)European Social Fund (ESF)European Commission; Greek national funds through the operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF); Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (H.F.R.I.) under the First Call for H.F.R.I.

Assortative mating may arise if traits and preferences diverge in step, and, alternatively, mate competition may counteract mating preferences and decrease assortative mating. Here, we examine potential assortative mating between populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura that have experimentally evolved under either increased ('polyandry') or decreased ('monogamy') sexual selection intensity for 100 generations. These populations have evolved differences in numerous traits, including a male signal and female preference traits. We use a two males: one female design, allowing both mate choice and competition to influence mating outcomes, to test for assortative mating between our populations. Mating latency shows subtle effects of male and female interactions, with females from the monogamous populations appearing reluctant to mate with males from the polyandrous populations. However, males from the polyandrous populations have a significantly higher probability of mating regardless of the female's population. Our results suggest that if populations differ in the intensity of sexual selection, effects on mate competition may overcome mate choice.","[Debelle, A.] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Ritchie, M.

Some seeds exude compounds that inhibit the germination of others. Ipomoea murucoides and I. pauciflora are sympatric tree species that form patches at the local scale where one or the other dominates, possibly due to allelopathy in the seeds. The objective of this study was to determine the possible density-dependence of the allelopathic effect among seeds of these species through the measure of seed germination and seedling emergence. Methods In both species, allelopathy was measured as: a) germination in mixed sowing of both species at different proportions, b) germination in single-species trials at different densities after adding seed extracts of both species, and c) seedling emergence in seed mixtures of both species sown at different proportions beneath canopies of the two Ipomoea species. Results Seed germination of I. murucoides was increased by the presence of I. pauciflora and diminished at higher densities of its own seeds; however, seed germination of I. pauciflora was not affected by the presence of I. murucoides seeds. The addition of extracts (either from conspecifics or congeneric) diminished the germination of both species and at higher seed densities the germination was lower. Seedling emergence did not depend on the species under which the seeds were sown nor on the density of the seeds. Conclusions The germination experiments evidenced positive allelopathy and/or autotoxicity, while there was no evidence of allelopathic effects in seedling emergence. The allelopathic activity is reported in the seeds of these species for the first time.","[Mercedes Aguilar-Franco, Zoila; Flores-Morales, Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Fac Ciencias Biol, Av Univ 1001, Cuernavaca 62209, Morelos, Mexico; [Flores-Palacios, Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, CIByC, Av Univ 1001, Cuernavaca 62209, Morelos, Mexico; [Perea-Arango, Irene; de Jesus Arellano-Garcia, Jose; Valencia-Diaz, Susana] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Ctr Invest Biotecnol CEIB, Av Univ 1001, Cuernavaca 62209, Morelos, Mexico","Valencia-Diaz, S (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Ctr Invest Biotecnol CEIB, Av Univ 1001, Cuernavaca 62209, Morelos, Mexico.",susana.valencia@uaem.mx,"Valencia-diaz, Susana/ABB-4670-2020; Flores-Palacios, Alejandro/T-7074-2017","Flores-Palacios, Alejandro/0000-0002-2000-9964; Perea, Irene/0000-0003-1944-4739","Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente (PRODEP) [carta de liberacion DSA/103.5/1516986, UAEMOR-PTC-375]; PRODEP","This study was funded by the Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente (PRODEP, No. carta de liberacion DSA/103.5/1516986, Folio asignado a profesor UAEMOR-PTC-375).

Functional and phylogenetic diversity (FD and PD respectively) of the resident community are expected to exert a key role in community resistance to colonization by surrounding species, and their establishment success. However, few studies have explored this topic experimentally or evaluated the interactive effects of these diversity measures. 2. We implemented a diversity experiment to disentangle the role of FD and PD by sowing mixtures of 6 species, drawn from a pool of 19 species naturally coexisting in central European mesic meadows. The mixtures were designed to cover four independent combinations of high and low FD and PD. Species covers were estimated in spring and late summer over two growing seasons. We then assessed the establishment success of colonizers as a function of their mean traits and phylogenetic distance to the resident (i.e. sown) communities, as well as the resistance of the resident communities to natural colonizers as a function of their functional and phylogenetic structure. 3. Results generally indicated a temporal shift regarding which trait values made a colonizer successful, from an acquisitive strategy in early stages to a more conservative trait syndrome in later stages. 4. FD decreased community resistance to natural colonization. However, PD tempered this effect: with high PD, FD was not significant, suggesting complementary information between these two components of biodiversity. On average, colonizing species were more functionally distant from the resident species in sown communities with high functional diversity, i.e. those that were more colonized. 5. Synthesis. Our results confirm an interplay between FD and PD during community assembly processes, namely resistance to colonizers, suggesting that these two descriptors of biodiversity only partially overlap in their contribution to the overall ecological structure of a community. The hypothesis that higher FD increases resistance through a more complete use of resources was challenged. Results rather suggested that greater FD could provide an unsaturated functional trait space allowing functionally unique species to occupy it.","[Galland, Thomas; Dvorakova, Hana; E-Vojtko, Anna; Puy, Javier; Blazek, Petr; Leps, Jan; de Bello, Francesco; Valencia, Enrique; Gotzenberger, Lars] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Galland, Thomas; E-Vojtko, Anna; Lanta, Vojtech; Gotzenberger, Lars] Czech Acad Sci, Dept Bot, Trebon, Czech Republic; [Adeux, Guillaume] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, Dijon, France; [Adeux, Guillaume] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Life Sci, Pisa, Italy; [Orban, Ildiko] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Plant Systemat Ecol & Theoret Biol, Budapest, Hungary; [Orban, Ildiko] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Vacratot, Hungary; [Lussu, Michele] Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Sez Bot, Cagliari, Italy; [Leps, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Biol Ctr, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [de Bello, Francesco] CSIC, CIDE, Valencia, Spain; [Perez Carmona, Carlos] Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Valencia, Enrique] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Mostoles, Spain","Galland, T (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.; Galland, T (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Dept Bot, Trebon, Czech Republic.",galland.thom@gmail.com,"Valencia, Enrique/AAR-1438-2021; Puy, Javier/ABH-8775-2020; Carmona, Carlos P./J-1536-2012; Lanta, Vojtech/J-7032-2017; Gotzenberger, Lars/H-1587-2014; Blazek, Petr/AAW-8682-2020; E-Vojtko, Anna/AAO-9561-2020; de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013","Puy, Javier/0000-0002-6422-2791; Carmona, Carlos P./0000-0001-6935-4913; Lanta, Vojtech/0000-0003-4484-3838; Gotzenberger, Lars/0000-0003-3040-2900; Blazek, Petr/0000-0002-0901-4578; E-Vojtko, Anna/0000-0001-6370-680X; Orban, Ildiko/0000-0003-1547-675X; Valencia, Enrique/0000-0003-3359-0759; ADEUX, Guillaume/0000-0003-0903-391X; Galland, Thomas/0000-0003-0883-8871; Lussu, Michele/0000-0002-1313-4732; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [GA16-15012S]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [626392, PSG293, 2017-T2]; Estonian Research CouncilEstonian Research Council","Czech Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: GA16-15012S; European Commission, Grant/Award Number: 626392, PSG293, 2017 and 2017-T2; Estonian Research Council",,88,9,9,3,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Under the context of traditional teaching, this study aims to explore the manner in which students become effective in sharing knowledge to help optimize course design and improve our existing education. Design/methodology/approach Among 195 university students taking an elective, the effects of different incentives on group performance in completing tasks is explored on the basis of a randomized experiment. Findings Results show that intra-group cooperation can be helpful to student performance, whereas intra-group competition neither improves nor worsens student performance. The former is mainly driven by reciprocity, especially for that stimulated by inter-group competition, whereas the latter is stimulated by egoism. Thus, proper reciprocity can promote student behavior to increase voluntary contribution. In addition, intra-group differences do not interfere with group performance, especially task-oriented groups. Originality/value Certain suggestions are proposed to improve the curriculum design in large classrooms. Forming groups is the best way to strengthen student knowledge sharing. Within task-oriented groups, the incentives of inter-group competition can encourage students to deepen intra-group cooperation and thus effectively improve group performance under the conditions of external competition.","[Liu, Fuzhen; Wu, Jiang; Huang, Xiao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Informat Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Fuzhen] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fong, Patrick S.

In such experiments, mutations typically appear that increase the fitness under the conditions tested (medium adaptation), but that are not necessarily of interest for the specific research question. Here, we have identified mutations that appeared during serial passage of E. coli and S. enterica in four different and commonly used laboratory media and measured the relative competitive fitness and maximum growth rate of 111 genetically re-constituted strains, carrying different single and multiple mutations. Little overlap was found between the mutations that were selected in the two species and the different media, implying that adaptation occurs via different genetic pathways. Furthermore, we show that commonly occurring adaptive mutations can generate undesired genetic variation in a population and reduce the accuracy of competition experiments. However, by introducing media adaptation mutations with large effects into the parental strain that was used for the evolution experiment, the variation (standard deviation) was decreased 10-fold, and it was possible to measure fitness differences between two competitors as small as vertical bar s vertical bar < 0.001.","[Knoppel, Anna; Knopp, Michael; Albrecht, Lisa M.; Lundin, Erik; Lustig, Ulrika; Nasvall, Joakim; Andersson, Dan I.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Med Biochem & Microbiol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Knoppel, Anna] Uppsala Univ, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Uppsala, Sweden","Andersson, DI (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Med Biochem & Microbiol, Uppsala, Sweden.",dan.andersson@imbim.uu.se,"Nasvall, Joakim/F-8750-2018","Nasvall, Joakim/0000-0002-6831-3105; Knopp, Michael/0000-0002-8218-3263","Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2016-03383, 2014-4479]",This work was funded by grants from the Swedish Research Council (grant numbers 2016-03383 to DA and 2014-4479 to JN).,,73,27,27,5,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

The current work models adhesion and subsequent internalization strategy of pathogenic bacteria into mammalian cells to design a bacteriomimetic bioinvasive delivery system. We report on the surface functionalization of liposomes with a C-terminal fragment of invasin (InvA497), an invasion factor in the outer membrane of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. InvA497-functionalized liposomes adhere to mammalian epithelial HEp-2 cell line at different infection stages with a significantly higher efficiency than liposomes functionalized with bovine serum albumin. Covalent attachment of InvA497 results in higher cellular adhesion than liposomes with physically adsorbed InvA497 with nonspecific surface protein alignment. Uptake studies in HEp-2 cells indicate active internalization of InvA497-functionalized liposomes via beta(1)-integrin receptor-mediated uptake mechanism mimicking the natural invasion strategy of Y. pseudotuberculosis. Uptake studies in Caco-2 cells at different polarization states demonstrate specific targeting of the InvA497-functionalized liposomes to less polarized cells reflecting the status of inflamed cells. Moreover, when loaded with the anti-infective agent gentamicin and applied to HEp-2 cells infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis, InvA497-functionalized liposomes are able to significantly reduce the infection load relative to non-functionalized drug-loaded liposomes. This indicates a promising application of such a bacteriomimetic system for drug delivery to intracellular compartments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Sites with high nutrient availability may favor the development of dominant grasses rather than subordinate species, especially in nutrient-limited systems, such as calcareous grasslands. The aim of this experiment was to determine whether seed source influences the CE of a dominant grass on a subordinate species, and whether this relationship is mediated by nutrient availability. A greenhouse experiment with three nutrient levels was established; Dianthus carthusianorum was chosen as the subordinate phytometer to detect variation in the CE of different Festuca rubra seed sources. The grass species was sourced from 13 cultivar and 12 commercially propagated, but not selected, wild sources. When CE was calculated from biomass, propagated wild seed sources of F. rubra had a greater CE on the subordinate species than cultivars for medium and high nutrient levels. Based on phytometer height, propagated wild seed sources of F. rubra had a greater CE under all three nutrient levels. Our findings do not support the general notion that cultivars are more competitive than wild genotypes. Thus, the cultivar F. rubra may facilitate the establishment of other species during grassland restoration, particularly under elevated nutrient conditions.","[Walker, Emer A.; Conradi, Timo; Kollmann, Johannes] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Meimberg, Harald] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci BoKu, Inst Nat Conservat, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","Walker, EA (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",e.walker@tum.de,"Kollmann, Johannes/B-4255-2012","Kollmann, Johannes/0000-0002-4990-3636; Meimberg, Harald/0000-0001-6696-2649","Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst, DAADDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); German Federal Environmental Foundation, DBU; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [KO 1741/3-1]","Doctoral scholarships to EAW (Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst, DAAD) and TC (German Federal Environmental Foundation, DBU), and a DFG grant to JK (KO 1741/3-1) supported this research.

Different approaches were applied to explore the nitrogen requirements of 28 wine yeast strains. Based on the growth and fermentation behaviour displayed at different nitrogen concentrations, high and low nitrogen-demanding strains were selected and further verified by competition fermentation. Biomass production with increasing nitrogen concentrations in the exponential fermentation phase was analysed by chemostat cultures. Low nitrogen demanding (LND) strains produced a larger amount of biomass in nitrogen-limited synthetic grape musts, whereas high nitrogen-demanding (HND) strains achieved a bigger biomass yield when the YAN concentration was above 100 mg/L. Constant rate fermentation was carried out with both strains to determine the amount of nitrogen required to maintain the highest fermentation rate. Large differences appeared in the analysis of the genomes of low and high-nitrogen demanding strains showed for heterozygosity and the amino acid substitutions between orthologous proteins, with nitrogen recycling system genes showing the widest amino acid divergences. The CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome modification method was used to validate the involvement of GCN1 in the yeast strain nitrogen needs. However, the allele swapping of gene GCN1 from low nitrogen-demanding strains to high nitrogen-demanding strains did not significantly influence the fermentation rate.","[Su, Ying; Macias, Laura G.; Querol, Amparo; Manuel Guillamon, Jose] CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Biotecnol Alimentos, Valencia, Spain; [Macias, Laura G.] Univ Valencia, Dept Genet, Doctor Moliner 50, E-46100 Valencia, Spain; [Maria Heras, Jose] Lallemand Spain Portugal, C Tomas Edison 4, Madrid 28521, Spain","Guillamon, JM (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Biotecnol Alimentos, Valencia, Spain.",guillamon@iata.csic.es,"Guillamon, Jose/I-2040-2015","Guillamon, Jose/0000-0001-5414-0787","Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat ValencianaEuropean Commission [GRISOLIA/2015/030, PROMETEO/2020/014]","The authors thank Lallemand Inc.

It is, however, unclear to what extent this is driven by ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we used experimental evolution to study the eco-evolutionary feedbacks among Ralstonia solanacearum bacterial pathogen, Ralstonia-specific phage parasite, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens competitor bacterium in the laboratory and plant rhizosphere. We found that while the phage had a small effect on pathogen densities on its own, it considerably increased the R. solanacearum sensitivity to antibiotics produced by B. amyloliquefaciens. Instead of density effects, this synergy was due to phage-driven increase in phage resistance that led to trade-off with the resistance to B. amyloliquefaciens antibiotics. While no evidence was found for pathogen resistance evolution to B. amyloliquefaciens antibiotics, the fitness cost of adaptation (reduced growth) was highest when the pathogen had evolved in the presence of both parasite and competitor. Qualitatively similar patterns were found between laboratory and greenhouse experiments even though the evolution of phage resistance was considerably attenuated in the tomato rhizosphere. These results suggest that evolutionary trade-offs can impose strong constraints on disease dynamics and that combining phages and antibiotic-producing bacteria could be an efficient way to control agricultural pathogens.","[Wang, Xiaofang; Wei, Zhong; Li, Mei; Wang, Xueqi; Shan, Anqi; Mei, Xinlan; Jousset, Alexandre; Shen, Qirong; Xu, Yangchun] Nanjing Agr Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Organ Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Organ Solid Waste Utilizat, Weigang 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jousset, Alexandre] Univ Utrecht, Inst Environm Biol Ecol & Biodivers, Padualaan 8, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Friman, Ville-Petri] Univ York, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Wei, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Organ Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Organ Solid Waste Utilizat, Weigang 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",weizhong@njau.edu.cn,"Shen, Qirong/AAB-6531-2020; Jousset, Alexandre/C-7607-2011","Friman, Ville-Petri/0000-0002-1592-157X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41671248, 41301262, 41471213]; National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB150503]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20130677]; Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; 111 projectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B12009]; Qing Lan ProjectJiangsu Polytech Institute; British Ecological Society large research; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [105624]; University of YorkEuropean Commission [C2D2]; NWO project [ALW.870.15.050]; KNAW [530-5CDP18]","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41671248 and 41301262, ZW, and 41471213, YX), National Key Basic Research Program of China (2015CB150503, QS), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20130677, ZW), Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (QS), 111 project (B12009, QS), andQing Lan Project (YX and ZW).

The test is carried out by using a tilting table; in-scale models of several different perforated walls are assembled and positioned on the tilting table. The table is progressively tilted in quasi-static conditions, in order to reproduce the action of a static horizontal load proportional to masses. As a result, the model collapses for a given tilting angle, which represents the ultimate destabilizing horizontal action. The experimental setup was applied to a series of seven different masonry panels, conceived by different University teams from different countries in the context of a student competition proposed in the occasion of the 10th international Masonry Conference (10th IMC), held at the Technical University of Milan from 9th to 11th July 2018. The aim was to design a running bond shear panel with established height over length ratio, a minimum perforation ratio equal to 30% of the area and clay bricks with given dimensions disposed in either stack or running bond. The winning team was that obtaining the largest inclination angle of the tilting plane activating the collapse of the structure. Three replicates of the same experimental test were repeated in the lab of the Technical University of Milan to reduce experimental scatter of the results. In this paper we present and discuss the outcome of the experimentations carried out, in view of analyzing such results with sophisticated limit analysis approaches in the second part of the paper. The test requires simple and inexpensive instrumentation and can be adopted for a reliable prediction of the behavior of perforated shear walls in-plane loaded, assembled with dry joint bricks and horizontally loaded.","[Grillanda, Nicola; Milani, Gabriele] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Chiozzi, Andrea; Tralli, Antonio] Univ Ferrara, Dept Engn, Via Saragat 1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy","Milani, G (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",nicola.grillanda@polimi.it; andrea.chiozzi@unife.it; gabriele.milani@polimi.it,,,,,,46,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0141-0296,1873-7323,,ENG STRUCT,Eng.

Many purported examples of character displacement exist, but few completely rule out alternative explanations. We reared genetically diverse populations of two species of bean beetles, Callosobruchus maculatus and Callosobruchus chinensis, in allopatry and sympatry on a mixture of adzuki beans and lentils, and assayed oviposition preference and other phenotypic traits after four, eight, and twelve generations of (co)evolution. C. maculatus specializes on adzuki beans; the generalist C. chinensis uses both beans. C. chinensis growing in allopatry emerged equally from both bean species. In sympatry, the two species competing strongly and coexisted via strong realized resource partitioning, with C. chinensis emerging almost exclusively from lentils and C. maculatus emerging almost exclusively from adzuki beans. However, oviposition preferences, larval survival traits, and larval development rates in both beetle species did not vary consistently between allopatric versus sympatric treatments. Rather, traits evolved in treatment-independent fashion, with several traits exhibiting reversals in their evolutionary trajectories. For example, C. chinensis initially evolved a slower egg-to-adult development rate on adzuki beans in both allopatry and sympatry, then subsequently evolved back toward the faster ancestral development rate. Lack of character displacement is consistent with a previous similar experiment in bean beetles and may reflect lack of evolutionary trade-offs in resource use. However, evolutionary reversals were unexpected and remain unexplained. Together with other empirical and theoretical work, our results illustrate the stringency of the conditions for character displacement.","[Hausch, Stephen J.; Vamosi, Steven M.; Fox, Jeremy W.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Fox, JW (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",jefox@ucalgary.ca,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [RGPIN/283114-2009, RGPIN/311728-2010]","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: RGPIN/283114-2009 and RGPIN/311728-2010",,32,0,0,6,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

These results were at odds from the predictions of classical K-selection theory, notably the expectation that selection at high density should result in the increase of efficiency of conversion of food to biomass, and were better interpreted through the lens of alpha-selection. We show here that populations of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta subjected to extreme larval crowding evolve greater competitive ability and pre-adult survivorship at high density, primarily through a combination of reduced larval duration, faster attainment of minimum critical size for pupation, greater time efficiency of food conversion to biomass and increased pupation height, with a relatively small role of increased urea/ammonia tolerance, if at all. This is a very different suite of traits than that seen to evolve under similar selection in D. melanogaster, and seems to be closer to the expectations from the canonical theory of K-selection. We also discuss possible reasons for these differences in results across the three species. Overall, the results reinforce the view that our understanding of the evolution of competitive ability in fruitflies needs to be more nuanced than before, with an appreciation that there may be multiple evolutionary routes through which higher competitive ability can be attained.","[Nagarajan, Archana; Natarajan, Sharmila Bharathi; Jayaram, Mohan; Thammanna, Ananda; Chari, Sudarshan; Bose, Joy; Jois, Shreyas V.; Joshi, Amitabh] Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Evolutionary Biol Lab, Evolutionary & Organismal Biol Unit, Jakkur PO, Bengaluru 560064, India; [Nagarajan, Archana] Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, Ctr Organelle Res CORE, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Natarajan, Sharmila Bharathi] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Pharmocol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jayaram, Mohan] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Mol Reprod Dev & Genet, Bengaluru 560012, India; [Thammanna, Ananda] Jubilant Biosys Ltd, 96 Yeshwantpur Ind Suburb 2nd Stage,Tumkur Rd, Bengaluru 560022, India; [Chari, Sudarshan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jois, Shreyas V.] Biocenter, Inst Zool, Dept Anim Physiol, D-50674 Cologne, Germany","Joshi, A (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Evolutionary Biol Lab, Evolutionary & Organismal Biol Unit, Jakkur PO, Bengaluru 560064, India.",ajoshi@jncasr.ac.in,,"Chari, Sudarshan/0000-0002-4683-0996; Nagarajan, Archana/0000-0002-3895-4200","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of IndiaCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific ResearchDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Summer Research Fellowship programme; Department of Science and Technology, Government of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India); J.

The importance of food limitation has been extensively studied in terrestrial vertebrate populations, especially in birds, by experimentally manipulating food supply. However, the factors explaining variation in reproductive decisions in response to food supplementation remain unclear. By performing meta-analyses, we aim to quantify the extent to which supplementary feeding affects several reproductive parameters in birds, and identify the key factors (life-history traits, behavioural factors, environmental factors, and experimental design) that can induce variation in laying date, clutch size and breeding success (i.e., number of fledglings produced) in response to food supplementation. Results: Food supplementation produced variable but mostly positive effects across reproductive parameters in a total of 201 experiments from 82 independent studies. The outcomes of the food effect were modulated by environmental factors, e. g., laying dates advanced more towards low latitudes, and food supplementation appeared not to produce any obvious effect on bird reproduction when the background level of food abundance in the environment was high. Moreover, the increase in clutch size following food addition was more pronounced in birds that cache food, as compared to birds that do not. Supplementation timing was identified as a major cause of variation in breeding success responses. We also document the absence of a detectable food effect on clutch size and breeding success when the target species had poor access to the feed due to competitive interactions with other animals. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, from the pool of bird species and environments reviewed, extra food is allocated to immediate reproduction in most cases. Our results also support the view that bird species have evolved different life-history strategies to cope with environmental variability in food supply. However, we encourage more research at low latitudes to gain knowledge on how resource allocation in birds changes along a latitudinal gradient. Our results also emphasize the importance of developing experimental designs that minimise competition for the supplemented food and the risk of reproductive bottle-necks due to inappropriate supplementation timings.","[Ruffino, Lise; Salo, Palvi; Koivisto, Elina; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Banks, Peter B.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Ruffino, L (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",lisruffino@gmail.com,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509; Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495","Norden Top-Level Research Initiative, Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change (Nordic Center of Excellence TUNDRA); Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [138638, 250709]; Australian Academy of Science [DP0881455]","The authors want to sincerely thank Julien Terraube, Quinn Fletcher and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on a draft manuscript.

In the 1960s, the drive towards holistic approaches of public and individual human settlements gave rise to the idea of environmental design, as a means to transcend the boundaries between various design disciplines: architecture, landscape, urban and product design. In the 1970s, environmentalism started to shift towards an ecological ideology soon dominated by technical solutions. This technological turn was driven by highly structured principles in the search for efficiency. Given that the goal of these reorientations of practice is to design for a cleaner future, how has this turn affected environmental architecture procurement and design practices? Shifting values and significances in the environmental discourse for cultural public places are not mere rhetorical choices, but meaningful traces of deeper transformations induced by the way in which environmentalism has been emerging as an imperative in the design of the built environment. This paper holds as its hypothesis that environmental issues are increasingly addressed in a normalized manner in architecture procurement and design practices, specifically, when environmental imperatives are highly specialized. This is quite a divergence from the deep systemic research and experimentation of the late 1960s and early 1970s. This potential trend can have significant consequences not only in the future of architectural design and its management of environmental risks, but also in other areas or fields where environmental technology and designs are employed to support cleaner production. We have selected the architectural competition as the comparative device to study this phenomenon. We will compare competitions launched between the 1970s and the 2000s in order to better understand the changes in environmental design practices.

However, little is known about how methodological factors affect in vitro measurement of these parameters. We compare the swimming performance of sperm from House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and Spanish Sparrows (Passer hispaniolensis) in two standard suspension media, at two different dilutions, and with different degrees of cell agitation. Further, we conduct a resampling analysis to investigate sample size effects. Sperm performance was generally reduced when sperm were diluted, or when suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) rather than a medium containing additional nutrients. Sperm performance was particularly low when they were diluted more and suspended in PBS, suggesting that seminal fluid may provide compounds that enhance performance but that these are less available following dilution. Mechanical agitation of the cells by vigorous pipetting increased the proportion of motile cells. Between-male repeatability, assessed on a single sample measured in multiple conditions, was moderate and significant, suggesting that similar results may be obtained regardless of the methodology used to assess sperm motion. We found no evidence of biased results when low numbers of cells per male were used in analysis, though precision increased substantially as sample size increased from five to 20 or more cells per male. We recommend using the same suspension media and similar sperm concentrations and levels of agitation, to the greatest degree possible, and including as many individuals as possible in analyses, even when some individuals are represented by few sperm cells.","[Cramer, Emily R.

Theoretical models also predict that if limited male dispersal predictably enhances local relatedness while maintaining global competition, kin selection can produce evolutionary divergences in male harmfulness among populations. Experimental tests of these predictions, however, are rare. We assessed rates of dispersal in female and male seed beetles Callosobruchus maculatus, a model species for studies of sexual conflict, in an experimental setting. Females dispersed significantly more often than males, but dispersing males travelled just as far as dispersing females. Next, we used experimental evolution to test whether limiting dispersal allowed the action of kin selection to affect divergence in male harmfulness and female resistance. Populations of C. maculatus were evolved for 20 and 25 generations under one of three dispersal regimens: completely free dispersal, limited dispersal and no dispersal. There was no divergence among treatments in female reproductive tract scarring, ejaculate size, mating behaviour, fitness of experimental females mated to stock males or fitness of stock females mated to experimental males. We suggest that this is likely due to insufficient strength of kin selection rather than a lack of genetic variation or time for selection. Limited dispersal alone is therefore not sufficient for kin selection to reduce male harmfulness in this species, consistent with general predictions that limited dispersal will only allow kin selection if local relatedness is independent of the intensity of competition among kin.","[Lymbery, Samuel J.; Wyber, Blake; Tomkins, Joseph L.; Simmons, Leigh W.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia","Lymbery, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Sci & Engn Res Support Facil, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",s.lymbery@exeter.ac.uk,"Lymbery, Samuel/AAE-1324-2020; Lymbery, Samuel J/AAN-2702-2021; Tomkins, Joseph/A-8091-2011","Lymbery, Samuel/0000-0002-8801-7880; Tomkins, Joseph/0000-0003-1259-7898",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP 35604400],"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP 35604400",,67,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

The four treatments were: the removal of the above-ground shoots of S. gigantea (A); the removal of the litter of S. gigantea (L); the removal of both the above-ground shoots and litter of S. gigantea (AL); and a control (C). The vegetation cover and S. gigantea cover decreased in the A and AL treatments and increased in the L and C treatments. The understory plant cover increased in the A and AL treatments, but did not change in the L and C treatments. The increases in the understory cover in the A and AL treatments were associated with increases in Phalaris arundinacea. The seedling emergence of P. arundinacea was promoted by AL. In a greenhouse, the S. gigantea litter tended to decrease the seed germination of P. arundinacea. The AL treatment also increased the abundance of the other exotic plant, Solidago altissima. The continuous removal of the above-ground shoots and litter of S. gigantea long term is effective for promoting the recovery and emergence of native riparian grassland vegetation. However, this method also promotes the recovery of other exotics.","[Saito, Tatsuya I.] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Tsuyuzaki, Shiro] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan","Saito, TI (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Kita Ku, Kita 10,Nishi 5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",saito-t@ees.hokudai.ac.jp,"Tsuyuzaki, Shiro/F-9090-2012","Tsuyuzaki, Shiro/0000-0003-3010-8699","Japan Science Society, Tokyo, Japan","Special thanks are due to A.

In the experiment, politicians can make nonbinding election promises about how to split an endowment between themselves and the group. We find that promises affect both voting and voter beliefs about how much the politician will contribute to the public fund. The relationship is inverted U-shaped with decreasing credibility of higher promises. Contributions of politicians are correlated with their promises in a similar pattern. The election promises are generally credible unless particularly high. Politicians keep promises more often if a reelection is possible and if the politician came into power by vote rather than by random draw. Voters reward high contributions in the previous period and punish promise breaking even after controlling for the contribution in the previous period or voters' beliefs about future contributions. By controlling for voters' beliefs, we distinguish retrospective from prospective voting. Our results suggest that voters both use promises for prospective voting and retrospectively punish broken promises.","[Born, Andreas; Johannesson, Magnus] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [van Eck, Pieter] AT Kearney, Chicago, IL USA","Born, A (corresponding author), Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Box 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",andreas.born@phdstudent.hhs.se,"Johannesson, Magnus/E-9680-2011","Johannesson, Magnus/0000-0001-8759-6393",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; UniCredit & Universities Foundation,"We thank Chris Dawes, Elle Parslow, Johanna Born, Markus Eyting, Sarah Eichmeyer, Sven Oskarsson, and four anonymous reviewers for helpful comments; Dr. Fabian Kleine and Florian Kochhan for their valuable help in conducting the experiment; and the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation as well as the UniCredit & Universities Foundation for financial support.",,61,10,10,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0162-895X,1467-9221,,POLIT PSYCHOL,Polit.

A long-standing hypothesis for this pattern is that parapatry is maintained by interspecific interference competition mediated by interspecific aggression. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis remain scarce. We used reciprocal playback experiments to measure interspecific aggression in five species-pairs of New Guinean passerine elevational replacements. We found evidence of interspecific aggression in three speciespairs. In these three cases, interspecific aggression was asymmetric, with the lower elevation species more aggressive towards the upper elevation species than vice versa. Two patterns suggest that this interspecific aggression is a learned response to the presence of a heterospecific competitor rather than misdirected intraspecific aggression or an evolved response to a competitor. First, when present, interspecific aggression was always strongest at the upper elevation range margin of the lower elevation species (i.e. in the elevational zone in which the two species were found in close proximity and thus interacted with each other), and diminished over very short distances away from this zone. Secondly, the two species-pairs that did not exhibit interspecific aggression had narrow 'no man's land' gaps between their elevational distributions such that heterospecifics did not encounter one another, possibly explaining the lack of interspecific aggression in these examples. Our results support the hypothesis that interspecific aggression is one factor influencing elevational limits in species-pairs of New Guinean elevational replacements.","[Freeman, Benjamin G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, E145 Corson Hall,220 Tower Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Freeman, Benjamin G.; Freeman, Alexandra M.

When monetary prizes were offered for achieving the highest saving rates within a particular month, average savings increased by $80 (a 30% increase in savings rate) while income and attendance at case management meetings remained unchanged. However, repeating the competition in the following month had no effect because responsive savers selected out of the shelter after the first month. In summary, while a savings competition can increase savings in the short run, its effect may be limited to the intensive margin and may diminish with repetition.

As a consequence, interactions between species that occur in ecosystems are not taken into account. To investigate the effects of contaminants on interacting species dynamics, our study describes the functioning of a 2-L laboratory microcosm with two species, the duckweed Lemna minor and the microalgae Pseudo-kirchneriella subcapitata, exposed to cadmium contamination. We modelled the dynamics of both species and their interactions using a mechanistic model based on coupled ordinary differential equations. The main processes occurring in this two-species microcosm were thus formalised, including growth and settling of algae, growth of duckweeds, interspecific competition between the two species and cadmium effects. We estimated model parameters by Bayesian inference, using simultaneously all the data issued from multiple laboratory experiments specifically conducted for this study. Cadmium concentrations ranged between 0 and 50 mu g.L-1. For all parameters of our model, we obtained biologically realistic values and reasonable uncertainties. Only duckweed dynamics was affected by interspecific competition, while algal dynamics was not impaired. Growth rate of both species decreased with cadmium concentration, as well as competition intensity showing that the interspecific competition pressure on duckweed decreased with cadmium concentration. This innovative combination of mechanistic modelling and model guided experiments was successful to understand the algae-duckweed microcosm functioning without and with contaminant. This approach appears promising to include interactions between species when studying contaminant effects on ecosystem functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

First, the CNU robotics course described here has classroom and laboratory sections. In class, students learn the theories behind robotics and practice them by performing simulation studies. In parallel, students perform robotics exercises in the laboratory. Second, the lab exercises are focused on hands-on experiments on robot systems; these include an experimental kit, LEGO robots, humanoid robots, industrial robots, and home service robots. Third, competition-based learning is explored by assigning a class project to develop a boxing robot, which covers both manipulation and mobility.

This study investigated whether PPN communities can affect the establishment and expansion of M. chitwoodi during a simulated introduction. An original experimental design was developed on potato in the glasshouse involving four PPN communities derived from a single natural one that was initially grown on different host plants. Meloidogyne chitwoodi was inoculated at two different densities (50 or 1000 second-stage juveniles (J2) per pot). After 4 months, M. chitwoodi was more abundant in the community showing a low overall abundance of PPNs, decreased in the other PPN communities and failed to establish in five pots out of 80. Results showed that establishment - even starting from a very low inoculum - can occur in all communities even if indigenous PPNs in the community affect the expansion through interspecific competition. The reverse interaction was also observed as PPN taxa were generally less abundant in the 1000 M. chitwoodi J2 inoculation treatments. The proportion of M. chitwoodi males produced was higher in the community showing low overall PPN abundance, suggesting a strong sensitivity of M. chitwoodi to intraspecific competition. The presented results suggest that a low abundance of indigenous PPNs presents a higher risk of expansion of M. chitwoodi even if the introduced inoculum is low.","[Garcia, N.; Sarniguet, C.; Buisson, A.; Ollivier, F.; Folcher, L.] ANSES, Plant Hlth Lab, Nematol Unit, BP 35327, F-35653 Le Rheu, France; [Garcia, N.; Grenier, E.] Rennes 1 Univ, IGEPP, Agrocampus Ouest, INRA, BP 35327, F-35653 Le Rheu, France","Garcia, N (corresponding author), ANSES, Plant Hlth Lab, Nematol Unit, BP 35327, F-35653 Le Rheu, France.; Garcia, N (corresponding author), Rennes 1 Univ, IGEPP, Agrocampus Ouest, INRA, BP 35327, F-35653 Le Rheu, France.",natgarcia.pro@gmail.com,"Grenier, Eric/AAR-8124-2020; Grenier, Eric/Q-7349-2016","Grenier, Eric/0000-0002-2260-1101; Grenier, Eric/0000-0002-2260-1101","Brittany Regional CouncilRegion Bretagne; French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES)","The authors wish to thank all the Anses LSV and INRA IGEPP colleagues, and in particular Valentin Boulenger and Sylvain Fournet, who helped in the design and set up of the experiments, carried out extractions, counted PPNs and brought fruitful discussions on the results.

The greater the difference between intra- and interspecific limitations, the more stable the coexistence, and the weaker the competitive release any species should experience following removal of competitors. We conducted a removal experiment to test whether a previously estimated model, showing surprisingly weak interspecific competition for four dominant species in a sagebrush steppe, accurately predicts competitive release. Our treatments were (1) removal of all perennial grasses and (2) removal of the dominant shrub, Artemisia tripartita. We regressed survival, growth, and recruitment on the locations, sizes, and species identities of neighboring plants, along with an indicator variable for removal treatment. If our baseline regression model, which accounts for local plant-plant interactions, accurately explains the observed responses to removals, then the removal coefficient should be non-significant. For survival, the removal coefficients were never significantly different from zero, and only A.tripartita showed a (negative) response to removals at the recruitment stage. For growth, the removal treatment effect was significant and positive for two species, Poa secunda and Pseudoroegneria spicata, indicating that the baseline model underestimated interspecific competition. For all three grass species, population models based on the vital rate regressions that included removal effects projected 1.4- to 3-fold increases in equilibrium population size relative to the baseline model (no removal effects). However, we found no evidence of higher response to removal in quadrats with higher pretreatment cover of A.tripartita, or by plants experiencing higher pre-treatment crowding by A.tripartita, raising questions about the mechanisms driving the positive response to removal. While our results show the value of combining observations with a simple removal experiment, more tightly controlled experiments focused on underlying mechanisms may be required to conclusively validate or reject predictions from phenomenological models.","[Adler, Peter B.; Kleinhesselink, Andrew; Teller, Brittany] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Adler, Peter B.; Kleinhesselink, Andrew; Teller, Brittany] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, 5230 Old Main, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hooker, Giles] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, 1198 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY USA; [Taylor, Joshua B.] ARS, USDA, US Sheep Expt Stn, 19 Off Loop, Dubois, ID USA; [Ellner, Stephen P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, E145 Corson Hall, Ithaca, NY USA","Adler, PB (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main, Logan, UT 84322 USA.; Adler, PB (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, 5230 Old Main, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",peter.adler@usu.edu,"Kleinhesselink, Andrew R/O-8956-2019","Kleinhesselink, Andrew R/0000-0003-2149-2027","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1353078, DEB-1054040, DEB-1353039]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1353078] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","P.

We assembled plots in this boundary such that each was initially covered by similar to 50% of each life form. We added NPK to three of the plots monthly and monitored them, along with the control plots, for 18mo. In plots with added NPK, mangrove branches grew over and shaded the herbaceous plants, resulting in the presence of mostly bare soil. The mangrove trees eventually covered similar to 80% of the experimental plots, but the proportion of cover in the control plots remained unaltered. We conclude that soil nutrient level modulates the mangrove-herbaceous plant interaction in steps, and from a given level there is a shift in the dominant life form. This mechanism leads to a sharp transition over a smooth nutritional gradient. Resumo As condicoes ambientais sAo geralmente consideradas os principais fatores a limitar a distribuicAo de especies de mangue. Elas podem agir diretamente, por exemplo, restringido a ocorrencia das especies, ou indiretamente modulando a interacAo entre elas. Em estuarios tropicais a fronteira entre o manguezal e as herbaceas e usualmente muito marcada, embora ocorra sobre um gradiente relativamente suave. Enquanto existem alguns estudos sobre a fronteira entre duas formacoes de herbaceas em estuarios temperados, os mecanismos que regem as fronteiras entre arvores e herbaceas em estuarios tropicais sAo desconhecidos. Nosso objetivo e determinar o papel dos nutrientes do solo na fronteira manguezal-herbaceas atraves de um experimento onde manipulamos a fertilidade do solo. Nos estabelecemos parcelas nessa fronteira de forma que inicialmente cada forma de vida ocupasse 50% da parcela. Em tres das parcelas adicionamos mensalmente NPK. As outras tres foram o controle. Acompanhamos as parcelas por 18 meses. Quando NPK foi adicionado, os galhos do mangue cresceram mais e sombrearam as herbaceas. Isso resultou em um solo predominantemente exposto sob os galhos do manguezal. Com o tempo o manguezal chegou a cobrir similar to 80% da area das parcelas. Concluimos que o nivel nutricional do solo e um fator importante na modulacAo da interacAo mangue-herbaceas, e que a partir de certa quantidade de nutrientes acontece uma alteracAo na forma de vida dominante. Esse mecanismo leva a uma transicAo abrupta sobre um gradiente nutricional suave.","[Ribeiro, Jose Pedro N.; de Oliveira, Alexandre A.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecol Florestas Trop, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Tiberio, Fernanda C.

Early development of a stands after a stand-replacing disturbance can have considerable legacy effects on growth via alterations in the diversity-productivity relationships. Accordingly compatibility of growth and competitiveness of different species is one of the key issues for susceptibility of mixed stands. A two-year chamber experiment was conducted to assess early growth and infra- and inter-specific competition for light and soil resources among the seedlings of temperate tree species simulating the predicted effect of warming (presuming optimal moisture regime). Five species, which have high economic importance or potential to become so in the eastern Baltic region (Scots pine, Norway spruce, silver birch, red oak, and European beech) were studied. Among the studied species, European beech had the fastest height growth and competitiveness, suggesting ability to concur a stable niche outside its natural range, particularly under increased temperature. Beech also maintained high competitiveness despite the damages suffered during the overwintering, supporting legacy effects of early development and suggesting invasive properties. Among the studied, Norway spruce had the slowest growth and suffered the highest competition, which is in line with predicted changes in forest composition. Scots pine, silver birch, and red oak showed intermediate growth and competitiveness, particularly when growing together, suggesting balanced development and optimal productivity of such mixed stands. Nevertheless, growth and competitiveness of these species was reduced by increased temperature, indicating negative effects of warming.","[Matisons, Roberts; Karklina, Annija; Krisans, Oskars; Elferts, Didzis; Jansons, Aris] Latvian State Forest Res Inst Silava, 111 Rigas Str, LV-2169 Salaspils, Latvia; [Elferts, Didzis] Univ Latvia, Fac Biol, Jelgavas Str 1, LV-1010 Riga, Latvia","Matisons, R (corresponding author), Latvian State Forest Res Inst Silava, 111 Rigas Str, LV-2169 Salaspils, Latvia.",robism@inbox.lv,"Jansons, Aris/AAX-1315-2021; Elferts, Didzis/M-8533-2015; Matisons, Roberts/AAO-4838-2021","Jansons, Aris/0000-0001-7981-4346; Elferts, Didzis/0000-0002-9401-1231; Matisons, Roberts/0000-0002-4042-0689; Karklina, Annija/0000-0003-0132-4317",European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission [VIAA/1/16/108],"The study was conducted under the framework of the post-doctoral studies in Latvia (`Plasticity of development and xylogenesis of the native and introduced tree species under changing climate', project No.: 1.1.1.2.VIAA/1/16/108) financed by the European Regional Development Fund.

The aim of the German youth science fair, Jugend forscht, is to encourage scientific thinking and inquiry methods such as experimentation. Based on 57 interviews with participants of the competition, this study summarises students' conceptions and steps of learning about experimentation, taking into account age disparities. Five distinct subdomains of learning were identified in which learning processes may occur. These subdomains are procedure, purpose, material, control, and time. The three separate age groups used slightly different concepts but all the participants took the same or very similar steps of learning independent of their age. Two main reasons for conceptual developments could be detected: Firstly, the participating students had the opportunity to work using methodology similar to the commonly accepted scientific path of knowledge. Secondly, due to communication processes during the competition, a purposive reflection of their own project was promoted. With respect to different educational levels, experimentation proves to be a complex scientific framework that will be learnt step by step throughout students' education. We therefore argue for a stronger anchoring of research experiments embedded in open or authentic inquiry to be included in science lessons at school.","[Paul, Juergen; Gross, Jorge] Univ Bamberg, Dept Sci Educ, Markuspl 3 Noddack Haus, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany; [Lederman, Norman G.] IIT, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Chicago, IL 60616 USA","Paul, J (corresponding author), Univ Bamberg, Dept Sci Educ, Markuspl 3 Noddack Haus, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany.",juergen.paul@uni-bamberg.de,,"Gross, Jorge/0000-0002-3525-9448",,,,73,10,10,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-0693,1464-5289,,INT J SCI EDUC,Int.

The experimental design was aimed at neutralizing other differences in psychological attitudes, such as self-confidence and risk aversion, that are typically considered as potential explanations of gender differences in competitive environments. Students were invited to undertake a midterm exam under a tournament scheme having as a prize some bonus points to add to the final grade. Students competed in pairs of equal predicted ability but different gender composition. In a competitive setting in which risk aversion, feedback provision and self-confidence have little relevance, we find that women tend to perform similarly to men. The gender of one's competitor does not play any role in shaping students' behavior. Men and women perform similarly both in the competitive and in the non-competitive environment.

We paired manipulative experiments to probe two mechanistic pathways through which plant invasion and warming may alter phenology and reproduction of native plant species. In the first, we tested how experimental warming (+1.7 degrees C) modulated flowering phenology and how this affected flowering overlap between a native plant (Dracophyllum subulatum) and an invasive plant (Calluna vulgaris L.). In the second experiment, we explored how variation in the ratio of native to invasive flowers, and the overall quantity of resources in a floral patch, affected the reproduction of the native species. We hypothesized that the flowering overlap of native and invasive plants would be altered by warming, given that invading plants typically exhibit greater phenological plasticity than native plants. Further, we hypothesized that pollination of native plant flowers would decrease in floral patches dominated by invasive plant flowers, but that this effect would depend on total floral density in the patch. As predicted, the invasive plant had a stronger phenological response to experimental warming than the native plant, resulting in increased flowering overlap between the native the invasive plants. There was a four-fold increase in the number of native flowers co-flowering with high densities of invasive flowers suggesting native plant competition for pollinators with invasive plants under a warmed climate. In the second experiment, we found depressed seed masses of the native species in high density floral patches that were dominated by invasive flowers relative to high density floral patches dominated by native flowers. At low floral densities, seed mass of native plants was unaffected by invasion. Together, these results demonstrate that by increasing their phenological overlap, warming may enhance the magnitude of existing competition for pollination exerted by an invasive plant on a native plant, particularly in plant patches with high floral density. Our results illustrate a novel pathway through which global change drivers can operate synergistically to alter an important ecosystem service: pollination.","[Giejsztowt, Justyna; Classen, Aimee T.; Deslippe, Julie R.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Giejsztowt, J (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",j.giejsztowt@gmail.com,"Classen, Aimee T/C-4035-2008; Classen, Aimee/AAM-5671-2021","Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; Giejsztowt, Justyna/0000-0002-3179-745X","Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment's Te Punaha Hihiko Fund [RTVU1511]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences ProgramUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0010562]","The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment's Te Punaha Hihiko Fund RTVU1511 supported this work.

The leading theory for the underlying cause of the price cycles, Edgeworth price cycles, is silent on the issue. The challenge in addressing this most important question has been the difficulty in isolating cycle effects from other confounding factors, especially market structure. In this article, I exploit a unique natural experiment to isolate the effect of cycles a refinery fire that, in a matter of days, halted cycles that had previously persisted for decades.

This paper addresses the problem of minimizing the energy necessary to provide predefined scheduled lighting levels upon a set of targets through an optimization technique. An experimental setup has been designed, built and used to gather data regarding the influences of five light sources upon three targets. The optimization problems corresponding to different lighting demands were solved with the recently introduced Competition Over Resources bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm. Modifications on this algorithm were proposed in order to enhance its performance in terms of convergence speed and computational effort. The modified algorithm was firstly tested with classical benchmark functions, and then with a real time lighting problem. Once algorithm performance improvements were verified, the energy consumption over a scheduled lighting demand was measured under different test conditions as to evaluate potential savings whilst minimizing the computational cost of running the algorithm. Using the proposed modifications, the best parameters for each lighting demand condition in the predefined schedule have been identified. By using these parameters along with a strategy of reusing the best solution while the lighting demand does not change, smaller population sizes in the algorithm could be used. Finally, the minimum algorithm population size at which energetic performance begins to be affected was identified. Promising results in terms of energy efficiency and reduced computational effort were achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) literature proposes that ecosystem functioning increases with biodiversity because of complementarity in resource-use among species, associated with functional diversity. In this study, we challenge the trait-based ecology framework by comparing congeneric exotic (European) and native (North American) tree species showing similar resource-use functional trait values. The trait-based framework suggests that two functionally equivalent species should play similar roles in a community, resulting in similar interactions and performances. However, several studies showed that when growing in mixtures, exotic species that are functionally equivalent to native species benefitted from enemy release, resulting in a reduced apparent competition. We hypothesize that exotic species should be more productive than native species because the exotic species benefit from reduced apparent competition due to enemy release rather than from possessing more competitive resource-use functional traits. 2. We study a diversity experiments, part of the International Diversity Experiment Network with Trees (IDENT), composed of two identical sites, each with two orthogonal diversity gradients: species richness and functional diversity. The functional gradient consists of species combinations of equal richness but increasing functional diversity, using different combinations of species provenance to assess the relationship between productivity, functional diversity and species provenance, independently of species richness. We grew a total of 12 species (six native and six exotic) in different combinations of one-, two- and six-species mixtures. The exotic species were selected based on their functional equivalence to their native congeneric species. 3. Eight years after planting, we found that exotic species were more productive than native species, but only at high functional diversity. Results indicate that exotic species overall benefit from a reduced apparent competition, and that exotic-increased productivity at high functional diversity is consistent with the enemy release hypothesis. 4. After 8 years, exotic species were more productive overall than their native counterparts, but only in the most functionally diverse communities. This study represents a first step in understanding the relative importance of complementarity in resource-use and apparent competition in a context of an exotic tree species invasion.

Studies quantifying the magnitude of competition between prairie dogs and cattle are difficult to conduct because of the large spatial and long temporal scales needed to quantify how competition varies in response to interannual variation in precipitation and prairie dog abundance. We examined variation in mass gains of yearling steers in shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado, USA, with and without prairie dogs from 2008-2019, a period that encompassed a full cycle in prairie dog abundance from a nadir following plague-induced population collapse, to peak abundance following population recovery, to plague-induced population lows again. Analyses of cattle grazing distribution with global positioning system (GPS)-collars revealed preferential grazing on colonies following a period of unusually high vegetation production, and preferential grazing off colonies following a period of rapid vegetation senescence, but these patterns were not clearly related to cattle mass gains. Across all 12 years of the study, average daily mass gain (ADG) during the growing season was 0.97 kg/steer/day in pastures where prairie dogs were controlled annually, and 0.95 kg/steer/day in pastures where they were not. Average daily mass gain was a quadradic function of precipitation and a linear function of prairie dog occupancy within a pasture, with a generalized linear mixed model predicting an 8.0% decrease in ADG as prairie dog occupancy increased from 0 to 60% of a pasture with average growing-season precipitation. We did not detect a significant interaction between precipitation and prairie dog occupancy, but one limitation of our study is that the only drought year (2012) occurred when prairie dogs occupied low percentages (10-25%) of the study pastures. Prairie dogs had a small but detectable negative effect on cattle mass gains during the growing season in shortgrass steppe. The magnitude of this effect can be used by managers in combination with market conditions and the spatial extent of prairie dog colonies to estimate economic effects of prairie dogs on livestock operations.

Data Sources/Study Setting Secondary data for 2008-2015 on patient experience from Hospital Compare's patient survey data, hospital characteristics from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey, and insurance market characteristics from HealthLeaders-InterStudy. Study Design Hospital/year-level regressions predict each hospital's patient experience measure as a function of insurance and hospital market concentration and hospital fixed effects. The model is identified by longitudinal variation in insurance and hospital concentration. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Hospital/year-level data from Hospital Compare and the AHA merged by market/year to insurance and hospital concentration measures. Principal Findings Changes in patient satisfaction are positively associated with increases in insurance concentration and negatively associated with increases in hospital concentration. Moving from a market with 20th percentile insurance concentration and 80th percentile hospital concentration to a market with 80th percentile insurance concentration and 20th percentile hospital concentration increases the share of patients that rated the hospital highly from 66.9 percent (95% CI: 66.5-67.2 percent) to 67.9 percent (95% CI: 67.5-68.3 percent) and the share of patients that definitely recommend the hospital from 69.7 percent (95% CI: 69.4-70.0 percent) to 70.8 percent (95% CI: 70.5-71.2 percent). The relationship for insurance concentration is stronger in more concentrated hospital markets, while the relationship for hospital concentration is stronger in less concentrated hospital markets. Conclusions These findings add to the evidence on the harms of hospital consolidation but suggest that insurer consolidation may improve patient experience.","[Hanson, Caroline; Herring, Bradley] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 624 North Broadway,Room 626, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Trish, Erin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Trish, Erin] Univ Southern Calif, Sch Pharm, Los Angeles, CA USA","Hanson, C (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 624 North Broadway,Room 626, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",chanson8@jhu.edu,,"Herring, Bradley/0000-0001-6845-1412",Agency for Healthcare Research and QualityUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality [R36HS026333],"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Grant/Award Number: R36HS026333",,32,1,1,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0017-9124,1475-6773,,HEALTH SERV RES,Health Serv.

Recent studies have suggested that male-male competition within a species selects for capability to reproductively interfere with a closely related species. Here, we examine the effect of past evolutionary history under different mating regimes on the demographic dynamics of interspecific competition in Callosobruchus seed beetles. We used previously established experimental evolution lines of Callosobruchus chinensis that evolved under either forced lifelong monogamy or polygamy for 17 generations, and examined the demographic dynamics of competition between these C. chinensis lines and a congener, Callosobruchus maculatus. Callosobruchus chinensis was competitively excluded by C. maculatus in all trials. Time series data analyses suggested that reproductive interference from C. chinensis was relatively more important in the trials involving polygamous C. chinensis than those involving monogamous C. chinensis, in accordance with the potentially higher reproductive interference capability of polygamous C. chinensis. However, the estimated signs and magnitudes of interspecific interactions were not fully consistent with this explanation, implying the evolution of not only reproductive interference but also other interaction mechanisms. Our study thus suggests multifaceted effects of sexually selected traits on interspecific competitive dynamics.","[Kyogoku, Daisuke; Kondoh, Michio] Tohoku Univ, Ecol Integrat, Aoba Ku, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Kyogoku, Daisuke] Ryukoku Univ, Dept Sci & Technol, Otsu, Shiga, Japan; [Kyogoku, Daisuke; Sota, Teiji] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Kyoto, Japan; [Kyogoku, Daisuke] Ryukoku Univ, Res Inst Food & Agr, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan","Kyogoku, D (corresponding author), Ryukoku Univ, Res Inst Food & Agr, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan.",d.kyogoku@gmail.com,"Kyogoku, Daisuke/O-8410-2018; Kondoh, Michio/AAE-4332-2019","Kyogoku, Daisuke/0000-0002-6214-8241; ","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [13J01115, 16H04846]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant/Award Number: 13J01115 and 16H04846",,51,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The role that such differences play in the assembly of diverse plant communities maintained by frequent fires remains unresolved. This lack of resolution results in part from the possibility that species with similar traits may coexist because none has a significant fitness advantage and in part from the difficulty of experimental manipulation of highly diverse assemblages dominated by perennial species. We examined a 65-year chronosequence of losses of herbaceous species following fire suppression (and subsequent encroachment by Pinus elliottii) in three wet longleaf pine savannas. We used cluster analysis, similarity profile permutation tests, and k-R cluster analysis to identify statistically significant functional groups. We then used randomization tests to determine if the absence of functional groups near pines was greater (or less) than expected by chance. We also tested whether tolerant and sensitive species were less (or more) likely to co-occur by chance in areas in savannas away from pines in accordance with predictions of modern coexistence theory. Functional group richness near pines was lower than expected from random species extirpations. Wetland perennials with thick rhizomes and high leaf water content, spring-flowering wetland forbs (including Drosera tracyi), orchids, Polygala spp., and club mosses were more likely to be absent near pines than expected by chance. C3 grasses and sedges with seed banks and tall, fall-flowering C4 grasses were less likely to be absent near pines than expected by chance. Species sensitive to pine encroachment were more likely to co-occur with other such species away from pines at two of the three sites. Results suggest that herb species diversity in frequently burned wet savannas is maintained in part by a weak fitness (e.g., competitive) hierarchy among herbs, and not as a result of trait differences among co-occurring species.","[Brewer, John Stephen; Zee, Peter] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA","Brewer, JS (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA.",jbrewer@olemiss.edu,,,"Department of Biology, University of Mississippi","The study was supported by the Department of Biology, University of Mississippi.

In those with fast syllable rates, males often increase rates when singing in aggressive context, and respond differently to test stimuli of varying rates. We asked whether the syllable rate fulfils a similar signalling function in the chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), a songbird species with a slow syllable rate. We confronted 36 chiffchaff males with one of three playback types differing in syllable rate: control (non-manipulated rate), fast, or slow (artificially increased and decreased syllable rate, respectively). We recorded tested males' songs and behaviour before and during the experiment. Our results indicate that syllable rate might be an aggressive signal in chiffchaff. Males that physically attacked the loudspeaker during experiments sang faster songs spontaneously, and those that continued singing during the playback responded to fast and non-manipulated stimuli with substantial increase of syllable rate. Indirect evidence further suggests that syllable rate in chiffchaff is unlikely constrained by respiratory demands; thus, we propose that syllable rate in this species functions as a conventional signal of male aggressiveness rather than an index of quality.

Little is known about consumer sensitivity to different channeling incentives. In particular, the impact of status quo bias, which is expected to differ between different provider types, can play a large role in insurers' channeling ability. Objective To examine consumer sensitivity to channeling strategies and to analyze the impact of status quo bias for different provider types. Data Sources/Study Design With a large-scale discrete choice experiment, we investigate the impact of channeling incentives on choices for pharmacies and general practitioners (GPs). Survey data were obtained among a representative Dutch household panel (n=2,500). Principal Findings Negative financial incentives have a two to three times larger impact on provider choice than positive ones. Positive financial incentives have a relatively small impact on GP choice, while the impact of qualitative incentives is relatively large. Status quo bias has a large impact on provider choice, which is more prominent in the case of GPs than in the case of pharmacies. Conclusion The large impact of the status quo bias makes channeling consumers away from their current providers a daunting task, particularly in the case of GPs.","[Boonen, Lieke H. H.

Strength of the coexistence mechanisms can be altered by evolution. In particular, populations evolved in sympatry may show niche divergence due to competition-mediated selection, whereas populations evolved in allopatry have a chance to become ecologically equivalent competitors which, on secondary contacts, may form neutral communities'. We addressed how evolution may change ecological mechanisms of coexistence with experimental microcosms of Escherichia coli strains that reproduce asexually and can be considered as analogues of species. We obtained five pairs of bacterial strains, within each of which the two strains could coexist stably. We then allowed the bacterial strains to evolve in a chemically defined nutrient medium for 1100 generations, under sympatric (in two-strain mixtures) or allopatric scenarios (in monocultures). The strength of coexistence mechanisms was assessed based on reciprocal invasion assays and measurements of environmental carrying capacity. Our data confirmed that coexistence could be weaken by either fitness difference or niche overlap among competitors. In allopatrically evolved strain pairs, fitness difference among competitors became larger or unchanged; and the magnitude of niche overlap often showed an increase rather than a decline. Sympatrically evolved competitors showed no consistent changing trend in the strength of the coexistence mechanisms. Overall, sympatrically evolved competitor pairs did not differ from allopatrically evolved ones in the magnitude of fitness difference, but had lower levels of niche overlap. The results are consistent with the character displacement' view that allopatric populations of competing species occupy more similar niche space compared with sympatric populations. However, the pattern observed here resulted from allopatrically evolved competitors showing niche convergence, but not sympatrically evolved competitors consistently showing further niche divergence. The results also suggest that convergent evolution in allopatry followed by secondary contacts is an unlikely mechanism for the origin of neutral communities'.","[Zhang, Quan-Guo] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; Beijing Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Zhang, QG (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhangqg@bnu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Da-Yong/B-3078-2011; Zhang, Quan-Guo/D-5244-2015","Zhang, Da-Yong/0000-0003-1056-8735; Zhang, Quan-Guo/0000-0001-7128-2664","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31222010, 31421063, 31030014]; 111 projectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B13008]","We thank Chuan Ni for technical assistance.

Kirzner (1973) and Schumpeter (1934), who emphasized the competitive nature of entrepreneurship, this study investigates whether potential and revealed entrepreneurs are more likely to seek competition than non-entrepreneurs. We provide a conceptual framework that links entrepreneurship to three facets of individual competitiveness drawn from economic, entrepreneurship, and psychological research: a desire to win, striving for personal development, and an enjoyment of competition. Following economic research linking competitive behavior in experiments to career choices, we conduct a lab-in-the-field study and demonstrate that entrepreneurs are more likely to enter competitions than non-entrepreneurs. Accounting for individual desires to win and mastery-related achievement motivations, our results indicate that entrepreneurs tend to enter competition for the sake of competition itself rather than for the prospect of winning it or personal development. Our results suggest that enjoyment of competition might be an additional factor driving entrepreneurs' market entry decisions beyond well-known factors like overconfidence and risk-taking.","[Urbig, Diemo; Bonte, Werner; Lombardo, Sandro] Univ Wuppertal, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Gaussstr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany; [Urbig, Diemo; Bonte, Werner] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Inst Dev Strategies, 1315 East 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Urbig, Diemo] Jheronimus Acad Data Sci, Sint Janssingel 92, NL-5211 DA Den Bosch, Netherlands; [Urbig, Diemo] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Ind Engn, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Bonte, Werner] Univ Wuppertal, Jackstadt Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat Res, Gaussstr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany; [Procher, Vivien D.] Univ Grenoble Alpes ComUE, Grenoble Ecole Management, 12 Rue Pierre Semard, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Procher, Vivien D.] RWI Leibniz Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Hohenzollemstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany","Urbig, D (corresponding author), Univ Wuppertal, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Gaussstr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany.",urbig@uni-wuppertal.de,"Urbig, Diemo/E-8088-2012","Urbig, Diemo/0000-0002-8899-9722",Dr. Werner Jackstadt-Stiftung through the Jackstadt Center of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Research,"The authors are very grateful for the generous financial support from the Dr. Werner Jackstadt-Stiftung through the Jackstadt Center of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Research.

This article provides new evidence regarding the impact of material self-interest on attitudes towards immigrants. It reports the results of a survey experiment embedded in representative surveys in 15 European countries before and after the European refugee crisis in 2014. As anticipated by the fiscal burden argument, it is found that rich natives prefer highly skilled over low-skilled migration more than low-income respondents do. Moreover, the study shows that these tax concerns among the wealthy are stronger if fiscal exposure to migration is high. No support is found for the labour market competition argument predicting that natives will be most opposed to migrants with similar skills. The results suggest that highly skilled migrants are preferred over low-skilled migrants irrespective of natives' skill levels.","[Naumann, Elias] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Stoetzer, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Pietrantuono, Giuseppe] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Immigrat Policy Lab, Zurich, Switzerland","Naumann, E (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, SFB Polit Econ Reforms 884, B6 30-32, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",naumann@uni-mannheim.de,"Naumann, Elias/A-4136-2018; Stoetzer, Lukas/M-1926-2019","Naumann, Elias/0000-0003-1415-0678; Stoetzer, Lukas/0000-0003-2486-7496",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [SFB 884],"Funding was provided by the DFG via SFB 884, project A6 (Elias Naumann).

Traditional manufacturing enterprises cannot handle the related challenges of service innovation by themselves. Recently, manufacturing service ecosystem (MSE) has been proposed to support service innovation by facilitating collaboration. The construction and development of MSE need to handle a series of complexities, such as individual complexity, interaction complexity and ecological complexity. However, it is still very difficult to clearly identify the possible effect of various influence factors on MSE evolution, which is necessary analyse the complex dynamic interactive relationship among participants, so as to maintain the sustainable and healthy development of MSE. To change such a situation, this paper proposes a mapping-based computational experiment approach to analyse the evolution of MSE. This approach has three main parts, i.e. model construction of real world, model mapping of computational system and experiment evaluation of various factors of MSE evolution. By adopting the proposed approach, several case studies are conducted to investigate the possible effect of cooperation preference on the MSE evolution in various market environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective.","[Xiao, Xue] Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Jiaozuo, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Xue] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shufang] Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Business Adm, Jiaozuo, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lejun] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qin, Cheng-zhi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qin, Cheng-zhi] Nanjing Normal Univ, Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Res, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Xiao, X (corresponding author), Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Jiaozuo, Peoples R China.; Xiao, X (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Zhang, LJ (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jzxuexiao@126.com; zhanglejun@yzu.edu.cn,"Qin, Cheng-Zhi/B-7729-2011","Qin, Cheng-Zhi/0000-0002-5910-9807","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61175066, 61379126, 41701133]; Program for Science & Technology Innovation Talents of Henan Province [2017JQ0008]; Program for Science& Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province [2012HASTIT013]; National Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province [162300410121]; Key Scientific Research Project in Universities of Henan Province [16A520012]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 61175066], [grant number 61379126], [grant number 41701133]; Program for Science & Technology Innovation Talents of Henan Province [grant number 2017JQ0008]; Program for Science& Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province [grant number 2012HASTIT013]; National Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province [grant number 162300410121]; and Key Scientific Research Project in Universities of Henan Province [grant number 16A520012].",,43,5,6,5,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Studying plant invasions in the context of the invaded community can help us to understand those mechanisms. In this study, we follow a community approach where we describe establishment and growth patterns of an exotic shrub, Elaeagnus umbellata, with respect to the local woody plant community. Primarily focusing on a forest ecosystem, we expect light availability to be a driving factor in the recruitment of E. umbellata individuals; however, this is not supported for seedling recruitment as light becomes detrimental to survival in conditions exceeding 30 % full sun. Instead, growth of first year seedlings is primarily affected by soil moisture. Forest census data of adult individuals show that growth of E. umbellata is affected by light and small-scale neighborhood density (i.e., limited in the understory by space or resources), suggesting a shift in resource requirement. Overall, our study indicates that although E. umbellata individuals are likely to recruit and persist in the understory, successful growth to adulthood is controlled by competitive interactions.","[Brym, Zachary T.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Allen, David] Middlebury Coll, Dept Biol, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [Ibanez, Ines] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Brym, ZT (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, 5305 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",z.t.brym@gmail.com,,"Brym, Zachary/0000-0002-0659-2938; Allen, David/0000-0002-0712-9603",USDA McIntire-Stennis Grant,"A number of individuals have contributed constructive criticism and guidance throughout the writing of this manuscript.

Site-choice models seek to explain site choice as a function of only the cost of visiting each site, the physical characteristics of the sites, income, and other characteristics of the individual. They ignore the influence of others on site choice. We find, using choice experiments, that having a companion and the companion's relative ability are critical determinants of site choice-what social psychology would predict. One will often choose a site less preferred in terms of its costs and characteristics if one has a companion of one's ability at the lesser site but not at the better site. Companions of comparable ability are preferred over companions that are better or worse. And, importantly, how one values the physical characteristics of sites depends on whether one has a companion. The magnitudes of our estimated companion effects suggest recreation-demand models that ignore them, all do, omit a critical endogenous variable. An implication is that observed trip patterns can be generated by social-interaction game playing (where I go depends on where you go and ...), not utility maximization in isolation. This paper does not model the game; it estimates a recreator's utility/reaction function with companion effects, showing the importance of the social component. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

More recently the quality of Nicaragua's democracy has deteriorated. This change is due partly to autocratic behaviour by the elected leftist president, Daniel Ortega. But democratic decline is also the result of factional divisions and vague, outmoded policy commitments on the right that have crippled its electoral competitiveness, enabling Ortega's behaviour. Utilizing an experimental research design, this article identifies two modernized policy platforms that could significantly broaden rightist electoral support in presidential campaigns, aiding democratic resurgence in Nicaragua. At a point when opposition parties are struggling to retain strength and coherence in many other democracies, the study presents a research strategy that could help clarify the ways such parties might reinvigorate their electoral competitiveness.","[Anderson, Leslie E.; Dodd, Lawrence C.] Univ Florida, Dept Polit Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Park, Won-ho] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Seoul, South Korea","Anderson, LE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Polit Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",landerso@ufl.edu,,"Park, Won-ho/0000-0002-7360-9111",Humanities Grant from the University of Florida; Republic of Korea National Research Foundation [NRF-2015S1A5A2A03049558],"This article was first presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, San Francisco, CA, 1-4 September 2015.

The evolution of male provisioning is thought to be driven by male reproductive competition and selection for female fecundity enhancement. We used experimental evolution under male- or female-biased sex ratios and limited or unlimited food regimes to investigate the relative roles of these routes to male provisioning in a sex role-reversed beetle, Megabruchidius tonkineus, where males provide females with nutritious ejaculates. Males evolving under male-biased sex ratios transferred larger ejaculates than did males from female-biased populations, demonstrating a sizeable role for reproductive competition in the evolution of male provisioning. Although larger ejaculates elevated female lifetime offspring production, we found little evidence of selection for larger ejaculates via fecundity enhancement: males evolving under resource-limited and unlimited conditions did not differ in mean ejaculate size. Resource limitation did, however, affect the evolution of conditional ejaculate allocation. Our results suggest that the resource provisioning that underpins sex role reversal in this system is the result of male-male reproductive competition rather than of direct selection for males to enhance female fecundity.","[Booksmythe, I.; Fritzsche, K.; Arnqvist, G.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Evolut & Genet, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden","Booksmythe, I (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Evolut Ecol & Genet, 116 Daley Rd, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",isobel.booksmythe@anu.edu.au,"Arnqvist, Goran/E-6782-2015; Booksmythe, Isobel/Y-2758-2018","Arnqvist, Goran/0000-0002-3501-3376; Booksmythe, Isobel/0000-0001-9108-1018",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [AdG-294333]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [621-2010-5266]; Zoologiska Stiftelsen; EBC graduate school on genomes and phenotypes,"We thank Zoltan Gyorgy for collecting beetles, and Johanna Liljestrand Ronn, Nino Amvrosiadi, Murielle Alund and Hwei-yen Chen for technical assistance.

This pattern has been observed in many plant species, but comparably few have sought to disentangle underlying mechanisms. Here, in a diverse lineage of Neotropical plants (Ruellia; Acanthaceae), we present evidence of reproductive character displacement in a macroevolutionary framework (i.e., among species) and document mechanistic underpinnings. In a series of interspecific hand pollinations in a controlled glasshouse environment, we found that crosses between species that differed more in overall flower size, particularly in style length, were significantly less likely to produce viable seeds. Further, species pairs that failed to set seed were more likely to have sympatric distributions in nature. Competition for pollinators and reinforcement to avoid costly interspecific mating could both result in these patterns and are not mutually exclusive processes. Our results add to growing evidence that reproductive character displacement contributes to exceptional floral diversity of angiosperms.","[Tripp, Erin A.; Stone, Heather B.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 334 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Tripp, Erin A.; Stone, Heather B.] Univ Colorado, Museum Nat Hist, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dexter, Kyle G.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Dexter, Kyle G.] Royal Bot Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Tripp, EA (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 334 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",erin.tripp@colorado.edu,"Dexter, Kyle G/D-5589-2018","Dexter, Kyle G/0000-0001-9232-5221","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1354963, 1355138]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1354963 and 1355138",,75,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, the role of sexual selection remains controversial, in part because of lack of evidence on genetic bases of traits and the response of relevant characters to selection. METHODS: In an experiment with Raphanus sativus, we selected on tendency to sire seeds in the stylar or basal regions of fruits. This character is likely related to pollen tube growth rate, and seed position affects rates of abortion and seed predation. We measured differences among families in seed siring and related characters and evaluated responses to selection. KEY RESULTS: All replicates showed strong effects of pollen donor family on proportion of seeds sired per fruit in mixed pollinations. Most also showed effects of pollen donor family on number of pollen grains per flower and pollen diameter. Two of four replicates showed a response to selection on position of seeds sired. In responding replicates, we found trade-offs in pollen grain size and number; plants with larger pollen grains sired more seeds in the basal region. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a genetic basis for pollen donor ability to sire seeds in competition. The significant response to selection in two replicates shows that position of seeds sired can respond to selection. Thus, all components for sexual selection to occur and affect traits are present. Variation in results among replicates might be due to changes in greenhouse conditions. Environmental effects may contribute to the maintenance of variation in these fitness-related characters.","[Marshall, Diane L.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, MSC03-2020,1 Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Evans, Ann S.] Thomas Nelson Community Coll, Dept Biol, 99 Thomas Nelson Dr, Hampton, VA 23666 USA","Marshall, DL (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, MSC03-2020,1 Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",marshall@unm.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BSR 8958233, DEB 9509184, DEB 9807337]","The authors thank K.

We detect significant price differences, which are indicative of in-group biases. White names receive higher prices for distinctively white products, and black names receive higher prices for distinctively black products. But price differences only emerge for sellers who have low eBay feedback scores in less competitive markets. Because the price differences dissipate as sellers accumulate credible reputations, the patterns in the data are indicative of statistical discrimination. Overall, the results suggest that mechanisms designed to reduce informational asymmetries and increased competition are both effective at reducing discrimination in online auctions.

We manipulated the distance that eight experienced volleyball players had to cover for successful ball passing, and mapped their passing technique (i.e., overhead or underhand) and ball return accuracy in a choice condition. Passing accuracy was then compared with conditions in which reception technique was imposed by instruction. When players were free to choose their technique the landing zone of the ball influenced the choice of technique: When a ball landed further away, the adoption of underhand technique increased, especially for balls that landed in front of the participants. Furthermore, in all conditions the accuracy of the pass decreased with increasing distance to be covered. These results are discussed vis-a-vis the idea that player behavior is shaped by affordances (i.e., possibilities for action). It is argued that to understand decision-making in dynamic sport situations we need to understand how players deal with competing affordances.","[Barsingerhorn, Annemiek D.; Zaal, Frank T. J.

However, it is not well known whether these traits transfer back to the native range, or instead represent genotype-by-environment interactions where traits are context specific to communities in the new range where the evolution occurred. Insight into transferability vs. context specificity can be tested using experiments performed with individuals from populations from the native and nonnative ranges of exotic invasive species. Using a widespread invasive plant species in Europe, Solidago gigantea, we established reciprocal common garden experiments in the native range (Montana, North America; n = 4) and the nonnative range (Hungary, Europe; n = 4) to assess differences in size, vegetative shoot number, and herbivory between populations from the native and nonnative ranges. In a greenhouse experiment, we also tested whether the inherent competitive ability of genotypes from 15 native and 15 invasive populations differed when pitted against 11 common native North American competitors. In common gardens, plants from both ranges considered together produced five times more biomass, grew four times taller, and developed five times more rhizomes in the nonnative range garden compared to the native range garden. The interaction between plant origin and the common garden location was highly significant, with plants from Hungary performing better than plants from Montana when grown in Hungary, and plants from Montana performing better than plants from Hungary when grown in Montana. In the greenhouse, there were no differences in the competitive effects and responses of S. gigantea plants from the two ranges when grown with North American natives. Our results suggest that S. gigantea might have undergone rapid evolution for greater performance abroad, but if so, this response does not translate to greater performance at home.","[Pal, Robert W.] Montana Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Butte, MT 59701 USA; [Pal, Robert W.; Nagy, David U.] Univ Pecs, Inst Biol, Fac Sci, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary; [Maron, John L.; Waller, Lauren P.; Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Maron, John L.; Waller, Lauren P.; Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Tosto, Ambra] Wageningen Univ, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Liao, Huixuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China","Pal, RW (corresponding author), Montana Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Butte, MT 59701 USA.; Pal, RW (corresponding author), Univ Pecs, Inst Biol, Fac Sci, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary.",rpal@mtech.edu,"Nagy, David U/N-8697-2019","Nagy, David U/0000-0001-7742-4459",People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under REA [300639]; Fulbright Commission; NSF EPSCoR Track-1 [EPS-1101342]; Provost's Office of the University of Montana; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0614406]; National Science Foundation EPSCoRNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OIA-1757351],"This research was funded by the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under REA grant number 300639 (RWP), the Fulbright Commission (RWP), NSF EPSCoR Track-1 EPS-1101342 (INSTEP 3) (RMC), the Provost's Office of the University of Montana (RMC; RWP), and the U.S. National Science Foundation DEB 0614406 (RMC).

The geographic distributions of a species, be it native or alien, is expected to be limited at some point by environmental conditions. In this situation, a range edge equilibrium (REE) takes place, i.e., populations occurring beyond the edge have a growth rate reduced below replacement. The occurrence of REE has never been tested for an invasive species. In Western Europe, the invasive weed Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. has spread in most parts of southern and central France, where it can be found in very high densities in sunflower fields, but seems to be limited in its northwards expansion. It is currently unknown whether the range has reached a limit or not. Information about how the species responds to sunflower competition is also lacking. Objectives. This work addressed two questions: Has the northern part of A. artemisiifolia invaded range in Western Europe reached REE? How is A. artemisiifolia performance influenced by sunflower competition? Method. Plots were established in an agricultural field ca. 250 km north to the current invaded range, in Belgium. We planted A. artemisiifolia seedlings with or without sunflower competition. The following year, the population growth rates and the soil seed bank were assessed. Results. The species established populations with relatively high growth rates and soil seed bank. Sunflower competition did not have a significant impact on plant performance. Conclusions. The results invalidate the hypothesis of equilibrium at the current margin of A. artemisiifolia invaded range, and suggest a significant potential for invasion northwards.","[Ortmans, William; Mahy, Gregory; Monty, Arnaud] Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, BIOSE Dept, Biodivers & Landscape Unit, Passage Deportes 2, BE-5030 Gembloux, Belgium","Ortmans, W (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, BIOSE Dept, Biodivers & Landscape Unit, Passage Deportes 2, BE-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",ortmans.w@gmail.com,,,Fonds de la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture (FRIA)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,The authors thank the Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 1347 Agroecologie from the Institut National de Recherche Agronomique of France that collected the seeds.

Here, we performed four experiments with Drosophila melanogaster to investigate two aspects of MCC methodology: whether (i) providing positive and negative social information simultaneously or sequentially during the demonstration phase of the protocol, and (ii) male-male competition during the mate-choice test, affect MCC. We found that the simultaneous provision of positive and negative information during demonstrations hampered female MCC performance, compared to the sequential provision of information. This can be interpreted in two alternative, yet not exclusive, ways: (i) attentional mechanisms may restrict the focus of the brain to one source of information at a time, and/or (ii) the shorter duration of demonstrations in the simultaneous protocol may have not permit full social learning use and may explain the non-detection of MCC in that protocol. Moreover, we did not detect any significant effect of male-male competition on female choice. This study thus provides further evidence for MCC in D. melanogaster and expands on the necessary methodology for detailed studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Theoretical models predict the strength of interference at different prey densities for birds differing in dominance. Observational studies have been used to validate the theoretical predictions, but there is reason to believe that these nonexperimental studies suffer from confounding factors. We therefore manipulated forager density of oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus foraging on live cockles Cerastoderma edule (low density: 1 bird per 50 m(2) and high density: 2 birds per 50 m(2)) in a unique experimental facility closely mimicking natural feeding conditions. In the high-density situation, the intake rate was on average reduced by 36% compared with the interference-free intake rate. However, this effect depended on status with intake rate of subordinates being more strongly reduced than intake rate of dominants (-45% vs. -25%). We could not investigate all possible mechanisms, but we observed that birds actively avoided each other, possibly to avoid kleptoparasitism. Our experiment shows that the decline in intake rate with increasing density of conspecifics is at least partly due to direct interactions between birds and possibly also to indirect interactions via prey depression but not to an unidentified confounding factor that covaries with intake rate and bird density, as may have been the case in nonexperimental field studies.","[Oosterbeek, Kees; Ens, Bruno J.] SOVON Texel, SOVON Dutch Ctr Field Ornithol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Rutten, Anne L.; Oosterbeek, Kees] Univ Groningen, Anim Ecol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [van der Meer, Jaap] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; [Verhulst, Simon] Univ Groningen, Behav Biol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Ens, Bruno J.] Wageningen IMARES, NL-1790 AD Den Burg, Netherlands","Ens, BJ (corresponding author), SOVON Texel, SOVON Dutch Ctr Field Ornithol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.",bruno.ens@sovon.nl,"Verhulst, Simon/S-3404-2019; van der Meer, Jaap/C-6687-2011; Verhulst, Simon/B-1613-2009","Verhulst, Simon/0000-0002-1143-6868; Verhulst, Simon/0000-0002-1143-6868",Technology Foundation STWTechnologiestichting STW [GBI 4804]; applied science division of NWONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Ministry of Economic Affairs,"The Technology Foundation STW (code GBI 4804), applied science division of NWO; technology programme of the Ministry of Economic Affairs supported the research.",,58,13,13,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Although previous research has investigated the evolutionary consequences of reductions in the number of mates, we know little about the costs and benefits of increased numbers of mates. Here, we use a genetic manipulation of mating frequency in Drosophila melanogaster to create a novel, highly promiscuous mating system. We generated D. melanogaster populations in which flies were deficient for the sex peptide receptor (SPR) gene - resulting in SPR-females that mated more frequently - and genetically-matched control populations, and allowed them to evolve for 55 generations. At several time-points during this experimental evolution, we assayed behavioural, morphological and transcriptional reproductive phenotypes expected to evolve in response to increased population mating frequencies. Results: We found that males from the high mating frequency SPR- populations evolved decreased ability to inhibit the receptivity of their mates and decreased copulation duration, in line with predictions of decreased per-mating investment with increased sperm competition. Unexpectedly, SPR- population males also evolved weakly increased sex peptide (SP) gene expression. Males from SPR- populations initially (i.e., before experimental evolution) exhibited more frequent courtship and faster time until mating relative to controls, but over evolutionary time these differences diminished or reversed. Conclusions: In response to experimentally increased mating frequency, SPR- males evolved behavioural responses consistent with decreased male post-copulatory investment at each mating and decreased overall pre-copulatory performance. The trend towards increased SP gene expression might plausibly relate to functional differences in the two domains of the SP protein. Our study highlights the utility of genetic manipulations of animal social and sexual environments coupled with experimental evolution.","[Perry, Jennifer C.; Wigby, Stuart] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford, England; [Perry, Jennifer C.] Univ Oxford, Jesus Coll, Oxford, England; [Joag, Richa; Hosken, David J.; Wedell, Nina] Univ Exeter, Penryn, England; [Joag, Richa; Radwan, Jacek] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland","Perry, JC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford, England.; Perry, JC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Jesus Coll, Oxford, England.",jennifer.perry@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Wigby, Stuart/A-3916-2017","Wigby, Stuart/0000-0002-2260-2948; Radwan, Jacek/0000-0001-8503-5701","Foundation for Polish Science (FNP) within Environmental Stress, Population Viability and Adaptation project [MPD/2009-3/5]; Institute of Environmental Sciences, JU [DS/MND/WbiNoZ/InoS/15/2013]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Jesus College, Oxford; Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/J018937/1]; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/K014544/1]; Welcome Trust VIP award; Lloyds Tercentenary Research Foundation; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/K014544/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/J018937/1] Funding Source: researchfish","RJ and RT-qPCR analyses were funded by the Foundation for Polish Science (FNP) within the Environmental Stress, Population Viability and Adaptation project (MPD/2009-3/5) and by the Institute of Environmental Sciences, JU (DS/MND/WbiNoZ/InoS/15/2013).

Resource acquisition in the wild may be mediated by a variety of ecological factors, such as the density of interspecific competitors. Allocation may in turn depend on social contexts, such as sex ratio, that alter the pay-off for investment in sexual traits. How these factors interact to promote or constrain the expression and evolution of sexual dimorphism is poorly understood. We manipulated sex ratio and interspecific resource competition over the growing season of red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) in artificial ponds. Fish competitors had a stronger effect on female than male growth, which effectively eliminated the expression of sexual size dimorphism. In addition, newt sex ratio influenced fish growth, leading to reduction in fish mass with an increase in female newt frequency. Fish also reduced the expression of male tail height, a sexually selected trait, but only in tanks with a female-biased sex ratio. This suggests males alter their resource allocation pattern in response to the strength of sexual selection. Our results demonstrate that ecologically and socially mediated interactions between sex-specific resource acquisition and allocation can contribute to variation in the expression of sexual dimorphism.","[De Lisle, S.

In order to generate a flexible, readily available knowledge that can also be applied to other mechanisms or in new contexts, we have developed experiments on a basic reaction mechanism. The E2 elimination reactions presented were designed as contrasting cases and provide focus on the study of molecularity and the influence of the base strength on the process of reactions in E2 reactions.

Tropical Australian fiddler crabs (Uca species) are differentially distributed in mangrove habitats according to levels of canopy cover. Here we conducted experiments to test three hypotheses explaining fiddler crab distributions in a tropical mangrove. Firstly we recorded the time that it took fiddler crabs from different habitats to reorientate themselves upon being placed on their backs. Secondly we transplanted forest inhabiting U.flammula and clearing inhabiting U. elegans into enclosures set up in clearing and forest sites and measured their activities. We then excluded predators from enclosures containing U. elegans in the forest and monitored crab activities over 10 weeks. We found that righting-response times were longer for crabs from low compared to high intertidal zones and longer when in full sun for all crabs living in or near forests compared to those from clearings, suggesting that forest-dwelling crabs experience physiological stress in open canopy habitats. After 10 weeks, transplanted crab activities varied according to species and habitat. In the clearing, crab activities remained high with burrow-enclosure distance varying between species. Neither transplanted crab activities nor burrow-enclosure distance varied with the presence or absence of other species. Our predator exclusion experiments also found no predator effects on the activities of transplanted crabs. Our results suggest that fiddler crab spatial distributions across the mangrove ecosystem are influenced by physiological stressors independent of any sympatric interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The region under study is divided into two areas according to exogenous variations in biomass production stemming from geological peculiarities. We conducted a joy-of-destruction game with pastoralists from both areas and provide evidence for a positive relationship between antisocial behavior and long-term exposure to scarcity. Antisocial behavior among villagers occurs twice as often in an area where resources are scarcer and competitive pressure is higher. Our results remain robust to the inclusion of various controls, including beliefs, socio-demographics, absolute and relative income, and within-group inequality. If one interprets decreasing another participant's payoff below one's own as a tendency towards conflict behavior, our results suggest a higher risk of conflict among resource users in areas of greater scarcity.

We administered social-choice tasks to more than 1,000 children and adults differentially affected by wars in the Republic of Georgia and Sierra Leone. We found that greater exposure to war created a lasting increase in people's egalitarian motivations toward their in-group, but not their out-groups, during a developmental window starting in middle childhood (around 7 years of age) and ending in early adulthood (around 20 years of age). Outside this window, war had no measurable impact on social motivations in young children and had only muted effects on the motivations of older adults. These war effects are broadly consistent with predictions from evolutionary approaches that emphasize the importance of group cooperation in defending against external threats, though they also highlight key areas in need of greater theoretical development.","[Bauer, Michal; Chytilova, Julie] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Bauer, Michal] CERGE EI, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Bauer, Michal] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Cassar, Alessandra] Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Henrich, Joseph] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Henrich, Joseph] Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Henrich, Joseph] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada","Bauer, M (corresponding author), CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",bauer@cerge-ei.cz; joseph.henrich@gmail.com,"Cassar, Alessandra/AAN-1426-2020; Chytilova, Julie/J-8621-2015; Bauer, Michal/H-2869-2014","Chytilova, Julie/0000-0002-8474-8192; Bauer, Michal/0000-0002-8414-5447",,,,45,106,107,0,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

We therefore aimed at identifying mechanisms driving alien species interactions. We conducted a common garden experiment investigating all pairwise combinations of 20 alien annual plant species in Germany. We first tested whether competition or facilitation occurred more often. Secondly, we determined whether individual traits, hierarchical or absolute trait distances, multivariate trait or phylogenetic distance explained alien plant interactions best. Thirdly, we assessed whether accounting for trait plasticity explains plant performance better than species-level trait averages. While the magnitude of interspecific competition compared to intraspecific competition was on average larger across the 190 alien species combinations, interspecific facilitation still occurred in 24% of cases. Interactions could be better explained by hierarchical trait distances which reflect competitive ability, compared to phylogenetic and multivariate trait distance (reflecting niche differences). This finding supports criticisms about the applicability of testing limiting similarity versus environmental filtering and the community phylogenetic approach. Specifically, when growing taller and having a lower specific leaf area than the co-occurring alien neighbour, biomass and seed number of individuals in mixture increased compared to growing alone. Effects of seed mass, root:shoot ratio and flowering time depended on the performance measure. In contrast to recent suggestions, accounting for trait plasticity did not necessarily explain plant performance better than models using species-level trait averages. These results advance our fundamental understanding of trait-interaction relationships, strengthening recent findings on the importance of competitive hierarchy in shaping interactions and community structure. In particular, applying these concepts to the novel case of alien-alien interactions, is crucial given the continuing accumulation of alien species around the globe.","[Ferenc, Viktoria; Sheppard, Christine S.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, DE-70593 Stuttgart, Germany","Ferenc, V (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, DE-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",viktoria.ferenc@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Sheppard, Christine S./0000-0002-7847-2310; Ferenc, Viktoria/0000-0003-4116-0089",Baden-Wurttemberg Stiftung,This work was funded by Baden-Wurttemberg Stiftung.

Specifically, longer and more pronounced waterlogged conditions are predicted after rain spells as well as more frequent droughts, especially in Central Europe. Such hydrological changes can severely affect species performance and alter the function of ecosystems, as well as favor plant invasions. Competition with native communities may change depending on water stress. Bunias orientalis is an invasive plant that may benefit from disturbance or precipitation changes. We conducted a 3-year mesocosm experiment in a common garden to investigate how invasion success of B. orientalis in native German grassland communities is affected by varying hydrological conditions (from very dry to waterlogged). We measured the establishment and growth of B. orientalis in varying water table depths in bare soil (simulating disturbance) vs. in the community. Establishment and biomass of B. orientalis was generally highest under non-stress conditions. The species was also highly tolerant to dry conditions, but only when growing in bare soil. However, performance of B. orientalis was generally low, whereby interspecific competition in communities greatly limited invasion success. This might be due to the low competitive ability of the species in conditions of hydrological stress and the near-natural grassland communities with an extensive mowing regime used in our experiment. Our results suggest that invasion success of B. orientalis in grasslands will not increase if precipitation patterns change toward more extreme events. However, disturbance that creates bare soil patches might favor B. orientalis under drought conditions.","[Corli, Anna] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Pavia, Italy; [Walter, Julia] Landwirtschaftl Technol Zentrum Augustenb, Pflanzenprod, Rheinstetten, Germany; [Sheppard, Christine S.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, Stuttgart, Germany","Sheppard, CS (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, Stuttgart, Germany.",christine.sheppard@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Sheppard, Christine S./0000-0002-7847-2310","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [WA 3442/2-1, SH 924/1-1]","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG, WA 3442/2-1 and SH 924/1-1).",,46,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Bicknell's Thrush populations are predicted to shift upslope in response to global warming, leading to local extinctions on mountains that lack the elevational extent to accommodate such shifts. However, biotic interactions may influence how montane species respond to changing abiotic conditions. In territorial songbirds, for example, aggression from dominant low-elevation species has been hypothesized to combine with warming temperatures to push'' populations of subordinate montane species upslope at a faster rate than in the absence of interspecific aggression. This push'' hypothesis could apply to Bicknell's Thrushes: the related Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) inhabits lower elevations, Bicknell's Thrushes are largely confined to mountaintops, and interspecific aggression by Swainson's Thrushes toward Bicknell's Thrushes has been anecdotally reported. We used reciprocal playback experiments to test whether patterns of interspecific aggression in Swainson's and Bicknell's thrushes along an elevational gradient in the Adirondack Mountains were consistent with the push'' hypothesis. We found weak asymmetrical interspecific aggression: Some Swainson's Thrush individuals at high elevations where the 2 species co-occurred responded aggressively to Bicknell's Thrush playback, and Bicknell's Thrushes did not respond aggressively to Swainson's Thrush playback. While Swainson's and Bicknell's thrushes appeared to regularly occupy overlapping home ranges, asymmetrical interspecific aggression from a lower-elevation species is consistent with the push'' hypothesis and suggests that interspecific aggression from Swainson's Thrushes may be a factor limiting Bicknell's Thrush populations in the Adirondack Mountains. More broadly, this case example supports the recent call to incorporate biotic interactions in models that predict montane species' responses to climate change.","[Freeman, Benjamin G.; Montgomery, Graham] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Freeman, Benjamin G.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA","Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA.; Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA.",bgf27@cornell.edu,"Montgomery, Graham/X-6293-2019","Montgomery, Graham/0000-0002-8217-8800",Kieckhefer Adirondack Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [2011083591],"A Kieckhefer Adirondack Fellowship to B.G.F. supported this research.

Understanding the persistence of cooperation and diversity is therefore a major problem for evolutionary ecology, especially in the context of well-mixed populations, where the potential for exploitation and displacement is greatest. Here, we demonstrate that a 'loner effect', described by economic game theorists, can maintain cooperation and diversity in real-world biological settings. We use mathematical models of public-good-producing bacteria to show that the presence of a loner strain, which produces an independent but relatively inefficient good, can lead to rock-paper-scissor dynamics, whereby cooperators outcompete loners, defectors outcompete cooperators and loners outcompete defectors. These model predictions are supported by our observations of evolutionary dynamics in well-mixed experimental communities of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We find that the coexistence of cooperators and defectors that produce and exploit, respectively, the iron-scavenging siderophore pyoverdine, is stabilized by the presence of loners with an independent iron-uptake mechanism. Our results establish the loner effect as a simple and general driver of cooperation and diversity in environments that would otherwise favour defection and the erosion of diversity.","[Inglis, R.

The interactions are framed to simulate real-world retail market competition. The participants compete in an effort task, with performance determining market returns. A highly incentivized individual round allows us to extract a measure of individual ability in the effort task. The subjects then compete in successive treatments, where in the final treatment the losing participant in a round can elect to burn their competitor's output, which is framed as the application of social pressure. The behavioural responses are significant and fitting with a theoretical model of the social institution we have in mind: even though subjects are from the same community they are willing to punish (apply social pressure), the probability of punishment is increasing in the gap in ability in the pair, and this leads to a decrease in performance from higher-ability individuals. The study provides an example of the use of framed lab experiments to shed light on market behaviour in developing countries, for which full-blown RCTs may face serious feasibility or ethical challenges.

Although a growing number of studies examine male and female signals in the context of coordinated vocal duets, the use of vocal signals by both sexes in non-duetting species is poorly documented, even though these species are more numerous than duetting species. Furthermore, few studies of tropical non-duetting species test for seasonal variation in signaling behavior. We studied season-specific and sex-specific variation in signaling behavior of a tropical resident songbird, the Rufous-capped Warbler (Basileuterus rufifrons), by conducting a playback experiment where we simulated conspecific territorial intruders producing three types of vocalizations (male songs, female calls, or a pair with simultaneous male songs and female calls) and a heterospecific control. We repeated playback during the pre-breeding and breeding seasons. Response intensity to playback varied with season and sex of the focal birds. During the pre-breeding season, both sexes showed strong physical approach responses and vocal responses to all conspecific intrusions, especially paired intrusions. During the breeding season, males responded strongly to all conspecific treatments, whereas females showed little response. Although females primarily used calls in response to conspecific playback, many females also sang, especially during the non-breeding season. Our results therefore suggest that both male and female signals are used for shared territory defense, but that the contributions of each sex to territory defense vary seasonally. Our results also contribute to our understanding of the evolution of combined male and female signaling during territory defense.","[Demko, Alana D.; Mennill, Daniel J.] Univ Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada","Demko, AD (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",demkoad@gmail.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Government of Ontario; University of Windsor; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR,"This research was funded through scholarship support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to ADD and grant support from NSERC, the Government of Ontario, the University of Windsor, and the Canada Foundation for Innovation to DJM.",,66,8,8,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

However, how plant functional traits are shaping these communities has received less attention though linking plant and microbial traits is crucial for better understanding plant-microbe interactions. Our objective was to determine how plant-microbe interactions were affected by plant traits. Specifically we analyzed how interactions between plant species and microbes involved in nitrogen cycling were affected by plant traits related to nitrogen nutrition in interaction with soil nitrogen availability. Eleven plant species, selected along an oligotrophic-nitrophilic gradient, were grown individually in a nitrogen-poor soil with two levels of nitrate availability. Plant traits for both carbon and nitrogen nutrition were measured and the genetic structure and abundance of rhizosphere microbial communities, in particular the ammonia oxidizer and nitrate reducer guilds, were analyzed. The structure of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere differed significantly between plant species and these differences depended on nitrogen availability. The results suggest that the rate of nitrogen uptake per unit of root biomass and per day is a key plant trait, explaining why the effect of nitrogen availability on the structure of the bacterial community depends on the plant species. We also showed that the abundance of nitrate reducing bacteria always decreased with increasing nitrogen uptake per unit of root biomass per day, indicating that there was competition for nitrate between plants and nitrate reducing bacteria. This study demonstrates that nitrate-reducing microorganisms may be adversely affected by plants with a high nitrogen uptake rate. Our work puts forward the role of traits related to nitrogen in plant-microbe interactions, whereas carbon is commonly considered as the main driver. It also suggests that plant traits related to ecophysiological processes, such as nitrogen uptake rates, are more relevant for understanding plant-microbe interactions than composite traits, such as nitrophily, which are related to a number of ecophysiological processes.","[Moreau, Delphine; Pivato, Barbara; Bru, David; Busset, Hugues; Deau, Florence; Faivre, Celine; Matejicek, Annick; Strbik, Florence; Philippot, Laurent; Mougel, Christophe] INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, F-21000 Dijon, France","Philippot, L (corresponding author), INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, BP 86510, F-21000 Dijon, France.",laurent.philippot@dijon.inra.fr,"Moreau, Delphine/C-5968-2014; Bru, David/A-9702-2016; Mougel, Christophe/D-5118-2017; Philippot, Laurent/G-5598-2011","Moreau, Delphine/0000-0003-2640-9931; Mougel, Christophe/0000-0001-8675-3115; Philippot, Laurent/0000-0003-3461-4492; Bru, David/0000-0002-1011-017X",Plant Health and Environment division of the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA),"This work was funded by the Plant Health and Environment division of the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA).

In birds, interspecific competition often occurs by song-mediated interference and frequently implies asymmetrical outcomes between the species pairs involved. Habitat loss resulting from agricultural intensification is expected to have aggregated bird species in the remaining suitable habitats, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecific competition. However, this process has rarely been considered as a potential factor limiting population recovery in farmland birds. We investigated whether interspecific competition occurs between grey, Perdix perdix, and red-legged, Alectoris rufa, partridges, two phylogenetically related species. Originally parapatric, they have suffered an artificial increase in their contact zone due to huge human-mediated gamebird releases. We analysed territorial behaviour through a playback stimuli experiment and investigated shifts in habitat niche in the absence and presence of a hypothetical competitor. Results showed that the grey partridge appeared less territorial when co-occurring with the red-legged partridge and shifted its habitat niche away from the latter, while no such change was detected for the red-legged partridge. These asymmetrical patterns in behaviour and ecology are predicted under an interspecific competition scenario beneficial to the red legged partridge, and therefore suggest that they are competitively dominant to grey partridges where they co-occur. This result has potentially strong implications for the management of grey partridges as gamebirds, and for their conservation in areas where they are almost extirpated.

We compared the impact of the native North American plant, Conyza canadensis, which is invasive to Eurasia, on species richness at home and in a number of introduced regions through well replicated transcontinental field studies, glasshouse experiments and individual-based models. Our results demonstrated mostly negative relationships between C.canadensis abundance and native species richness in nonnative ranges, but either positive or no relationships in its native North American range. In glasshouse experiments, the total biomass of Conyza was suppressed more by species from its native range than by species from regions where it is nonnative, but the effects of Conyza on other species did not show a consistent biogeographical pattern. Finally, individual-based models led to the exclusion of Conyza from North American scenarios but to high abundances in scenarios with species from the nonnative ranges of Conyza. We illustrate biogeographical differences in the impact of an invader across regional scales and suggest that inherent differences in one specific aspect of competitive ability, tolerance to the effects of other species, may play some role in these differences.","[Shah, Manzoor A.; Shah, Tabasum; Reshi, Zafar A.] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Callaway, Ragan M.; Pal, Robert W.; Xiao, Sa; Chen, Shuyan] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.; Pal, Robert W.; Xiao, Sa; Chen, Shuyan] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Houseman, Gregory R.] Wichita State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Wichita, KS 67208 USA; [Pal, Robert W.] Univ Pecs, Fac Sci, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary; [Xiao, Sa; Chen, Shuyan] Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Cell Activ & Stress Adaptat, Minist Educ, Sch Life Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Luo, Wenbo] NE Normal Univ, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Vegetat Restorat, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Rosche, Christoph] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Rosche, Christoph] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Bot Garden, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Khasa, Damase P.] Univ Laval, Ctr Forest Res, Quebec City, PQ GIV0A6, Canada; [Khasa, Damase P.] Univ Laval, Inst Syst & Integrat Biol, Quebec City, PQ GIV0A6, Canada","Shah, MA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",mashah75@yahoo.com,,"Houseman, Gregory/0000-0001-6554-770X; Khasa, Damase/0000-0002-9336-7770",DBT CREST Award; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0614406]; NSF EPSCoR Track-1 [EPS-1101342]; European UnionEuropean Commission [300639]; State Key Program of the National Natural Science of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31230014]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in UniversityProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-13-0265]; Central University Special Fund [lzujbky-2013-101]; Office of Integrative ActivitiesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1443108] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"M.A.S. is grateful for the DBT CREST Award 2012 to work on this project at the University of Montana.

Some evidence indicates that invasive plant species might benefit from climate change via these features. However, apart from theory-based predictions, knowledge of the tolerance of invasive species to short-term climatic stress is very limited. We investigated whether three naturalized alien plant species in central Europe, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Hieracium aurantiacum and Lysimachia punctata perform better under stressful conditions than comparable native species. A greenhouse experiment with a fixed stress sequence of frost, drought and water logging was setup. We applied this stress treatment to two life history stages (seedling and adult plants), plants grown in monoculture (mild intraspecific competition) and in a highly competitive setting with intra- and interspecific competition. Whilst small differences in plant responses were detected the alien species overall were not more tolerant to stress. The responses of alien and native congeners/confamilials to stress in all treatments (monoculture, competition, adult, seedling) were similar, which indicates that stress thresholds are phylogenetically conserved. All species were more vulnerable to stress at the seedling stage and when subject to competition. Our data indicates that results obtained from experiments using only monocultures and one development stage are not appropriate for drawing generalizations about lethal thresholds. Moreover, rather abrupt species-specific thresholds exist, which indicates that a prediction of species responses based on just two stress levels, as is the case in most studies, is not sufficient.","[Laube, Julia; Ziegler, Kathrin; Sparks, Tim H.; Estrella, Nicole; Menzel, Annette] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Ecoclimatol, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Laube, Julia; Sparks, Tim H.; Estrella, Nicole; Menzel, Annette] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Sparks, Tim H.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Sparks, Tim H.] Coventry Univ, Sigma, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England","Laube, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Ecoclimatol, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",julia.laube@wzw.tum.de; kathrin.ziegler.msc@gmx.de; thsparks@btopenworld.com; estrella@wzw.tum.de; amenzel@wzw.tum.de,"; Menzel, Annette/B-1105-2013","Estrella, Nicole/0000-0002-1028-0048; Menzel, Annette/0000-0002-7175-2512; Sparks, Tim/0000-0003-4382-7051","Technische Universitat Munchen - Institute for Advanced Study - German Excellence Initiative; European Research Council, under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [282250]","We thank Petra Scheuerer, Udo Ehlers, Ivonne Juttner, F.

This is because biotic interactions are notoriously context dependent and traits leading to success in one habitat might be costly or unimportant in another. We aim to identify plant characteristics that are related to biotic interactions and may drive patterns of rarity and commonness, taking environmental context into account. Location Switzerland. Methods In a multispecies experiment, we compared the response to biotic interactions of 19 rare and 21 widespread congeneric plant species in Switzerland, while also accounting for variation in environmental conditions of the species' origin. Results Our results restrict the long-standing hypothesis that widespread species are superior competitors to rare species to only those species originating from resource-rich habitats, in which competition is usually strong. Tolerance to herbivory and ambient herbivore damage, on the other hand, did not differ between widespread and rare species. In accordance with the resource-availability hypothesis, widespread species from resource-rich habitats where more damaged by herbivores (less defended) than widespread species from resource-poor habitats-such a growth-defence trade-off was lacking in rare species. This indicates that the evolutionary important trade-off between traits increasing competitive ability and defence is present in widespread species but may have been lost or never evolved in rare species. Main conclusions Our results indicate that biotic interactions, above all competition, might indeed set range limits and underlines the importance of including context dependency in studies comparing traits of common and rare or invasive and non-invasive species.","[Kempel, Anne; Vincent, Hugo; Prati, Daniel; Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, Bot Garden, Bern, Switzerland","Kempel, A (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",kempel@ips.unibe.ch,"Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008","Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900; Kempel, Anne/0000-0002-0563-901X",,,,56,2,2,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

I argue that voters do not take a party's statements at face value because these messages can be a strategic tool to win elections. Voters discount popular statements because they may respond to vote-seeking incentives rather than reflect the party's sincere views. Espousing unpopular policies has less instrumental value in obtaining more votes and therefore is more credible. I have tested this argument with a survey experiment fielded in the United Kingdom that exposes respondents to Conservative and Labour Party statements on immigration and the National Health Service. I report evidence that popular statements tend to have a weaker effect on voter perceptions than unpopular ones. This finding suggests a paradox: the more a party needs to change its reputation in order to gain votes, the stronger the voters' skepticism.","[Fernandez-Vazquez, Pablo] Univ Pittsburgh, Polit Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Fernandez-Vazquez, P (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Polit Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",pablo.fernandezvz@gmail.com,"Fernandez-Vazquez, Pablo/ABG-6875-2020","Fernandez-Vazquez, Pablo/0000-0003-1296-1936",,,,12,7,7,2,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3816,1468-2508,,J POLIT,J.

Transferrins can also act as antimicrobial agents, by tightly sequestering iron and making it unavailable for bacterial growth. Using a combination of quadrupolar central transition (QCT) metal ion NMR (Al-27, Sc-45, V-51, and Ga-71) and C-13 NMR, the binding and displacement of a variety of metal ions to ovotransferrin was studied through direct metal ion competition experiments. The metal ions investigated (Al3+, Co3+, Fe3+, Ga3+, In3+, Se3+, Y3+, and VO2+) were of differing ionic radius and charge, thus allowing for an assessment of how these factors contribute to metal ion affinity. The competition for the N- and C-terminal metal ion binding sites on ovotransferrin was directly followed by metal ion QCT NMR. Moreover, C-13 NMR was used to study the two protein-bound synergistic anions (C-13-labeled carbonate), whose chemical shifts are distinct and dependent on the bound metal ion that is present in the binding sites. The observed order of decreasing affinity for the metal ions studied was Fe3+ approximate to In3+ >= Sc3+ >= Ga3+ > Al3+ > VO2+ > Y3+ >= Co3+. These results illustrate how a combination of multinuclear solution NMR methods can provide unique insights into the ligand binding properties of larger metalloproteins.","[Saponja, Jillian A.; Vogel, Hans J.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Biochem Res Grp, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Vogel, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Biochem Res Grp, 2500 Univ Dr 1 NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",vogel@ucalgary.ca,,,Medical Research Council (MRC) of CanadaUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC); AHFMRAlberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research,"This research was supported by an operating grant from the Medical Research Council (MRC) of Canada.

The experimental removal of early successional species can explain how plant communities change over time. 2. During a 7.3-year period, early successional woody species, scrambling ferns and tree ferns were removed from a total of 10 landslides in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in north-eastern Puerto Rico. 3. Early successional woody plants in combination with tree ferns decreased species richness and cover of forbs and increased richness of late-successional woody plants compared to removals, facilitating long-term forest development. 4. Dense stands of scrambling ferns decreased both forb and woody plant richness compared to removals, inhibiting forest development. 5. Stands of monospecific tree ferns initially increased woody plant richness compared to removals, but overall decreased woody plant richness and cover, inhibiting forest development. 6.Synthesis. Early successional species both facilitate and inhibit succession on tropical landslides, but detailed predictions of successional trajectories remain elusive and are influenced by stochastic processes including arrival order, the life-form of colonizing species and their competitive interactions.","[Walker, Lawrence R.; Landau, Frederick H.; Velazquez, Eduardo] Univ Nevada, Sch Life Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Walker, Lawrence R.; Shiels, Aaron B.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Velazquez, Eduardo] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ecol, Madrid 28871, Spain; [Sparrow, Ashley D.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [Sparrow, Ashley D.] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Alice Springs, NT 0871, Australia","Walker, LR (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Sch Life Sci, Box 454004,4505 Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",walker@unlv.nevada.edu,"Sparrow, Ashley/D-7872-2011; Sparrow, Ashley/AAD-7709-2020","Sparrow, Ashley/0000-0003-0388-8255; Velazquez, Eduardo/0000-0002-7651-7191","United States National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); University of Puerto Rico; United States Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Luquillo Experimental Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Program [DEB-0218039, DEB-0620910]","We thank Oscar Abelleira, Maria Aponte, Brittany Barber, Tammy Nyugen, Cindy Phillips, Michael Powers, Chelse Prather, Laura Shiels and Christine West for field assistance; Lauren Kaminski and Neil Pascual for laboratory analyses; Francisco de Castro and Shiyun Wen for assistance with the hemispherical photos; Frank Axelrod for plant identifications; and the staff of the El Verde Field Station for logistical support.

The ICS includes an internal transfer payment from the lowest to highest contributing team proportional to the difference in group contributions. The ICS requires minimal information, makes the efficient contribution a dominant strategy, and is budget balanced. These features make the ICS ideally suited to solve the moral hazard problem in team production. Our experiment demonstrates that the ICS raises contributions to almost reach optimality with the appropriate parameters. We also show experimentally that the success of the ICS can be primarily attributed to the effect of higher returns and to the introduction of competition, and it is not due to the introduction of potential losses or information regarding other groups.","[Guillen, Pablo; Slonim, Robert] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Merrett, Danielle] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Guillen, P (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",pablo.guillen@sydney.edu.au; danielle.merrett@sydney.edu.au; robert.slonim@sydney.edu.au,,"Slonim, Robert/0000-0002-9513-4970",Faculty of Economics and Business; School of Economics at the University of Sydney,"The authors are indebted to Yan Chen, Rachel Croson, Enrique Fatas, Glenn Harrison, Alvin Roth, Tom Wilkening, and Ralph Bayer, as well as to participants at the 2010 International Meeting on Experimental and Behavioral Economics and the QuBE Workshop on Behavioural and Experimental Economics at Queensland University of Technology for helpful comments.

We experimentally investigate the robustness of this solution by introducing different channels of communication that naturally arise from group competitions. In the absence of communication, we confirm that output sharing can introduce sufficient free riding to offset over-harvesting and results in full efficiency. Allowing local communication within output-sharing groups substantially decreases this efficiency enhancement because it reduces free riding and boosts between-group competition. Yet the efficiency level is still significantly higher than that achieved when global communication is allowed among all appropriators in a conventional common pool resource without output sharing. The efficiency-reducing effect of local communication is mitigated when random partners instead of fixed partners are sharing output over time, and is nearly eliminated when random partners are formed with users who belong to different communication groups.","[Buckley, Neil J.] York Univ, Dept Econ, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Mestelman, Stuart; Muller, R.

Liebl., and pedunculate oak, Q. robur L.) is of considerable importance in Europe and will probably become even more important under climate change. Therefore, the performance of oak and beech in mixture was compared with the species' growth in pure stands. Data from 37 long-term mixing experiments in Poland, Germany and Switzerland were pooled for analysis of mixing effects on stand productivity and possible interrelationships with mixing portions or site conditions. We found that on average, mixed stands of oak and beech exceeded biomass productivity in pure stands by 30 % or 1.7 t ha(-1) year(-1), as the growth of both species was benefitted by the mixture. However, that the interaction actually ranged from facilitation and overyielding on poor sites to underyielding on fertile sites triggered by competition. An empirically derived interaction model showed volume and dry mass growth changing in mixed stands from gains of 50 % to losses of 10 % depending on site conditions. It is concluded that the analysed mixture grows in accordance with the stress-gradient hypothesis and that our results suggest a site-specific relationship between species mixture and biomass productivity. As a consequence, an adequate species mix should result in increased productivity under steady state as well as climate change.","[Pretzsch, Hans; Dieler, Jochen] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Bielak, Kamil; Zasada, Michal] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Warsaw, Poland; [Block, Joachim; Ehrhart, Hans-Peter] Res Inst Forest Ecol & Forestry Rhineland Palatin, Trippstadt, Germany; [Bruchwald, Arkadiusz] Forest Res Inst, Sekocin Stary, Poland; [Kohnle, Ulrich] Forest Res Inst Baden Wurttemberg, Freiburg, Germany; [Nagel, Juergen; Spellmann, Hermann] Northwest German Forest Res Stn, Gottingen, Germany; [Zingg, Andreas] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Pretzsch, H (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",Hans.Pretzsch@lrz.tum.de,"Pretzsch, Hans/K-3716-2014; Zasada, Michal/U-6141-2017; Bruchwald, Arkadiusz/R-4165-2018; Zasada, Michal/AAH-2819-2020; Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Zasada, Michal/0000-0002-4881-296X; Bruchwald, Arkadiusz/0000-0001-5861-015X; Zasada, Michal/0000-0002-4881-296X; Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Bielak, Kamil/0000-0002-1327-4911","German Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Sonderforschungsbereich SFB 607]; Bavarian State Ministry for Nutrition, Agriculture and Forestry [W 07]","Thanks to Gregor Aas, Ecological-Botanical Garden, University of Bayreuth, for his advice how to deal with the two different Quercus species in this evaluation and to Anton Fischer, Geoecology, Technische Universitat Munchen, for revision of the geoecological statements on oak and beech.

Moreover, few studies examine the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors for limiting species ranges. We combined multiple approaches to assess the extent to which fitness of a widespread native annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, decreases at and beyond its northern and western range edges, and how this is influenced by the presence of neighbors. First, we examined plant fitness and the effect of neighbors in natural populations at different geographic range locations for three years. Fitness decreased toward the northern range edge, but not the western edge. Neighbor removal had a consistently positive effect on seedpod production across all years and sites. Second, we established experimental populations at sites within the range, and at and beyond the northern and western range edges. We tracked individual fitness and recorded seedling recruitment in the following year (a complete generation) to estimate population growth rate. Individual fitness and population growth declined to near zero beyond both range edges, indicating that C. fasciculata with its present genetic composition will not establish in these regions, given conditions currently. We also carried out a neighbor removal treatment. Consistent with the natural populations, neighbors reduced seedpod production of reproductive adults. However, neighbors also increased early-season survival, and this positive effect early in life history resulted in a net positive effect of neighbors on lifetime fitness at most range locations. Our data show that the population growth rate of C. fasciculata includes values above replacement, and populations are well adapted to conditions up to the edge of the range, whereas the severely compromised fitness at sites beyond the edge precludes immediate establishment of populations and thereby impedes adaptation to these conditions.","[Stanton-Geddes, John; Shaw, Ruth G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Tiffin, Peter] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Stanton-Geddes, J (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",stant067@umn.edu,,"Tiffin, Peter/0000-0003-1975-610X; Stanton-Geddes, John/0000-0003-4667-2542","Dayton Wilkie Fellowship; Alexander and Lydia Anderson Fellowship; Ray C.

We focus on a more recent phenomenon: smart markets. This phenomenon is starting to draw considerable interdisciplinary attention from the researchers in computer science, operations research, and economics communities. The objective of this commentary is to identify and outline fruitful research areas where IS researchers can provide valuable contributions. The idea of smart markets revolves around using theoretically supported computational tools to both understand the characteristics of complex trading environments and multiechelon markets and help human decision makers make real-time decisions in these complex environments. We outline the research opportunities for complex trading environments primarily from the perspective of design of computational tools to analyze individual market organization and provide decision support in these complex environments. In addition, we present broad research opportunities that computational platforms can provide, including implications for policy and regulatory research.","[Bichler, Martin] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Gupta, Alok] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Ketter, Wolfgang] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Decis & Informat Sci, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Bichler, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",bichler@in.tum.de; alok@umn.edu; wketter@rsm.nl,"Gupta, Alok/AAF-4281-2020; Ketter, Wolfgang/W-4931-2017","Gupta, Alok/0000-0002-2097-1643; Ketter, Wolfgang/0000-0001-9008-142X",,,,29,72,72,1,32,INFORMS,HANOVER,"7240 PARKWAY DR, STE 310, HANOVER, MD 21076-1344 USA",1047-7047,,,INFORM SYST RES,Inf.

We ask if the underlying mechanisms operate at specific points in plant life history, and if patterns are consistent along different stress gradients. Location Boreal, sub-alpine and alpine grasslands in southern Norway. Methods We test the SGH through ontogeny along stress gradients by monitoring seedlings in intact vegetation vs bare-ground gaps across a climatic grid of temperature and precipitation gradients. We follow one seedling cohort over two years and quantify four vital rates; emergence, survival, establishment success, and growth rate, to determine if biotic interaction effects (intact vs removed vegetation) on each of these stages shift along gradients in accordance with the SGH. Results We find competitive effects early in ontogeny, reflected in increased probability of seedling emergence in gaps. The magnitude of competition increases with temperature and precipitation, in line with the SGH. Growth rate of alpine seedlings was higher in intact vegetation vs gaps, indicating facilitation, and in accordance with the SGH, these effects decreased towards warmer climates. The net outcome of these processes occurring in early life history are reflected in the seedling community, where richness of emerging and surviving species is higher in bare-ground gaps than in intact vegetation, with increasing effect toward warmer but not toward wetter sites. Conclusion Our results support the SGH for the earliest stages in plant life, predicting shifts from competitive to neutral or facilitative interactions toward colder climates. The biotic interaction effects on vital rates vary over ontogeny, with competition dominating for emergence whereas facilitation was more evident for seedling growth. The patterns along the precipitation gradient indicate stress at both the dry and the wet end. We highlight the importance of studies across ontogeny and along different gradients to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the SGH.","[Klanderud, Kari] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Meineri, Eric; Michel, Pascale; Berge, Astrid; Vandvik, Vigdis] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Meineri, Eric] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Avignon, IMBE Marseille, CNRS,IRD, Marseille, France; [Goldberg, Deborah E.; Guittar, John L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Berge, Astrid] Direktoratet Nat Forvaltning, Trondheim, Norway; [Vandvik, Vigdis] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway","Klanderud, K (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",kari.klanderud@nmbu.no,"Vandvik, Vigdis/C-1924-2008","Vandvik, Vigdis/0000-0003-4651-4798; , Kari/0000-0003-1049-7025",NorgesForskningsr (NORKLIMA) [184912/230],NorgesForskningsr (NORKLIMA #184912/230).,,50,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

The objective of this study was to assess the performance of six maize genotypes under intercropping with conservation tillage (no-till) - two promising options for SI. The experiment was carried out over three years (or six cropping seasons) at Kiboko Research Station, Kenya with sole cropping and mouldboard ploughing as baseline production systems. Results showed that maize genotypes and cropping systems had a significant effect on yield, but the effect of tillage was not significant. Moreover, there was no significant interactive effects of the tested factors on maize yield. The maize genotype CKH10085 had the highest yield of 7.7 t ha(-1) under sole cropping yet it also recorded the largest yield penalty due to intercropping of 1.1 t ha(-1). On the other hand, genotype CKH10717 maintained the same average yield of 7.1 t ha(-1) in both conventional and conservation tillage systems. The commercial genotype genotype CKH10080 and CKH08051 were more stable than the other experimental genotypes under the variable growing and management conditions. These two genotypes are of intermediate maturity and drought tolerance, two critical attributes to improved maize production. Intercropping reduced maize yields due to increased competition, for example the overall yield of sole cropping was 7.1 t ha(-1) compared with 6.4 t ha(-1) under intercropping; representing an overall yield penalty of 0.7 t ha(-1). The differences in performance of maize genotypes revealed opportunities to deploy genotypes to reduce risk or maximize yield, depending on the biophysical circumstances and the production objective of the farmer.","[Rusinamhodzi, Leonard] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, CSIR Campus,PMB 56, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Rusinamhodzi, Leonard; Makumbi, Dan; Njeru, James M.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, ICRAF Campus,POB 1041-00621, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kanampiu, Fred] Int Inst Trop Agr, ICIPE Campus Duduville,POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya","Rusinamhodzi, L (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, CSIR Campus,PMB 56, Legon, Accra, Ghana.; Rusinamhodzi, L (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, ICRAF Campus,POB 1041-00621, Nairobi, Kenya.",l.rusinamhodzi@cgiar.org,"Rusinamhodzi, Leonard/ABH-8601-2020","Rusinamhodzi, Leonard/0000-0002-5576-2040",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res [CSE/2009/024]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPPGD1390],"This study was made possible through the project on Sustainable Intensification of Maize-Legume Systems for Food Security in Eastern and Southern Africa -SIMLESA funded by Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) through a grant to CIMMYT (CSE/2009/024 variation 3), the drought tolerant maize hybrids used in this research were developed through the Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA) project at CIMMYT supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF, grant OPPGD1390).

In addition, they provide key empirical data that may be used in predictive modelling to forecast evolutionary responses of natural ecosystems to future environmental changes. However, excluding a few exceptional cases, long-term studies are scarce because of logistic difficulties associated with accessing temporal samples. Temporal dynamics are frequently studied in the laboratory or in controlled mesocosm experiments with exceptional studies that reconstruct the evolution of natural populations in the wild. Here, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided to revive or resurrect dormant Daphnia magna, a widespread zooplankton keystone species in aquatic ecosystems, to dramatically advance the state-of-the-art longitudinal data collection in natural systems. The field of Resurrection Ecology was defined in 1999 by Kerfoot and co-workers, even though the first attempts at hatching diapausing zooplankton eggs date back to the late 1980s. Since Kerfoot's seminal paper, the methodology of resurrecting zooplankton species has been increasingly frequently applied, though propagated among laboratories only via direct knowledge transfer. Here, an SOP is described that provides a step-by-step protocol on the practice of resurrecting dormant Daphnia magna eggs. Two key studies are provided in which the fitness response of resurrected Daphnia magna populations to warming is measured, capitalizing on the ability to study historical and modern populations in the same settings. Finally, the application of next generation sequencing technologies to revived or still dormant stages is discussed. These technologies provide unprecedented power in dissecting the processes and mechanisms of evolution if applied to populations that have experienced changes in selection pressure over time.","[Cambronero, Maria Cuenca; Orsini, Luisa] Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Environm Genom Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Orsini, L (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Environm Genom Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",l.orsini@bham.ac.uk,,"Orsini, Luisa/0000-0002-1716-5624; Cuenca Cambronero, Maria/0000-0002-5342-2165",NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/N016777/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/N016777/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"This work was supported by the NERC highlights grant (NE/N016777/1).

Recent experiments appear to validate this approach by showing effects of correlated trait and phylogenetic distances on coexistence. However, traits governing resource use in animals are often labile. To test whether feeding trait or phylogenetic diversity can predict competition and production in communities of grazing amphipods, we manipulated both types of diversity independently in mesocosms. We found that increasing the feeding trait diversity of the community increased the number of species coexisting, reduced dominance and changed food availability. In contrast, phylogenetic diversity had no effect, suggesting that whatever additional ecological information it represents was not relevant in this context. Although community phylogenetic structure in the field may result from multiple traits with potential for phylogenetic signal, phylogenetic effects on species interactions in controlled experiments may depend on the lability of fewer key traits.","[Best, R.

During 1999-2001, we experimentally created two population densities of North American elk (Cervus elaphus), a high-density population at 20elk/km(2), and a low-density population at 4elk/km(2) to test hypotheses relative to timing and duration of sexual segregation and variation in selection of resources. We used multi-response permutation procedures to investigate patterns of sexual segregation, and resource selection functions to document differences in selection of resources by individuals in high- and low-density populations during sexual segregation and aggregation. The duration of sexual segregation was 2months longer in the high-density population and likely was influenced by individuals in poorer nutritional condition, which corresponded with later conception and parturition, than at low density. Males and females in the high-density population overlapped in selection of resources to a greater extent than in the low-density population, probably resulting from density-dependent effects of increased intraspecific competition and lower availability of resources.","[Stewart, Kelley M.; Walsh, Danielle R.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Kie, John G.; Bowyer, R.

The association between product market competition and the cost of equity capital is more pronounced with lower analyst coverage, lower forecast accuracy, higher forecast dispersion, and higher bid-ask spread. Using import tariff rate reductions as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that tariff reductions intensify domestic product market competition, which in turn reduces firms' cost of equity capital. When the tariff rate reduction is larger, the more intensified competition reduces the cost of equity capital to a greater extent. Tariff rate reductions also influence firms' financing policy, cash flow from operations, and growth rate.","[Zheng, Zhen; Liu, Xinming] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zhen; Yu, Xiaoou; Liu, Xinming] Xiamen Univ, Ctr Accounting Studies, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yongjia] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Ave Wai Long, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaoou] Xiamen Univ, Inst Financial & Accounting Studies, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China","Liu, XM (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.; Liu, XM (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Ctr Accounting Studies, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.",zhenzheng@xmu.edu.cn; yjlin@must.edu.mo; xiaoouyu@xmu.edu.cn; xmliu@xmu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71702160, 71790602, 71772156, 72002183]; MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities [16JJD790034]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720181022, 20720171077, 20720191033]; Strategic Innovation Research Foundation of Fujian Province [2020R0010]","Zhen Zheng appreciates the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71702160, 71790602, 71772156) ; the MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities (16JJD790034) ; and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (20720171077) .

In addition, most plant -species removal experiments in grasslands are short-term (1e2 years), which may imprecisely reflect transient effects arising from methodological limitations. We conducted a dominant species removal experiment in a subalpine ecosystem, containing a mosaic of grass-dominated and shrub-dominated community patches, both of which are common in the subalpine zone of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We examined the direction and magnitude of the effects of three co-dominant grass and a dominant shrub species on subordinate species richness and biomass over a 6-year period. Removal of the dominant grass species alleviated their competitive pressure on subdominant grasses, which resulted in similar total and grass biomass detected in the final year of the study. By contrast, shrub removal showed no effects on its subordinate species biomass. Furthermore, neither the removal of the dominant shrubs nor the grasses altered their respective subordinate species richness. Thus, in subalpine ecosystems that experience harsh environmental conditions, our results showed that the direction of interactive effects of dominant plant species on subordinate species may be dependent on the plant functional type and are not necessarily facilitative. Furthermore, we showed that longer-term plant-removal experi-ment observations may be required to better determine the effects of species removal for this subalpine and other montane ecosystem(s).

The competition is typically organized every two years and deals with relevant issues for the community such as the definition of evaluation standards, the publication of benchmarks and the collection and dissemination of data about state-of-the-art planners. This paper focuses on the deterministic part, the longest-running part of the International Planning Competition. The paper describes its format, the participants, the selection of benchmarks and the generated results accompanied with analysis from different perspectives. The paper also examines the results of a brand new track created to explore the potential of planners that exploit the power of multi-core processors. Overall, the results of the competition indicate significant progress with respect to previous competitions, but they also reveal that some issues remain open and need further research, such as the coverage of temporal planners when concurrency is required and the performance in the multi-core track. As a novelty, all the data and the software generated for running the competition have been made publicly available allowing researchers to reproduce the competition and to carry out different analysis of the results.

In this game, decision makers face uncertainty about the consequences of their choice, but can rely on recommendations from advisors. Financial incentives between alternatives are not aligned for the two players, which produces an incentive to lie. While many advisors tell the truth against their monetary self-interest, the propensity to tell the truth is unaffected by the contextual variation. In contrast, decision makers show less trust in a competitive context, but only when they have no explicit information about the payoff alignment. The context seems to shape their belief about the situation. The data of this study is largely in line with Subjective Equilibrium Analysis [Kalai, E., Lehrer, E., 1995.

We propose that distinct aspects of environmental change associated with N enrichment (resource limitation, asymmetric competition, and interactions with soil microbes) drive different aspects of plant response. We test this in greenhouse mesocosms, experimentally manipulating each factor across three ecosystems: tallgrass prairie, alpine tundra and desert grassland. We found that resource limitation controlled productivity responses to N enrichment in all systems. Asymmetric competition was responsible for diversity declines in two systems. Plant community composition was impacted by both asymmetric competition and altered soil microbes, with some contributions from resource limitation. Results suggest there may be generality in the mechanisms of plant community change with N enrichment. Understanding these links can help us better predict N response across a wide range of ecosystems.","[Farrer, Emily C.] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Farrer, Emily C.; Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA","Farrer, EC (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.; Farrer, EC (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",efarrer@tulane.edu,"Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017; Farrer, Emily/AAD-4639-2020","Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176; Farrer, Emily/0000-0001-8003-8831","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919569]; Niwot Ridge LTER [DEB-0423662, DEB-1027341]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Sevilleta LTERs; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1440478] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank Lisa August-Schmidt, Katherine Bailey, Nicolas Cabrera, Truc Dinh, Amy Foo, Shiyang Fu, Tammy Lee, Donna Lek, Liana Nichols, Nicole Parish, Alexandra Race, Louis Spanias, and the Suding lab for their assistance in planting, harvesting and processing samples.

We analyzed whether growth form of C-4 grasses affects invasion success. The experimental plots represented three patch-types arising from short-term grazing effects and were dominated by prostrate C-4 grasses, erect C-4 grasses and codominated by prostrate C-4 grasses and forbs. We seeded the plots with four exotic species: one perennial C-4 grass, one annual C-3 grass, one perennial forb and one annual legume. Contrary to many studies conducted at small spatial scales, our results suggest that in our system, the processes that control invasibility are not directly linked with resident species richness or biomass, but rather are driven by growth form. Emergence of invaders did not differ among patch-types, but seedlings survived less in plots dominated by erect grasses. We suggest that the erect growth form of C-4 grass species is more successful in preventing invasion by mediating seedling competition for light under the canopy for a longer period of time. Grazing management, through its ability to regulate canopy architecture, is a potentially important tool in controlling invasion.","[Bresciano, Daniella] Univ Republica, Fac Agron, Dept Sistemas Ambientales, Montevideo 12900, Uruguay; [Altesor, Alice; Rodriguez, Claudia] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ecol & Ciencias Ambientales, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay","Bresciano, D (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Fac Agron, Dept Sistemas Ambientales, Montevideo 12900, Uruguay.",dbrescia@fagro.edu.uy,,,Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion (ANII) of Uruguay,"We thank V.

Few ecological studies have addressed their questions through long-term, experimental approaches, and many questions remain unanswered regarding temporal patterns in ecological effect sizes. We document temporal variation in effect sizes in response to pulse and press manipulations in a long-term factorial field experiment at Nash's Field, England. The experiment comprises seven treatments applied in a split-plot design to test the single and interactive effects of herbivory by insects, molluscs, and rabbits, liming, nutrient limitation (applied as press experiments), competition (exclusion of grasses or herbs with specific herbicides), and seed limitation (pulse experiments) on plant community dynamics. The response of all vascular plant species was followed for two decades. High species richness was positively related to the minus-grass herbicide in the first decade and negatively related to both nitrogen addition and the abundance of dominant species in both decades. Many significant effects appeared quickly, but some large effects were not detected until year 15. Press experiments produced some long-lasting effects, but effect sizes changed due to both idiosyncratic year effects and secular trends. For pulse experiments, most effects, including positive and negative responses to herbicide application and the invasion of most of the sown species, disappeared quickly. However, some endured or grew monotonically, such as the invasion of two sown species that benefited from particular combinations of the press treatments. The fastest effects to appear were the responses from established species. Many of these responses were negative, likely resulting from reduced niche dimensionality and competitive exclusion by new dominant species. Contrarily, one of the largest community-level effects took well over a decade to appear: the natural invasion by one species, which responded to a four-way interaction between experimental treatments. The insights gained from individual effects increased with the duration of the lag before their first appearance, drawing attention to the importance of long-term, manipulative field experiments. This experiment also reinforces the point that factorial experiments are the most insightful way to explore ecological interactions.","[Leverkus, Alexandro B.; Crawley, Michael J.] Imperial Coll London, Div Ecol & Evolut, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Leverkus, Alexandro B.] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Madrid 28805, Spain; [Leverkus, Alexandro B.] Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, Granada 18071, Spain","Leverkus, AB (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Div Ecol & Evolut, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.; Leverkus, AB (corresponding author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Madrid 28805, Spain.; Leverkus, AB (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, Granada 18071, Spain.",leverkus@ugr.es,"Leverkus, Alexandro/AAG-7761-2019","Leverkus, Alexandro/0000-0001-5452-3614",Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation Funding Source: Medline; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Funding Source: Medline; MINECO Funding Source: Medline; MECD Funding Source: Medline,,,50,2,2,9,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2020,101,6,,,,,,,e03009,10.1002/ecy.3009,,,21,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LU9YA,WOS:000538100800021,32031674,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-30,

Our results are based on the estimation of a dynamic game of network competition using data from the Airline Origin and Destination Survey with information on quantities, prices, and entry and exit decisions for every airline company in the routes between the 55 largest US cities. As methodological contributions of the paper, we propose and apply a method to reduce the dimension of the state space in dynamic games, and a procedure to deal with the problem of multiple equilibria when implementing counterfactual experiments. Our empirical results show that the most important factor to explain the adoption of hub-and-spoke networks is that the sunk cost of entry in a route declines importantly with the number of cities that the airline connects from the origin and destination airports of the route. For some carriers, the entry deterrence motive is the second most important factor to explain hub-and-spoke networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In grasslands, the micro-environment generated under the canopy of shrubs could differentially affect co-occurring species with different abiotic requirements. In a C-3/C-4 grassland with scattered shrubs, we asked the following questions: (a) Does the aerial effect, the below-ground effect, and the net effect of shrubs affect the vegetative and reproductive biomass, the number of tillers, the biomass allocation, and the leaf elongation rate of grasses? and (b) Do these effects differ between C-3 and C-4 grasses? Location Temperate sub-humid grassland of Uruguay. Methods We planted one C-3 and two C-4 grasses under a shrub canopy and in adjacent open sites. Half of the grasses were planted with a fabric bag to reduce root competition with the shrub. We measured leaf elongation rate, the number of tillers produced and the biomass of the grasses in every treatment. We also measured photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), air temperature and wind speed under shrub canopies and in adjacent open sites. Results Root biomass, aerial biomass and reproductive biomass, the number of tillers and the leaf elongation rate of the C-4 grasses were negatively affected by the reduction in radiation and probably by below-ground competition with the shrub. On the other hand, the leaf elongation rate of the C-3 grasses was positively affected by the shrub canopy. PPFD, air temperature and wind speed were lower under shrubs than in adjacent open sites. Conclusions Our results show the interplay between plant interactions and photosynthetic metabolism on the vegetative and reproductive performance of grasses. The micro-environmental conditions generated below shrub canopies create a more appropriate site for the growth of C-3 than for C-4 grasses. These results show that shrubs may differentially affect co-occurring species with different abiotic requirements.","[Fernandez, Gaston] Univ Republ, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Grp Multidisciplinario Ecol Agr, Treinta Y Tres, Uruguay; [Altesor, Alice] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ecol & Ciencias Ambientales, Montevideo, Uruguay","Fernandez, G (corresponding author), Univ Republ, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Grp Multidisciplinario Ecol Agr, Treinta Y Tres, Uruguay.",gfernandez@cure.edu.uy,,"Fernandez, Gaston/0000-0002-3866-6428",Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion [BE_POS_2009_719]; Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) CRN III 3095 - US National Science Foundation [GEO-1128040]; Programa de Desarrollo de las Ciencias Basicas of Uruguay,"This work was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion (BE_POS_2009_719), the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) CRN III 3095, which is supported by the US National Science Foundation (Grant GEO-1128040) and the Programa de Desarrollo de las Ciencias Basicas of Uruguay.",,62,2,3,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Males have been shown to adapt to sperm competition by modifying their behaviour and/or reproductive physiology. We investigated the fitness effects of male responses to sperm competition in house mice, Mus domesticus. Males that had been evolving with (polygamy) and without (monogamy) sperm competition for 18 generations were subject to different frequencies of social encounters with conspecific males to generate a sperm competition 'risk' treatment and a 'no risk' treatment. After manipulation of their social environment for 15-22 days, males were forced to compete for fertilizations against a male with the same selection history that experienced no manipulation. We genotyped embryos at 16 days gestation to quantify paternity success, and thus the competitive ability, of the experimental males. While there was no treatment effect on mating behaviour and paternity success, males from polygamous lines had significantly increased mating duration and paternity success when positioned in the disfavoured role of the second male to mate. Thus, males that had evolved with sperm competition showed greater mating effort and fitness compared to males that had evolved without sperm competition. Whether this is due to a genetic divergence between the lines or a differential capacity of males with different selection histories to respond plastically to current levels of sperm competition remains to be tested.

The contrasting reproductive roles of the sexes can influence the phenology of growth, plant size, and flowering time, with implications for the intensity of competitive interactions within and between the sexes. Here, we investigate the influence of contrasting nutrient regimes and intra-sexual and inter-sexual competition on the expression of sexual dimorphism in life-history traits and biomass allocation throughout the life cycle of the dioecious annual Rumex hastatulus Baldw. (Polygonaceae). Development of a sex-specific marker enabled us to quantify the influence of competition on sex-specific differences in mortality and vegetative traits. We were particularly interested in determining whether the overall performance of the sexes might differ between the two forms of intra-specific competition, potentially providing evidence for sexual specialization in resource acquisition and niche differentiation. Our results indicated that although patterns of sexual dimorphism were dynamic, they were largely insensitive to nutrient conditions. We found that intra-sexual competition was more severe than inter-sexual competition, differentially affecting mortality and most traits during the vegetative and particularly the reproductive stage of the life history. Female trait values generally increased more under inter-sexual than intra-sexual competition in comparison to males. Our findings are consistent with temporal niche differentiation resulting from sexual specialization for different resource requirements and provide evidence for the Jack Sprat effect.","[Yu, Qian; Li, De-Zhu; Zhou, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Plant Germplasm & Genom Ctr, Germplasm Bank Wild Species, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qian; Wang, Xin-Jia; Zhong, Li] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Barrett, Spencer C.

In the sciences of population biology, however, the laboratory is often seen as a poor approximation of what occurs in nature. Results obtained in the field are usually more convincing. This raises special problems: it is much more difficult to obtain stable, repeatable results in the field, where environmental conditions vary out of the experimenter's control, than in the laboratory. We examine here how this problem affected an influential experimental research tradition in community ecology, the study of the ecology of the rocky seashores. In the 1960s, a handful of North-American ecologists, most notably Joseph Connell, Robert Paine and Paul Dayton, made the rocky seashores a model study system for experimenting in the field. Their experiments were deceptively simple: they removed species living on the seashore and described the resulting effects on the local ecology. These experiments exerted a deep influence on community ecology. They provided evidence for speculative developments concerning the theory of interspecific competition, the factors responsible for species richness and the ecology of food webs. They also stimulated novel conceptual developments. In particular, Paine developed the predation hypothesis, which states that the presence of predators can favour species richness, before introducing the keystone species concept, according to which some species exert disproportionate effects on ecological systems. More broadly, these experiments gave support to a methodological trend in favour of field experimentation. Only controlled perturbations in the field, it seemed, provided a reliable method to get insights into the structure of ecological communities. However, as experiments were continued in time and repeated in different sites, divergent results appeared. We analyse here how intertidal researchers coped with the variability of environmental conditions and tried to stabilize their results. In the process, they reconsidered not only their early conclusions, but also the exclusive status given to field experiments. Expanding on this case study, we discuss some significant differences between laboratory and field experiments.","[Grodwohl, Jean-Baptiste; Porto, Franco; El-Hani, Charbel N.] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Hist Philosophy & Biol Teaching Lab LEFHBio, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Grodwohl, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cambridge, England; [Porto, Franco; El-Hani, Charbel N.] Univ Fed Bahia, Natl Inst Sci & Technol Interdisciplinary & Trans, Salvador, BA, Brazil","Grodwohl, JB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Hist Philosophy & Biol Teaching Lab LEFHBio, Salvador, BA, Brazil.; Grodwohl, JB (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cambridge, England.",jb.grodwohl@gmail.com,"El-Hani, Charbel/Q-1364-2019","grodwohl, jean-baptiste/0000-0003-1445-8277",,,,61,2,2,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0391-9714,1742-6316,,HIST PHIL LIFE SCI,Hist.

Understanding competitive interactions between invaders and functionally similar native species provides an important benchmark for predicting the consequences of invasion. However, even though having a broad dietary niche is widely considered a key factor determining invasion success, little is known about the effects of competition with functionally similar native competitors on the dietary niche breadths of invasive species. We used a combination of field experiments and field surveys to examine the impacts of competition with a functionally similar native crab species on the population densities, growth rates and diet of the globally widespread invasive red swamp crayfish in an African river ecosystem. The presence of native crabs triggered significant dietary niche constriction within the invasive crayfish population. Further, growth rates of both species were reduced significantly, and by a similar extent, in the presence of one another. In spite of this, crayfish maintained positive growth rates in the presence of crabs, whereas crabs lost mass in the presence of crayfish. Consequently, over the 3-year duration of the study, crab abundance declined at those sites invaded by the crayfish, becoming locally extinct at one. The invasive crayfish had a dramatic effect on ecosystem structure and functioning, halving benthic invertebrate densities and increasing decomposition rates fourfold compared to the crabs. This indicates that replacement of native crabs by invasive crayfish likely alters the structure and functioning of African river ecosystems significantly. This study provides a novel example of the constriction of the dietary niche of a successful invasive population in the presence of competition from a functionally similar native species. This finding highlights the importance of considering both environmental and ecological contexts in order to predict and manage the impacts of invasive species on ecosystems.","[Jackson, Michelle C.; Grey, Jonathan; Miller, Katie] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Jackson, Michelle C.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Ctr Invas Biol, Hatfield, South Africa; [Grey, Jonathan] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lib Ave, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Britton, J.

Specifically, we were interested to know if the resource partitioning and plant interactions act as complementary mechanisms of the shrub-grass coexistence. In 1983 different plots from grass-shrub Patagonian steppes were submitted to three treatments: control, grass-, and shrub-removal during three consecutive years. In 1997 we studied nine plots from the original experiment and recorded all shrubs to compare shrub density, population size structure, vitality, spatial patterns and neighbourhood interferences of three native and co-dominant shrub species: Mulinum spinosum, Senecio filaginoides, and Adesmia volckmanni. After 12 years of recovery, shrubs as a growth-form group, fully re-established in plots where they were removed and attained 75% higher density in grass-removal plots than in control plots. However, long-term population responses of Mulinum, Senecio, and Adesmia to removals were distinctive. On the other hand, negative and positive interferences among shrub species and between shrubs and grasses generated a complex network. Morphological and functional differences in shrub and grass species and their interactions at population level and long-term could be a key to achieve a better comprehension of shrub-grass coexistence from semi-arid ecosystems.

PSS can be intense in some cases and can drive the evolution of remarkable ejaculate properties. In males, investment in ejaculate plays an important role in the outcome of PSS. Thus, males are expected to adaptively tailor their ejaculate according to the perceived competition in their vicinity. Plastic responses in ejaculate investment to variation in intrasexual competition are disparate and widespread in males. We investigated the evolution of plasticity in reproductive traits using Drosophila melanogaster populations evolving for more than 150 generations under male- or female-biased sex ratios. When exposed to different numbers of competitors early in their life, males from these two regimes responded differently in terms of their copulation duration and sperm competitive ability. In addition, the effect of this early life experience wore off at different rates in males of male-biased and female-biased regimes with increasing time from the removal of competitive cues. Furthermore, our study finds that males change their reproductive strategies depending upon the identity of rival males. Together, our results provide evidence of the evolution of male reproductive investment that depends on socio-sexual cues experienced early in life.","[Maggu, Komal; Ahlawat, Neetika; Arun, Manas Geeta; Meena, Abhishek; Prasad, Nagaraj Guru] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Mohali, Dept Biol Sci, Mohali, India","Prasad, NG (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Mohali, Dept Biol Sci, Mohali, India.",prasad@iisermohali.ac.in,,"Geeta Arun, Manas/0000-0002-4433-4913","UGCUniversity Grants Commission, India; CSIR, Govt. of IndiaCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; IISER Mohali; DST, Govt of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India)","K.M. thanks UGC and M.G.A. thanks CSIR, Govt. of India for Junior and Senior Research Fellowships.

In a deception game we investigate experimentally which factors could improve advice quality. Besides advisor competition and identifiability, we add the possibility for clients to make a voluntary payment, a bonus, after observing advice quality. While the combination of competition and reputation concerns achieves the highest rate of truthful advice, we observe a similar effect, when the bonus is combined with one of them. Thus, our results suggest that a voluntary component can act as a substitute for either competition or reputation, decreasing moral hazard. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although this phenomenon is not unique to fynbos, this community regenerates after fire and therefore provides an opportunity to study the ecological genesis of hydrological niche segregation. Methods Following wildfires at two field sites where we had previously mapped the vegetation and monitored the hydrology, seeds were moved experimentally in >2500 intact soil cores up and down soil-moisture gradients to test the hypothesis that hydrological niche segregation is established during the seedling phase of the life cycle. Seedling numbers and growth were then monitored and they were identified using DNA bar-coding, the first use of this technology for an experiment of this kind. Key Results At the site where niche segregation among Restionaceae had previously been found, the size of seedlings was significantly greater, the wetter the location into which they were moved, regardless of the soil moisture status of their location of origin, or of the species. Seedling weight was also significantly greater in a competition treatment where the roots of other species were excluded. No such effects were detected at the control site where niche segregation among Restionaceae was previously found to be absent. Conclusions The finding that seedling growth on hydrological gradients in the field is affected by soil moisture status and by root competition shows that hydrological niche segregation could potentially originate in the seedling stage. The methodology, applied at a larger scale and followed-through for a longer period, could be used to determine whether species are differently affected by soil moisture.","[Silvertown, Jonathan; Araya, Yoseph N.; Gowing, David J.] Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Linder, H.

(2) How does the cover of species differ when they are seeded in a mixture and how is their response influenced by soil conditions? (3) Do individual species perform better or worse in a mixture than when sown separately? LocationHjerkinn, Dovrefjell, Norway. MethodsIn a factorial, randomized field experiment, we recorded the percentage cover of Festuca ovina, Luzula multiflora subsp. frigida and Poa alpina seeded in four different soil types for 3yr after seeding. We seeded the three species separately and in a mixture in organic topsoil, peat soil, mineral fine soil and mineral coarse soil. We also recorded seedling emergence in a greenhouse experiment, using the same seeding treatments. ResultsIn the field experiment, vegetation cover established fastest when F. ovina was sown in monoculture, followed by the seed mixture. After 3yr, mean cover of F. ovina was 1.4 times higher than mean P. alpina cover and more than three times higher than mean L. multiflora cover for single species treatments, and four (P. alpina) and 15 (L. multiflora) times higher when the species were seeded together. L. multiflora germinated slowly in the greenhouse experiment, which could partly explain its poor field performance. In the field experiment, establishment was faster in organic soils than mineral soils for all seeding treatments. The largest difference between F. ovina and L. multiflora performance in the mixture treatment was found in the organic soil types, where overall cover was larger than in the mineral soils. In the organic soils, F. ovina was slightly facilitated in the mixture treatment, while the opposite was found for L. multiflora. ConclusionWhen the restoration goal is to quickly establish a vegetation cover, seeding monocultures of rapidly establishing species may be more effective than seeding mixtures, even in alpine sites, where interspecific facilitation may prevail.","[Rydgren, Knut] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Sci, POB 133, NO-6851 Sogndal, Norway; [Hagen, Dagmar; Pedersen, Bard] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, POB 5685, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Rosef, Line] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Plant Sci, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Aradottir, Asa L.] Agr Univ Iceland, IS-112 Reykjavik, Iceland","Rydgren, K (corresponding author), Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Sci, POB 133, NO-6851 Sogndal, Norway.",knut.rydgren@hvl.no; Dagmar.Hagen@nina.no; line.rosef@nmbu.no; Bard.Pedersen@nina.no; asa@lbhi.is,,"/0000-0002-2417-7113; Rydgren, Knut/0000-0001-8910-2465; Rosef, Line/0000-0003-4444-6488",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [208024 ECONADA]; ECONADA,"We would like to thank the Research Council of Norway (project no. 208024 ECONADA) and all ECONADA partners for financial support, the Norwegian Defence Estate Agency for cooperation on establishing the field site, and contractors at Gjermundshaug for supplying soil for the field experiment.

Indeed, a number of studies, including a highly cited meta-analysis, have concluded that the trend for such interactions is competitive. Here we provide evidence that publication bias and study design have obscured our ability to assess the pollinator-mediated impacts of alien plants. In a meta-analysis of 76 studies, we demonstrate that alien/native status does not predict the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions among plants. Moreover, we found no evidence that similarity in floral traits or phylogenetic distance between species pairs influences the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions. Instead, we report that aspects of study design, such as distance between the control and nearest neighbour, and/or the arrangement of study plants better predict the impact of a neighbour than does alien/native status. Our study sheds new light on the role that publication bias and experimental design play in the evaluation of key patterns in ecology. We conclude that, due to the absence of clear, generalisable pollinator-mediated impacts of alien species, management schemes should base decisions on community-wide assessments of the impacts of individual alien plant species, and not solely on alien/native status itself.","[Charlebois, Julia A.; Sargent, Risa D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Charlebois, JA (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",julia.a.charlebois@gmail.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank J.

We therefore experimentally studied interference in the wild, capitalizing on 2 cockle beds in an isolated bay that were exploited by a population of individually marked oystercatchers. We successfully increased forager density by chasing birds from one cockle bed, leaving the other cockle bed as the only nearby alternative. The density increase was most pronounced on the eastern cockle bed where food stocks were poorer and initial feeding densities were lower compared with the western cockle bed. Oystercatchers residing on this eastern bed suffered a significant decline in intake rate when bird density was experimentally increased, providing evidence of interference. Refugee birds, that is, the birds that were displaced from their home bed, experienced an even stronger reduction in intake rate compared with the residents and compared with their intake rate on their home bed, probably partly due to the fact that the refugee birds were forced to feed on an unfamiliar cockle bed. The fact that disturbance at 1 site influenced both the refugees and the local resident birds indicates that human disturbance (an important conservation issue) has an effect that extends beyond the site where the disturbance takes place. The benefits and costs of site fidelity and interference competition are likely to play an important role in understanding animal distributions and how they change in response to environmental perturbations, including human disturbance of foraging sites.","[Oosterbeek, Kees; Ens, Bruno J.] SOVON Texel, SOVON Dutch Ctr Field Ornithol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Rutten, Anne L.; Oosterbeek, Kees; Verhulst, Simon; Dingemanse, Niels J.] Univ Groningen, Anim Ecol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Dingemanse, Niels J.] Univ Groningen, Dept Behav Biol, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Ens, Bruno J.] Wageningen IMARES, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands","Ens, BJ (corresponding author), SOVON Texel, SOVON Dutch Ctr Field Ornithol, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.",bruno.ens@sovon.nl,"Dingemanse, Niels/ABE-6880-2020; Verhulst, Simon/S-3404-2019; Verhulst, Simon/B-1613-2009","Verhulst, Simon/0000-0002-1143-6868; Verhulst, Simon/0000-0002-1143-6868; Dingemanse, Niels/0000-0003-3320-0861",Technology Foundation STWTechnologiestichting STW [GBI 4804]; applied science division of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Ministry of Economic Affairs; NWONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),"The Technology Foundation STW (GBI 4804), itself funded by the applied science division of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) and the technology programme of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; S.

However, disturbance-driven changes may be mediated by environmental conditions that affect habitat quality and species interactions. In a decade-long field experiment, we tested how kelp forest net primary productivity (NPP) responds to repeated canopy loss along a gradient in grazing and substrate suitability. We discovered that habitat quality can mediate the effects of intensified disturbance on canopy and understory NPP. Experimental annual and quarterly disturbances suppressed total macroalgal NPP, but effects were strongest in high-quality habitats that supported dense kelp canopies that were removed by disturbance. Understory macroalgae partly compensated for canopy NPP losses and this effect magnified with increasing habitat quality. Disturbance-driven increases in understory NPP were still rising after 5-10 years of disturbance, demonstrating the value of long-term experimentation for understanding ecosystem responses to changing disturbance regimes.","[Castorani, Max C.

Increases in stress hormones in vertebrates may be associated with these processes and contribute to the decline in survival or reproduction of the native species. Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) have gone extinct across much of the British Isles and parts of Northern Italy following the introduction of North American invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). We extracted glucocorticoid metabolites from faecal samples to measure whether the presence of the invasive species causes an increase in physiological stress in individuals of the native species. We show that native red squirrels in seven sites where they co-occurred with invasive grey squirrels had glucocorticoid concentrations that were three times higher than those in five sites without the invasive species. Moreover, in a longitudinal study, stress hormones in native red squirrels increased after colonisation by grey squirrels. When we experimentally reduced the abundance of the invasive grey squirrels, the concentration of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in co-occurring red squirrels decreased significantly between pre- and postremoval periods. Hence, we found that the invasive species acts as a stressor which significantly increases the concentrations of glucocorticoids in the native species. Given that sustained elevations in glucocorticoids could reduce body growth and reproductive rate, our results are consistent with previous studies where the co-occurrence of the invasive grey squirrel was associated with smaller size and lower reproductive output in red squirrels.","[Santicchia, Francesca; Martinoli, Adriano; Wauters, Lucas Armand] Univ Insubria, Guido Tosi Res Grp, Environ Anal & Management Unit, Varese, Italy; [Dantzer, Ben; van Kesteren, Freya] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Dantzer, Ben] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Unit Physiol Pathophysiol & Expt Endocrinol, Dept Biomed Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Dept Vet Sci & Publ Hlth, Milan, Italy; [Wauters, Lucas Armand] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Antwerp, Belgium","Santicchia, F (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Via JH Dunant 3, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",f.santicchia@uninsubria.it,"Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008; Ferrari, Nicola/E-6331-2013; Dantzer, Ben/E-9779-2011; Santicchia, Francesca/L-2591-2019; Martinoli, Adriano/L-4924-2016","Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Ferrari, Nicola/0000-0001-8959-3495; Dantzer, Ben/0000-0002-3058-265X; Santicchia, Francesca/0000-0003-4814-9632; van Kesteren, Freya/0000-0002-3034-9022; Martinoli, Adriano/0000-0003-0298-0869; Wauters, Lucas/0000-0002-4871-5035; Wauters, Lucas Armand/0000-0002-7012-9200",ESI (European Squirrel Initiative),ESI (European Squirrel Initiative),,69,20,20,2,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Pest management strategies should be informed by research on a broad suite of biotic and abiotic interactions. We used a life table response experiment (LTRE) to assess the reliability of ragwort Jacobaea vulgaris management recommendations based on interactions of (i) time of disturbance to initiate experimental units, (ii) herbivory from two biological control organisms, the cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae and ragwort flea beetle Longitarsus jacobaeae and (iii) interspecific competition by perennial grasses. 2. Our LTRE combines a factorial experiment with a linear, deterministic matrix model for ragwort populations representing transitions among three stages: 1st year juveniles, 2nd year juveniles and adults. Elasticity analysis identified potentially vulnerable ragwort transitions, and a contributions analysis confirmed which treatments influenced these transitions. Ultimate treatment effects were quantified as the reduction in population growth rates and time to local extinction. 3. Elasticity analyses found the ragwort's biennial pathway, juvenile to adult transition and fertility transition were most influential and most amenable to manipulation across all community configurations. The flea beetle and perennial grass competition had negative effects on survival and fertility, whereas the cinnabar moth only reduced fertility and induced the perennial pathway. 4. All combinations of insects or increased plant competition reduced the growth rate of ragwort. Full interspecific competition and the flea beetle resulted in a significantly greater and faster decline in the ragwort populations than the cinnabar moth. Moreover, this pattern was consistent between two times of initial disturbance. 5. Synthesis and applications. Maximizing plant competition provides the fastest way to control ragwort. If this option is unavailable, for example, grazed or disturbed land, the ragwort flea beetle provides excellent management to lower ragwort densities without the potential nontarget effects of the cinnabar moth. Factorial experiments and matrix models help to evaluate interacting factors that influence invasive species' vulnerabilities, inform how to intervene in a weed life cycle to reduce weed abundance and confirm recommendations that are robust to community variation.","[Dauer, Joseph T.; McEvoy, Peter B.; Van Sickle, John] Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Dauer, JT (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Plant Biol Labs, 612 Wilson Rd,Room 166, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jdauer@msu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BSR-8516997, BSR-9020483]; United State Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [89-383004515, 90-383005310]; Agricultural Research Foundation","We gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation through grants BSR-8516997 and BSR-9020483, the United State Department of Agriculture through grants 89-383004515 and 90-383005310, and the Agricultural Research Foundation to P.

However, few studies have rigorously tested predictions of IFD models in situations involving multiple species and trophic levels. We fully parameterized and tested predictions of a general interference IFD model for both predators and prey in a tritrophic system: seven-spotted lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Hemiptera: Aphididae), and tic bean plants (Vicia faba L., Fabaceae). We used habitat selection treatments having both predators and prey in the presence and absence of one another. We also performed experiments to quantify the strength of interspecific competition, the functional response of predators and several measures of fitness for the prey. Our results show that whether prey were present or not, predators followed IFD predictions and aggregated most strongly in the patch with the highest-quality resource. Prey in the presence of predators followed the predicted IFD, which was similar to a uniform distribution. However, prey in the absence of predators moved infrequently and were far from ideal free, suggesting that predators instigated habitat selection behaviour. Our results underscore the importance of considering trophic interactions and multiple measures of patch quality in studies of habitat selection. The observed departures from theoretical predictions also usefully suggest promising extensions for future theory and experiments. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

This gap in knowledge exists in part because of the rarity of ecologically meaningful studies capable of disentangling different elements of disturbance. Hence, we carried out a long-term (9 yr), large-scale (2,000 m(2) plots), spatially replicated (4 sites) field experiment in which we manipulated disturbance to a globally distributed marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, and tracked community responses over time. To distinguish the effects of disturbance frequency and severity on the biodiversity and composition of temperate rocky reef communities, we simulated the repeated loss of giant kelp from destructive winter waves across a background of natural variation in disturbance. By following the response of over 200 taxa from the surrounding community, we discovered that the frequency of disturbance to giant kelp changed the biomass, diversity, and composition of community guilds in a manner commensurate with their dependence on the physical (i.e., benthic light and space), trophic (i.e., living and detrital biomass), and habitat (i.e., biogenic structure) resources mediated by this foundation species. Annual winter disturbance to giant kelp reduced living and detrital giant kelp biomass by 57% and 40%, respectively, enhanced bottom light by 22%, and halved the seafloor area covered by giant kelp holdfasts. Concomitantly, the biomass of understory algae and epilithic sessile invertebrates more than doubled, while the biomass of rock-boring clams, mobile invertebrates, and fishes decreased 30-61%. Frequent loss of giant kelp boosted understory algal richness by 82% and lowered sessile invertebrate richness by 13% but did not affect the biodiversity of mobile fauna. In contrast to changes driven by disturbance frequency, interannual variation in the severity of disturbance to giant kelp had weaker, less consistent effects, causing only modest changes in assemblages of sessile invertebrates, mobile invertebrate herbivores, and fishes. Our results broaden the foundation species concept by demonstrating that repeated disturbance to a dominant habitat-forming species can outweigh the influence of less frequent but severe disturbances for the surrounding community.","[Castorani, Max C.

Because the risk of experiencing sibling competition increases with increasing seed family size, a negative relationship between maternal fecundity and offspring germination fraction is predicted. Since competition is the main reason for this relationship, this effect should be stronger in more competitive environments. Unfortunately, there is very limited and contradictory empirical support for the sibling competition hypothesis, and habitats differing in competition intensity have never been compared. Using field collected seeds, we examined the effect of seed family size on germination fractions in three common dryland winter annuals along a steep climatic gradient where competition intensity increases with increasing productivity. Our findings clearly contradict the sibling competition hypothesis. There was no relationship between maternal fecundity and germination fractions in any of the ten combinations of species and environments but high variation between coexisting families. In combination with related studies, our findings suggest that other factors, such as variation in the abiotic environment or generalised competition may be more important constraints for the evolution of optimal germination than competition among siblings.

This can either be done by doubling nutrient concentration (C) or by doubling soil volume (V) in the neighbour treatment as compared to the solitary treatment. 2. Statistically analysing the same dataset from an experiment that grew plants in solitary or neighbour treatment with a series of V given a fixed amount of nutrients per plant (e.g. 1 g), Chen et al. (2015a) found significant neighbour effects when they controlled for V, while McNickle (2020) found the effects to be insignificant when he controlled for C. 3. The discrepancy in the results of the two studies is caused by a difference in their analytical approaches. This includes (a) different choices of data transformation for the controlling factor, and (b) a mathematical deviation of model structures between V-based and C-based analyses, due to the different inversely proportional V-C relationships between solitary (C= 1 V ) and neighbour (C= 2 V) treatments. 4. Choices for either V or C as a controlling factor in the analyses for `neighbour effect' are based on two different perspectives, focussing either on neighbourinduced nutrient depletion (like McNickle, 2020) or on identity recognition (like Chen et al., 2015a). 5. We also raise concerns about the use of mesh-divided root interaction design and replacement series design in the studies of plant-plant root interactions.

Here, we tested how evolution under enforced monogamy affected a suite of reproductive traits (including testis area, sex allocation, genital morphology, sperm morphology and mating behaviour) in the outcrossing hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano, using an assay that also allowed the assessment of phenotypically plastic responses to group size. The experiment comprised 32 independent selection lines that evolved under either monogamy or polygamy for 20 generations. While we did not observe an evolutionary shift in sex allocation, we detected effects of the selection regime for two male morphological traits. Specifically, worms evolving under enforced monogamy had a distinct shape of the male copulatory organ and produced sperm with shorter appendages. Many traits that did not evolve under enforced monogamy showed phenotypic plasticity in response to group size. Notably, individuals that grew up in larger groups had a more male-biased sex allocation and produced slightly longer sperm than individuals raised in pairs. We conclude that, in this flatworm, enforced monogamy induced moderate evolutionary but substantial phenotypically plastic responses.","[Janicke, T.; Sandner, P.; Vizoso, D.

We examined the mechanisms mediating the distribution patterns of tidal marsh plants along an estuarine gradient in Georgia (USA) using a combination of field transplant experiments and monitoring. Our results could not be fully explained by the competition-to-stress hypothesis (the current paradigm explaining plant distributions across estuarine landscapes). This hypothesis states that the upstream limits of plant distributions are determined by competition, and the downstream limits by abiotic stress. We found that competition was generally strong in freshwater and brackish marshes, and that conditions in brackish and salt marshes were stressful to freshwater marsh plants, results consistent with the competition-to-stress hypothesis. Four other aspects of our results, however, were not explained by the competition-to-stress hypothesis. First, several halophytes found the freshwater habitat stressful and performed best (in the absence of competition) in brackish or salt marshes. Second, the upstream distribution of one species was determined by the combination of both abiotic and biotic (competition) factors. Third, marsh productivity (estimated by standing biomass) was a better predictor of relative biotic interaction intensity (RII) than was salinity or flooding, suggesting that productivity is a better indicator of plant stress than salinity or flooding gradients. Fourth, facilitation played a role in mediating the distribution patterns of some plants. Our results illustrate that even apparently simple abiotic gradients can encompass surprisingly complex processes mediating plant distributions.","[Guo, Hongyu; Pennings, Steven C.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Pennings, SC (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",spennings@uh.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE06-20959],"We thank Jane Buck, Christine Ewers, Alana Lynes, Brittany D.

Although they address the same issue, they measure different aspects of plant interactions: experiments indicate contemporary processes, whilst observations of spatial patterns integrate the results of interactions that have prevailed in the past. Aim: The aim of this study was to propose a new conceptual approach that takes into account the chronological order between processes and the arising patterns i.e., the time lag between neighbour effects quantified with NRE and SPA, to detect shifts in the balance of plant interactions due to current environmental change. Methods: This conceptual approach was applied to alpine snowbeds. Data from NRE were used to calculate the importance index of current neighbour interactions. Spatial patterns were quantified using variance ratio statistics and were assumed to reflect historic interactions. Results: The results of the two approaches showed a consistent difference in the prevailing type of plant interactions and suggested a shift towards competition in recent times. Conclusions: The simultaneous application of NRE and SPA allows the detection of a recent shift in the balance of plant interactions and provides a deeper and more accurate insight into the temporal dynamics of plant communities that could not be gained using one method alone.","[Schoeb, Christian] CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Canada San Urbano Almeri, Spain; [Schoeb, Christian; Kammer, Peter M.] Univ Teacher Educ, Dept Biol, Bern, Switzerland; [Kikvidze, Zaal] Ilia State Univ, Inst Ecol, Tbilisi, Georgia","Schob, C (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Canada San Urbano Almeri, Spain.",christian.schoeb@gmx.ch,"Schob, Christian/B-6083-2008","Schob, Christian/0000-0003-4472-2286",Centro de Ciencias de Benasque (Spain); Andew W.

(2019) have recently published the results of a well-designed experiment examining the effect of functional traits on the outcome of competition. Their main conclusions were that (a) trait hierarchies better predict the strength of competition than trait differences, and (b) the consideration of intraspecific trait variation improves our ability to predict the strength of competition. They applied multi-model inference by averaging regression coefficients. This approach is strongly criticized because it averages regression coefficients for which the meaning is conditional on the other predictors included in the model. In this paper, their data were re-analysed using alternative methods. The results only partly support the original conclusions in that trait hierarchy proved to be obviously important in height, but not in the other three traits. Synthesis. Intraspecific trait variation contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between traits and competitive interactions. On the other hand, traits measured in focal individuals may be both drivers and consequences of competition, which makes the interpretation of the relationship more difficult.","[Botta-Dukat, Zoltan] Inst Ecol & Bot, Ctr Ecol Res, Vacratot, Hungary","Botta-Dukat, Z (corresponding author), Inst Ecol & Bot, Ctr Ecol Res, Vacratot, Hungary.",botta-dukat.zoltan@ecolres.hu,,,"Nemzeti Kutatasi Fejlesztesi es Innovacios HivatalNational Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary [K 124671]","Nemzeti Kutatasi Fejlesztesi es Innovacios Hivatal, Grant/Award Number: K 124671",,33,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, competitive effects of aliens and competitive response of natives may also change over time. Indeed, as with time, the novelty of an invader decreases, the accumulated eco-evolutionary experience of resident species may eventually limit invasion success. We aimed to gain insights on whether directional changes in biotic interactions over time or more general differences between natives and aliens, for instance, resulting from an introduction bias, are relevant in determining competitive ability. We conducted a pairwise competition experiment in a target-neighbour design, using 47 Asteraceae species with residence times between 8 years-12,000 years in Germany. We first tested whether there are differences in performance in intraspecific competition amongst invasion status groups, that is casual and established neophytes, archaeophytes or native species. We then evaluated whether competitive response and effects depend on residence time or invasion status. Lastly, we assessed whether competitive effects influence range sizes. We found only limited evidence that native target species tolerate neighbours with longer potential co-existence times better, whereas differences in competitive ability were mostly better explained by invasion status than residence time. Although casual neophytes produced most biomass in intraspecific competition, they had the weakest per-capita competitive effects on natives. Notably, we did not find differences between established neophytes and natives, both of which ranked highest in interspecific competitive ability. This lack of differences might be explained by a biased selection of highly invasive or rare native species in previous studies or because invasion success may result from mechanisms other than interspecific competitive superiority. Accordingly, interspecific per-capita competitive effects did not influence range sizes. Further studies across a broader range of environmental conditions, involving other biotic interactions that indirectly influence plant-plant interactions, may clarify when eco-evolutionary adaptations to new invaders are a relevant mechanism.","[Sheppard, Christine S.; Brendel, Marco R.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany","Sheppard, CS (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",christine.sheppard@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Sheppard, Christine S./0000-0002-7847-2310",German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SH 924/1-1],"This research was financially supported by the German Research Foundation (grant SH 924/1-1).

However, standard choices for these designs strive to provide uniform density of points throughout the region of interest. There are numerous situations where flexibility to adapt the density of points to match specific design objectives would be advantageous to maximize the efficiency of the design. In this paper, we propose non-uniform space-filling (NUSF) designs to achieve a user-specified desired density distribution of design points across the input space and demonstrate how to implement NUSF designs in different ways to provide the experimenters with flexibility to match their goals. The approach is flexible for a variety of scenarios where the experimenter wishes to control the density of points throughout the region while still preserving the space-filling characteristic. Details are provided about how to translate a problem into an appropriate weight structure to generate several designs which can then be compared using graphical methods, including the Closest Distance by Weight plot, to determine if the desired characteristics have been achieved.

Genuine conclusions on male sperm competitiveness can only be made in real competitive situations. However, statistical analyses of sperm competitiveness from fertilization success data have been shown to be problematic. Here, I first outline a comprehensive general description of the different additive and nonadditive elements relevant for the outcome of sperm competition staged between two males. Based on this description, I will highlight two main problems that are frequently encountered in experiments aiming at estimating sperm competitiveness. First, I focus on potential problems when using standardized competitors versus random mating trials, because trials with standardized competitors do not allow generalization if malemale interactions are important. Second, I illustrate the necessity to analyze data on the logit scale rather than on raw proportions, because only the logit scale allows a clean separation of additive and nonadditive effects (i.e., male x male and female x male interactions).","[Engqvist, Leif] Univ Bielefeld, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Engqvist, Leif] Univ Groningen, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Groningen, Netherlands","Engqvist, L (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",leif.engqvist@uni-bielefeld.de,"Engqvist, Leif/C-3595-2009","Engqvist, Leif/0000-0002-9434-7130",,,,48,13,13,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,MAY,2013,67,5,,,,,1396,1405,,10.1111/evo.12024,,,10,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,134SN,WOS:000318234900012,23617916,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2021-09-30,

We used an experimental approach to examine changes in diet diversity, selection of diets, dietary importance, niche breadth and overlap among sympatric species of large herbivores with changes in population density of one species. We hypothesized that diets of both species would change with changing population density and dietary niche would be expanded to include forages of lower quality in the areas with increased competition for resources. We used microhistological analysis corrected for differential digestibility of forages to estimate diets of mule deer and elk from faeces in two study areas with high and low population densities of elk. For both mule deer and elk, dietary niche was expanded in the high-density area compared with the low-density area, and included forages of lower quality and palatability. Our results indicate that negative feedbacks associated with density-dependent processes interact with competitive interactions among sympatric species of large herbivores.","[Stewart, Kelley M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [Bowyer, R.

Trin. ex Stencil. (common reed), already one of the world's most widespread plant species, has realized rapid range expansion in coastal wetlands of North America in the past century, but little is known about P australis range expansion in inland wetland systems. We used genetic analyses, aerial photographs, field surveys, and a greenhouse experiment to study the extent and mechanism of nonnative P australis invasion of Utah wetlands. We collected and genetically analyzed 39 herbarium samples across the state and 225 present-day samples from northern Utah's major wetland complexes. All samples collected before 1993 and all samples collected outside the major wetlands of northern Utah, including some as recent as 2001, were identified as native (haplotypes A, B, D, and H). Only 10 (4%) of the present-day samples were native, each from small, discrete, low-density stands; the remaining samples were nonnative (haplotype M). Our earliest nonnative sample was collected near the Great Salt Lake in 1993. Around the Great Salt Lake, which contains 40% of Utah's wetlands, P. australis cover has increased from 20% to 56% over the past 27 years-an increase that appears attributable to the nonnative strain. In a 3-month-long greenhouse experiment, the nonnative haplotype grew taller, had more aboveground biomass, and had a greater above- to below-ground biomass ratio than the native haplotypes regardless of nitrogen, phosphorus, or water availability. Nonnative P australis is rapidly invading the wetlands of northern Utah. Areas in Utah where the native P australis remains should be identified and protected.","[Kulmatiski, Andrew] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Beard, Karen H.; Gibson, Jacob R.; Mock, Karen E.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Beard, Karen H.; Gibson, Jacob R.; Mock, Karen E.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Meyerson, Laura A.] Univ Rhode Isl, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Kulmatiski, A (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",afak@uaa.alaska.edu,"Meyerson, Laura/D-4487-2013; Meyerson, Laura A./S-2979-2019; Meyerson, Laura/K-9013-2012; kulmatiski, andrew/J-2072-2015; Mock, Karen E/C-1418-2011; Beard, Karen/B-7177-2011; Meyerson, Laura A./AAN-6688-2020","kulmatiski, andrew/0000-0001-9977-5508; Mock, Karen E/0000-0002-8357-4434; Beard, Karen/0000-0003-4997-2495; Meyerson, Laura A./0000-0002-1283-3865","Utah Division of Forestry, Fire State Lands; Alaska EPSCoR NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [EPS-0701898]; state of Alaska; USDA Agricultural Experiment Station [0208537]","This research was funded by the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire & State Lands.

Long-term grassland biodiversity experiments have shown that diversity effects on productivity tend to strengthen through time, as complementarity among coexisting species increases. But it remains less clear whether this pattern also holds for other ecosystems such as forests, and if so why. 2. Here we explore whether diversity effects on tree growth change predictably during stand development in Finland's boreal forests. Using tree ring records from mature forests, we tested whether diameter growth trajectories of dominant tree species growing in mixture differed from those in monoculture. We then compared these results with data from the world's longest running tree diversity experiment, where the same combinations of species sampled in mature forests were planted in 1999. 3. We found that diversity effects on tree growth strengthened progressively through time, only becoming significantly positive around 20 years after seedling establishment. This shift coincided with the period in which canopy closure occurs in these forests, at which time trees begin to interact and compete above-ground. These temporal trends were remarkably consistent across different tree species sampled in mature forests, and broadly matched growth responses observed in the much younger experimental plots. 4. Synthesis. Our results mirror those from grassland ecosystems and suggest that canopy closure is a key phase for promoting niche complementarity in diverse tree communities. They also provide a series of testable hypotheses for the growing number of tree diversity experiments that have been established in recent years.","[Jucker, Tommaso] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Koricheva, Julia] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Biol Sci, Egham, Surrey, England; [Finer, Leena] Finiand Nat Resources Inst, Joensuu, Finland; [Bouriaud, Olivier] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Fac Forestry, Suceava, Romania; [Bouriaud, Olivier] IGN, Lab Inventaire Forestier, Nancy, France; [Iacopetti, Giovanni] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry, Florence, Italy; [Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Conservat Res Inst, Cambridge, England","Jucker, T (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",t.jucker@bristol.ac.uk,"Jucker, Tommaso/S-4724-2017","Jucker, Tommaso/0000-0002-0751-6312; Coomes, David/0000-0002-8261-2582",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/S01537X/1]; European UnionEuropean Commission [265171],"Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/S01537X/1; European Union Seventh Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 265171 and FP7/2007-2013",,59,2,2,3,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Firstly, the competition model of cross-border e-commerce payment platform is constructed using fuzzy fractional order ordinary differential equation. Based on the theory of Hopf bifurcation, the stability of the model is analyzed. Then, the cross-border e-commerce improved payment mode is built based on the secure electronic transaction protocol. Finally, the efficiency and security performance of the improved payment mode are compared with that of the traditional payment mode with face through simulation experiments. The results show that the improved mode takes less time in encryption and decryption than the traditional mode; the time spent on the security payment of the improved mode remains around 1.2 s, while that of the traditional mode is around 2.7 s; the improved mode security payment takes significantly less time than the traditional mode, which indicates that the payment mode proposed in this research based on fuzzy fractional order ordinary differential equation is not only more secure than the traditional payment mode, but also can effectively improve the payment speed of users and greatly enhance their shopping experience.

This paper presents the test concept, the four test specimens, the test results and the predictions received, and also evaluates the results of the competition. Simplified hand calculation analyses of the experiments are also included. The tests showed that there is significant shear strength in reinforced concrete slabs under axial tension, and that the system capacity of such slab strips is not limited by a local shear failure. The prediction competition revealed that the modelling of a cracked reinforced concrete slab strip is still a significant challenge, even for experienced researchers using the latest analysis tools.","[Galmarini, Andreas] Walt Galmarini AG, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Locher, Daniel] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Struct Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Marti, Peter] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Struct Engn, Zurich, Switzerland","Galmarini, A (corresponding author), Walt Galmarini AG, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",andreas.galmarini@waltgalmarini.ch,,,ETH ZurichETH Zurich,Financial support from ETH Zurich is gratefully acknowledged.,,13,3,3,0,1,ERNST & SOHN,BERLIN,"ROTHERSTRASSE 21, BERLIN, DEUTSCHLAND 10245, GERMANY",1464-4177,1751-7648,,STRUCT CONCRETE,Struct.

Using a field experiment focusing on a system of Mediterranean grasslands, we show that interspecific competition may influence the two components in the same direction or in opposite directions, depending on whether competitive exclusions are deterministic or stochastic. Deterministic exclusions reduce both patch-scale richness and beta-diversity, thereby homogenising the community. Stochastic extinctions reduce richness at the patch scale, but increase the differences in species composition among patches. These results indicate that studies of competitive effects on beta diversity may help to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic components of competitive exclusion. Such distinction is crucial for understanding the causal relationship between competition and species diversity, one of the oldest and most fundamental questions in ecology.","[Segre, Hila; Ron, Ronen; De Malach, Niv; Kadmon, Ronen] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Henkin, Zalmen] Agr Res Org, Beef Cattle Sect, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, IL-30095 Ramat Yishay, Israel; [Mandel, Micha] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel","Kadmon, R (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",kadmon@mail.huji.ac.il,"DeMalach, Niv/AAW-8339-2020; Segre, Hila/AAJ-3995-2021","DeMalach, Niv/0000-0002-4509-5387; Segre, Hila/0000-0002-3354-4675","Nature and Parks Authority; Ministry of Science and Technology TASHTIOT program; Israeli Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [454/11, 1026/11]","We thank S.

Biotic resistance represents an important natural barrier to potential invaders throughout the world, yet the underlying mechanisms that drive such resistance are still debated. In theory, native communities should repel both functionally similar invaders which compete for the same resources, and invaders which possess less competitive traits. However, environmental stress, trade-offs across vital rates and competition-induced plastic trait shifts may modify expected competitive outcomes, thereby influencing invasion dynamics. 2. In order to test these theoretical links between trait distributions and biotic resistance, we performed a mesocosm experiment with 25 non-native ornamental species invading native plant communities. Each non-native species was grown with and without the native community under two watering treatments (regular and reduced). We measured biotic resistance as the difference in performance of non-native individuals grown with and without the community in terms of their survival, growth and reproduction. We quantified overall functional dissimilarity between non-native ornamental individuals and native communities based on the combination of plant height, specific leaf area and seed mass. Then, assuming each of these traits is also potentially linked to competitive ability, we measured the position of non-natives on trait hierarchies. While height is positively correlated with competitive ability for light interception, conservative leaf and seed characteristics provide greater tolerance to competition for other resources. Finally, we quantified plastic trait shifts of non-native individuals induced by competition. 3. Indeed, the native community repelled functionally similar individuals by lowering the invader's survival rate. Simultaneously, shorter ornamental individuals with larger specific leaf areas were less tolerant to biotic resistance from the community across vital rates, although the effect of trait hierarchies often depended on watering conditions. Finally, non-natives responded to competition by shifting their traits. Most importantly, individuals with more competitive traits were able to overcome biotic resistance also through competition-induced plastic trait shifts. 4. Synthesis. Our results highlight that both functional dissimilarity and trait hierarchies mediate biotic resistance to ornamental plant invaders. Nevertheless, environmental stress as well as opposing trends across vital rates are also influential. Furthermore, plastic trait shifts can reinforce potential invaders' competitive superiority, determining a positive feedback.","[Conti, Luisa; Acosta, Alicia T.

So far, the principal force shaping local plant abundance patterns remains unclear. Rarity can result not only from poor competitive ability or from small vegetative or generative reproduction, but also from strong self-limitation. The same mechanisms can drive species-specific overyielding, that is, increased species productivity at high community diversity. Rare species can then benefit more (i.e., overyield to a larger extent) from growing in species-rich communities because of altered competitive hierarchies or smaller conspecific frequencies. Here, we test which mechanism is the most important determinant of species rarity and of species-specific productivity across a diversity gradient ranging from 1- to 60-species plots. 2. For that, we measured vegetative growth, competitive ability (competitive effect), and negative frequency dependence for 49 perennial grassland species from Central Europe. We then linked these characteristics with species abundance (measured as species biomass from 60-species plots) and with species-specific overyielding in The Jena Experiment. 3. Species with higher rates of vegetative growth (when grown without neighbours) were also more abundant in the Jena Experiment. Larger species-specific overyielding was then associated with a stronger negative frequency dependence. As species with greater vegetative growth were also more self-limited, larger overyielding in species-rich communities was characteristic for common rather than for rare species, refuting our initial hypothesis. Finally, path analysis indicated that species with poor capacity to suppress neighbours also profited more from growing in diverse communities. 4. Synthesis. Our results identify key mechanisms driving abundance and productivity of species in synthetic communities differing in species richness. While vegetative reproduction was closely associated with abundance, intraspecific interactions (strength of negative frequency dependence) shaped species productivity across a richness gradient. Our study sheds light on the abundance patterns of species and their influence on community functions, such as biomass production, of species-rich and -poor vegetation.","[Dostal, Petr; Tasevova, Karolina; Klinerova, Tereza] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic","Dostal, P (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.",petr.dostal@ibot.cas.cz,,"Dostal, Petr/0000-0002-2342-6632",Grantova Agentura Ceske republikyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-09119S]; Akademie ved Ceske republiky [RVO 67985939],"Grantova Agentura Ceske republiky, Grant/Award Number: 15-09119S; Akademie ved Ceske republiky, Grant/Award Number: RVO 67985939",,72,4,4,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, the role of climate is now known to be mainly an indirect one mostly mediating dispersal and establishment, species interactions, or habitat characteristics, which all are often modified by human land use. In these complex systems, negative biotic interactions are predicted to increase in relative importance toward benign climatic conditions. We tested this hypothesis experimentally by exposing plant species with different geographic distribution ranges to different climates, biotic interactions, and land use. Thereby, species predominantly distributed in regions with benign climatic conditions were expected to be better able to cope with negative biotic interactions than species from regions with environmentally stressful climatic conditions. We present results of a fully crossed two-year transplantation field experiment replicated in 45 plots in three study regions along a precipitation gradient across Germany. We manipulated biotic interactions (presence/absence of competition and mollusk herbivory) in grasslands of different management regimes (meadows, mown pastures, pastures). The transplanted phytometers consisted of six congeneric species pairs, each representing one oceanic and one distinctly more continental range type. The oceanic range type is predominantly distributed in benign climatic conditions in Western Europe, while the more continental type is distributed in regions with more stressful climatic conditions in Eastern Europe. This experimental setting allowed us to study the impact of negative biotic interactions along an abiotic stress gradient under realistic land-use conditions. Under competition and mollusk herbivory, growth performance was more strongly reduced in continental compared to oceanic species. Range types also differed in their responses to grassland management. Differences in survival between the congeneric species were found to be region-specific and largely unaffected by biotic interactions and land use. In consequence, our results suggest that local responses to biotic interactions and land-use practices of otherwise very similar plant species can differ strongly depending on species' large-scale geographical distribution. Regionally differing responses to biotic interactions also show that local conditions can drastically change responses expected from macroecological theory.","[Welk, Astrid; Welk, Erik; Baudis, Mathias; Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Welk, Erik; Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Boeckelmann, Joerg] Univ Vienna, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Div Trop Ecol & Anim Biodivers, Rennweg 14, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Bruelheide, H (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.; Bruelheide, H (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",helge.bruelheide@botanik.uni-halle.de,"Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013","Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Welk, Erik/0000-0002-2685-3795",DFG Priority Program 1374 Infrastructure-Biodiversity-Exploratories [BR 1698/14-1],"We thank the managers of the three Exploratories, Swen Renner, Sonja Gockel, and Andreas Hemp, as well as Martin Gorke and all former managers for their work in maintaining the plot and project infrastructure; Christiane Fischer and Simone Pfeiffer for giving support through the central office, Jens Nieschulze and Michael Owonibi for managing the central data base, and Markus Fischer, Eduard Linsenmair, Dominik Hessenmoller, Daniel Prati, Ingo Schoning, Francois Buscot, Ernst-Detlef Schulze, Wolfgang W.

However, the mechanisms underlying environmental changes, such as a decrease in the relative abundance of native species, are poorly understood. Since the introduction of the ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), in Chile in the 1970s for biological control of aphids, a reduction in the relative abundance of the native ladybird beetle Eriopis connexa (Germar) has been noticed. To explore the role of cannibalism, intraguild predation (IGP) or competition as possible mechanisms that might increase dominance of H. variegata over E. connexa, several laboratory experiments were carried out. The native and the exotic species were very similar in their voracity and biotic interactions. Although H. variegata was able to maintain constant reproductive performance, E. connexa reproduction decreased at lower densities of aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The impacts of cannibalism, IGP, and competition exerted by these species were very symmetrical in both larvae and adults. We conclude that these biotic factors may not fully explain the increase in relative abundance of H. variegata. The higher sensitivity of E. connexa to prey patch size, along with other factors such as chemical-mediated negative interspecific interactions may be operating in alfalfa fields, changing the composition of associated coccinellid assemblages.","[Grez, A.

We established a transplant experiment to disentangle the contribution of these processes to the local extinction risk of four alpine plants in the Swiss Alps. Projected population growth (lambda) derived from integral projection models was reduced by 0.07/degrees C of warming on average, whereas novel species additionally decreased lambda by 0.15 across warming levels. Effects of novel species on predicted extinction time were greatest at warming < 2 degrees C for two species. Projected population declines under both warming and with novel species were primarily driven by increased mortality. Our results suggest that extinction debt can be explained by a combination of demographic inertia and lags in novel species establishment, with the latter being particularly important for some species under low levels of warming.","[Nomoto, Hanna A.; Alexander, Jake M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Nomoto, HA (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hanna.no-moto@env.ethz.ch,,,European UnionEuropean Commission [678841],"We thank members of the Plant Ecology Group for assistance with field work, in particular Loic Liberati, Tim Murray, Yan Hess, Jessica Joaquim, Megan Stamp, Daniel Slodowicz, and Chelsea Chisholm, Jeff Diez, Sebastian Block Mungia and three anonymous reviewers for their comments on the manuscript.

A recent simulation study showed that under increased fire regimes positive tree-tree interactions were recorded (Bacelar et al., 2014). Data from experimental burning plots in an African savanna, the Kruger National Park, were collected across unburnt and annual burn plots. Indices of aggregation and spatial autocorrelation of the distribution of trees between different fire regimes were explored. Results show that the distribution of trees under fire were more clumped and exhibited higher spatial autocorrelation than in unburnt plots. In burnt plots spatial autocorrelation values were positive at finer scales and negative at coarser scales potentially indicating co-existence of facilitation and competition within the same ecosystem depending on the scale. The pattern derived here provides inference for (a) fire acting as an increasing aggregation & spatial autocorrelation force, (b) tree survival under fire regimes is potentially facilitated by forming patches of trees and (c) scale-dependent facilitation and competition coexisting within the same ecosystem with finer scale facilitation and coarser scale competition.

Detailed, parameter-rich models often provide accurate estimates of system behaviour but can be data-hungry and difficult to operationalize. Moreover, complexity increases the danger of 'over-fitting', which leads to poor performance when models are applied to novel conditions. This challenge is typically described in terms of a trade-off between bias and variance (i.e. low accuracy vs. low precision). In studies of ecological communities, this trade-off often leads to an argument about the level of detail needed to describe interactions among species. Here, we used data from a grassland biodiversity experiment containing nine locally abundant plant species (the Jena 'dominance experiment') to parameterize models representing six increasingly complex hypotheses about interactions. For each model, we calculated goodness-of-fit across different subsets of the data based on sown species richness levels, and tested how performance changed depending on whether or not the same data were used to parameterize and test the model (i.e. within vs. out-of-sample), and whether the range of diversity treatments being predicted fell inside or outside of the range used for parameterization. As expected, goodness-of-fit improved as a function of model complexity for all within-sample tests. In contrast, the best out-of-sample performance generally resulted from models of intermediate complexity (i.e. with only two interaction coefficients per species-an intraspecific effect and a single pooled interspecific effect), especially for predictions that fell outside the range of diversity treatments used for parameterization. In accordance with other studies, our results also demonstrate that commonly used selection methods based on AIC of models fitted to the full dataset correspond more closely to within-sample than out-of-sample performance. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that models which include only general intra and interspecific interaction coefficients can be sufficient for estimating species-level abundances across a wide range of contexts and may provide better out-of-sample performance than do more complex models. These findings serve as a reminder that simpler models may often provide a better trade-off between bias and variance in ecological systems, particularly when applying models beyond the conditions used to parameterize them.","[Clark, Adam Thomas; Harpole, W.

These responses have important ecological implications, but debate about the appropriate control treatments used in experiments has led many to debate results. When plants ignore neighbours, and only respond to nutrient levels this is sometimes called an ideal-free distribution (IFD). When individual plants respond to neighbours by increasing root production to pre-empt the uptake of neighbours, and do so at the expense of reproduction, this has become known as a tragedy of the commons (TOC). Here, I describe how the history of competition experiments has largely been a history of experiments that only control two of three critical variables: (a) total nutrients per plant; (b) soil nutrient concentration and (c) pot volume. These confounding effects are the source of debate about results. In one study, split-root pea plants were grown with and without a below-ground neighbour at many pot volumes with equal total nutrients per-plant. The researchers explicitly argued that plant growth responses would not be affected by the concentration of nutrients in soil, and therefore they explicitly confounded soil nutrient concentration with neighbour presence. Here, I reanalyse a subset of their data, controlling for soil nutrient concentration, but confounding pot volume with neighbour presence. When I controlled for soil nutrient concentration, the presence of a below-ground neighbour had no effects on plant size, or allocation, and the effects of volume also disappeared. The reanalysis suggests that the behaviour of peas in this study was consistent with an IFD model, and that the previously reported volume and neighbour responses may have been due to the confounding of nutrient concentration. The results of the study in question depend very much on whether one does analyses that control for pot volume or whether one does analyses that control for soil nutrient concentration. Ultimately, these analyses lead to two different interpretations of the data. New experimental designs are emerging that fully control pot volume and nutrients across competition treatment, and I discuss possible paths forward in this ongoing debate.","[McNickle, Gordon G.] Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [McNickle, Gordon G.] Purdue Univ, Purdue Ctr Plant Biol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","McNickle, GG (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; McNickle, GG (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Purdue Ctr Plant Biol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",gmcnickle@purdue.edu,,,,,,51,3,3,6,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Although several studies reported a positive diversity - productivity relationship, the role of soil animals has been largely neglected. Nematodes are among the most widespread and important herbivores causing substantial yield losses in agriculture; however, impacts of nematodes on the diversity - productivity relationship in semi-natural plant communities have not been investigated until today. In the framework of the Jena Experiment (Thuringia, Germany) we established control and nematicide treated subplots to manipulate nematode densities on plots varying in plant species (1-16) and functional group richness (1-4). We explored the interacting effects of nematicide application and plant diversity on the main trophic groups of nematodes and on aboveground plant productivity. Nematicide application reduced the number of nematodes significantly, particularly that of plant feeders and predators. The negative impact of nematicide application on plant and bacterial feeders depended however on the diversity of the plant community. Total plant shoot biomass tended to decrease in the presence of ambient nematode densities. In detail, nematode effects varied however with plant functional group identity by reducing only the shoot biomass of herbs significantly but not that of legumes. Furthermore, the shoot biomass of grasses tended to decrease in the presence of ambient nematode densities. In contrast to total shoot biomass, nematodes decreased grass shoot biomass only in high diverse but not in low diverse plant communities. Thus, the present study for the first time highlights that nematodes likely modify the community structure und functions of semi-natural plant communities by altering the competition between plant functional groups and by attenuating the diversity - productivity relationship.

Transplant experiments with adult plants showed that marsh plant zonation along estuarine salinity gradients develops according to species tolerances of abiotic factors and biotic interactions. Thus, glycophytes are restricted from salt marshes by abiotic stress, whereas halophytes are excluded from freshwater marshes by competition. We hypothesized that adult plant zonations along estuarine stress gradients are predefined by processes affecting plants during their seedling phase. In an experimental glasshouse study, we tested how a mixed community of glycophytes and halophytes developed during the first months of early establishment affected by different flooding and salinity regimes. 2. We set up two factorial mesocosm experiments that tested the effects of three tidal regimes (daily tide, spring tide, no tide) and three salinity levels (fresh, brackish, salt) on the emergence and early establishment of glycophyte and halophyte seedlings. In the Emergence Experiment seedlings were identified and removed once per week. In the Establishment Experiment species cover was estimated every 2 weeks, and after 15 weeks final above-ground biomass of each species was determined. 3. Both glycophytes and halophytes showed highest seedling emergence under freshwater conditions. Emergence of halophytes was less impaired by increased salinities than that of glycophytes. Emergence and establishment of glycophytes were extremely reduced under brackish and salt conditions, whereas under freshwater conditions, glycophytes showed a consistent increase in cover over time. Cover of halophytes showed a similar increase in brackish and salt treatments; however, in freshwater treatments it significantly decreased after week 9. While daily tides predominantly decreased seedling emergence and establishment, spring tides had no significant effects on seedlings in freshwater and negative effects in saltwater treatments. 4. Synthesis. The ability of a species to germinate and emerge under conditions representing a particular position along an environmental gradient is necessary but not solely responsible for determining plant zonation patterns along estuarine marsh gradients. Our results show that competitive exclusion of halophytes by glycophytes as an important driver of marsh plant zonations along estuarine salinity gradients takes effect already during the early seedling establishment phase of the co-occurring plants.","[Engels, J.

In softwater lakes in Western Europe, hydrological state (submersed/emersed), carbon dioxide and ammonium levels and species interactions are considered as driving forces in structuring amphibious plant communities. In this study we aimed at evaluating the relative importance of these factors for four species in a competitive neighbourhood. Softwater lake habitat was simulated during one growing season in laboratory conditions, mimicking water level fluctuation, photoperiod and temperature. Artificial communities consisted of small populations of four softwater macrophyte species: Luronium natans, Baldellia ranunculoides ssp. repens, Eleocharis multicaulis and Hydrocotyle vulgaris. These communities were subjected to two levels of carbon dioxide and ammonium. Additionally, monocultures of Baldellia and Eleocharis were grown at a higher nutrient level combination in order to measure their competitive response in a community. Time (hydrological state) and species identity turned out to be the only consistently significant factors determining community composition. Plant performance was clearly species-dependent, while carbon dioxide and ammonium did not have major effects. The competitive response was significant in both Eleocharis and Baldellia. Competition intensity was highest in the emersed state. Carbon dioxide had a supplementary effect on the within-species performance in Luronium, Baldellia and Eleocharis, with high carbon dioxide level mainly resulting in more flowers and more stolons. Community outcomes and competitive responses in aquatic macrophytes appear difficult to predict, because of mixed life strategies and morphological and functional plasticity. We conclude that hydrological state was the only important environmental factor. The identity of the species that were present-implying species interactions-largely determined community outcome.

Field studies are constrained by environmental conditions which cannot be fully controlled and thus reproduced. A suitable model system would allow reproducible experiments on processes operating within crop genetic mixtures. Phenotypically dissimilar genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana were grown in monocultures and mixtures under high levels of competition for abiotic resources. Seed production, flowering time and rosette size were recorded. Mixtures achieved high yield stability across environments through compensatory interactions. Compensation was greatest when plants were under high levels of heat and nutrient stress. Competitive ability and mixture performance were predictable from above-ground phenotypic traits even though below-ground competition appeared to be more intense. This study indicates that the mixing ability of plant genotypes can be predicted from their phenotypes expressed in a range of relevant environments, and implies that a phenotypic screen of genotypes could improve the selection of suitable components of genotypic mixtures in agriculture intended to be resilient to environmental stress.","[Creissen, Henry E.; Brown, James K.

Sequential competitions have been shown to have either a first-or last-mover advantage. In contrast, this paper illustrates a general sequential-move competition where the first-and last-moving agents are the least profitable while the middle-moving agent is guaranteed to earn the highest possible payoff. This result provide for a new intuition about the underlying incentives in a sequential decision structure which are tested using a multiple-round laboratory experiment. Experimental data aggregated across all rounds support the prediction of a first-and last mover disadvantage along with a middle-mover advantage. Furthermore, the data suggest that subjects learn as they gain experience with this competition. In this manner, a sequential decision structure with inexperienced agents will benefit the first-and middle-moving agents, whereas the same decision structure with experienced agents will only benefit the middle-moving agents.","[Kendall, Ryan] UCL, Dept Econ, Drayton House,30 Gordon St, London WC1H 0AN, England","Kendall, R (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Econ, Drayton House,30 Gordon St, London WC1H 0AN, England.",Ryan.Kendall@ucl.ac.uk,,,UC Irvine's Institute of Mathematical Behavioral Sciences; UC Irvine's Department of Economics; UC Irvine's Experimental Social Science Lab; Army Research Office MURI grant [W911NF-11-1-0332],"I would like to thank Donald Saari for his guidance, support, and constant encouragement on developing this project.

In many instances, front-line technology applications have replaced traditional, hard-copy sales support materials. However, do these technology-based sales support materials (TSSM) offer meaningful utility in the PSP? Using a randomized field experiment, the current study answers the question through examining the use of TSSM within the PSP and across genders. Results indicate that the use of TSSM offers utility during the presentation and objection-handling stages of the PSP. There are no gender effects associated with technology use. The study offers educators pedagogical recommendations regarding the use of TSSM within the PSP.

We utilized a 13-year experiment consisting of factorial removal of three shrub species (Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, and Empetrum hermaphroditum) and factorial removal of two functional groups (tree roots and feather mosses) to assess how neighbors affect N acquisition and growth of each of the three shrub species. The removal plots were established on each of 30 lake islands in northern Sweden that form a natural gradient of resource availability. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) the presence of functionally similar neighbors would reduce shrub N acquisition through competition for a shared N resource; (2) the removal of functional groups would affect shrub N acquisition by altering the breadth of their niches; and (3) soil fertility would influence the effects of neighbor removals. We found that the removal of functionally similar neighbors (i.e., other shrub species) usually resulted in higher biomass and biomass N, with the strength of these effects varying strongly with site fertility. Shrub species removals never resulted in altered stable N isotope ratios (delta N-15), suggesting that the niche breadth of the three shrubs was unaffected by the presence of neighboring shrub species. In the functional group removal experiment, we found positive effects of feather moss removal on V. myrtillus biomass and biomass N, and negative effects on E. hermaphrotium N concentration and V. vitis-idaea biomass and biomass N. Tree root removal also caused a significant shift in foliar delta N-15 of V. myrtillus and altered the delta N-15, biomass, and biomass N of E. hermaphroditum. Collectively, these results show that the resource acquisition and niche breadth of the three shrub species are often affected by neighbors, and further that both the identity of neighbors and site fertility strongly determine whether these interactions are positive, negative, or neutral. These findings have implications for understanding species coexistence and the reciprocal relationships between productivity and species diversity in this ecosystem.","[Gundale, Michael J.; Nilsson, Marie-Charlotte; Wardle, David A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Hyodo, Fujio] Okayama Univ, Res Core Interdisciplinary Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Gundale, MJ (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Michael.Gundale@slu.se,"Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/B-1802-2017; Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011; Gundale, Michael J/O-1265-2013; HYODO, Fujio/B-2422-2011","Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/0000-0002-9254-2223; Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; Gundale, Michael J/0000-0003-2447-609X; ","Swedish research council FORMASSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish research council VRSwedish Research Council; Wallenberg Scholars foundation; MEXT, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","We thank A.

However, the role of biotic interactions as drivers of intraspecific variability in litter traits remains surprisingly little studied. In this study, we used a large-scale, multi-site network of long-term tree removal experiments manipulating the abundance of a foundation tree species, i.e., Quercus petraea, to assess how plant interactions control intraspecific variation in oak leaf litter traits and decomposability. We studied 19 plots across eight experimental sites covering a large gradient of oak abundance, stand age, and local abiotic context. Oak leaf litter quality strongly declined with tree removal in early forest successional stage. Litter became poorer in nutrients such as N and Mg and richer in secondary metabolites such as lignin and condensed tannins. This in turn slowed its decomposition. Importantly, litter N loss switched from N release to N immobilization. Variance partitioning indicated that oak abundance explained as much variation in oak leaf litter traits as oak age and twice as much as soil inherent fertility. Confirmatory path analysis revealed that the decline of oak leaf litter quality induced by tree removal was most likely driven by a shift in understory plant species composition. Plasticity of oak leaf litter traits to the shortage of nutrient supply related to the development of understory plants competitors with higher nutrient capture and retention ability could potentially explain this response pattern. Our data also give consistent but weaker support that the decline of oak leaf litter quality could be driven by alleviated competition for light among canopy trees and subsequent enhanced crown exposure to light. Overall, our study provides evidence that biotic factors such as plant interactions are major drivers of plasticity in leaf litter traits and decomposability. This finding contributes to the emerging view that phenotypic -plasticity is fundamentally related to biotic interactions for sessile organisms, especially for long-lived and large plant species such as trees. Taking this source of functional diversity into account could help us to better understand plant community dynamics and ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems.","[Henneron, Ludovic; Chauvat, Matthieu; Akpa-Vinceslas, Marthe; Bureau, Fabrice; Mignot, Laurent; Aubert, Michael] Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, IRSTEA, ECODIV, FR-76000 Rouen, France; [Henneron, Ludovic] INRA, UREP, F-63039 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Archaux, Frederic; Dumas, Yann; Perret, Sandrine; Balandier, Philippe] Domaine Barres, IRSTEA, UR EFNO, F-45290 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Ningre, Francois] INRA, Ctr INRA Nancy, LERFoB, UMR 1092, F-54280 Seichamps, France; [Richter, Claudine] ONF, Res & Dev Dept, Blvd Constance, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France","Henneron, L (corresponding author), Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, IRSTEA, ECODIV, FR-76000 Rouen, France.",ludovic_henneron@hotmail.com,"Archaux, Frederic/M-5242-2014; Chauvat, Matthieu/J-6113-2019; Aubert, Michael/C-8724-2012","Archaux, Frederic/0000-0002-9996-0006; Chauvat, Matthieu/0000-0002-4831-5904; Aubert, Michael/0000-0003-4846-1159; Henneron, Ludovic/0000-0002-3979-0543; BUREAU, Fabrice/0000-0002-5501-0949","Upper-Normandy region via the Wide Area Network Research (TERA: Territory, Environment, Risk, Agronomy)Region Normandie; French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy [10-MBGD-BGF-3-CVS-081]; AgroParisTech; INRA; ONF; Irstea; French Ministry of Agriculture and Forest","This study was funded by a grant provided by the Upper-Normandy region via the Wide Area Network Research (TERA: Territory, Environment, Risk, Agronomy) and by the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy (Convention No. 10-MBGD-BGF-3-CVS-081, BGF program, IMPREBIO Research Project).

On caged Tiliaxeuropaea L. cv. Pallida trees (Malvaceae) with ample amounts of aphid food, we introduced freshly hatched larvae of a single or of both ladybird species and followed their development until emergence of adults. Under the condition of ample prey availability, both ladybird species apparently hardly interacted and intraguild predation did not cause significant mortality. Development time of both species is in line with data from laboratory tests under controlled conditions. Immature survival can reach high levels, but is considerably higher for H.axyridis (44-100%) than for A.bipunctata (11-77%), resulting in faster increase of H.axyridis populations, which is one of the factors that may explain its invasion success.","[Raak-van den Berg, C.

It has been suggested that much of the elevated CO2 effect on plant productivity and N cycling in semi-arid grasslands is related to a CO2-induced increase in soil moisture, but the relative importance of moisture-mediated and direct effects of CO2 remain unclear. 2. We grew five grassland species common to the semi-arid grasslands of northern Colorado, USA, as monocultures and as mixtures of all five species in pots. We examined the effects of atmospheric CO2 concentration (ambient vs. 780 p.p.m.) and soil moisture (15 vs. 20% m/m) on plant biomass and plant N uptake. Our objective was to separate CO2 effects not related to water from water-mediated CO2 effects by frequently watering the pots, thereby eliminating most of the elevated CO2 effects on soil moisture, and including a water treatment similar in magnitude to the water-savings effect of CO2. 3. Biomass of the C-3 grasses Hesperostipa comata and Pascopyrum smithii increased under elevated CO2, biomass of the C-4 grass Bouteloua gracilis increased with increased soil moisture, while biomass of the forbs Artemisia frigida and Linaria dalmatica had no or mixed responses. Increased plant N uptake contributed to the increase in plant biomass with increased soil moisture while the increase in plant biomass with CO2 enrichment was mostly a result of increased N use efficiency (NUE). Species-specific responses to elevated CO2 and increased soil moisture differed between monocultures and mixtures. Both under elevated CO2 and with increased soil moisture, certain species gained N in mixtures at the expense of species that lost N, but elevated CO2 led to a different set of winners and losers than did increased water. 4. Elevated CO2 can directly increase plant productivity of semi-arid grasslands through increased NUE, while a CO2-induced increase in soil moisture stimulating net N mineralization could further enhance plant productivity through increased N uptake. Our results further indicate that the largest positive and negative effects of elevated CO2 and increased soil moisture on plant productivity occur with interspecific competition. Responses of this grassland community to elevated CO2 and water may be both contingent upon and accentuated by competition.","[Dijkstra, Feike A.; Blumenthal, Dana; Morgan, Jack A.; LeCain, Daniel R.] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Crops Res Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Follett, Ronald F.] USDA ARS, Soil Plant & Nutrient Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA","Dijkstra, FA (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Crops Res Lab, 1701 Ctr Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",feike.dijkstra@ars.usda.gov,"Dijkstra, Feike A/H-2182-2012; Blumenthal, Dana M/J-3106-2012","Dijkstra, Feike A/0000-0002-6191-6018; ",Agricultural Research ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service,"We thank Caitlin Brooks, Ed Buenger, Alison Eden, Joseph Hansen, Erik Hardy, Patrick McCusker, and David Smith for technical assistance and Wayne Polley and Stephen Prior for helpful comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

To fulfil this role adequately, understanding consumer preferences for health plan characteristics is of vital importance. Little is known, however, about these preferences and how they vary across consumers. Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) we quantified trade-offs between basic health plan characteristics and analysed whether there are differences in preferences according to age, health status and income. We selected four health plan characteristics to be included in the DCE: (i) the level of provider choice and associated level of reimbursement, (ii) the primary focus of provider contracting (price, quality, social responsibility), (iii) the level of service benefits, and (iv) the monthly premium. This selection was based on a literature study, expert interviews and focus group discussions. The DCE consisted of 17 choice sets, each comprising two hypothetical health plan alternatives. A representative sample (n = 533) of the Dutch adult population,. based on age, gender and educational level, completed the online questionnaire during the annual open enrolment period for 2015. The final model with four latent classes showed that being able to choose a care provider freely was by far the most decisive characteristic for respondents aged, over 45, those with chronic conditions, and those with a gross income over (sic)3000/month. Monthly premium was the most important choice determinant for young, healthy, and lower income respondents. We conclude that it would be very unlikely for half of the sample to opt for health plans with restricted provider choice. However, a premium discount up to (sic)15/month by restricted health plans might motivate especially younger, healthier, and less wealthy consumers to choose these plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Three low-input Cropping Systems (CS) using diverse weeding strategies (MMLI, a Low-Input MM implementing ploughing, a combination of on-row spraying and in-between row cultivation and cover crops; MMCT, Conservation Tillage MM implementing chemical control and cover crops; Maize-MSW, maize managed similar to MMLI but rotated with soybean & wheat) were compared to a reference system (MMConv, a conventional MM with tillage and a high quantity of inputs). Potential of Infestation of weeds (PI), weed biomass and crop production of these CS were compared during the first five years after their establishment. Yields were also assessed in weed-free zones hand-weeded weekly in 2014 and 2015. Weed communities did not drastically differ among CS. PI and weed biomass were higher in MMCT, especially for Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.Beauv. and were comparable between MMConv, MMLI and Maize-MSW. Analysis of covariance between CS and weed biomass did not reveal a significant interaction, suggesting that weed biomass affected yield similarly among the CS. Comparison between weedy and weed-free zones suggested that weeds present at maize maturity negatively affected yields to the same extent for all four CS, despite having different weed biomasses. Grain yields in MMConv (11.3 +/- 1.1 t ha(-1)) and MMLI (10.6 +/- 2.3 t ha(-1)) were similar and higher than in MMCT (8.2 +/- 1.9 t ha(-1). Similar yields, weed biomasses and PI suggest that MMLI and Maize-MSW are interesting alternatives to conventional MM in terms of weed control and maize productivity and should be transferred to farmers to test their feasibility under wider, farm-scale conditions.","[Adeux, Guillaume; Giuliano, Simon; Alletto, Lionel] Univ Toulouse, Ecole Inn Purpan, UMR 1248, AGIR 75,Voie TOEC, BP 57611, F-31076 Toulouse, France; [Adeux, Guillaume; Cordeau, Stephane] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Savoie, Jean-Marie] Univ Toulouse, Ecole Ingn Purpan, UMR 1201, DYNAFOR 75,Voie TOEC, BP 57611, F-31076 Toulouse, France","Giuliano, S (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Ecole Inn Purpan, UMR 1248, AGIR 75,Voie TOEC, BP 57611, F-31076 Toulouse, France.",guillaume.adeux@inra.fr; simon.giuliano@purpan.fr; stephane.cordeau@inra.fr; jm.savoie@purpan.fr; lionel.alletto@lrmp.chambagri.fr,"Cordeau, Stephane/AAL-7447-2020; CORDEAU, Stephane/K-6926-2012","CORDEAU, Stephane/0000-0003-1069-8388; ADEUX, Guillaume/0000-0003-0903-391X; Alletto, Lionel/0000-0003-0933-9476",'Conseil Regional de Midi-Pyrenees' through the ANR Systerra MICMAC-Design projectFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-STRA-06]; ONEMA through the SYSTEM-ECO4; ONEMA through ECoPESt; Burgundy Region through the FABER program; Burgundy Region through CouvHerbi project,"The authors warmly thank Francois Perdrieux and Gael Rametti (Ecole dingenieurs de Purpan, France) for their involvement throughout the field and laboratory work, Michelle Corson for their revision of English language and Fabrice Dessaint (INRA-UMR Agroecologie, France), Stefano Carlesi and Gionata Bocci (SSSA Pisa, Italy) for their help with statistical methods.

Purportedly, Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus), a common species, and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis), an endangered species, compete for roosting and nesting cavities in living pine trees. To determine whether behavioral interactions measured at the individual level manifest themselves at the population level, we conducted field experiments designed to test whether the presence of Red-bellied Woodpeckers resulted in a decrease in fitness to Red-cockaded Woodpeckers. As part of a 4-year study examining the nature of interspecific interactions in two populations of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (one stable, the Apalachicola Ranger District; one declining, the Wakulla Ranger District) in the Apalachicola National Forest, Florida, we conducted a set of Red-bellied Woodpecker removal experiments. Paradoxically, following the removal of Red-bellied Woodpeckers, we observed decreases in Red-cockaded Woodpecker group size, proportion of nests that were successful, and proportion of individuals remaining on territories. Removal of Red-bellied Woodpeckers may have exaggerated the immigration rate of Red-bellied Woodpeckers to Red-cockaded Woodpecker territories. The Red-cockaded Woodpeckers in the Apalachicola Ranger District likely can withstand pressure from immigrating Red-bellied Woodpeckers given that their population has remained relatively stable despite the presence of Red-bellied Woodpeckers. A major factor of population persistence in the Wakulla Ranger District was the high turnover rate of adult female Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, a phenomenon that was exacerbated by removal of Red-bellied Woodpeckers. Relying solely on observations of apparently competitive interactions between individuals may not necessarily provide information about population-level outcomes. Paradoxically, removing species that appear to be competitors may harm species of concern.","[Walters, Eric L.; James, Frances C.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Walters, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Hastings Nat Hist Reservat, 38601 E Carmel Valley Rd, Carmel Valley, CA 93924 USA.",elw78@cornell.edu,"Walters, Eric L./C-1685-2008","Walters, Eric L./0000-0002-9414-5758",U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Florida State University; North American Bluebird Society; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 9629829],"The authors thank B.

Based on concepts borrowed from natural selection theory, we propose that trait-competition relationships can generally correspond to three univariate selection modes: directional (a rectilinear relationship), stabilising (an n-shaped relationship), and disruptive (a u-shaped relationship). Moreover, correlational selection occurs when two traits interact in determining competitive ability and lead to an optimum trait combination (i.e., a bivariate nonlinear selection mode). We tested our ideas using two independent datasets, each one characterising a group of species according to (a) their competitive effect on a target species in a pot experiment and (b) species-level values of well-known functional traits extracted from existing databases. The first dataset comprised 10 annual plant species frequent in a summer-rainfall desert in Argentina, while the second consisted of 37 herbaceous species from cool temperate vegetation types in Canada. Both experiments had a replacement design where the identity of neighbours was manipulated holding total plant density in pots constant. We modelled the competitive ability of neighbours (i.e., the log inverse of target plant biomass) as a function of traits using normal multiple regression. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) was consistently subjected to negative directional selection in both experiments as well as to stabilising selection among temperate species. Leaf size was subjected to stabilising selection among desert species while among temperate species, leaf size underwent correlational selection in combination with specific leaf area (SLA): selection on SLA was negative directional for large-leaved species, while it was slightly positive for small-leaved species. Synthesis. Multiple quadratic regression adds functional flexibility to trait-based community ecology while providing a standardised basis for comparison among traits and environments. Our analyses of two datasets from contrasting environmental conditions indicate (a) that leaf dry matter content can capture an important component of plant competitive ability not accounted for by widely used competitive traits, such as specific leaf area, leaf size, and plant height and (b) that optimum relationships (either univariate or bivariate) between competitive ability and plant traits may be more common than previously realised.","[Rolhauser, Andres G.; Nordenstahl, Marisa; Pucheta, Eduardo] Univ Nacl San Juan, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Dept Biol, San Juan, Argentina; [Rolhauser, Andres G.] Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos & Sistemas Informac, Fac Agron, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rolhauser, Andres G.; Aguiar, Martin R.] Univ Buenos Aires, IFEVA, CONICET, Fac Agron, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Rolhauser, AG (corresponding author), Univ Nacl San Juan, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Dept Biol, San Juan, Argentina.; Rolhauser, AG (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos & Sistemas Informac, Fac Agron, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.; Rolhauser, AG (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, IFEVA, CONICET, Fac Agron, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",rolhauser@agro.uba.ar,"Rolhauser, Andres/AAA-2743-2020","Rolhauser, Andres/0000-0001-6781-6723","Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [01322, 2449]","Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant/Award Number: 01322 and 2449",,73,7,8,4,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Competitive interactions are considered of critical importance in structuring ant assemblages, but field experiments show varied effects. I tested how succession in managed boreal forests affects the outcome of competition from dominant red wood ants, Formica aquilonia, through a removal experiment in replicated stands of three different ages (0-4, 30-40, and 80-100 years old). F. aquilonia abundance was reduced by 87%, and procedural controls showed no nontarget effects. The succession gradient revealed the full range of possible responses from ant species: decreases in 1-4-year-old stands, increases in 30-40-year-old stands, and no effects in 80-100-year-old stands, where diversity was lowest. Habitat succession thus regulates competitive interactions in this system. I propose a model for this system, where competitive effects depend on time since disturbance. In this case, soon after disturbance the dominant species facilitates increases in the abundance of other species. At intermediate times, competition reduces the abundance of some species. Finally, in long-undisturbed habitats, competitors may fail to evolve, particularly in high-stress environments. Interactions between competition and habitat succession may explain why structuring effects of ecologically dominant species appear inconsistent.","[Gibb, H.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Gibb, H.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Gibb, H (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",h.gibb@latrobe.edu.au,"Gibb, Heloise/B-8338-2013","Gibb, Heloise/0000-0001-7194-0620",Formas (the Swedish Research Council)Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas,"I thank Therese Johansson, Ake Nordstrom, Melanie Monroe, Jenny Landin, Jon Andersson, Tim Dempster, and Ylva Nordstrom for their valuable help with fieldwork.

These indirect effects can ramify through a community and affect many species, including some that may not have been directly affected by the perturbation. Identifying these chains of indirect effects is difficult, and most studies only follow indirect effects across two or three species. Here, we use a factorial field experiment to demonstrate that precipitation affects spotted aphids through a complex chain of indirect interactions that are mediated by other herbivores and a generalist predator. We experimentally simulated drought, which reduced water content in alfalfa plants. While water stress in alfalfa had no direct effect on spotted aphids, it lowered the population growth rate of pea aphids, another common alfalfa pest. Because ladybeetle predators were attracted to high pea aphid densities, predator densities were lower in drought treatments. Consequently, spotted aphid densities were released from top-down control (apparent competition) in drought treatments and reached densities three times higher than spotted aphids in ambient treatments with high pea aphid densities.

By alleviating interspecific competition among prey, predators may promote biodiversity, but the precise mechanisms of how predators alter competition have remained elusive. Here we report on a predator-exclosure experiment carried out in a tropical intertidal ecosystem, providing evidence for a three-level trophic cascade induced by predation by molluscivore Red Knots (Calidris canutus) that affects pore water biogeochemistry. In the exclosures the knots' favorite prey (Dosinia isocardia) became dominant and reduced the individual growth rate in an alternative prey (Loripes lucinalis). Dosinia, a suspension feeder, consumes suspended particulate organic matter (POM), whereas Loripes is a facultative mixotroph, partly living on metabolites produced by sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria, but also consuming suspended POM. Reduced sulfide concentrations in the exclosures suggest that, without predation on Dosinia, stronger competition for suspended POM forces Loripes to rely on energy produced by endosymbiotic bacteria, thus leading to an enhanced uptake of sulfide from the surrounding pore water. As sulfide is toxic to most organisms, this competition-induced diet shift by Loripes may detoxify the environment, which in turn may facilitate other species. The inference that predators affect the toxicity of their environment via a multi-level trophic cascade is novel, but we believe it may be a general phenomenon in detritus-based ecosystems.","[van Gils, Jan A.; van der Geest, Matthijs; Jansen, Erik J.; de Fouw, Jimmy; Piersma, Theunis] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Govers, Laura L.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Piersma, Theunis] Univ Groningen, CEES, Anim Ecol Grp, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","van der Geest, M (corresponding author), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.",matthijs.van.der.geest@nioz.nl,"van der Geest, Matthijs/A-4744-2013; Piersma, Theunis/D-1871-2012; Govers, Laura/B-8838-2011; van Gils, Jan/B-5544-2008","van der Geest, Matthijs/0000-0002-9837-3803; van Gils, Jan/0000-0002-4132-8243; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",NWO-WOTRONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [W.01.65.221.00],"We are grateful to the staff of the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin for allowing us to work and stay in the area under their management.

Apparent competition can be as strong as or stronger than direct competition, but the role of apparent competition has rarely been examined in biological invasions. We used four years of demographic data and seed-removal experiments to determine if introduced grasses caused elevated levels of seed consumption on native plant species in a coastal dune system in California, USA. We show that the endangered, coastal dune plant Lupinus tidestromii experiences high levels of pre-dispersal seed consumption by the native rodent Peromyscus maniculatus due to its proximity to the invasive grass, Ammophila arenaria. We use stage-structured, stochastic population models to project that two of three study populations will decline toward extinction under ambient levels of consumption. For one of these declining populations, a relatively small decrease in consumption pressure should allow for persistence. We show that apparent competition with an invasive species significantly decreases the population growth rate and persistence of a native species. We expect that apparent competition is an important mechanism in other ecosystems because invasive plants often change habitat structure and plant-consumer interactions. Possible implications of the apparent-competition mechanism include selective extinction of species preferred by seed consumers in the presence of an invasive species and biological homogenization of communities toward non-preferred native plant species.","[Dangremond, Emily M.; Pardini, Eleanor A.; Knight, Tiffany M.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Dangremond, EM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, 3060 Valley Life Sci Bldg,MC 3140, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dangremond@berkeley.edu,,"Dangremond, Emily/0000-0001-6177-9079","Lennette Undergraduate Research Fellowship; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; Washington University, St. Louis Office of Undergraduate Research; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0743731]","We are grateful to A.
