Sea urchin tethering has been the method of choice to evaluate rates of predation in marine benthic ecosystems. As standardly practiced, this method involves piercing the urchin test, potentially introducing significant methodological artifacts that may influence survival or detection by predators. Here we assess possible artifacts of tethering comparing invasive (pierced) and non-invasive tethering techniques using the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Specifically, we looked at how degree of confinement and high water temperature (first order artifacts) and predator guild and size of the prey (second order artifacts) affect the survival and/or detectability of pierced urchins. Our results show that first order artifacts only arise when pierced sea urchins are placed in sheltered bays with confined waters, especially when water temperature reaches extremely high levels. Prey detectability did not increase in pierced sea urchins for the most common predators. Also, test piercing did not alter the preferences of predators for given prey sizes. We conclude that the standard tethering technique is a robust method to test relative rates of sea urchin predation. However, local conditions could increase mortality of the tethered urchin in sheltered bays or in very high temperature regimes. Under these conditions, adequate pierced controls (within predator exclusions) need to be included in assays to evaluate artifactual sources of mortality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Does this history affect their ability to assess and respond to a snake that has this ability? As a test, we exposed gerbils to risk of predation from various predators, including snakes, owls, and foxes. The snakes included the Saharan horned viper (Cerastes cerastes) and the sidewinder rattlesnake (Crotalus cerastes). The former snake lacks sensory pits and shares a common evolutionary history with the gerbil. The latter snake, while convergent evolutionarily on the horned viper, has sensory pits and no prior history with the gerbil. The gerbils exploited depletable resource patches similarly, regardless of snake species and moon phase. While the gerbils did not respond to the novel snake as a greater threat than their familiar horned viper, the gerbils were cognizant that the novel predator was a threat. In response to both snakes, giving-up densities (GUDs; the amount of food left in a resource patch following exploitation) of the gerbils were higher in the bush than open microhabitat. In response to moonlight, GUDs were higher on full than on the new moon. Based on GUDs, the gerbils responded most to the risk of predation from the red fox, least from the two snake species, and intermediate for the barn owl.","[Bleicher, Sonny S.] Felidae Conservat Fund, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL USA; [Embar, Keren; Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Sede Boqer, Israel","Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Felidae Conservat Fund, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",bleicher@email.arizona.edu,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo/AAE-6272-2020","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Bleicher, Sonny S/0000-0001-8727-5901",US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF)US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [BSF-2008163],US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) [grant number BSF-2008163].,,30,16,16,0,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1565-9801,2224-4662,,ISR J ECOL EVOL,Isr.

Theoretical models have mainly used Holling Type I and Type II functional response, the latter typically best describing the functional response of a predator. However, no empirical study has simultaneously examined the form of the functional response and the effect of prey density on intraguild interactions. This is surprising considering that the strength of the functional response is crucially important for the stability of simple predator-prey systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of communities. In this study, we first developed a linear and a nonlinear functional response model for intraguild predators and next used a plant-aphid-predator mesocosm to parameterize the models and test their predictions at different prey densities. As expected, the assumptions of the linear model are not supported by empirical results which lead to systemic overestimation of the predation rate and the intensity of intraguild predation. On the other hand, the predictions of the nonlinear functional response model fit very well with experimental observations mainly because key behavioral characteristics such as handling time are integrated in this model. The nonlinear model is thus a good predictor of intraguild predation and allows a better understanding of how environmental productivity and predator behavior influence the occurrence and outcome of multiple predator interactions.","[Sentis, A.; Brodeur, J.] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Sentis, A.; Hemptinne, J.

Oxazepam, an anxiolytic drug, has been shown to intensify salmon smolt migration in mesocosm experiments, and treatment with this drug has, therefore, been suggested as a management option to improve downstream smolt migration. In this study, we tested this by assessing migration performance of hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolt along a 21-km long natural river-to-sea migration route in a boreal river in Northern Sweden. Using acoustic telemetry, the migration rate and survival of smolt that had been exposed to oxazepam (200 mu g L-1, N = 20) was monitored and compared with a control group (N = 20) of unexposed smolt. Exposed smolt took significantly longer time to initiate migration after release compared to the control fish, but after that we observed no significant difference in downstream migration speed. However, exposed smolt had considerably higher probability of being predated on compared to control smolt. We attribute these results to increased risk-taking and higher activity in oxazepam-exposed smolt, which in turn increased initial non-directional exploratory behavior and decreased predator vigilance. These results are discussed based on current concerns for ecological implications of behavioral modifications induced by pharmaceutical pollution and climate change. We conclude that exposure to oxazepam is an unsuitable management option to prime migration of reared salmon in natural systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Benthic food resources have been assumed to be less important for mysid diets than pelagic zooplankton. Studies have nevertheless indicated that mysids consume benthic sedimented detritus, calling this assumption into question. We conducted a food-choice experiment to evaluate the feeding preferences of Mysis diluviana (Audzijonyte & Vainola, 2005) by presenting field-caught specimens in individual foraging arenas with multiple choices of food. Experimental food treatments included a preferred pelagic prey (Daphnia), a presumed less desirable benthic resource (detritus), and a combination of both. We hypothesized that M. diluviana 1) prefers Daphnia over detritus and consumes only Daphnia in combination treatments, and 2) would not consume detritus except when detritus was the only food source available. Contrary to our hypothesis, M. diluviana readily consumed detritus in the presence of Daphnia. Mysis diluviana unexpectedly consumed more individuals of Daphnia in the presence rather than in the absence of detritus. Our results demonstrate that mysids take advantage of benthic food resources even in the presence of a presumably preferred zooplankton prey, calling to question the long-held assumption that benthic resources are unimportant when considering the trophic role of freshwater mysids of the M. relicta group.","[Griffin, Jessica E.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, Coastal & Marine Inst, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Griffin, Jessica E.] San Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst Lab, San Diego, CA 92106 USA; [Griffin, Jessica E.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92106 USA; [O'Malley, Brian P.] US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Lake Ontario Biol Stn, Oswego, NY 13126 USA; [Stockwell, Jason D.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Ecosyst Sci Lab, Burlington, VT 05401 USA","O'Malley, BP (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Lake Ontario Biol Stn, Oswego, NY 13126 USA.",bomalley@usgs.gov,"O'Malley, Brian/O-9764-2018","O'Malley, Brian/0000-0001-5035-3080",Great Lakes Fishery Commission Award [2018-STO-44074]; University of Vermont Chrysalis Award; International Association for Great Lakes Research; National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [DBI-1358838],"We thank Steve Cluett and Brad Roy for help with field collections, and Hannah Lister and Sture Hansson for their help in the execution of the experiment.

At the White Sea, the adult moonsnails Amauropsis islandica feed mostly on Macoma balthica clams. The diet of juveniles was largely unknown. We conducted a field survey and a caging experiment to find out if juvenile moonsnails can prey on Hydrobia ulvae, and whether they prefer this snail to their usual prey. Live molluscs and their intact or perforated shells were collected from 34 sediment cores. We exposed the single-prey cages with 50 Macoma (MP) or 50 Hydrobia (HP) together with five Amauropsis juveniles, as well as the cages where both prey species were in a 25: 25 proportion (HMP). While live Hydrobia was more abundant in the natural assemblages, Amauropsis preferred Macoma, as indicated by proportions of perforated shells. The caging experiment produced similar results. Per capita Macoma consumption rate was significantly higher than Hydrobia consumption rate (6.4 +/- 0.5 mg day(-1) ind.(-1) vs. 1.4 +/- 0.2 mg day(-1) ind.(-1) in MP and HP respectively). Prey consumption rates in the single-prey treatments were higher than in mixed-prey cages regardless of prey species. Different mechanisms explain this variation: for Hydrobia it is a consequence of the dietary shift, while for Macoma it reflects the 'floor' effect in HMP cages, where virtually all Macoma had been drilled by the end of exposure term. While Macoma is the preferable prey of young Amauropsis, Hydrobia can supplement the diet of juveniles when Macoma is scarce in certain locations.","[Aristov, Dmitriy] Russian Acad Sci, Zool Inst, St Petersburg 196140, Russia; [Varfolomeeva, Marina] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Aristov, Dmitriy; Puzachenko, Georgii] Lab Marine Benth Ecol & Hydrobiol, St Petersburg, Russia","Aristov, D (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Zool Inst, St Petersburg 196140, Russia.",amauropsis@gmail.com,"Aristov, Dmitriy/O-6042-2017; Varfolomeeva, Marina A./D-1024-2013","Aristov, Dmitriy/0000-0001-5271-9568; Varfolomeeva, Marina A./0000-0003-0887-8486",,,,44,6,6,1,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Three invasive (peacock bass Cichla piquiti, Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus) and two native (yellowtail tetra Astyanax altiparanae and streaked prochilod Prochilodus lineatus) fish species were offered as prey to P corruscans in 300 L aquaria with three habitat complexity treatments (0%, 50% and 100% structure-covered). Prey survival was variable through time and among species (C. piquiti < O. niloticus < A. altiparanae < P lineatus <1. punctatus), depending largely on species-specific prey behavior but also on prey size and morphological defenses. Habitat complexity did not directly affect P corruscans piscivory but some prey species changed their microhabitat use and shoaling behavior among habitat treatments in predator's presence. Pseudoplatystoma corruscans preyed preferentially on smaller individuals of those invasive species with weak morphological defensive features that persisted in a non-shoaling behavior. Overall, our results contrast with those in a companion experiment using a diurnal predator, suggesting that nocturnal piscivores preferentially prey on different (rather diurnal) fish species and are less affected by habitat complexity. Our findings suggest that recovering the native populations of P. corruscans might help controling some fish species introduced to the Parana River basin, particularly C. piquiti and O. niloticus, whose parental care is expected to be weak or null at night.","[Santos, Alejandra F.

Cannibalism is an intriguing form of predation whereby foraging by predators may contribute to the regulation of their own populations. This is particularly interesting in the case of invasive species, like the widely distributed European green crab (Carcinus maenas). This study explores how habitat complexity influences cannibalism rates in green crab populations of Prince Edward Island, Atlantic Canada. Both laboratory and field experiments were conducted to measure feeding rates by individual adult green crabs on a standard number of smaller conspecifics. In the laboratory, experimental treatments mimicked unstructured to increasingly structured habitats: water, sandy bottom, oyster shells, mussel shells, oyster shells with sandy bottom and mussel shells with sandy bottom. In those trials, adult green crabs consumed several times more juveniles on unstructured habitats than on the most structured ones, with a gradual decrease in predation rates across increasingly complex habitats. Field inclusion experiments used the same approach and were conducted in sandy bottoms, sandy bottoms with a layer of oyster shells and sandy bottoms with a layer of mussel shells. These trials showed similar patterns of decreasing feeding rates across increasingly complex habitats, but differences among treatments were not significant. These results support the idea that complex habitats have the potential to mediate predator-prey interactions, including adult-juvenile cannibalism in green crabs.","[Gehrels, Hannah; Flynn, Paula Tummon; Quijon, Pedro A.] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Dept Biol, Charlottetown, PE, Canada; [Cox, Ruth] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Atlantic Vet Coll, Dept Hlth Management, Charlottetown, PE, Canada","Quijon, PA (corresponding author), Univ Prince Edward Isl, Dept Biol, Charlottetown, PE, Canada.",pquijon@upei.ca,,"Quijon, Pedro/0000-0002-7980-0654",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Excellence Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs,NSERC; Canada Excellence Research Chairs Program,,51,2,2,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-9565,1439-0485,,MAR ECOL-EVOL PERSP,Mar.

We tested this hypothesis by manipulating the density of two common lake predators, the small-sized fish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco (the intraguild predator) and the shrimp Exopalaemon modestus (the intraguild prey), in outdoor mesocosms containing natural phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. In single predator treatments, both predators induced a strong trophic cascade, as evidenced by extinction of the key herbivore, Daphnia pulex, and increasing phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentration. When the two predators were added together, however, the strength of collective predator effects on zooplankton and the cascading effects on phytoplankton growth were weaker than the sum of the individual predator effects. We attributed this antagonism among predators to intraguild predation as demonstrated by the lower shrimp catch per unit effort in the presence of fish. Our study suggests that common predators in subtropical shallow lakes may act antagonistically and thereby dampen trophic cascades in food webs. Thus, when implementing biomanipulation efforts to suppress algal growth via enhancing zooplankton herbivory, both the quantity and diversity of lake predator assemblies should be considered.","[He, Hu; Chen, Kunquan; Li, Qisheng; Li, Kuanyi; Liu, Zhengwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ning, Xiaoyu] Chuzhou Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Chuzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Qisheng] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Aquaculture, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Kuanyi; Liu, Zhengwen; Jeppesen, Erik] Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengwen] Jinan Univ, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengwen] Jinan Univ, Inst Hydrobiol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Jeppesen, Erik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Limnol Lab, Ankara, Turkey; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Res & Implementat, Ankara, Turkey; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Inst Marine Sci, Mersin, Turkey","He, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",hehu@niglas.ac.cn,"Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012","Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X","National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31930074, 31971473]; Chinese National Key Research and Development Project [2017YFA0605201]; One-Three-Five Strategic Planning of Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences [NIGLAS2017GH01, NIGLAS2018GH04]; AnaEE Denmark; AQUACOSM; Tubitak program BIDEB 2232Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [118C250]","National Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31930074 and 31971473; Chinese National Key Research and Development Project, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFA0605201; One-Three-Five Strategic Planning of Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: NIGLAS2017GH01 and NIGLAS2018GH04; AQUACOSM; AnaEE Denmark; Tubitak program BIDEB 2232, Grant/Award Number: 118C250",,55,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Both factors might affect prey detection success in PCR-based gut content analysis, potentially resulting in over-or underestimation of feeding rates. Experimental evidence, however, is scarce. We examined how body size and prey quality affect prey DNA detection success in centipede predators. Due to metabolic rates increasing with body size, we hypothesized that prey DNA detection intervals will be shorter in large predators than in smaller ones. Moreover, we hypothesized that prey detection intervals of high-quality prey, defined by low carbon-to-nitrogen ratio will be shorter than in low-quality prey due to faster assimilation. Small, medium and large individuals of centipedes Lithobius spp. (Lithobiidae, Chilopoda) were fed Collembola and allowed to digest prey for up to 168 h post-feeding. To test our second hypothesis, medium-sized lithobiids were fed with either Diptera or Lumbricidae. No significant differences in 50% prey DNA detection success time intervals for a 272-bp prey DNA fragment were found between the predator size groups, indicating that body size does not affect prey DNA detection success. Post-feeding detection intervals were significantly shorter in Lumbricidae and Diptera compared to Collembola prey, apparently supporting the second hypothesis. However, sensitivity of diagnostic PCR differed between prey types, and quantitative PCR revealed that concentration of targeted DNA varied significantly between prey types. This suggests that both DNA concentration and assay sensitivity need to be considered when assessing prey quality effects on prey DNA detection success.","[Eitzinger, B.; Unger, E.

Hemimysis is predicted to impact nearshore fish communities in the Northeastern USA where its range is expanding, either negatively through predation of shared zooplankton prey or positively as high-calorie prey. In this experimental study, we examined the factors influencing Hemimysis' benthic habitat selection, vertical distribution, and susceptibility to fish predation. In the presence of fish cues, Hemimysis preferred cobble over other benthic substrates (Dreissena mussels, pebble, or sand) regardless of light conditions; in dark conditions without a fish present, Hemimysis preferred open waters with sand habitat. Light and fish cues also interacted to influence the vertical distribution of Hemimysis, with the majority of mysids selecting depths that minimized perceived cumulative risk. The mean feeding rates of young-of-year (YOY) alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), adult round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), YOY yellow perch (Percaflavescens), adult pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), and YOY lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) varied among species, prey densities, and substrate (range = 0.77-57 mysids/fish/h). In general, feeding rates were highest for alewife, a nonnative species in the Great Lakes basin, and in refuge-free conditions for all species, except for non-native round goby, which fed at similar rates regardless of prey refuge availability. Collectively, our results suggest that fish feeding success is contingent upon the interaction of light and Hemimysis refuge availability due to behavioral modifications of Hemimysis in the presence of fish and adverse light conditions.

Experimental models under simplified conditions with the presence of bacteria and bacteriophages have been used to elucidate the mechanisms that have enabled both prey and predator to coexist over long periods. In experimental coevolution conducted with Escherichia coli and the virulent RNA bacteriophage Q beta in serial transfer, both coexisted for at least for 54 days, during which time they continued to change genetically and phenotypically. By day 16, an E. coli strain partially resistant to Q beta appeared and caused an approximately 10(4)-fold decrease in Q beta amplification. Whole-genome analysis of this strain suggested that a single mutation in TraQ was responsible for the partially resistant phenotype. TraQ interacts with propilin, encoded by the traA gene and a precursor of pilin, which is a component of the F pilus. The present study was performed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the coexistence of E. coli and Q beta by investigating how a mutation in TraQ altered the physiological state of E. coli, and thus the amplification of Q beta. Overexpression of wild-type TraQ in the partially resistant E. col' strain resulted in recovery of both TraA protein content, including propilin and pilin, and Q beta amplification to levels comparable to those observed in the susceptible strain. Intriguingly, overexpression of the mutant TraQ in the partially resistant strains also increased the levels of TraA protein and Q beta amplification, but these increases were smaller than those observed in the wild-type strain or the partially resistant strain expressing wildtypeTraQ.The results of this study represent an example of how E. coli can become partially resistant to RNA bacteriophage infection via changes in a protein involved in maturation of a receptor rather than in the receptor itself and of how E. col' can stably coexist with virulent RNA bacteriophages.","[Kashiwagi, Akiko; Kitamura, Hikari; Tsushima, Fumie Sano] Hirosaki Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, 3 Bunkyo Cho, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368561, Japan","Kashiwagi, A (corresponding author), Hirosaki Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, 3 Bunkyo Cho, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368561, Japan.",kashi_a1@cc.hirosaki-u.ac.jp,,,"MEXT KAKENIAI [21770255, 23570268]; Kato Memorial Bioscience Foundation; Hirosaki University Grant for Exploratory Research by Young Scientists; Priority Research Grant for Young Scientists Designated by the President of Hirosaki University; Hirosaki University Institutional Research Grant for Young Scientists; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26440194] Funding Source: KAKEN","We are grateful to Dr. Tetsuya YOMO (Osaka University) and Dr. Kotaro Mori (Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, ltd.) for valuable discussions, and Ms. Hiroko Tohyama for excellent technical assistance, We thank Dr. Takahiro Toba and the members of RNA Research Center (Hirosaki University) for their cooperation, Fhis work was supported in part by MEXT KAKENIAI (21770255 and 23570268), Kato Memorial Bioscience Foundation, Hirosaki University Grant for Exploratory Research by Young Scientists, Priority Research Grant for Young Scientists Designated by the President of Hirosaki University, and Hirosaki University Institutional Research Grant for Young Scientists.",,47,0,0,0,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

We experimentally evaluated the influence of grazing by zooplankton and by different predator groups on the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and morphologically-based functional groups (MBFGs), in a subtropical floodplain shallow lake (Brazil). We tested if different grazing levels modify the structure of the phytoplankton, considering that higher zooplankton abundance reduces the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and the MBFGs. We used five treatments (5 L) with different zooplankton abundance and five replicas to represent an increasing grazing gradient. Sampling of phytoplankton and zooplankton was carried out after 24 hours, in each treatment. The zooplankton abundance presented significant differences among treatments (F = 11.79; p < 0.01), showing the evident grazing gradient in the experiment. Rotifers dominated all the treatments, followed by copepods, although their abundance decreased at the end of the experiment. In contrast, cladoceran abundance increased. An inverse and significant relationship was observed between zooplankton and rotifer abundances and MBFG III abundance (beta = -0.85, p < 0.01; r(2) = 0.32; beta = -0.54; p < 0.01; r(2) = 0.29, respectively), showing an effective predator-prey interaction. Many positive and significant relationships were also observed among the grazers and the prey. The increase of the abundance and biovolume of phytoplankton was related to the bottom-up mechanisms, the rapid population growth of prey, and the short time of the experiment. The change in the MBFGs' contribution was related to the increase in the zooplankton and group abundance, grazer competition and exploitative competition among the MBFGs. The experiment contributes to the knowledge on an important part of the trophic dynamics among planktonic communities in subtropical floodplain shallow lakes.","[Fonseca da Silva, Joao Vitor; Bonecker, Claudia Costa] Univ Estadual Maringa, Programa Posgrad Biol Comparada, Ave Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Baumgartner, Matheus Tenorio; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide; Bonecker, Claudia Costa] Univ Estadual Maringa, Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Miracle, Maria Rosa] Univ Valencia, Dept Microbiol & Ecol, ICBiBE, Burjassot, Valencia, Spain; [Dias, Juliana Deo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Oceanog & Limnol, Natal, RN, Brazil","da Silva, JVF (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Maringa, Programa Posgrad Biol Comparada, Ave Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",joaovitorbio@live.com,"Dias, Juliana D/B-3184-2013; Bonecker, Claudia C/D-5946-2013; Rodrigues, Luzia/AAB-2194-2021","Bonecker, Claudia C/0000-0003-4338-9012; Rodrigues, Luzia/0000-0002-0593-0931; Fonseca da Silva, Joao Vitor/0000-0002-1742-995X",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Nupelia (UEM); PELD/CNpq (site 6-PIAP); Proex/CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"We thank Leilane Talita Fatoretto Schwind for substantially contributing to the improvement of the manuscript.

Here, we demonstrate how it can benefit woodland caribou, which became the first large mammal extirpated from the contiguous United States in recent history. The continental scale of forest alteration and extended time needed for forest recovery means that relying only on habitat protection and restoration will likely fail. Therefore, population management is also needed as an emergency measure to avoid further extirpation. Reductions of predators and overabundant prey, translocations, and creating safe havens have been applied in a design covering >90,000 km(2). Combinations of treatments that increased multiple vital rates produced the highest population growth. Moreover, the degree of ecosystem alteration did not influence this pattern. By coordinating recovery involving scientists, governments, and First Nations, treatments were applied across vast scales to benefit this iconic species.","[Serrouya, Robert] Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, Caribou Monitoring Unit, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Serrouya, Robert] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Seip, Dale R.] British Columbia Minist Environm, Conservat Sci Sect, Prince George, BC V2L 3H9, Canada; [Hervieux, Dave; Steenweg, Robin] Alberta Environm & Pk, Resource Management Operat Div, Grande Prairie, AB T8V 6J4, Canada; [McLellan, Bruce N.] British Columbia Minist Forests Lands & Nat Resou, Res Branch, Darcy, BC V0N 1L0, Canada; [McNay, R.

To better understand and characterize the predator-prey system dynamics under field conditions, we developed a detailed process-based simulation model for the stage structured population interaction between cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, and its main natural enemy, the sevenspot ladybeetle Coccinella septempunctata. The model includes interactions between all insects stages as affected by temperature and host growth, and was parameterized based on detailed data collection in the laboratory and the field. The model was tested with independent data. Simulations show that the initial predator-prey ratio, as affected by immigration rates of the aphid and the predators into the crop, is the key factor for biological control. The model is a useful tool for scenario assessments on the effects of crop diversification on pest-natural enemy dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Xia, J. Y.; Cui, J.

Different trophic levels may respond disproportionately to change, with lower levels more likely to react faster, as they typically consist of smaller-bodied species with higher reproductive rates. This response could cause a mismatch between trophic levels, in which predators and prey will respond differently to changing abiotic or biotic conditions. This mismatch between trophic levels could result in altered top-down and bottom-up control and changes in interaction strength. To determine the possibility of a mismatch, we conducted a reciprocal-transplant experiment involving Sarracenia purpurea food webs consisting of bacterial communities as prey and a subset of six morphologically similar protozoans as predators. We used a factorial design with four temperatures, four bacteria and protozoan biogeographic origins, replicated four times. This design allowed us to determine how predator and prey dynamics were altered by abiotic (temperature) conditions and biotic (predators paired with prey from either their local or non-local biogeographic origin) conditions. We found that prey reached higher densities in warmer temperature regardless of their temperature of origin. Conversely, predators achieved higher densities in the temperature condition and with the prey from their origin. These results confirm that predators perform better in abiotic and biotic conditions of their origin while their prey do not. This mismatch between trophic levels may be especially significant under climate change, potentially disrupting ecosystem functioning by disproportionately affecting top-down and bottom-up control.","[Parain, Elodie C.; Rohr, Rudolf P.; Bersier, Louis-Felix; Gray, Sarah M.] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol Ecol & Evolut, Chemin Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Parain, Elodie C.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Ecol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gravel, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gravel, Dominique] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol Ecol Terrestre, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada","Parain, EC (corresponding author), Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",elodie.parain@yale.edu,"Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/K-9232-2015; Bersier, Louis-Felix/G-8018-2011","Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/0000-0002-6440-2696; Bersier, Louis-Felix/0000-0001-9552-8032",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A_138489]; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); SNSF International Short Visit Grant,"Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) (Grant/Award Number: '31003A_138489'), NSERC-Discovery, SNSF International Short Visit Grant.",,66,6,6,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The trophic relationship between mosquito larvae and copepods offers an exception to the conspicuous feature that the bigger consumes the smaller. We here address this ecological question by investigating the predation impact of the epibenthic cyclopoid copepod Megacyclops formosanus on a 30-h old mosquito larvae Aedes aegypti in a controlled environment. Our quantitative assessment depicted the effect of M. formosanus on 30-h old mosquito larvae. We found that copepod captured mosquito larvae on an average 1.6 +/- A 0.20 larvae ind(-1) h(-1) with an attack speed 22.80 +/- A 8.52 mm s(-1). In addition, copepod predation dramatically affected mosquito behavior. In the presence of predator, mosquito larvae significantly decreased browsing and filtering paths, while using mixed foraging tactics and shifting the habitat use from the bottom to surfacing or air-water interfacing. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the interaction between mosquito and cyclopoid copepods, and show that copepod predation constrains the habitat use of mosquito larvae. Copepod predation pressure results in reduced facultative behavioral responses that challenge mosquito life history and ultimately percolate its population fitness.","[Awasthi, Amit Kant; Molinero, Juan Carlos; Wu, Cheng-Han; Hwang, Jiang-Shiou] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Keelung 202, Taiwan; [Molinero, Juan Carlos] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Tsai, Kun-Hsien] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Inst Environm Hlth, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [King, Chwan-Chuen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Epidemiol, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Hwang, JS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, 2 Pei Ning Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan.",jshwang@mail.ntou.edu.tw,,"King, Chwan-Chuen/0000-0002-6078-2601; TSAI, KUN-HSIEN/0000-0002-6154-113X","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, ROC [NSC 98-2621-B-019-001-MY3, NSC 99-2611-M-019-009, NSC 100-2611-M-019-010, NSC 101-2611-M-019-011, NSC 102-2611-M-019-003, NSC 102-2923-B-019-001-MY3]; NSC grant [102-2811-B-019-002]","This study was supported by the funding provided by projects NSC 98-2621-B-019-001-MY3, NSC 99-2611-M-019-009, NSC 100-2611-M-019-010, NSC 101-2611-M-019-011, NSC 102-2611-M-019-003, and NSC 102-2923-B-019-001-MY3 from Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, ROC.

Yet, most experimental studies increase temperatures constantly throughout a 24 h day, or disproportionally during the daytime, which could lead to a mismatch between evaluated and predicted warming. We conducted three experiments to evaluate how timing of warming (constant, day, or night) influences development, predation, and respiration rates of predators. Lady beetles were reared from egg to adulthood in one of four different temperature treatments. Next, we compared aphid consumption rates by adult lady beetles that were reared in different conditions. Finally, all individuals were exposed to a single similar temperature to evaluate respiration rates. Warming treatment affected many of the measured predator traits, including hatching success, development times, predation rates, and respiration rates, but the direction and magnitude of effects differed among traits measured. Our results demonstrate that the timing of warming has ecologically-relevant effects and that future studies should strive for more realistic warming treatments to increase their predictive power and reliability of results.

We get new insights derived from experimental approaches: analytical models (optimal dynamic control of predator-prey models) provide optimal dynamic strategies and interventions, depending on different objective functions. Our economic experiments are able to test the applicability of these strategies, and in how far decision-makers can learn to improve decision-making by repeated applications. We aim to analyse a sustainable environment with diametrical goals to harvest as much as possible while allowing optimal population growth. We find interesting insights from those who manage the dynamic system. With the methodology of experimental economics, the experiment at hand is developed to analyse the capability of individual persons to handle a complex system, and to find an economic, stable equilibrium in a neutral setting. We have developed a most interesting simulation model, where it will turn out that prices play a less important role than availability of the goods.

However, organisms may acclimate to these conditions through behavioural and physiological mechanisms as exposure time increases. We used a reciprocal temperature (16 degrees C and 24 degrees C) transplant experiment to determine how feeding rate and body size of an apex soil mite predator (Stratiolaelaps scimitus) (formerly Hypo aspis miles) consuming prey (Carpoglyphus lactis) (dried-fruit-mite) changed along a gradient of acclimation time (1, 3, and 7 days, with control). In the control treatments, mites reared at 24 degrees C fed more, but were smaller than mites reared at 16 degrees C. When transferred to new temperature conditions, predators that experienced cooling events had reduced feeding efficiencies driven by decreased feeding performance, despite an absence of metabolic costs, while under warming events, predators also had reduced feeding activity, but feeding increased with acclimation time. Yet predators lost more weight the longer they were exposed to warming, and continued to experience reduced feeding efficiencies (i.e., lack of weight gain after feeding); this result suggests increased metabolic costs at higher temperatures and provides a mechanism for community downsizing under warming. Overall, our results suggest that ectothermic predators can acclimate to warming events with increased exposure time, but both warming and cooling events decrease overall performance.

In the large-size species Hermodice carunculata, characterized by invasive potential and great predatory ability, notochaetae deter consumers and damage prey. The origin of fireworm defensive and offensive capacities, the mechanism of action of the stinging chaetae, and whether other chemical defenses occur are still uncertain. In the present study, we tested if the urticating system of fireworms is the result of a synergy between mechanical injury, due to notochaetae penetration, and the release of toxins vehiculated. To determine whether and where chemical or structural deterrents were present, different body parts of H. carunculata involved in inter-specific interactions were assayed (i.e. dorsal body wall, gills, dorsal and ventral parapodia). Feeding bioassays were performed to assess palatability against a fish (generalist consumer) and deterrent action on contact with two sea anemones (fireworm prey). In all the assays, only the offers bearing the dorsal chaetae (notochaetae) strongly deterred consumers and induced paralysis in prey. The notochaetae treated with organic solvents lost their deterrence against fish. Besides, the notopodia were palatable to fish and anemones after the removal of the notochaetae. These findings support a powerful synergy between chemical deterrence and physical structure. To date, the only acute inflammation inducer isolated from an amphinomid is complanine, a trimethylammonium compound. High-resolution LC-MS/MS and preliminary NMR analyses suggested the presence of complanine-related compounds in the notochaetae. The present results suggest that the release of compounds and their strong deterrent effect should be mediated by mechanical injury. The sharp, fragile and hollow structure of the notochaetae combined with inflammatory substances could support the success of fireworms in marine benthic environments. Further research is required to ascertain the nature and localization of these chemicals in H. carunculata, broadening knowledge on the chemical ecology of amphinomids.","[Simonini, Roberto; Zanetti, Federica; Prevedelli, Daniela; Righi, Sara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Life Sci, Via Campi 213-D, I-41125 Modena, Italy; [Maggioni, Federica] Univ la Reunion, Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, IFREMER, CNRS,IRD,ENTROPIE, Noumea 98800, New Caledonia; [Fai, Sergio] Municipal Nardo, Piazza Cesare Battisti, I-73048 Lecce, Italy; [Forti, Luca] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Dept Life Sci, Via Campi 103, I-41125 Modena, Italy; [Righi, Sara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Chem & Geol Sci, Via Campi 103, I-41125 Modena, Italy","Righi, S (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Life Sci, Via Campi 213-D, I-41125 Modena, Italy.",sara.righi@unimore.it,"Forti, Luca/AAY-9976-2021; Luca, Forti/C-9876-2015","Forti, Luca/0000-0002-5662-7756; Luca, Forti/0000-0002-5662-7756; Maggioni, Federica/0000-0002-7109-4257",University of Modena and Reggio Emilia [FAR 2014],This work was supported by a grant from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (FAR 2014).,,64,1,1,0,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,1879-1697,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Other predatory aquatic insects have difficulty in capturing seed shrimps owing to the general form of the insects' mandibles. Larvae of Hyphydrus japonicus bear a projection on the head (the nasale), which is used in conjunction with vertical movements of the mandibles to fixate the valves of their prey and gain access to the soft body within them. This capture method does not destroy shells and is extremely efficient.

The aim of this study was to compare the magnitude of predation by these crabs on three mangrove species propagules: Avicennia schaueriana, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle. We found that G. cruentata is a more important predator than U. cordatus in both natural and restored areas. We also tested the hypothesis that Ucides and Goniopsis have antagonistic effects on propagules predation using a cage experiment where the presence/absence of these species was manipulated in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The effects of Goniopsis were stronger in the absence of Ucides due to negative interactions between these predator species. Moreover, we found that Goniopsis preference for A. schaueriana and L. racemosa can favor the dominance of R. mangle in Neotropical mangroves. This study suggests that propagule predation by Goniopsis should be controlled in mangrove restoration programs at abandoned shrimp farms and destroyed areas, if dominance by R. mangle is undesirable relative to mixed species communities.","[Ferreira, Alexander C.; Ganade, Gislene; Morais Freire, Fulvio A.; Attayde, Jose Luiz] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Bot Ecol & Zool, BR-59161175 Natal, RN, Brazil","Ferreira, AC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Bot Ecol & Zool, Campus Lagoa Nova, BR-59161175 Natal, RN, Brazil.",alexcrab90@hotmail.com,"Freire, Fulvio/C-8370-2012; Attayde, Jose/C-4009-2015; Ganade, Gislene/F-4863-2016","Freire, Fulvio/0000-0003-1580-0222; Ganade, Gislene/0000-0002-9291-1025; Ferreira, Alexander/0000-0002-0687-3844; Attayde, Jose/0000-0002-8372-4172",Conselho de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal Superior (CAPES)/REUNICoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"Conselho de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal Superior (CAPES)/REUNI provided a PhD grant to Alexander C.

Understanding proximate determinants of predation rates is a central question in ecology. Studies often use functional response (density dependent) or allometric (mass dependent) models but approaches that consider multiple factors are critical to capture the complexity in predator-prey interactions. We present a novel comprehensive approach to understand predation rates based on field data obtained from a vertebrate predator. 2. Estimates of food consumption and prey abundance were obtained from 21 semi-natural populations of the lizard Zootoca vivipara. We identified the most parsimonious feeding rate function exploring allometric, simple functional response and allometric functional response models. Each group included effects of sex and weather conditions. 3. Allometric models reveal the importance of predator mass and sex: larger females have the highest natural feeding rates. Functional response models show that the effect of prey density is best represented by a Holling type II response model with a mass, sex and weather dependent attack rate and a constant handling time. However, the best functional response model only received moderate support compared to simpler allometric models based only on predator mass and sex. 4. Despite this limited effect of prey densities on feeding rates, we detected a significant negative relationship between an index of preferred prey biomass and lizard density. 5. Functional response models that ignore individual variation are likely to misrepresent trophic interactions. However, simpler models based on individual traits may be best supported by some data than complex allometric functional responses. These results illustrate the importance of considering individual, population and environmental effects while also exploring simple models.","[Gonzalez-Suarez, Manuela; Mugabo, Marianne; Claessen, David; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 06, CNRS UPMC ENS 7625, F-75005 Paris, France; [Decenciere, Beatriz; Perret, Samuel; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS UPMC ENS 3194, CEREEP Ecotron IleDeFrance, F-77140 St Pierre Les Nemours, France; [Claessen, David] Ecole Normale Super, CERES ERTI, F-75005 Paris, France","Gonzalez-Suarez, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Calle Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",manuela.gonzalez@ebd.csic.es,"Le Galliard, Jean-Francois/E-8702-2011; Gonzalez-Suarez, Manuela/B-9740-2008; Claessen, David/S-7596-2017; Mugabo, Marianne/P-3527-2015","Le Galliard, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-5965-9868; Gonzalez-Suarez, Manuela/0000-0001-5069-8900; Claessen, David/0000-0001-7354-1316; Mugabo, Marianne/0000-0002-2346-2617; Decenciere, Beatriz/0000-0002-2847-7631",Region Ile-de-FranceRegion Ile-de-France [2007-06]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)French National Research Agency (ANR) [07-JCJC-0120]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL2009-07301/BOS]; European CommunityEuropean Commission [235897],"We would like to thank all personnel at the CEREEP field station for their help.

An increasing body of evidence suggests that rapid evolution and coevolution can alter these interactions, with important ecological implications, by acting on traits determining fitness, including reproduction, anti-predatory defence and foraging efficiency. However, most studies to date have focused only on evolution in the prey species, and the predator traits in (co)evolving systems remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated changes in predator traits after approximately 600 generations in a predator-prey (ciliate-bacteria) evolutionary experiment. Predators independently evolved on seven different prey species, allowing generalization of the predator's evolutionary response. We used highly resolved automated image analysis to quantify changes in predator life history, morphology and behaviour. Consistent with previous studies, we found that prey evolution impaired growth of the predator, although the effect depended on the prey species. By contrast, predator evolution did not cause a clear increase in predator growth when feeding on ancestral prey. However, predator evolution affected morphology and behaviour, increasing size, speed and directionality of movement, which have all been linked to higher prey search efficiency. These results show that in (co)evolving systems, predator adaptation can occur in traits relevant to foraging efficiency without translating into an increased ability of the predator to grow on the ancestral prey type.","[Cairns, Johannes] Wellcome Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Cairns, Johannes] Univ Helsinki, Dept Comp Sci, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol Res Programme, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Cairns, Johannes; Hiltunen, Teppo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Microbiol, POB 56, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Moerman, Felix; Altermatt, Florian] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Eawag, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Moerman, Felix; Altermatt, Florian] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Moerman, Felix; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.] Univ Montpellier, ISEM, CNRS, EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Hiltunen, Teppo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland","Hiltunen, T (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Microbiol, POB 56, Helsinki 00014, Finland.; Altermatt, F (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Eawag, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.; Altermatt, F (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.; Hiltunen, T (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland.",florian.altermatt@eawag.ch; teppo.hiltunen@helsinki.fi,"Fronhofer, Emanuel A./AAY-3186-2021; Moerman, Felix/AAP-4605-2020","Fronhofer, Emanuel A./0000-0002-2219-784X; Cairns, Johannes/0000-0003-1329-2025; Moerman, Felix/0000-0002-5164-0978; Altermatt, Florian/0000-0002-4831-6958",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [106993]; University Research Priority Program (URPP) `Evolution in Action' of the University of Zurich; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PP00P3_179089]; Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation [00190040],"This work was funded by the Academy of Finland (T.H.; project no. 106993), the University Research Priority Program (URPP) `Evolution in Action' of the University of Zurich and the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no.

As distress calls may trigger antipredator behaviour even in individuals that are not under attack, we tested whether this defensive behaviour induced behavioural changes in neighbouring conspecifics. We compared the behavioural responses of two species of Neotropical hylid frogs (genus Boana) to conspecific distress calls and white noise. Individuals of both species interrupted their vocal activity and decreased call rate after hearing the distress call. Natural variation on signal intensity calibrated among the nearest neighbours did not influence the response and we did not observe negative phonotaxis after any acoustic stimulus. Despite the fact that many predators are acoustically oriented, we could not determine if such response (reduced call rate) was induced by risk assessment or by the masking effect on advertisement calls. Boana faber responded similarly to white noise and distress calls, while B. bischoffi responded more intensely to distress calls. Duration of silence after playbacks in B. faber was longer than B. bischoffi. We suggest that, if the signals are interpreted as a risk cue by neighbouring conspecifics, each species may be preyed upon by different predators, as they may have led to distinct defensive strategies and different responses to distress calls. If risk assessment information is included in distress calls, it triggers behavioural responses only in the nearest neighbours, as we did not observe responses on the vocal activity of the interspecific chorus. Our results add relevant data about acoustic communication and interpretations by anurans, highlighting the importance of considering cues within common and widespread signals.","[Forti, Lucas Rodriguez; Toledo, Luis Felipe] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Forti, Lucas Rodriguez; Toledo, Luis Felipe] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Multiusuario Bioacust LMBio, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Bella Sanches Forti, Anna Barbara] Fac Direito Sorocaba, Rua Doutora Ursulina Lopes Torres, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Marquez, Rafael] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat CSIC, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Fonoteca Zool, Madrid, Spain","Forti, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Forti, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Multiusuario Bioacust LMBio, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lucas_forti@yahoo.com.br,"Toledo, Luis Felipe/I-4017-2012; Forti, Lucas/E-8207-2013","Toledo, Luis Felipe/0000-0002-4929-9598; Forti, Lucas/0000-0003-3057-2141; Marquez, Rafael/0000-0002-2070-860X","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/21519-4, 2014/23388-7]; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas [CGL2011-16159-E]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [302589/2013-9, 300896/2016-6, 438675/2016-9, 150041/2017-9, 405285/2013-2]; Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [ACOURA CGL2008-04814]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Grant/Award Number: #2013/21519-4 and #2014/23388-7; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Grant/Award Number: CGL2011-16159-E; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Grant/Award Number: #302589/2013-9, #300896/2016-6, #438675/2016-9, #150041/2017-9 and #405285/2013-2; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: ACOURA CGL2008-04814; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad",,32,5,5,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,DEC,2017,123,12,,,,,942,948,,10.1111/eth.12693,,,7,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FM2YC,WOS:000414867800007,,,,,2021-09-30,

Whereas the former condition should select for growth performance, the latter should favour traits that reduce predation mortality, such as the formation of large cell aggregates. However, protected morphotypes often convey a growth disadvantage, and bacteria thus face a trade-off between investing in growth or defence traits. We set up an evolutionary experiment with the freshwater isolate Sphingobium sp. strain Z007 that conditionally increases aggregate formation in supernatants from a predatorprey coculture. We hypothesized that low substrate levels would favour growth performance and reduce the aggregated subpopulation, but that the concomitant presence of a flagellate predator might conserve the defence trait. After 26 (1-week) growth cycles either with (P+) or without (P-) predators, bacteria had evolved into strikingly different phenotypes. Strains from P- had low numbers of aggregates and increased growth yield, both at the original rich growth conditions and on various single carbon sources. By contrast, isolates from the P+ treatment formed elevated proportions of defence morphotypes, but exhibited lower growth yield and metabolic versatility. Moreover, the evolved strains from both treatments had lost phenotypic plasticity of aggregate formation. In summary, the (transient) residence of bacteria at oligotrophic conditions may promote a facultative oligotrophic life style, which is advantageous for survival in aquatic habitats. However, the investment in defence against predation mortality may constrain microbial adaptation to the abiotic environment.","[Baumgartner, M.; Blom, J.

Increasing evidence suggests that birds are able to assess nest predation risk and avoid settling in high-risk areas to increase their reproductive performance. However, the cues used for settlement decisions are poorly known in most species. Population sizes of the migratory wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix are characterized by strong annual fluctuations, which are negatively correlated with the number of forest rodents. Wood warblers might avoid rodent-rich areas to reduce predation risk arising either from rodents, from rodent-hunting predators attracted to such areas or from predators not linked to rodents. To evaluate these hypotheses, we conducted a large-scale field experiment to test whether wood warblers avoided settling in plots with high predation risk simulated by broadcasting vocalizations of rodents or predators. Moreover, we tested whether reproductive performance varied in relation to simulated predation risk. Settlement patterns did not differ between plots with rodent, predator and noise control treatments. Likewise, measures of reproductive performance did not seem to differ across treatments. Thus, the broadcasted vocalizations of rodents and predators did not seem to be perceived as threat by wood warblers.

This technique has limitations, however, and often models are displayed in the field for long periods of time without distinguishing between daytime and nighttime attacks. We compared day and night predation rates on lizard-shaped clay models in a temperate ecosystem in northwest Italy. We placed 206 lizard models in two adjacent habitats (i.e., a mixed broadleaf woodland and along an adjacent ecotone) and checked them every morning and evening for three consecutive days (i.e., for 72 h). The model head was attacked more than expected by chance, indicating that predators were perceiving the models as true prey items. The overall observed predation rate was 18% (39/206) and was similar between the two habitats; however, models were attacked more than twice as often during daytime versus nighttime with 28 attacks (71%) during the day and 11 attacks (29%) during the night. Mammal predators attacked the models with similar frequencies during both daytime and nighttime. These findings indicate that, at least in our study area, the predation rate on terrestrial lizards differs between day and night and that mammals are diurnal potential predators of lizards.","[Costa, Andrea; Salvidio, Sebastiano] Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ambiente & Vita DISTAV, Genoa 16132, Italy; [Coroller, Simon] Univ Rochelle, Fac Sci & Technol, Ave Michel Crepeau, La Rochelle 17000, France","Salvidio, S (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ambiente & Vita DISTAV, Genoa 16132, Italy.",sebastiano.salvidio@unige.it,"Costa, Andrea/AAS-3754-2021","Costa, Andrea/0000-0003-4273-6182",Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra dell'Ambiente e della Vita (DISTAV); Genova University (Fondo di Ricerca di Ateneo 2019),"This research was partially funded by a Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra dell'Ambiente e della Vita (DISTAV) with a grant from Genova University (Fondo di Ricerca di Ateneo 2019) to SS.

This might be surprising because gold coloration is dominant and coded for by a single Mendelian locus. Furthermore, gold individuals are considered to be competitively advantaged over dark ones because they grow faster and win aggressive encounters more often compared to dark individuals of equal size. However, one might expect a cost of being gold in terms of natural selection as a result of predation. We tested whether the Jaguar cichlid (Parachromis managuensis), a major fish predator of Midas cichlids, preys differentially on colour variants of goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus), which were used as a proxy for Midas cichlids because of their similarity in colour. Size-matched pairs of prey fish (gold and dark) were offered to the predator and the time until the fish were attacked was recorded. The gold morph was attacked first more often (approximately 70%) but not faster than the dark morph. This suggests that the predator perceives the gold individual first, and/or that the predator exhibits a preference or higher motivation to attack the gold prey fish. The increased risk of predation of gold prey fish suggests for the Midas cichlid system that being gold may carry significant costs in terms of natural selection as a result of its major piscivorous predator.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 111, 350-358.","[Kusche, Henrik; Meyer, Axel] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Lehrstuhl Zool & Evolut Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Kusche, Henrik; Meyer, Axel] Univ Konstanz, Int Max Planck Res Sch Organismal Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Meyer, A (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Lehrstuhl Zool & Evolut Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",axel.meyer@uni-konstanz.de,"Meyer, Axel/C-9826-2009","Meyer, Axel/0000-0002-0888-8193",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG); European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC) [293700]; Deutsche Cichliden Gesellschaft,"We are grateful to Peter Buchhauser and the Nicaragua (2012) field crew (Carmelo Fruciano and Gonzalo Machado-Schiaffino) for providing the predators.

The ability to detect predators may be lower in darker light conditions or with darker backgrounds. For birds, however, this has never been experimentally tested. We test the hypothesis that the response time of avian prey (feral pigeon Columbia livia f. domestica) to a simulated hawk attack (taxidermy mounted colourpolymorphic black sparrowhawk Accipiter melanoleucus) will differ depending on light levels or background colour. We predict that response will be slower under darker conditions, which would translate into higher predation risk. The speed of response of prey in relation to light level or background colour may also interact with the colour of the predator, and this idea underpins a key hypothesis proposed for the maintenance of different colour morphs in polymorphic raptors. We therefore test whether the speed of reaction is influenced by the morph of the hawk (dark/light) in combination with light conditions (dull/bright), or background colours (black/white). We predict slowest responses to morphs under conditions that less contrast with the plumage of the hawk (e.g. light morph under bright light or white background). In support of our first hypothesis, pigeons reacted slower under duller light and with a black background. However, we found no support for the second hypothesis, with response times observed between the hawk-morphs being irrespective of light levels or background colour. Our findings experimentally confirm that birds detect avian predators less efficiently under darker conditions. These conditions, for example, might occur during early mornings or in dense forests, which could lead to changes in anti-predator behaviours. However, our results provide no support that different morphs may be maintained in a population due to differential selective advantages linked to improved hunting efficiencies in different conditions due to crypsis.","[Nebel, Carina; Sumasgutner, Petra; Pajot, Adrien; Amar, Arjun] Univ Cape Town, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Pajot, Adrien] Bordeaux Sci Agro, 1 Cours Gen Gaulle, F-33170 Gradignan, France","Nebel, C (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",carina.nebel@gmail.com,"Nebel, Carina/AAD-5646-2020; amar, arjun/F-3815-2011","Nebel, Carina/0000-0002-0848-1676; Pajot, Adrien/0000-0002-6874-4490; Sumasgutner, Petra/0000-0001-7042-3461; amar, arjun/0000-0002-7405-1180",DST-NRF Centre of ExcellenceDepartment of Science & Technology (India); UCT's International Student's Scholarship; William C.

However, few studies have demonstrated that the bright structural colours of beetles function as such aposematic signals for predators in the wild. To determine whether body colour might act as an aposematic signal in the carabid beetle Damaster blaptoides, we generated beetle models and conducted camera-trap and field experiments. Elaborate beetle models produced using a three-dimensional printer were used to determine which animals attack them in the wild. Red and black models were placed in forests to test which of the two types was attacked the least frequently. The camera-trap experiments indicated that mammals and birds were the potential predators of D. blaptoides. The field experiments revealed that predators attacked the red models significantly less frequently than the black models in each of three sites where red Damaster subspecies were distributed. In three sites where black Damaster subspecies were distributed, predators attacked both red and black models at similar rates. These results might imply that the predators learned more easily to avoid distasteful red beetles rather than black ones.","[Fukuda, Shinpei; Konuma, Junji] Toho Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, 2-2-1 Miyama, Funabashi, Chiba 2748510, Japan","Konuma, J (corresponding author), Toho Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, 2-2-1 Miyama, Funabashi, Chiba 2748510, Japan.",junji.konuma@sci.toho-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K18615]; Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society [2018-5032]","We thank M.

Moreover, a synecological classification tree, based on the abundance of the taxa present in the macroinvertebrate communities, indicated that the presence of D villosus negatively affected the presence of the Indigenous G pulex When the laboratory experiments and the field observations are combined, it can be concluded that D villosus can seriously affect macroinvertebrate communities in Flanders (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved","[Boets, Pieter; Lock, Koen; Messiaen, Marjolein; Goethals, Peter L.

The planktonic prey organisms were the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia and the copepod Notodiaptomus conifer. The three invertebrate predators were the shrimp Macrobrachium borellii, the crab Trichodactylus borellianus and the larva of the dipteran midge Chaoborus. Feeding experiments were first performed to document the effects of exposure time and prey density on predation. All the selected predators fed on C. dubia and N. conifer, and predation rates were dependent on prey density and exposure time. The ability of microcrustaceans to modify their swimming and avoidance behaviour when faced with cues from each predator was then analysed. The cladoceran was more vulnerable to decapod predation, whereas the prey microcrustaceans were taken equally by the dipteran larvae. The analysis showed that the microcrustaceans detected the presence of at least one invertebrate predator through the predator alarm signals. The cladoceran responded to chemical signals from the three predators but copepods modified their behaviour only in the presence of infochemicals of M. borellii. The different outcomes suggest that macrocrustaceans have different vulnerabilities when faced with the same predator and so have evolved specific and different strategies to reduce invertebrate predation.","[Florencia Gutierrez, Maria; Rojas Molina, Florencia; Carvalho, Debora A.] UNL, CONICET, Inst Nacl Limnol, Lab Plancton, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Rojas Molina, Florencia] Univ Nacl Litoral, Fac Ciencias Med, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina","Gutierrez, MF (corresponding author), UNL, CONICET, Inst Nacl Limnol, Lab Plancton, Ciudad Univ, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina.",fgutierrez@inali.unl.edu.ar,"de Azevedo Carvalho, Debora/AAS-1008-2021","de Azevedo Carvalho, Debora/0000-0001-8278-4416; Gutierrez, Maria Florencia/0000-0003-2644-3339","Agencia Nacional Cientifica y Tdecnologica, FONCYT, PICT [PICT 2011 - 2350]","The authors thank to Prof. Juan Cesar Paggi for his critical lecture and constructive contributions and to Mr. Cristian De Bonis for his technical assistance.

Here we suggest a new, evolutionary, paradox of enrichment. Resource enrichment can lead to more asymmetrical predator-prey coevolution (i.e., extremely high levels of prey defenses against predators) that decreases predator abundances and increases predator extinction risk. A major reason for this is that high resource availability can reduce fitness costs associated with prey defenses. In our experiments with a bacterium and its lytic phage, nutrient-balanced resource enrichment led to patterns in population demography and coevolutionary dynamics consistent with this coevolution-based paradox of enrichment; in particular, phage population extinction events were observed under nutrient-rich, not nutrient-poor, conditions. Consistent with ecological studies, carbon-biased resource enrichment (with carbon availability disproportionately increased relative to other nutrients) did not destabilize dynamics, and the asymmetry of coevolution was not altered in this context. Our work highlights the importance of integrating ecological and evolutionary thinking for studies of the consequences of nutrient pollution and other types of environmental changes.","[Zhang, Quan-Guo] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Quan-Guo] Beijing Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Buckling, Angus] Univ Exeter, ESI, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Buckling, Angus] Univ Exeter, CEC, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England","Zhang, QG (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Zhang, QG (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhangqg@bnu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Quan-Guo/D-5244-2015","Zhang, Quan-Guo/0000-0001-7128-2664; Buckling, Angus/0000-0003-1170-4604","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31222010, 31421063]; 111 projectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B13008]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); AXA research fund; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/J021806/1] Funding Source: researchfish","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31222010 and 31421063) and the 111 project (B13008).

As such mechanisms are costly in terms of energy and time, species living in habitats where predators are rare or absent were expected to show reduced predator responses. Such a reduction was expected for larvae of the native whitefish (Coregonus wartniann) in Upper Lake Constance, as these pass their initial stage in a historically predator-free pelagic habitat and only start to encounter predators in a later ontogenetic stage during which they shift to littoral habitat. However, a recent invader of the pelagic waters of the lake, the three-spined stickle-back (Gasterosteus aculeatus), is implicated in a severe decline in whitefish recruitment through larval predation. The predator-naivety effect and its consequences on predation were experimentally tested by comparing predator defenses of different age classes of whitefish with those of roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), two species whose larvae grow up in a predator-holding habitat. As predator, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) was selected. Sticklebacks actively hunted all prey species but predation was high on whitefish only. The addition of zooplankton (Daphnia) as alternative prey for sticklebacks in the experimental setup did not reduce predation on the whitefish larvae, indicating a clear preference for whitefish in this invasive predator. The escape responses of roach and perch were found to be clearly more complex and diverse to those of the predator-naive whitefish larvae. Particularly striking was that whitefish often did not show any apparent behavioral response to the approaching predator. Only large whitefish larvae (Table 1: length = 40.8 +/- 0.6 mm) appeared capable of escaping predation, and this was correlated with a change in complexity of predator escape responses. Thus, differences in predation pressure for the different larvae species were highly related to the observed interspecific differences in predator defenses, and with the ontogenetic intraspecific change in whitefish from poor and inefficient predator escape responses to complex and more efficient predator escape responses. The evolutionary consequences of stickleback as an invasive predator on whitefish larvae behavior are discussed.","[Ros, Albert; Dunst, Julian; Gugele, Sarah; Brinker, Alexander] LAZBW, Fisheries Res Stn Baden Wurttemberg, Langenargen, Germany","Brinker, A (corresponding author), LAZBW, Fisheries Res Stn Baden Wurttemberg, Langenargen, Germany.",alexander.brinker@lazbw.bwl.de,"Brinker, Alexander/ABF-4644-2020; Ros, Albert FH/I-7726-2015","Brinker, Alexander/0000-0002-2433-5652; Ros, Albert FH/0000-0003-3241-9722","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [298726046/GRK2272]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission [ABH060]; Swiss Confederation and cantons","We thank the Fischbrutanstalt Langenargen and Jasminca Behrmann-Godel of the Institute of Limnology, University of Konstanz (Germany), for their kind donation of fish larvae.

Therefore, ants that are important predators of other ants are likely to play key roles by changing the abundance and impacts of their prey. Familiar arthropod predators, like army ants, are known for their overwhelming raids on invertebrate prey but are limited to mostly tropical systems. Thief ants (Genus: Solenopsis Westwood) are a cosmopolitan group of mostly subterranean ants found in a wide variety of ecosystem types. They are known for their extremely small sizes and their specialized predation where they stealthily tunnel into the nests of other larger ant species to capture and consume only immature ants (larvae and pupae). Predation of ant colonies by other ants, and specialized predatory behaviors of presumed top ant predators (e.g., army ants) are well known. However long-term predation effects, such as across several seasons, are still poorly understood because of a lack of experimental studies. Here we report results of a similar to 1.5-year press field experiment where thief ants were reduced in natural ant communities. Potential impacts, such as predator-release, were quantified by sampling the co-occurring ant community. Compared to control plots, overall worker abundance and biomass increased where thief ants were reduced, and effects varied among ant species. Results suggest predator release as select aboveground foraging ant species increased in abundance and that thief ants may act as significant predators. Because thief ants are abundant and widespread, similar predatory effects may occur in many ant communities, and our understanding of important predators may need to adjust to include thieving species as well as army ants. Thief ants are very abundant, tiny, specialized to consume immature life stages, equipped with powerful venom, eusocial, and subterranean. This suite of adaptive traits seems unique to eusocial predators compared to animals, where thieving predators are usually larger in size compared to their adult-sized prey. Future work quantifying top-down regulation of prey and cascading consumptive and non-consumptive effects will help to understand thief ant predation and potential effects on ecosystem processes.","[Ohyama, Leo; King, Joshua R.; Jenkins, David G.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, 4110 Libra Dr, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Ohyama, L (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, 4110 Libra Dr, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",leoohyama12@gmail.com,,"Ohyama, Leo/0000-0002-1874-2972",,,,71,2,2,3,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2020,101,8,,,,,,,e03084,10.1002/ecy.3084,,MAY 2020,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NA4PQ,WOS:000534334200001,32323300,,,,2021-09-30,

While observational data from systematic camera arrays have informed inferences on the spatiotemporal outcomes of predator-prey interactions, the capacity for observational studies to identify mechanistic drivers of species interactions is limited. Experimental study designs that utilize camera traps uniquely allow for testing hypothesized mechanisms that drive predator and prey behaviour, incorporating environmental realism not possible in the laboratory while benefiting from the distinct capacity of camera traps to generate large datasets from multiple species with minimal observer interference. However, such pairings of camera traps with experimental methods remain underutilized. We review recent advances in the experimental application of camera traps to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying predator-prey ecology and present a conceptual guide for designing experimental camera trap studies. Only 9% of camera trap studies on predator-prey ecology in our review use experimental methods, but the application of experimental approaches is increasing. To illustrate the utility of camera trap-based experiments using a case study, we propose a study design that integrates observational and experimental techniques to test a perennial question in predator-prey ecology: how prey balance foraging and safety, as formalized by the risk allocation hypothesis. We discuss applications of camera trap-based experiments to evaluate the diversity of anthropogenic influences on wildlife communities globally. Finally, we review challenges to conducting experimental camera trap studies. Experimental camera trap studies have already begun to play an important role in understanding the predator-prey ecology of free-living animals, and such methods will become increasingly critical to quantifying drivers of community interactions in a rapidly changing world. We recommend increased application of experimental methods in the study of predator and prey responses to humans, synanthropic and invasive species, and other anthropogenic disturbances.","[Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Hunter, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Hastings Nat Hist Reservat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Keller, Carson B.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Palmer, Meredith S.; Atkins, Justine L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Castaneda, Irene] Sorbonne Univ, MNHN, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, CNRS,UPMC,UMR 7204, Paris, France; [Castaneda, Irene] Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, Ecol Systemat & Evolut, UMR 8079, Orsay, France; [Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Kingsville, TX USA; [Garvey, Patrick M.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Huebner, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Coll Biol Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Morin, Dana J.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Starkville, MS USA; [Teckentrup, Lisa] Univ Potsdam, BioMove Res Training Grp, Potsdam, Germany; [Weterings, Martijn J.

Individual species responses, however, are often highly variable, and such variability can be explained by differences in species ecological traits. To examine this hypothesis, we focused on two co-occurring land snails, Ezohelix gainesi and Euhadra brandtii sapporo; the former is ground-dwelling and the latter is arboreal. We first estimated their population densities at nine sites distributed along an urbanization gradient: three were located in continuous natural forests, three at the edge of natural forests, and the rest in small isolated forests in urban areas. As a result, the ground-dwelling E. gainesi occurred at highest density in urban forests, followed by forest edges and continuous forests. By contrast, the arboreal E. b. sapporo occurred at highest density in continuous forests, but declined in forest edges and urban forests. We then conducted manipulative field experiments to quantify changes in predation pressure on these species. Ground-tethered E. gainesi and E. b. sapporo were repeatedly predated upon by forest-living mammals in continuous forests, but their survival rates increased in forest edges and urban forests. By contrast, canopy-tethered E. b. sapporo maintained high survival rates in all three forest types. The results indicate that a lack of mammalian predators enables ground-dwelling species to occur at high densities in urban forests, whereas the arboreal species was not affected by this predator relaxation effect. The combination of species-specific behavioural traits and changes in predator communities across an urbanization gradient has important effects on the biodiversity of urban ecosystems.","[Saeki, Ikuyo] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan; [Niwa, Shigeru] Japan Wildlife Res Ctr, Sumida Ku, 3-3-7 Kotobashi, Tokyo 1308606, Japan; [Osada, Noriyuki] Meijo Univ, Lab Plant Conservat Sci, Fac Agr, Nagoya, Aichi 4688502, Japan; [Azuma, Wakana] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Hiura, Tsutom] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr, Kita 9 Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan","Saeki, I (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan.",saeki.ikuyo.ge@u.tsukuba.ac.jp,,"Saeki, Ikuyo/0000-0003-3252-6819; Azuma, Wakana/0000-0002-4254-719X; Hiura, Tsutom/0000-0002-6735-1935","Japan Society for Promotion of SciencesMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17 K07270]","We sincerely thank Dr. T.

In the case of cyanobacteria, phages can reduce primary production and infected hosts release intracellular nutrients influencing planktonic food web structure, community dynamics, and biogeochemical cycles. Cyanophages may be of great importance in aquatic food webs during large cyanobacterial blooms unless the host population becomes resistant to phage infection. The consequences on plankton community dynamics of the evolution of phage resistance in bloom forming cyanobacterial populations are still poorly studied. Here, we examined the effect of different frequencies of a phage-resistant genotype within a filamentous nitrogen-fixing Nodularia spumigena population on an experimental plankton community. Three Nodularia populations with different initial frequencies (0%, 5%, and 50%) of phage-resistant genotypes were inoculated in separate treatments with the phage 2AV2, the green alga Chlorella vulgaris, and the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, which formed the experimental plankton community subjected to either nitrogen-limited or nitrogen-rich conditions. We found that the frequency of the phage-resistant Nodularia genotype determined experimental community dynamics. Cyanobacterial populations with a high frequency (50%) of the phage-resistant genotype dominated the cultures despite the presence of phages, retaining most of the intracellular nitrogen in the plankton community. In contrast, populations with low frequencies (0% and 5%) of the phage-resistant genotype were lysed and reduced to extinction by the phage, transferring the intracellular nitrogen held by Nodularia to Chlorella and rotifers, and allowing Chlorella to dominate the communities and rotifers to survive. This study shows that even though phages represent minuscule biomass, they can have key effects on community composition and eco-evolutionary feedbacks in plankton communities.","[Coloma, Sebastian; Sivonen, Kaarina; Hiltunen, Teppo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Microbiol, Viikinkaari 9, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Gaedke, Ursula] Univ Potsdam, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Modelling, Inst Biochem & Biol, Neuen Palais 10, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Hiltunen, Teppo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland","Hiltunen, T (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Microbiol, Viikinkaari 9, Helsinki 00014, Finland.; Hiltunen, T (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland.",teppo.hiltunen@helsinki.fi,,"Sivonen, Kaarina/0000-0002-2904-0458",Nessling Foundation; Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank Lyudmila Saari for technical assistance and providing cyanobacterial cultures, Johannes Cairns for editing the language, and Vanessa Marzets for the intracellular nitrogen measurements and guidance in sample preparation.

The orange-footed sea cucumber Cucumaria frondosa is a slow-moving suspension feeder that is preyed on by the purple sunstar Solaster endeca. The sea cucumber's antipredator behavior involves changing shape and detaching from the substratum, which might increase its probability of being displaced by water motion into an unsuitable environment. We hypothesized that sea cucumbers' antipredator responses would be diminished under stronger hydrodynamic forces, and that behavioral strategies would be flexible so that individuals could adjust to frequent changes in water flows. In a natural orange-footed sea cucumber habitat, individuals lived along a pronounced hydrodynamic gradient, allowing us to measure antipredator behavior under different water flow strengths. We placed purple sunstars in physical contact with sea cucumbers living at various points along the gradient to elicit antipredator responses. We then repeated this procedure in a laboratory mesocosm that generated weak and strong hydrodynamic forces similar to those observed at the field site. Subjects in the mesocosm experiment were tested in both wave conditions to determine if their antipredator behavior would change in response to sudden environmental change, as would be experienced under deteriorating sea conditions. Antipredator responses did not covary with hydrodynamic forces in the field. However, antipredator responses in the mesocosm experiment increased when individuals were transplanted from strong to weak forces and decreased when transplanted from weak to strong forces. Overall, our results indicate environmentally induced plasticity in the antipredator behavior of the orange-footed sea cucumber.","[Brown, Nicholas A.

Such top-down effects seem to be most common in systems with relatively simple food chains, and rarer in species-rich systems where numerous weak interactions among species can buffer strong top-down effects. Seagrass ecosystems are typically species-rich and characterized by complex food webs, but evidence of top-down effects in these systems has been mixed. We examined effects of predatory fishes on the species richness, biomass, density, and composition of the epifaunal community in a shallow seagrass ecosystem of The Bahamas. We used exclusion experiments at two different spatial scales, and applied mesh sizes that excluded different-sized predator individuals. We found some evidence of species-level top-down effects (i.e., strong interactions within a subset of the community), driving higher biomass in at least one decapod mesopredator. In contrast community-level predator effects were rather weak, with predator size and spatial scale of experiments displaying no detectable impact on the overall epifaunal community. Multiple factors may have contributed to these patterns, including high species richness, relatively shallow water depth, small-scale spatial variation in habitat features, and the size and abundance of predators. Because of the rapid global decline of seagrasses and their associated fauna, increased knowledge of predator effects on faunal communities of seagrass beds is critical for long-term conservation efforts.

In addition, M. xanthus altered nematode predatory behavior on basal prey, repelling C. elegans from two-species patches that would be attractive without M. xanthus, an effect similar to that of C. elegans pathogens. The nematode also influenced the behavior of the bacterial predator: M. xanthus increased its predatory swarming rate in response to C. elegans in a manner dependent both on basal-prey identity and on worm density. Our results suggest that M. xanthus is an unattractive prey for some soil nematodes and is actively avoided when other prey are available. Most broadly, we found that nematode and bacterial predators mutually influence one another's predatory behavior, with likely consequences for coevolution within complex microbial food webs.","[Mayrhofer, Nicola; Velicer, Gregory J.; Schaal, Kaitlin A.; Vasse, Marie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Vasse, Marie] MIVEGEC, UMR 5290 CNRS, IRD, UM,CNRS, F-34394 Montpellier, France","Schaal, KA; Vasse, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.; Vasse, M (corresponding author), MIVEGEC, UMR 5290 CNRS, IRD, UM,CNRS, F-34394 Montpellier, France.",nicola.mayrhofer@usys.ethz.ch; gregory.velicer@env.ethz.ch; kaitlin.schaal@env.ethz.ch; contact@marievasse.eu,,,NIH Office of Research Infrastructure ProgramsUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P40 OD010440],"Some strains were provided by the CGC, which is funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440).

Herein, we examined the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) on both prey and predator by letting one predatory reef fish interact for 24 h with eight small or large juvenile damselfishes from four congeneric species. Both prey and predator were exposed to control or elevated levels of CO2. Mortality rate and predator selectivity were compared across CO2 treatments, prey size and species. Small juveniles of all species sustained greater mortality at high CO2 levels, while large recruits were not affected. For large prey, the pattern of prey selectivity by predators was reversed under elevated CO2. Our results demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative consumptive effects of CO2 on small and larger damselfish recruits respectively, resulting from CO2-induced behavioural changes likely mediated by impaired neurological function. This study highlights the complexity of predicting the effects of climate change on coral reef ecosystems.","[Ferrari, Maud C.

Many shorebirds winter in North African Atlantic coastal sites, most likely because these locations provide constant and reliable food supplies with less energy costs in comparison with the wintering sites of northern Europe. Although more information is available for other important southern coastal sites (e.g. Saharan Atlantic coastal desert and Guinean mangroves coast), very little information is available for the North African Atlantic coast. Here, we focus on the impact of shorebird predation on benthic macroinvertebrates in a major wintering site in this area-Sidi Moussa coastal lagoon, Morocco-using an exclosure experiment. For most of the macroinvertebrate species there was no significant effect of the exclusion of shorebird predation. Overall, our results do not show evidence that predation by shorebirds influenced the overall standing biomass of the benthic community. This may indicate that the benthic productivity is high enough to provide constant and reliable food supplies for non-breeding shorebirds.","[Joulami, L.; El Hamoumi, R.] Univ Hassan 2, Fac Sci Ben Msik, Casablanca, Morocco; [Daief, Z.] Univ Hassan 2, Fac Sci Ain Chock, Casablanca, Morocco; [Bazairi, H.] Mohammed V Univ Rabat, Fac Sci, Rabat, Morocco; [Lopes, R.

Predation by feral cats Felis sylvestris catus is one hypothesised cause. Most evidence of cat impacts on native prey comes from islands, where cat densities are often high, but cats typically occur at low densities on mainland Australia. We conducted a field experiment to measure the effect of predation by low-density cat populations on the demography of a native small mammal. We established two 125-ha enclosures in tropical savanna in the Northern Territory. Each enclosure was divided in half, with cats allowed access to one half but not the other. We introduced about 20 individuals of a native rodent, Rattus villosissimus, into each of the four compartments (two enclosuresxtwo predator-access treatments). We monitored rat demography by mark-recapture analysis and radiotracking, and predator incursions by camera surveillance and track and scat searches. Rat populations persisted over the duration of the study (18months) in the predator-proof treatment, where we detected no predator incursions, but declined to extinction in both predator-accessible compartments. In one case, cat incursions were frequently detected and the rat population was rapidly extirpated (<3months); in the other, cat incursions were infrequent, and the population declined more gradually (c. 16months) due to low recruitment. We detected no incursions by dingoes Canis dingo, the other mammalian predator in the area. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to provide direct evidence that cats are capable of extirpating small mammals in a continental setting, in spite of their low population densities. This finding supports the hypothesis that predation by feral cats is contributing to declines of small mammals in northern Australia. The conservation management of native small mammals in northern Australia may require intensive control of cat populations, including large cat-free enclosures.","[Frank, Anke S.

This study experimentally evaluated the ecological effects of the sea slug Pleurobranchaea maculata, a recently introduced invasive predator, on the fouling communities of a cold-temperate port in the South-western Atlantic. The results show that increasing predation pressure reduces significantly the abundance of sea anemones, which are among the preferred prey items. This study reveals new evidence to help better understand the effects of P. maculata on the biological communities of a recently invaded region. Furthermore, it provides the first experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that marine invasive predators can induce a significant decrease in the abundance of native species in benthic communities of cold-temperate marine environments in the South-western Atlantic.","[Battini, Nicolas; Giachetti, Clara B.; Castro, Karen L.; Bortolus, Alejandro; Schwindt, Evangelina] Grp Ecol Ambientes Costeros, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Battini, Nicolas; Giachetti, Clara B.; Castro, Karen L.; Schwindt, Evangelina] Inst Biol Organismos Marinos IBIOMAR CONICET, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Castro, Karen L.] Univ Nacl Comahue, Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Bortolus, Alejandro] Inst Patagon Estudio Ecosistemas Continentales IP, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina","Battini, N (corresponding author), Grp Ecol Ambientes Costeros, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",nicolasbattini@gmail.com,,"Battini, Nicolas/0000-0001-8033-4155; Bortolus, Alejandro/0000-0003-3035-315X; Castro, Karen Lidia/0000-0002-0103-6502",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y TecnicasConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 20130100508]; Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [2016-1083]; PADI Foundation [21773],"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Grant/Award Number: PIP 20130100508; Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant/Award Number: PICT P BID no. 2016-1083; PADI Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 21773",,91,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Providing a general explanation for the evolutionary success of sex has thus proven difficult and resulted in numerous hypotheses. A leading hypothesis suggests that antagonistic species interaction can generate conditions selecting for increased sex due to the production of rare or novel genotypes that are beneficial for rapid adaptation to recurrent environmental change brought on by antagonism. To test this ecology-based hypothesis, we conducted experimental evolution in a predator (rotifer)-prey (algal) system by using continuous cultures to track predator-prey dynamics and in situ rates of sex in the prey over time and within replicated experimental populations. Overall, we found that predator-mediated fluctuating selection for competitive versus defended prey resulted in higher rates of genetic mixing in the prey. More specifically, our results showed that fluctuating population sizes of predator and prey, coupled with a trade-off in the prey, drove the sort of recurrent environmental change that could provide a benefit to sex in the prey, despite inherent costs. We end with a discussion of potential population genetic mechanisms underlying increased selection for sex in this system, based on our application of a general theoretical framework for measuring the effects of sex over time, and interpreting how these effects can lead to inferences about the conditions selecting for or against sexual reproduction in a system with antagonistic species interaction.","[Koch, Hanna R.; Wagner, Sophia; Becks, Lutz] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Community Dynam Grp, D Plon, Germany","Koch, HR (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Community Dynam Grp, D Plon, Germany.",hkoch@evolbio.mpg.de,,"Koch, Hanna/0000-0002-1776-9487",,,,66,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

Biologists have documented such changes for a wide array of predator-prey interactions in a variety of ecosystems; however, the energetic cost of nonconsumptive effects to prey populations has rarely been measured directly. Using a reach-scale manipulation of a naturally-fishless stream, we added chemical cues produced by live Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalisMitchill, 1814) to simulate the presence of trout predation risk, and we quantified the impact of nonconsumptive effects on the secondary production of mayfly prey in the stream. The addition of trout chemical cues reduced the secondary production of larvalBaetismayflies in the treatment reach by 17% compared to an upstream, unmanipulated reference reach. This reduction was driven by smaller body size and earlier emergence of mayflies from the reach with added predator cues. The nonconsumptive effects of a predator can consequently reduce the flux of energy through a dominant stream invertebrate by altering individual life-history and development patterns. Furthermore, quantifying the population-level impact of nonconsumptive effects enables understanding the extent to which these widespread predator effects shape food-web dynamics and ecosystem processes.","[Koch, Benjamin J.; Hall, Robert O., Jr.] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, 1000 East Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Koch, Benjamin J.; Hall, Robert O., Jr.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, 1000 East Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Koch, Benjamin J.; Peckarsky, Barbara L.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, POB 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Peckarsky, Barbara L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, 453 Birge Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Peckarsky, Barbara L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, 453 Birge Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Koch, Benjamin J.] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, POB 5620, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Koch, Benjamin J.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 5620, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Hall, Robert O., Jr.] Univ Montana, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, 32125 Bio Stn Lane, Polson, MT 59860 USA","Koch, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, 1000 East Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.; Koch, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, 1000 East Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.; Koch, BJ (corresponding author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, POB 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.; Koch, BJ (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, POB 5620, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.; Koch, BJ (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 5620, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",ben.koch@nau.edu; bob.hall@flbs.umt.edu; peckarsky@wisc.edu,,,"University of Wyoming's School of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Zoology and Physiology; Program in Ecology through NSF [EPS-0447681]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0516035]; American Museum of Natural History; Colorado Mountain Club Foundation; Sigma Xi Scientific Research Society; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory; Northern Arizona University's Center for Ecosystem Science and Society; Wyoming NASA Space Grant Consortium","We thank S.

Predation risk has been hypothesised to drive the evolution of ARTs, but few empirical studies have examined this. It is unclear whether predators affect fitness of the two sexes directly, by reducing survival, or indirectly, by altering mate searching. In crickets, mate search typically involves acoustic signalling by males and acoustic-mediated movement towards males by silent females. Males and females may however employ ARTs, which includes silent searching by males, and mating without performing phonotaxis in females. We empirically examined effects of increased predation risk on mate searching behaviour and survival of male and female tree crickets, and their effects on mating success, using field-enclosure experiments with tree cricketsOecanthus henryiand their primary predator, green lynx spidersPeucetia viridans. Crickets were allocated into three treatments with different levels of predation risk. Increased predation risk strongly reduced survival, and thereby mating success, for both sexes. With increasing predation risk, males reduced calling and increased movement towards neighbouring callers, with negative effects on mating success. By comparing with simulated random movement, we found that male movement was significantly directed towards other calling males, implying a switch to satellite strategies. Female movement behaviour, however, remained unaltered. Males and females thus differed in their response to comparable levels of predation risk, implying that the role of predation as a driver of alternative mate search strategies is sex-specific.

Facultative sexuality, being able to reproduce both sexually and asexually, has been deemed evolutionary favourable as the benefits of either mode may be fully realized. In fact, many studies have focused on identifying the benefits of sex and/or the forces selecting for increased rates of sex using facultative sexual species. The costs of either mode, however, can also have a profound impact on a population's evolutionary trajectory. Here, we used experimental evolution and fitness assays to investigate the consequences of facultative sexuality in prey adapting to predation. Specifically, we compared the adaptive response of algal prey populations exposed to constant rotifer predation and which had alternating cycles of asexual and sexual reproduction where sexual episodes were either facultative (sexual and asexual progeny simultaneously propagated) or obligate (only sexual progeny propagated). We found that prey populations with facultative sexual episodes reached a lower final relative fitness and suffered a greater trade-off in traits under selection, that is defence and competitive ability, as compared to prey populations with obligate sexual episodes. Our results suggest that costs associated with sexual reproduction (germination time) and asexual reproduction (selection interference) were amplified in the facultative sexual prey populations, leading to a reduction in the net advantage of sexuality. Additionally, we found evidence that the cost of sex was reduced in the obligate sexual prey populations because increased selection for sex was observed via the spontaneous production of sexual cells. These results show that certain costs associated with facultative sexuality can affect an organism's evolutionary trajectory.","[Koch, H.; Becks, L.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Community Dynam Grp, Plon, Germany","Becks, L (corresponding author), August Thienemann Str 2, D-24306 Plon, Germany.",lbecks@evolbio.mpg.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [BE 4135/3-1],The study was funded by German Research Foundation (DFG) to LB (BE 4135/3-1).

While evidence is accumulating for how insects are affected, it is not clear how this impacts higher trophic levels that feed on insect communities. Spiders are important insect predators that have recently been shown to have increased abundance in urban areas, but have shown mixed responses to artificial light. On a single bridge with alternating artificially lit and unlit sections, I measured changes in the orb-weaving spider Larinioides sclopetarius (Araneidae) web abundance, web-building behavior, prey-capture, and body condition. In artificially lit conditions, spiders caught more prey with smaller webs, and had higher body conditions. However, there were fewer spiders with active webs in those lit areas. This suggests that either spiders were not taking advantage of an ecological insect trap, perhaps due to an increased risk of becoming prey themselves, or were satiated, and thus not as active within these habitats. The results from this natural experiment may have important consequences for both insects and spiders in urban areas under artificial lighting conditions.","[Gomes, Dylan G.

Yet, disentangling their roles in life-history evolution in the wild is challenging because (1) the two factors often co-vary across environments, and (2) environmental effects on phenotypes can mask patterns of genotypic evolution. Here, we use the model system of the post-Pleistocene radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) inhabiting blue holes to provide a strong test of the roles of predation and resources in life-history evolution, as the two factors do not co-vary in this system and we attempted to minimize environmental effects by raising eight populations under common laboratory conditions. We tested a priori predictions of predation- and resource-driven evolution in five life-history traits. We found that life-history evolution in Bahamas mosquitofish largely reflected complex interactions in the effects of predation and resource availability. High predation risk has driven the evolution of higher fecundity, smaller offspring size, more frequent reproduction, and slower growth rate-but this predation-driven divergence primarily occurred in environments with relatively high resource availability, and the effects of resources on life-history evolution was generally greater within environments having high predation risk. This implies that resource-driven selection on life histories overrides selection from predators when resources are particularly scarce. While several results matched a priori predictions, with the added nuance of interdependence among selective agents, some did not. For instance, only resource levels, not predation risk, explained evolutionary change in male age at maturity, with more rapid sexual maturation in higher-resource environments. We also found faster (not slower) juvenile growth rates within low-resource and low-predation environments, probably caused by selection in these high-competition scenarios favoring greater growth efficiency. Our approach, using common-garden experiments with a natural system of low- and high-predation populations that span a continuum of resource availability, provides a powerful way to deepen our understanding of life-history evolution. Overall, it appears that life-history evolution in this adaptive radiation has resulted from a complex interplay between predation and resources, underscoring the need for increased attention on more sophisticated interactions among selective agents in driving phenotypic diversification.","[Hulthen, Kaj; Hill, Jacob S.; Jenkins, Matthew R.; Langerhans, Randall Brian] North Carolina State Univ, WM Keck Ctr Behav Biol, Dept Biol Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hulthen, Kaj] Lund Univ, Aquat Ecol Unit, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden","Langerhans, RB (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, WM Keck Ctr Behav Biol, Dept Biol Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",langerhans@ncsu.edu,,,North Carolina State University; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2016-03552]; Helge Ax:son Johnsons Stiftelse; Magnus Bergvalls Stiftelse; Royal Physiographic Society of Lund,"Financial support was provided by the North Carolina State University, the Swedish Research Council (Grant No. 2016-03552), Helge Ax:son Johnsons Stiftelse, Magnus Bergvalls Stiftelse, and the Royal Physiographic Society of Lund.",,104,1,1,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

However, few studies have rigorously tested predictions of IFD models in situations involving multiple species and trophic levels. We fully parameterized and tested predictions of a general interference IFD model for both predators and prey in a tritrophic system: seven-spotted lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Hemiptera: Aphididae), and tic bean plants (Vicia faba L., Fabaceae). We used habitat selection treatments having both predators and prey in the presence and absence of one another. We also performed experiments to quantify the strength of interspecific competition, the functional response of predators and several measures of fitness for the prey. Our results show that whether prey were present or not, predators followed IFD predictions and aggregated most strongly in the patch with the highest-quality resource. Prey in the presence of predators followed the predicted IFD, which was similar to a uniform distribution. However, prey in the absence of predators moved infrequently and were far from ideal free, suggesting that predators instigated habitat selection behaviour. Our results underscore the importance of considering trophic interactions and multiple measures of patch quality in studies of habitat selection. The observed departures from theoretical predictions also usefully suggest promising extensions for future theory and experiments. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Because of its dependence on body size and temperature, escape velocity is fully characterized by three measures, absolute value, size-corrected value, and its response to temperature (thermal sensitivity). The primary target of the selection imposed by predators is poorly understood. We examined predator (dragonfly larva)-imposed selection on prey (newt larvae) body size and characteristics of escape velocity using replicated and controlled predation experiments under seminatural conditions. Specifically, because these species experience a wide range of temperatures throughout their larval phases, we predict that larvae achieving high swimming velocities across temperatures will have a selective advantage over more thermally sensitive individuals. Results: Nonzero selection differentials indicated that predators selected for prey body size and both absolute and size-corrected maximum swimming velocity. Comparison of selection differentials with control confirmed selection only on body size, i.e., dragonfly larvae preferably preyed on small newt larvae. Maximum swimming velocity and its thermal sensitivity showed low group repeatability, which contributed to non-detectable selection on both characteristics of escape performance. Conclusions: In the newt-dragonfly larvae interaction, body size plays a more important role than maximum values and thermal sensitivity of swimming velocity during predator escape. This corroborates the general importance of body size in predator-prey interactions. The absence of an appropriate control in predation experiments may lead to potentially misleading conclusions about the primary target of predator-imposed selection. Insights from predation experiments contribute to our understanding of the link between performance and fitness, and further improve mechanistic models of predator-prey interactions and food web dynamics.","[Gvozdik, Lumir; Smolinsky, Radovan] AS CR, Inst Vertebrate Biol, CZ-60365 Brno, Czech Republic","Gvozdik, L (corresponding author), AS CR, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Kvetna 8, CZ-60365 Brno, Czech Republic.",gvozdik@brno.cas.cz,"Smolinsky, Radovan/F-9730-2014; Gvozdik, Lumir/G-1178-2014","Gvozdik, Lumir/0000-0002-6495-2233","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P506/10/2170, 15-07140S];  [RVO: 68081766]",We thank J.

Despite the importance of this hypothesis for understanding community assembly and ecosystem functioning, the extent to which interaction strength varies across latitude and the effects of this variation on natural communities remain unresolved. Predation in particular is central to ecological and evolutionary dynamics across the globe, yet very few studies explore both community-scale causes and outcomes of predation across latitude. Here we expand beyond prior studies to examine two important components of predation strength: intensity of predation (including multiple dimensions of the predator guild) and impact on prey community biomass and structure, providing one of the most comprehensive examinations of predator-prey interactions across latitude. Using standardized experiments, we tested the hypothesis that predation intensity and impact on prey communities were stronger at lower latitudes. We further assessed prey recruitment to evaluate the potential for this process to mediate predation effects. We used sessile marine invertebrate communities and their fish predators in nearshore environments as a model system, with experiments conducted at 12 sites in four regions spanning the tropics to the subarctic. Our results show clear support for an increase in both predation intensity and impact at lower relative to higher latitudes. The predator guild was more diverse at low latitudes, with higher predation rates, longer interaction durations, and larger predator body sizes, suggesting stronger predation intensity in the tropics. Predation also reduced prey biomass and altered prey composition at low latitudes, with no effects at high latitudes. Although recruitment rates were up to three orders of magnitude higher in the tropics than the subarctic, prey replacement through this process was insufficient to dampen completely the strong impacts of predators in the tropics. Our study provides a novel perspective on the biotic interaction hypothesis, suggesting that multiple components of the predator community likely contribute to predation intensity at low latitudes, with important consequences for the structure of prey communities.","[Freestone, Amy L.; Jurgens, Laura J.; Bonfim, Mariana; Lopez, Diana P.; Repetto, Michele F.; Sewall, Brent J.] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Freestone, Amy L.; Jurgens, Laura J.; Ruiz, Gregory M.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Freestone, Amy L.; Torchin, Mark E.; Jurgens, Laura J.; Schloder, Carmen] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 084303092, Ancon, Panama; [Jurgens, Laura J.] Texas A&M Univ, Marine Biol Dept, Galveston, TX 77553 USA","Freestone, AL (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.; Freestone, AL (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.; Freestone, AL (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 084303092, Ancon, Panama.",amy.freestone@temple.edu,,"Jurgens, Laura/0000-0003-3565-455X; Lopez, Diana/0000-0003-4317-6244","National Science Foundation, Division of Ocean SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1434528]; Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute","We are grateful to G.

Mathematical models are valuable tools to further elucidate those mechanisms and underlying processes. However, obtaining an agreement between model predictions and experimental observations remains a demanding task. As models always abstract from reality one parameter often summarizes several properties. Parameter measurements are performed in additional experiments independent of the ones delivering the time series. Transferring these parameter values to different settings may result in incorrect parametrizations. On top of that, the properties of organisms and thus the respective parameter values may vary considerably. These issues limit the use of a priori model parametrizations. In this study, we present a method suited for a direct estimation of model parameters and their variability from experimental time series data. We combine numerical simulations of a continuous-time dynamical population model with Bayesian inference, using a hierarchical framework that allows for variability of individual parameters. The method is applied to a comprehensive set of time series from a laboratory predator-prey system that features both steady states and cyclic population dynamics. Our model predictions are able to reproduce both steady states and cyclic dynamics of the data. Additionally to the direct estimates of the parameter values, the Bayesian approach also provides their uncertainties. We found that fitting cyclic population dynamics, which contain more information on the process rates than steady states, yields more precise parameter estimates. We detected significant variability among parameters of different time series and identified the variation in the maximum growth rate of the prey as a source for the transition from steady states to cyclic dynamics. By lending more flexibility to the model, our approach facilitates parametrizations and shows more easily which patterns in time series can be explained also by simple models. Applying Bayesian inference and dynamical population models in conjunction may help to quantify the profound variability in organismal properties in nature.","[Rosenbaum, Benjamin] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Rosenbaum, Benjamin] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Jena, Germany; [Raatz, Michael; Weithoff, Guntram; Gaedke, Ursula] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Potsdam, Germany; [Fussmann, Gregor F.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Rosenbaum, B (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany.; Rosenbaum, B (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Jena, Germany.",benjamin.rosenbaum@idiv.de,,"Rosenbaum, Benjamin/0000-0002-2815-0874; Fussmann, Gregor/0000-0001-9576-0122","German Centre for integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118]; German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [1704, WA 2445/11-1, GA 401/26-1]",BR gratefully acknowledges the support of the German Centre for integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig funded by the German Research Foundation (FZT 118).

In common-garden experiments, we exposed populations of two desert rodents to two different viper species, testing their ability to adjust to novel predators that use different hunting strategies. We aimed to understand whether both predators and prey with constraint-breaking adaptations actually manifest comparative advantage over their counterparts. We used convergent species from desert dunes in the Mojave Desert in North America, Merriam's kangaroo rat Dipodomys merriami and the sidewinder rattlesnake Crotalus cerastes, and from the Negev Desert in the Middle East, the greater Egyptian gerbil Gerbillus pyramidum and the Saharan horned viper Cerastes cerastes. Both Mojave species hold constraint-breaking adaptations in relation to their counterparts from the Negev. The rattlesnakes have heat sensing organs (pits) and the kangaroo rats have fur-lined cheek pouches that allow for greater foraging efficiency and food preservation. Using patch-use theory, we evaluated the rodents' risk-assessment from each snake-separately, together and in combination with barn owls. Initially each rodent species foraged less in the presence of its familiar snake, but within a month both foraged less in the presence of the pit-viper (sidewinder). Our findings indicate a level of learning, and behavioural plasticity, in both rodents and ability to assess the risk from novel predators. The kangaroo rats were capable of harvesting far greater amounts of resources under the same conditions of elevated risk.

Measuring these perceived risks from the perspective of the forager can produce a heatmap or their fear in the environments, a so-called landscape of fear (LOF). In an intercontinental comparison of rodents from the Mojave and Negev Deserts, we set to compare families that are used regularly as examples of convergent evolution, heteromyid and gerbilline respectively. Using a LOF spatial-analysis on data collected from common garden experiments in a semi-natural arena we asked: (1) do all four species understand the risk similarly in the exact same physical environment; (2) does relative relation between species affect the way species draw their LOFs, or does the evolutionary niche of a species have a greater impact on its LOF?; and (3) does predator facilitation between vipers and barn owls cause similar changes to the shape of the measured LOFs. For stronger comparative power we mapped the LOF of the rodents under two levels of risk: low risk (snakes only) and high risk (snakes and barn owls). We found concordance in the way all four species assessed risk in the arena. However, the patterns observed in the LOFs of each rodent family were different, and the way the topographic shape of the LOF changed when owls were introduced varied by species. Specifically, gerbils were more sensitive to owl-related risk than snakes and at the opposite correct for heteromyids. Our findings suggest that the community and environment in which a species evolved has a strong impact on the strategies said animals employ. We also conclude, that given the homogenous landscape we provide in our arena and the non- homogenous patterns of LOF maps, risk assessment can be independent of the physical conditions under which the animals find themselves.","[Bleicher, Sonny S.] George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.; Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Dryland & Ecol, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Bleicher, Sonny S.; Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.] Jyvaskylan Yliopisto, Konevesi Res Stn, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Brown, Joel S.] Moffitt Canc Res Ctr, Dept Integrated Math Oncol, Tampa, FL USA","Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Dryland & Ecol, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Beer Sheva, Israel.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Jyvaskylan Yliopisto, Konevesi Res Stn, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",bleichers.s@gmail.com,"Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo/AAE-6272-2020; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Bleicher, Sonny S/0000-0001-8727-5901",USA-Israel Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [BSF-2008163],This project was supported by USA-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF-2008163 to BK and JB).,,63,6,6,1,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Previous studies never considered local adaptation of both predators and prey at different latitudes, and ignored the novel population combinations of the same predatorprey species system that may arise because of northward dispersal. We set up a common garden warming experiment to study predatorprey interactions between Ischnura elegans damselfly predators and Daphnia magna zooplankton prey from three source latitudes spanning >1500km. Damselfly foraging rates showed thermal plasticity and strong latitudinal differences consistent with adaptation to local time constraints. Relative survival was higher at 24 degrees C than at 20 degrees C in southern Daphnia and higher at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C, in northern Daphnia indicating local thermal adaptation of the Daphnia prey. Yet, this thermal advantage disappeared when they were confronted with the damselfly predators of the same latitude, reflecting also a signal of local thermal adaptation in the damselfly predators. Our results further suggest the invasion success of northward moving predators as well as prey to be latitude-specific. We advocate the novel common garden experimental approach using predators and prey obtained from natural temperature gradients spanning the predicted temperature increase in the northern populations as a powerful approach to gain mechanistic insights into how community modules will be affected by global warming. It can be used as a space-for-time substitution to inform how predatorprey interaction may gradually evolve to long-term warming.","[De Block, Marjan; Pauwels, Kevin; Van den Broeck, Maarten; De Meester, Luc; Stoks, Robby] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol Evolut & Conservat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Stoks, R (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Deberiotstr 32, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",robby.stoks@bio.kuleuven.be,"De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015; Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020","De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459","FWOFWO [G.0419.08, G.0610.11]; KU LeuvenKU Leuven [GOA/2008/06, PF/2010/07]","We are grateful to Helen Michels, Viktor Nilsson-Ortman and Karin Rengefors for collecting eggs and to Khuong Dinh Van and Cathy Duvivier for assistance during the experiment.

However, many small-mammal species occur at relatively low and fairly stable densities at temperate latitudes, and our understanding of how complex predator assemblages influence the abundance and dynamics of these species is surprisingly limited. In an intact grassland ecosystem in western Montana, USA, we examined the abundance and dynamics of Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and montane voles (Microtus montanus) on 1-ha plots where we excluded mammalian and avian predators and ungulates, excluded ungulates alone, or allowed predators and ungulates full access. Our goal was to determine whether the relatively low population abundance and moderate population fluctuations of these rodents were due to population suppression by predators. Our predator-exclusion treatment was divided into two phases: a phase where we excluded all predators except weasels (Mustela spp.; 2002-2005), and a phase where all predators including weasels were excluded (2006-2009). Across the entire duration of the experiment, predator and/or ungulate exclusion had no effect on the abundance or overall dynamics of ground squirrels and deer mice. Ground squirrel survival (the only species abundant enough to accurately estimate survival) was also unaffected by our experimental treatments. Prior to weasel exclusion, predators also had no impacts on montane vole abundance or dynamics. However, after weasel exclusion, vole populations reached greater population peaks, and there was greater recruitment of young animals on predator-exclusion plots compared to plots open to predators during peak years. These results suggest that the impacts of predators cannot be generalized across all rodents in an assemblage. Furthermore, they suggest that specialist predators can play an important role in suppressing vole abundance even in lower-latitude vole populations that occur at relatively low densities.","[Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Fletcher, Robert J., Jr.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Maron, JL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,"Fletcher, Robert/0000-0003-1717-5707","National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-35101-16040]; McIntire-Stennis; U.S. Bureau of Land Management","We thank the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for allowing us to conduct experiments on their protected sites.

In turn, variation in species' interactions and densities can alter the strength and direction of trait change. The resulting feedback between species' traits and abundance permits a wide range of community dynamics that would not be expected from ecological theories purely based on species abundances. Despite the theoretical importance of these interrelated processes, unambiguous experimental evidence of how intraspecific trait variation modifies species interactions and population dynamics and how this feeds back to influence trait variation is currently required. We investigate the role of trait-mediated demography in determining community dynamics and examine how ecological interactions influence trait change. We concurrently monitored the dynamics of community abundances and individual traits in an experimental microbial predator-prey-resource system. Using this data, we parameterised a trait-dependent community model to identify key ecologically relevant traits and to link trait dynamics with those of species abundances. Our results provide clear evidence of a feedback between trait change, demographic rates and species dynamics. The inclusion of trait-abundance feedbacks into our population model improved the predictability of ecological dynamics from r(2) of 34% to 57% and confirmed theoretical expectations of density-dependent population growth and species interactions in the system. Additionally, our model revealed that the feedbacks were underpinned by a trade-off between population growth and anti-predatory defence. High predator abundance was linked to a reduction in prey body size. This prey size decrease was associated with a reduction in its rate of consumption by predators and a decrease in its resource consumption. Modelling trait-abundance feedbacks allowed us to pinpoint the underlying life history trade-off which links trait and abundance dynamics. These results show that accounting for trait-abundance feedbacks has the potential to improve understanding and predictability of ecological dynamics.","[Griffiths, Jason I.; Childs, Dylan Z.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Petchey, Owen L.; Pennekamp, Frank] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland","Griffiths, JI (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",jasonigriff@gmail.com,"Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011; Pennekamp, Frank/ABD-3597-2020; Childs, Dylan/P-7388-2018","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633; Pennekamp, Frank/0000-0003-0679-1045; Childs, Dylan/0000-0002-0675-4933","Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/K500914/1, NE/I022027/1]; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [31003A_159498]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [1233106] Funding Source: researchfish","Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/K500914/1 and NE/I022027/1; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 31003A_159498",,87,12,12,4,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

We investigated whether predator-avoidance behaviors by larval long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) in lakes with nonnative trout result in NCEs on morphology and development. Field studies in lakes with and without trout were corroborated by experimental enclosures, where prey were exposed only to visual and chemical cues of predators. We found that salamanders in lakes with trout were consistently smaller than in lakes without trout: 38% lower weight, 24% shorter body length, and 29% shorter tail length. Similarly, salamanders in protective enclosures grew 2.9 times slower when exposed to visual and olfactory trout cues than when no trout cues were present. Salamanders in trout-free lakes and enclosures were 22.7 times and 1.48 times, respectively, more likely to metamorphose during the summer season than those exposed to trout in lakes and/or their cues. Observed changes in larval growth rate and development likely resulted from a facultative response to predator-avoidance behavior and demonstrate NCEs occurred even when predation risk was only perceived. Reduced body size and growth, as well as delayed metamorphosis, could have ecological consequences for salamander populations existing with fish if those effects carry-over into lower recruitment, survival, and fecundity.","[Kenison, Erin K.; Litt, Andrea R.; McMahon, Thomas E.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Pilliod, David S.] US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Boise, ID 83706 USA; [Kenison, Erin K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Kenison, EK (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.; Kenison, EK (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ekenison@purdue.edu,"Pilliod, David/D-1782-2013","Pilliod, David/0000-0003-4207-3518","Montana State University; Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks, Counter Assault; Montana Institute on Ecosystems","This study was funded by Montana State University with additional financial support from Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks, Counter Assault, and Montana Institute on Ecosystems.

In particular, parasites can alter host traits that influence predation risk, and predators can have nonconsumptive effects on prey traits which influence susceptibility (i.e., infection intensity and tolerance) to parasites. Here, we examined the combined effects of trematode parasites (Digenea: Echinostomatidae) and odonate (Anax) predators on the survival of larval green frogs (Rana clamitans). First, in a large-scale mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the presence or absence of parasites in combination with the presence of no predator, caged predators, or free predators, and measured survival, traits, and infection. Parasites, caged predators, and free predators decreased survival, and we found a strong negative synergistic effect of parasites in combination with free predators on survival. Importantly, we then examined the potential mechanisms that explain the observed synergistic effect of parasites and predators in a series of follow-up experiments. Results of the follow-up experiments suggest that increased predation susceptibility due to elevated activity levels in the presence of free-swimming parasite infective stages (i.e., an avoidance response) is the most likely mechanism responsible for the observed synergism. These results suggest a potential trade-off in susceptibility to parasites and predators, which can drive nonadditive effects that may have important consequences for natural enemy interactions in natural populations and amphibian conservation.","[Marino, John A.; Werner, Earl E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Marino, JA (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2010B Kraus Nat Sci Bldg,830 N Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jamarino@umich.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1110137]; University of Michigan Edwin S.

We tested several hypotheses about the evolution of chemical defenses in plant-feeding insects using a meta-analysis. We analyzed the effectiveness (in terms of prey survival; 159 publications) and costs (in terms of reduction in performance due to defense production; 33 publications) of chemical defenses in various prey-predator systems (140 herbivore species and 124 enemy species). The chemical defenses of insect herbivores, on average, were effective against generalist predators, were not effective against specialist predators and generalist parasitoids, and increased the risk of parasitism by specialist parasitoids. The defenses were more effective against vertebrate than against invertebrate predators and most effective against birds. Defensive compounds synthesized de novo and derived from the herbivore's food plants did not differ in the magnitude of their effects. Externalization of chemical defenses enhanced their effects on naive vertebrate predators but simultaneously increased the risk of parasitism. The defenses of specialist herbivores were more effective than those of generalists, mostly due to species that sequestered plant allelochemicals for their own defenses. Advertising of chemical defenses by warning display enhanced their effectiveness only against vertebrate predators. Aposematic colors and patterns were more effective warning signals than other types of conspicuous coloration against both experienced and naive vertebrate predators, suggesting that certain colors and/or patterns were more important than conspicuousness for both learning and innate avoidance. The meta-analysis did not reveal physiological costs of the production of chemical defenses across 22 herbivore species, although the results varied strongly with the method used to measure these costs. We conclude that the cost-benefit trade-offs driving the evolution of chemical defenses in herbivorous insects are affected by ecological costs (i.e., increased susceptibility to parasitoids) more than by costs in terms of resources. Still, a favorable cost-benefit ratio, i.e., great effects for a small expenditure, may partly explain the prevalence of chemical anti-predator defenses in insects.","[Zvereva, Elena L.; Kozlov, Mikhail V.] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland","Zvereva, EL (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland.",elezve@utu.fi,"Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013; Zvereva, Elena L./M-8490-2016","Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244; Zvereva, Elena L./0000-0003-2934-3421",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [268124],"We thank A.

We proposed in a previous study that branching corals like Acropora valida were more susceptible to low temperature stress during, and weakened corals became more vulnerable to corallivorous attack by the snails Drupella spp. In the following spring. Acropora spp., however, are not the most common species found in Hong Kong. In the present study, we examined comparable temperature effects, both low and elevated, on Platygyra acuta, one of the most dominant coral species in Hong Kong. Platygyra acuta fragments were exposed to six temperature levels ranging from 14 degrees C to 32 degrees C for 7 days before they were exposed to prey-choice experiments with Drupella. Results from these experiments indicated that P. acuta fragments were generally tolerant to temperature changes within the range tested. In contrast to those observed for A. valida, they were not found to be attractive to the subsequent Drupella corallivory. The greater tolerance of P. acuta to both these environmental and biological stresses may have contributed to its dominance in Hong Kong coral communities.","[Tsang, Ryan Ho Leung; Ang, Put, Jr.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Marine Sci Lab, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Ang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Marine Sci Lab, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",thlryan.411@gmail.com; aput96229@gmail.com,"Ang, Put/AAO-5490-2021",,Research Grant Council of Hong Kong General Research Fund [14122215],"This study was partly supported by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong General Research Fund No. 14122215, we thank HL Leung, YE Leung, TY Ng and KT Wong for their assistance in the experiments.

One way in which to examine these processes is to study the secondary effects of predator removal on communities. This study examined the role of predatory fishes in structuring communities of coral reef fishes, by using a network of marine reserves (the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park) as a natural experiment. We hypothesized that reefs with high densities of piscivores (marine reserves) would have distinct fish communities from those where piscivores have been depleted through fishing, due to variation in predation pressure. We predicted that predator depletion would result in prey release'', and a corresponding increase in prey densities along a gradient of fishing intensity, causing a change in the community composition of reef fishes. To address this, fish counts and habitat surveys were conducted at four locations on the Great Barrier Reef. At each location, comparisons were made amongst three marine park zones that varied in their exposure to fishing practices; no-take marine reserves, limited fishing areas, and open fishing areas. The density and biomass of predators varied consistently among zones at each location. Furthermore, we found strong evidence for prey release at all four locations, resulting in distinct fish assemblages amongst zones. Reefs open to fishing had much lower densities of piscivores, and higher densities of prey and herbivorous fishes compared to marine reserves. This broad pattern was consistent amongst locations, and persisted at the level of species, trophic groups, families and communities. Habitat characteristics did not vary significantly amongst zones in a consistent manner amongst locations. Although habitat relationships were strong for specialist species such as butterflyfishes, densities of predators were stronger predictors of prey density for most species, and the trophic composition of reef fish communities differed significantly amongst zones at all locations. Results from this study support the concept that top-down effects can be strong divers of prey populations and influence community structure in highly diverse systems. These data emphasize the vital role of predators, and reinforce the importance of preserving and restoring top-down trophic interactions in ecological systems.","[Boaden, A.

We used long-term data from three reference streams (covering 24 stream-years) and 13-year whole-stream organic matter manipulations to investigate the influence of terrestrial detrital quantity and quality on benthic invertebrate community structure, abundance, biomass, and secondary production in rockface (RF) and mixed substrates (MS) of forested headwater streams. Using a mesh canopy covering the entire treatment stream, we examined effects of litter exclusion, small-and large-wood removal, and addition of artificial wood (PVC) and leaves of varying quality on organic matter standing crops and invertebrate community structure and function. We assessed differences in functional feeding group distribution between substrate types as influenced by organic matter manipulations and long-term patterns of predator and prey production in manipulated vs. reference years. Particulate organic matter standing crops in MS of the treatment stream declined drastically with each successive year of litter exclusion, approaching zero after three years. Monthly invertebrate biomass and annual secondary production was positively related to benthic organic matter in the MS habitats. Rockface habitats exhibited fewer changes than MS habitats across all organic matter manipulations. With leaf addition, the patterns of functional group distribution among MS and RF habitats returned to patterns seen in reference streams. Secondary production per unit organic matter standing crop was greatest for the leaf addition period, followed by the reference streams, and significantly less for the litter exclusion and wood removal periods. These data indicate that the limited organic matter remaining in the stream following litter exclusion and wood removal was more refractory than that in the reference streams, whereas the added leaf material was more labile and readily converted into invertebrate production. Predator production and total production were tightly coupled in reference and treatment streams, indicating strong relationships between predators and their prey. Results from the artificial wood addition demonstrate that physical structure alone will not restore invertebrate productivity without detrital resources from the riparian forest. Our long-term studies conducted over three decades at the ecosystem scale unequivocally show the necessity of maintaining and restoring aquatic-terrestrial linkages in forested headwater streams.","[Wallace, J.

These indirect effects can ramify through a community and affect many species, including some that may not have been directly affected by the perturbation. Identifying these chains of indirect effects is difficult, and most studies only follow indirect effects across two or three species. Here, we use a factorial field experiment to demonstrate that precipitation affects spotted aphids through a complex chain of indirect interactions that are mediated by other herbivores and a generalist predator. We experimentally simulated drought, which reduced water content in alfalfa plants. While water stress in alfalfa had no direct effect on spotted aphids, it lowered the population growth rate of pea aphids, another common alfalfa pest. Because ladybeetle predators were attracted to high pea aphid densities, predator densities were lower in drought treatments. Consequently, spotted aphid densities were released from top-down control (apparent competition) in drought treatments and reached densities three times higher than spotted aphids in ambient treatments with high pea aphid densities. Thus, drought affected spotted aphids in the interaction chain: drought alfalfa pea aphids predators spotted aphids. This result illustrates the lengthy path that indirect effects of climate change may take through a community, as well as the importance of community-level experiments in determining the net effect of climate change.","[Barton, Brandon T.; Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Barton, BT (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 430 Lincoln Dr,Birge Hall,Room 460, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",btbarton@wisc.edu,,,US-NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1240804]; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2007-35302-18266],"We thank N.

In the case of climate change, many species may be affected directly and subsequently initiate numerous indirect effects that propagate throughout the community. Therefore, the net effect of climate change on any one species is a function of the direct and indirect effects. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of climate warming on corn leaf aphids, a pest of corn and other grasses, by performing an experimental manipulation of temperature, predators, and two common aphid-tending ants. Although warming had a positive direct effect on aphid population growth rate, warming reduced aphid abundance when ants and predators were present. This occurred because winter ants, which aggressively defend aphids from predators under control temperatures, were less aggressive toward predators and less abundant when temperatures were increased. In contrast, warming increased the abundance of cornfield ants, but they did not protect aphids from predators with the same vigor as winter ants. Thus, warming broke down the ant-aphid mutualism and counterintuitively reduced the abundance of this agricultural pest.","[Barton, Brandon T.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Barton, BT (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",btbarton@wisc.edu,,,UW-Madison Graduate School;  [NSF-DEB-Dimensions 1240804],"We thank J.
