Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo) has been shown to accumulate high concentrations of DDE and was proposed for phytoremediation of contaminated soils. We performed a field trial covering a full plant life cycle. C. pepo plants inoculated with the plant growth-promoting endophytic strains Sphingomonas taxi UH1, Methylobacterium radiotolerans UH1, Enterobacter aerogenes UH1, or a consortium combining these 3 strains were grown on a DDE-contaminated field for 100 days. The effects of these inoculations were examined at both the plant level, by evaluating plant weight and plant DDE-content, and at the level of the cultivable and total endophytic communities. Inoculating plants with S. taxi UH1, M. radiotolerans UH1, and the consortium increased plant weight. No significant effects of the inoculations were observed on DDE-concentrations in plant tissues. However, the amount of DDE accumulated by C. pepo plants per growing season was significantly higher for plants that were inoculated with the consortium of the 3 strains. Therefore, inoculation of C. pepo with DDE-degrading endophytes might be promising for phytoremediation applications.","[Eevers, N.; Vangronsveld, J.; Weyens, N.] Hasselt Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Agoralaan Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Hawthorne, J.

A total of 70 bacterial isolates were characterized by both biochemical and molecular identification methods. Taxonomic classification showed dominance of three major phyla, viz, Firmicutes (57.1%), Actinobacteria (20.0%) and Proteobacteria (22.8%). Screening for in vitro plant growth-promoting activities revealed a hitherto unreported endophytic bacterium from wild rice germplasm, Microbacterium laevaniformans RS0111 with highest indole acetic acid (28.39 +/- 1.39 mu g/ml) and gibberellic acid (67.23 +/- 1.83 mu g/ml) producing efficiency. Few other endophytic isolates from cultivated rice germplasm such as Bacillus tequilensis RHS01 showed highest phosphate solubilizing activity (81.70 +/- 1.98 mu g/ml), while Microbacterium testaceum MKLS01 and Microbacterium enclense MI03 L05 showed highest potassium (53.42 +/- 0.75 mu g/ml) and zinc solubilizing activity (157.50%). Fictibacillus aquaticus LP20 05 produced highest siderophore (64.8%). In vivo evaluation of plant growth-promoting efficiencies of the isolates showed that Microbacterium laevaniformans RS0111, Microbacterium testaceum MKLS01 and Bacillus tequilensis RHS 01 could increase rice grain yield by 3.4-fold when compared to the control group. This study indicates the potentiality of rice endophytes isolates as an effective bioinoculants.","[Borah, Madhusmita; Das, Saurav; Boro, Robin Chandra; Barooah, Madhumita] Assam Agr Univ, Dept Agr Biotechnol, Jorhat, Assam, India; [Bora, Sudipta Sankar; Barooah, Madhumita] Assam Agr Univ, DBT North East Ctr Agr Biotechnol DBT NECAB, Jorhat, Assam, India","Barooah, M (corresponding author), Assam Agr Univ, Dept Agr Biotechnol, Jorhat, Assam, India.; Barooah, M (corresponding author), Assam Agr Univ, DBT North East Ctr Agr Biotechnol DBT NECAB, Jorhat, Assam, India.",madhumita.barooah@aau.ac.in,"Das, Saurav/AAC-8299-2021","Das, Saurav/0000-0002-1239-6271; Barooah, Madhumita/0000-0002-3768-5336","Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India (DBT, GoI), through the project entitled Endophyte diversity in wild versus cultivated rice across the environmental gradients in North East India [BT/PR15208/AGR/21/332/2011]","This study was funded by the Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India (DBT, GoI), through the project entitled Endophyte diversity in wild versus cultivated rice across the environmental gradients in North East India (BT/PR15208/AGR/21/332/2011).",,91,0,0,3,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0302-8933,1432-072X,,ARCH MICROBIOL,Arch.

In this study, greenhouse and field trials were carried out using individual endophytic Pseudomonas fluorescens strains, the well characterized rhizospheric P. fluorescens F113 and an endophytic microbial consortium of 10 different strains. These bacteria had been previously characterized with respect to their PGP properties in vitro and had been shown to harbor a range of traits associated with PGP including siderophore production, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase activity, and inorganic phosphate solubilization. In greenhouse experiments individual strains tagged with gfp and Km(r) were applied to Brassica napus as a seed coat and were shown to effectively colonize the rhizosphere and root of B. napus and in addition they demonstrated a significant increase in plant biomass compared with the non-inoculated control. In the field experiment, the bacteria (individual and consortium) were spray inoculated to winter oilseed rape B. napus var. Compass which was grown under standard North Western European agronomic conditions. Analysis of the data provides evidence that the application of the live bacterial biofertilizers can enhance aspects of crop development in B. napus at field scale. The field data demonstrated statistically significant increases in crop height, stem/leaf, and pod biomass, particularly, in the case of the consortium inoculated treatment. However, although seed and oil yield were increased in the field in response to inoculation, these data were not statistically significant under the experimental conditions tested. Future field trials will investigate the effectiveness of the inoculants under different agronomic conditions.","[Lally, Richard D.; Galbally, Paul; Moreira, Antonio S.; Ryan, David; Germaine, Kieran J.; Dowling, David N.] Inst Technol, Dargan Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Sci & Hlth, EnviroCORE, Carlow, Carlow, Ireland; [Galbally, Paul; Spink, John] TEAGASC, Oak Pk Crops Res Ctr, Carlow, Ireland; [Moreira, Antonio S.] Dundalk Inst Technol, Dundalk, Ireland","Dowling, DN (corresponding author), Inst Technol, Dargan Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Sci & Hlth, EnviroCORE, Carlow, Carlow, Ireland.",david.dowling@itcarlow.ie,"Germaine, Kieran/T-8842-2019","Ryan, David/0000-0002-9655-2373; Germaine, Kieran/0000-0003-4026-3414","Science Foundation Ireland Technology Innovation Development Award (SFI)Science Foundation Ireland [11/TIDA/B2018]; Institutes of Technology Ireland (IoTI); Institute of Technology Carlow (ITC); Irish Research Council (IRC)Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology","The authors would like to acknowledge the Science Foundation Ireland Technology Innovation Development Award (SFI, 11/TIDA/B2018), Institutes of Technology Ireland (IoTI) and the Institute of Technology Carlow (ITC), and Irish Research Council (IRC) postgraduate scholarship (to RL) funding to support this research in part.",,61,28,29,2,27,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

In the present study, the feeding performance of larvae, post treatment with the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium robertsii and Isaria fumosorosea, was first evaluated in laboratory experiments. The efficacy of the three entomopathogens in protecting the sorghum from its pest was then examined in a tritrophic field experiment in a farm, under natural conditions. The fungi, efficiently induced the mortality of larvae and reduced their relative growth rate (RGR), with the virulence of I. fumosorosea being relatively higher (90-93%). The feeding performance of larvae was significantly affected by the three entomopathogens. Reduced food consumption (39-64%), relative food consumption rate (15-38%) and the feces produced (48-81%) compared to untreated larvae, resulted in slight changes of digestibility. The weight of treated larvae remained almost unchanged while ECD and ECI increased in infected larvae compared to control. The infected larvae were also sluggish and static, and unwieldy on the food surface. The impact of infection should be rather attributed to their altered behaviour than to disturbed digestion. The tritrophic field experiment confirmed the efficacy of entomopathogens which were experimentally introduced into the plants as endophytes, against larvae of S. nonagrioides under natural conditions. In fact, they reduced infestation by 20-30% and the tunnelling length by 19-43%, and increased larval mortality by 57-82%, without affecting sorghum growth. Consequently, the three fungi could be used for the control of S. nonagrioides in sorghum crops, at least in areas with a Mediterranean-like climate.","[Mantzoukas, Spiridon; Grammatikopoulos, George] Univ Patras, Dept Biol, Lab Plant Physiol, Patras 26504, Greece","Grammatikopoulos, G (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Biol, Lab Plant Physiol, Patras 26504, Greece.",grammati@upatras.gr,,,,,,33,6,6,2,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0261-2194,1873-6904,,CROP PROT,Crop Prot.,JAN,2020,127,,,,,,,,104952,10.1016/j.cropro.2019.104952,,,7,Agronomy,Agriculture,JQ1YW,WOS:000498749700012,,,,,2021-09-30,

Thus, microbes are of interest to agricultural research. In this study, we used vertically transmitted Epichloe species because these fungal endophytes of grasses produce alkaloids that have been shown to protect the host from herbivory. Depending on the amount, type, and profile of alkaloids, Epichloe species can promote the host's defense against invertebrate or vertebrate herbivores. Here, we used Festuca rubra colonized by Epichloe festucae from wild populations of different geographic origins in a reciprocal transplant experiment at three locations across Europe. We sought to determine whether genetic differences among Epichloe-colonized plants from different origins or phenotypic plasticity explained variations in alkaloid content and whether the alkaloid content was correlated with the growth and reproduction of the plants colonized by Epichloe. We found that the geographic origin of the Epichloe-colonized genotypes explained differences in ergovaline and peramine production. The ergovaline content also indicated chemotypic plasticity, as profiles changed when transplanted to a new environment, while the concentration of peramine was constant among the transplantation sites. The lack of a strong correlation between alkaloid content and plant performance (number of reproductive stems and total biomass) indicated that the costs of alkaloid production were too low to have consequences for fitness in terms of those parameters. Our findings emphasize the importance of estimating the fungal alkaloid content in multiple field environments in order to determine its potential toxicity and value for breeding programs that are aimed at the improvement of turfgrass and forage cultivars.

GTDs are responsible for considerable loss of quality, production, and vineyard longevity. Seventy-five percent of Chilean vineyards are estimated to be affected by GTDs. GTDs are complex diseases caused by several fungi species, including members of the Botryosphaeriaceae family and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, considered some of the most important causal agents for these diseases in Chile. In this study, we isolated 169 endophytic and 209 rhizospheric fungi from grapevines grown under organic and conventional farming in Chile. Multiple isolates of Chaetomium sp., Cladosporium sp., Clonostachys rosea, Epicoccum nigrum, Purpureocillium lilacinum, and Trichoderma sp. were evaluated for their potential of biocontrol activity against Diplodia seriata, Neofusicoccum parvum, and Pa. chlamydospora. Tests of antagonism were carried out using two dual-culture-plate methods with multiple media types, including agar containing grapevine wood extract to simulate in planta nutrient conditions. Significant pathogen growth inhibition was observed by all isolates tested. Clonostachys rosea showed 98.2% inhibition of all pathogens in the presence of grapevine wood extract. We observed 100% pathogen growth inhibition when autoclaved lignified grapevine shoots were pre-inoculated with either C. rosea strains or Trichoderma sp.

Altitudinal gradient studies and warming experiments can both increase understanding of climate effects on species interactions, but few studies have used both together to improve predictions. We examined whether plant-fungal symbioses responded similarly to altitude and 23 yr of experimental warming. Root- and leaf-associated fungi, which can mediate plants' climate sensitivity, responded divergently to elevation vs. warming. Fungal colonization, diversity, and composition varied with altitude, but climate variables were generally weak predictors; other factors such as host plant identity, plant community composition, or edaphic variables likely drive fungal altitudinal distributions. Manipulated warming altered fungal colonization, but not composition or diversity. Leaf symbionts were more sensitive to climate and experimental warming than root symbionts. Altitudinal patterns and responses to warming differed among host plant species and fungal groups, indicating that predicting climate effects on symbioses will require tracking both host and symbiont identities. Combining experimental and observational methods can yield valuable insight into how climate change may alter plant-symbiont interactions, but our results indicate that altitude does not always serve as an adequate proxy for warming effects on fungal symbionts of plants.","[Kazenel, Melanie R.; Kivlin, Stephanie N.; Taylor, D.

Although the rules governing root microbiota assembly have been investigated and the importance of abiotic determinants highlighted, the consequences of the biotic context of the plant community have often been overlooked. We tested the hypothesis that the abundance of species in a given plant neighborhood could leave a fingerprint on its root-endophytic fungal community, ultimately impacting its biomass. Outdoor experimental mesocosms, comprising a range of floristic compositions and spatially mapped plant distributions, were monitored for 2y. Medicago truncatula was used as trap-plant and grown under standardized conditions on soil samples collected in the mesocosms. The root-endophytic fungal community of M. truncatula was described by amplicon mass sequencing and M. truncatula performance was also assessed. The richness and evenness of M. truncatula's root-endophytic fungal community were explained by the small-scale plant neighborhood of the soil samples. For instance, the occurrence of Brachypodium pinnatum in the neighborhood induced higher and lower richness of Sordariomycetes and Glomeromycetes, respectively, whereas Holcus mollis decreased the OTU evenness of the entire mycobiota. These changes in fungal Glade OTU richness and evenness were related to modifications in the biomass of M. truncatula. These results indicate that a given plant endophytic fungal community is determined in part by the neighboring plants. Considering that changes in endophytic fungal community are correlated with the plant biomass, this suggests that plant-plant interactions (i.e. competition, facilitation) impacting plant biomass can be mediated by endophytic fungal community changes.

However, it is unclear whether community-scale endophyte effects arise due to the endophyte itself or as a result of unique, endophyte-host interactions. We used a long-term field experiment to test whether common-toxic (CT) and non-ergot alkaloid-producing (novel) endophytes in Schedonorus arundinaceus (tall fescue) forage cultivars consistently affect communities across tall fescue hosts. Tilled plots (2 x 2 m; Guelph, ON) were seeded with Georgia 5 and Jesup cultivars containing either the CT or AR542 (novel) endophyte and allowed to be re-colonized by plant species from the local propagule pool. Non-seeded control plots were included to assess effects of seeding the non-native grass. We assessed plant, invertebrate, soil moisture, and soil nutrient responses to the endophyte-cultivar treatments after four growing seasons. Seeding tall fescue affected plant species abundances, but not richness, and did not consistently alter soil moisture and nutrient pools. Endophyte identity in the tall fescue cultivars affected the communities, but effects were not consistent between cultivars. Within Georgia 5, the AR542 endophyte reduced tall fescue abundance and altered the invertebrate community relative to CT plots. Within Jesup, the AR542 endophyte reduced species evenness and decreased soil moisture during dry periods relative to CT plots. Endophyte effects were not consistent between cultivars, and it is probable that the community-scale effects of endophyte infection in tall fescue cultivars arise due to unique interactions between cultivar and endophyte.","[Yurkonis, Kathryn A.] Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA; [Shukla, Kruti; Holdenried, Jessica; Hager, Heather A.; Bolton, Kim A.; Newman, Jonathan A.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Klironomos, John N.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Maherali, Hafiz] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Newman, JA (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jnewma01@uoguelph.ca,"Newman, Jonathan/A-5932-2008; Hager, Heather/A-2984-2014","Newman, Jonathan/0000-0003-3155-4084; Hager, Heather/0000-0002-0066-6844","Canadian Natural Science and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; Canada Foundation for Innovation/Ontario Innovation TrustCanada Foundation for Innovation; North Dakota Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research","P.

Truly effective defences against herbivores may require normal functioning of the plant, as excised leaves may be less resistant as compared with those still attached to the plant. Yet, most studies investigating possible effects of endophytes in conferring host resistance to herbivores have been conducted with plant parts rather than intact plants. 3. Using the root endophytic fungus (Acremonium strictum)-broad bean (Vicia faba)-generalist herbivore (Helicoverpa armigera) model, we conducted experiments to examine whether endophyte effects on herbivory would depend on the experimental setting used in the investigation and whether they would translate into a subsequent generation of the herbivore. 4. Acremonium strictum negative effects on the fitness of H. armigera first generation were more evident when the larvae foraged freely on inoculated intact whole plants than when offered leaf discs of inoculated plants. Furthermore, these effects were carried over into H. armigera second generation reared on an artificial diet. 5. Acremonium strictum could not be re-isolated from V. faba leaves; hence direct contact between the endophyte and the insect could be excluded. Alternatively, loss of volatiles or inhibitory effects of compounds that were stronger in situ might have caused changes in larval feeding and performance on leaf discs as compared with intact plants, regardless of infection status. 6. We suggest that the reduction in fitness parameters of H. armigera across two generations is caused indirectly via an endophyte-triggered reduction in plant quality.","[Jaber, Lara R.; Vidal, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Sect Agr Entomol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Jaber, LR (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Sect Agr Entomol, Grisebachstr 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",Lara.Jaber-1@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Vidal, Stefan/AAC-3130-2020","Vidal, Stefan/0000-0002-1673-4055",Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"We would like to thank Dereje Dugassa-Gobena for help with handling H. armigera and Ronald Kuhne for statistical advice.

Based on a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment in southeast China, we evaluated the impacts of root-associated soil fungi on plant total, above- and belowground biomass production in monocultures and in different 2- and 4-tree species mixtures using two pools of four subtropical tree species each. All plots were inoculated with forest soil but half of the plots were additionally treated with fungicide to suppress fungi. Tree species richness promoted individual biomass only in control but not in fungicide-treated soils, leading to positive relative yield totals (RYTs, sum of the relative growth of each tree species in mixture to monoculture) of mixed species plots in control soils. Additive partitioning analysis showed that the net biodiversity effects were due to positive complementarity effects (CE) rather than selection effects. The relative yield of individual tree species was positively correlated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization for AM trees but not significantly correlated with ectomycorrhizal (EM) colonization for EM trees. The molecular analysis of the root-associated fungi showed that larger RYT and CE values were correlated with greater dissimilarity in pathogenic fungal communities between tree species, suggesting distinct pathogen compositions will result in overyielding and high complementarity in mixture.","[Yang, Bo; Liang, Yu; Li, Yangfan; He, Ling; Tian, Qiuyang; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Schmid, Bernhard; Baruffol, Martin; Salmon, Yann; Niklaus, Pascal A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Yang, Bo] Jingdezhen Univ, Key Lab Plant Resources & Biodivers Jiangxi Prov, 838 Cidu Ave, Jingdezhen 333000, Peoples R China","Liang, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",coolrain@ibcas.ac.cn,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31000000]; National Key Research and Development Project of China [2017YFA0605103]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31170495, 30710103907]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [SNSF 147092]; Sino-Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation Joint Research Program [IZL CZ3 123883]; German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG FOR 891-SCHM 1628/2-1]","We are grateful to our partners Sabine Both, Anne Lang, Xueqin Zeng, Stefan Trogisch, Mo Gao, and Xuefei Yang for help in setting up the experiment and to Zaogen Cheng and Guodong Qi for help with field work.

However, whether preceding crops have a legacy effect on the AM fungi of the subsequent crop is poorly known. We set up an outdoor mesocosm crop rotation experiment that consisted of a first phase growing either one of four pre-crops establishing AM and/or rhizobial symbiosis or not (spring barley, faba bean, lupine, canola), followed by an AM crop, winter barley. After the pre-crop harvest, carbon-rich organic substrates were applied to test whether it attenuated, accentuated or modified the effect of pre-crops. The pre-crop mycorrhizal status, but not its rhizobial status, affected the richness and composition of AM fungi, and this difference, in particular community composition, persisted and increased in the roots of winter barley. The effect of a pre-crop was driven by its single symbiotic group, not its mixed symbiotic group and/or by a crop-species-specific effect. This demonstrates that the pre-crop symbiotic group has lasting legacy effects on the AM fungal communities and may steer the AM fungal community succession across rotation phases. This effect was accentuated by sawdust amendment, but not wheat straw. Based on the previous observation of decreased crop yield after AM pre-crops, our findings suggest negative PSF at the level of the plant symbiotic group driven by a legacy effect of crop rotation history on AM fungal communities, and that a focus on crop symbiotic group offers additional understanding of PSF.","[Roy, Julien; Leifheit, Eva F.; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Roy, Julien; Leifheit, Eva F.; Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [van Duijnen, Richard; Temperton, Vicky M.] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Luneburg, Germany; [Mbedi, Susan] Nat Kundemuseum Berlin, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Mbedi, Susan] Berlin Ctr Genom Biodivers Res, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Roy, J (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Roy, J (corresponding author), Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",roy.julien@live.fr,,"Roy, Julien/0000-0003-2964-1314",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) initiative 'BonaRes-Soil as a sustainable resource for the bioeconomy' through the project INPLAMINTFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [031B0508B]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [LE 3859/1-1]; RISE programme; DAADAIESTE programme,"This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) initiative 'BonaRes-Soil as a sustainable resource for the bioeconomy' through the project INPLAMINT (grant number: 031B0508B).

Using cycles of in planta and in vitro evolution, we experimentally simulated lifestyles where rhizobia repeatedly interact with novel plant genotypes with which they initially provide negligible benefits. Using a full-factorial replicated design, we independently evolved two rhizobia strains in associations with each of two Lotus japonicus genotypes that vary in regulation of nodule formation. We evaluated phenotypic evolution of rhizobia by quantifying fitness, growth effects and histological features on hosts, and molecular evolution via genome resequencing. Rhizobia evolved enhanced host benefits and caused changes in nodule development in one of the four host-symbiont combinations, that appeared to be driven by reduced costs during symbiosis, rather than increased nitrogen fixation. Descendant populations included genetic changes that could alter rhizobial infection or proliferation in host tissues, but lack of evidence for fixation of these mutations weakens the results. Evolution of enhanced rhizobial benefits occurred only in a subset of experiments, suggesting a role for host-symbiont genotype interactions in mediating the evolution of enhanced benefits from symbionts.","[Quides, Kenjiro W.; Trinh, Jerry; Salaheldine, Fathi; Cardenas, Paola; Lee, Hsu-Han; Jariwala, Ruchi; Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Microbiol & Plant Pathol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Weisberg, Alexandra J.; Chang, Jeff H.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Sachs, JL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.; Sachs, JL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Microbiol & Plant Pathol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.; Sachs, JL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",joels@ucr.edu,,"Weisberg, Alexandra/0000-0002-0045-1368","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1738009, DEB-1738028]; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [CA-R-EEOB-5200-H]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no.

However, our knowledge on how different mycorrhizal types interact with each other is still limited. We asked whether the combination of hosts with a preferred association with either AM or EM fungi increases the host tree roots' mycorrhization rate and affects AM and EM fungal richness and community composition. We established a tree diversity experiment, where five tree species of each of the two mycorrhiza types were planted in monocultures, two-species and four-species mixtures. We applied morphological assessment to estimate mycorrhization rates and next-generation molecular sequencing to quantify mycobiont richness. Both the morphological and molecular assessment revealed dual-mycorrhizal colonization in 79% and 100% of the samples, respectively. OTU community composition strongly differed between AM and EM trees. While host tree species richness did not affect mycorrhization rates, we observed significant effects of mixing AM- and EM-associated hosts in AM mycorrhization rate. Glomeromycota richness was larger in monotypic AM tree combinations than in AM-EM mixtures, pointing to a dilution or suppression effect of AM by EM trees. We found a strong match between morphological quantification of AM mycorrhization rate and Glomeromycota richness. Synthesis. We provide evidence that the combination of hosts differing in their preferred mycorrhiza association affects the host's fungal community composition, thus revealing important biotic interactions among trees and their associated fungi.","[Heklau, Heike; Schindler, Nicole; Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Buscot, Francois; Salcedo, Luis D.

In particular, no research has been done on the significance of root-derived resources for nematode communities in boreal forests. In two spruce stands in the taiga zone, we set up a field experiment in which girdling of spruce trees and clipping of dwarf shrubs was performed. Root-derived resources were hypothesized to be highly important; accordingly, we expected to observe a suppression of the nematode community after experimental manipulations. To obtain information on the nature of changes in the soil food web, nematode community structure indices were applied. In partial confirmation of our hypothesis, spruce girdling decreased mycorrhizal hyphae biomass as assessed via in-growth mesh bags, as well as the abundance of fungivorous nematodes, mostly of the Aphelenchoides and Filenchus genera. The enrichment index (EI) value decreased, indicating reduction of organic matter inputs into the soil food web, whereas nematode channel ratio (NCR) index value increased, indicating a shift towards domination of the bacterial energy channel. Total nematode abundance, genera richness, and abundance of herbivores, omnivores, and predators did not change in response to spruce girdling. Clipping of dwarf shrubs decreased fungal and bacterial PLFA biomarkers, but did not affect nematode communities. Thus, the resources channeled in soil by the mots of canopy trees are of different relative importance for nematodes having different tmphic habits. Fungivorous nematodes are at least partly dependent on root-derived resources, suggesting feeding on ectomycorrhizal mycelium. Rhizodeposits of understory vegetation are likely of low importance for nematodes.","[Kudrin, Alexey A.; Taskaeva, Anastasia A.; Konakova, Tatiana N.; Kolesnikova, Alla A.; Gruzdev, Ivan, V; Gabov, Dmitriy N.; Yakovleva, Evgenia, V] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Biol, Komi Sci Ctr, Ural Branch, Kommunist Skaja 28, Syktyvkar 167000, Russia; [Zuev, Andrey G.; Tiunov, Alexei, V] Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Leninsky Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia","Kudrin, AA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Biol, Komi Sci Ctr, Ural Branch, Kommunist Skaja 28, Syktyvkar 167000, Russia.",kudrin@ib.komisc.ru,"Tiunov, Alexei V./F-7771-2013","Tiunov, Alexei V./0000-0003-2400-3559","Institute of Biology FRC Komi SC UB RAS [AAAA-A17117112850235-2]; Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [20-04-00606, 20-34-90088]","This work was carried out within the state assignment of the Institute of Biology FRC Komi SC UB RAS (Project No AAAA-A17117112850235-2), and supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Project No. 20-04-00606).

A recurring pattern of pollinator shifts from hummingbird to hawkmoth pollination has characterized plant speciation in many western North American plant taxa, but in the genus Mimulus (monkeyflowers) section Erythranthe the evolution of hawkmoth pollination from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors has not occurred. We manipulated two flower color loci and tested the attractiveness of the resulting four color phenotypes (red, yellow, pink, and white) to naive hawkmoths (Manduca sexta). Hawkmoths strongly prefer derived colors (yellow, pink, white) over the ancestral red when choosing an initial flower to visit, and generally preferred derived colors when total visits and total visit time were considered, with no hawkmoth preferring ancestral red over derived colors. The simple flower color genetics underlying this innate pollinator preference suggests a potential path for speciation into an unfilled hawkmoth-pollinated niche in Mimulus section Erythranthe, and the deliberate design of a hawkmoth-pollinated flower demonstrates a new, predictive method for studying pollination syndrome evolution.","[Byers, Kelsey J.

This pattern has been observed in many plant species, but comparably few have sought to disentangle underlying mechanisms. Here, in a diverse lineage of Neotropical plants (Ruellia; Acanthaceae), we present evidence of reproductive character displacement in a macroevolutionary framework (i.e., among species) and document mechanistic underpinnings. In a series of interspecific hand pollinations in a controlled glasshouse environment, we found that crosses between species that differed more in overall flower size, particularly in style length, were significantly less likely to produce viable seeds. Further, species pairs that failed to set seed were more likely to have sympatric distributions in nature. Competition for pollinators and reinforcement to avoid costly interspecific mating could both result in these patterns and are not mutually exclusive processes. Our results add to growing evidence that reproductive character displacement contributes to exceptional floral diversity of angiosperms.","[Tripp, Erin A.; Stone, Heather B.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 334 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Tripp, Erin A.; Stone, Heather B.] Univ Colorado, Museum Nat Hist, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dexter, Kyle G.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Dexter, Kyle G.] Royal Bot Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Tripp, EA (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 334 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",erin.tripp@colorado.edu,"Dexter, Kyle G/D-5589-2018","Dexter, Kyle G/0000-0001-9232-5221","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1354963, 1355138]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1354963 and 1355138",,75,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here, we conducted an extensive field survey to test how mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungal colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) seedlings in a subtropical forest respond to density of neighbouring adult trees. In addition, we undertook a hyphal exclusion experiment to explicitly test the role of soil fungal networks in driving density-dependent effects on seedling growth and survival. Conspecific adult density was a strong predictor for the relative abundance of putative pathogens, which was greater in roots of AM than of ECM seedlings, while mycorrhizal fungal abundance and colonization were not consistently affected by conspecific adult density. Both ECM and AM fungal networks counteracted conspecific density-dependent mortality, but ECM fungi were more effective at weakening the negative effects of high seedling density than AM fungi. Our findings reveal a critical role of common fungal networks in mitigating negative density-dependent effects of pathogenic fungi on seedling establishment, which provides mechanistic insights into how soil fungal diversity shapes plant community structure in subtropical forests.","[Liang, Minxia; Shi, Liuqing; Fang, Miao; Zhang, Xinyi; Yu, Shixiao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Dept Ecol, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Burslem, David F.

Even though common bean benefits from the biological N-2 fixation carried out by native rhizobia isolates, the low efficiency of this process highlights the importance of screening new strains for plant inoculation. Two rhizobial strains (SEMIA 4108 and SEMIA 4107) previously showed great potential to improve the growth of common beans under greenhouse conditions. Thus, this study evaluated the growth and grain yield of common bean plants inoculated with those strains in field experiments. The rhizobial identification was performed by 16S rRNA sequencing and the phylogeny showed that SEMIA 4108 and SEMIA 4107 are closely related to Rhizobium phaseoli, within a clade containing other 18 Rhizobium spp. type strains. Common bean plants inoculated with SEMIA 4107 showed similar productivity to N-fertilised (N+) plants in the first experiment (2016/17) and higher productivity in the second experiment (2018/19). The development of inoculated plants was different from that observed for N+. Nonetheless, comparing inoculated treatments with N-fertilised control, no yield or productivity losses at the end of the growing process were detected. Our results showed that inoculation of the rhizobial isolates SEMIA 4108 and SEMIA 4107 improved the growth and grain yield of common bean plants. The observed agronomical performance confirms that both strains were effective and can sustain common bean growth without nitrogen fertilisation under the edaphoclimatic conditions of this study.","[Lisboa, Bruno Britto; de Sao Jose, Jackson Freitas Brilhante; Vargas, Luciano Kayser] Secretary Rio Grande Sul, Dept Agr Res & Diag Agr Livestock & Irrigat, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Schmidt, Thomas Muller; Thome, Arthur Henrique Ely; Sperotto, Raul Antonio; Granada, Camille Eichelberger] Univ Taquari Valley Univates, Grad Program Biotechnol, Lajeado, RS, Brazil; [Volpiano, Camila Gazolla] Fed Univ Rio Grande UFRGS, Dept Genet, Inst Biosci, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","Granada, CE (corresponding author), Univ Taquari Valley Univates, Grad Program Biotechnol, Lajeado, RS, Brazil.",cegranada@univates.br,,"Granada, Camille/0000-0002-7493-1348",University of Taquari Valley - Univates; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes/Brazil)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"We thank the University of Taquari Valley - Univates for the financial support, and the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes/Brazil) for granting the scholarships.",,46,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0014-4797,1469-4441,,EXP AGR,Exp.

In tropical forests, phosphorus (P) is often considered the main limiting nutrient for plants. However, support for the P paradigm is limited, and N and cations might also control tropical forests functioning. We used a large-scale experiment to determine how the factorial addition of nitrogen (N), P and cations affected root productivity and traits related to nutrient acquisition strategies (morphological traits, phosphatase activity, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation and nutrient contents) in a primary rainforest growing on low-fertility soils in Central Amazonia after 1 yr of fertilisation. Multiple root traits and productivity were affected. Phosphorus additions increased annual root productivity and root diameter, but decreased root phosphatase activity. Cation additions increased root productivity at certain times of year, also increasing root diameter and mycorrhizal colonisation. P and cation additions increased their element concentrations in root tissues. No responses were detected with N addition. Here we showed that rock-derived nutrients determined root functioning in low-fertility Amazonian soils, demonstrating not only the hypothesised importance of P, but also highlighting the role of cations. The changes in fine root traits and productivity indicated that even slow-growing tropical rainforests can respond rapidly to changes in resource availability.","[Lugli, Laynara F.; Rosa, Jessica S.; Pires, Maria; Cordeiro, Amanda L.; Cunha, Hellen F.

Praxelis clematidea is a triploid neotropical Asteraceae species that is invasive in China and other countries. However, few studies have focused on its reproductive biology. In this study, flow cytometric seed screening (FCSS) was used to identify and confirm the reproductive mode of the species. The development of ovules, anthers, and mega- and microgametophytes was observed using a clearing method and differential interference contrast microscopy. Pollen viability was measured using the Benzidine test and Alexander's stain. Pollen morphology was observed via fluorescence microscopy after sectioning the disk florets and staining with water-soluble aniline blue or 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclei dyes. Controlled pollination experiments were conducted on four populations in China to examine the breeding system and to confirm autonomous apomixis. The reproductive mode was found to be autonomous apomixis without pseudogamy, according to FCSS. Megaspore mother cells developed directly into eight-nucleate megagametophytes without meiosis, conforming to Antennaria-type diplospory. The unreduced egg cells developed into embryos through parthenogenesis, while the endosperm was formed by the fusion of two unreduced polar nuclei. Pollen viability was very low (0.82 +/- 0.57 % and 0.36 +/- 0.44 %) as measured by the Benzidine test and Alexander's stain, respectively. The majority of the pollen grains were empty and had neither cytoplasm nor nuclei. The seed set was >90 % for all treatments of open pollination, bagging and emasculated capitula. Mature cypselae developed in capitula that were emasculated before flowering, which confirmed that the breeding system of P. clematidea was autonomous apomixis. The present study is the first report of autonomous apomixis in P. clematidea in China. Antennaria-type autonomous apomixis in P. clematidea greatly increases the probability of successful colonisation and dispersal of P. clematidea into new areas, which likely contributes to its high invasion potential. Effective control measures should be implemented to prevent autonomous (pollen-independent) seed production.","[Zhang, Yuhuan; Wang, LiXin; Hao, Jianhua] Changshu Inst Technol, Sch Biol & Food Engn, Nansanhuanlu 99, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuhuan] Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 967 Anningxi Rd, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hairong] Guangzhou Customs Technol Ctr, 66 Huacheng Ave, Guangzhou 51062, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hoerandl, Elvira] Univ Goettingen, Dept Systemat Biodivers & Evolut Plants Herbarium, Untere Karspuele 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Franca, Rafael de Oliveira] Univ Estadual Maringa, Programa Posgrad Biol Comparada, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil","Hao, JH (corresponding author), Changshu Inst Technol, Sch Biol & Food Engn, Nansanhuanlu 99, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jhhao@cslg.edu.cn,"Horandl, Elvira/AAQ-9588-2021",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31370548]; Basic Research Program of Jiangsu Province, China [BK20131192]; Science and Technology Research Program of Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency of the People's Republic of China [JSCIQ_2014IK013]; German Research Fund (Deutsche For schungsgemeinschaft project)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ho 4395/1-2]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 31370548); the Basic Research Program of Jiangsu Province, China (grant no.

Soil microorganisms are closely linked to soil organic C (SOC), and they are assumed to respond quicker to management changes than SOC. Using two Swedish long-term tillage experiments, our aim was to determine whether (i) continuous conservation tillage (harrowing, H) increase microbial biomass (indicated by fatty acid signatures) compared to plowing (P), and if occasionally tilled soil (HP) was more like H or P. Also, the aim was to determine whether (ii) crop residue management has different effects on microbial biomass depending on tillage management, and whether (iii) conservation tillage and residue return increase SOC. We found that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were stimulated by the H treatment compared to P treatment in the upper soil layer, and that occasional plowing resulted in intermediate amounts of AMF. The amount of microbial saprotrophs, on the other hand, was not affected by tillage treatment, and neither was the SOC concentration. Whether crop residues were returned in the autumn or not, had no direct effect on the microbial saprotrophs or the SOC after the winter, but crop residue removal stimulated AMF close to the surface in the P treatment. Although more research is needed to fully understand agricultural tillage and residue management effects on SOC dynamic, our study suggests that reducing or omitting plowing influence soil microbes, but does not necessarily result in more SOC.","[Hydbom, Sofia] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Hydbom, Sofia; Olsson, Pal Axel] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Olsson, PA (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",pal_axel.olsson@biol.lu.se,,,Royal Physiographic Society of Lund; Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry (C.F.

Forest soils are an important sink of ecosystem C, though the capacity to store C may be disrupted by the elevated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) compounds by dispersion of soil aggregates via acidification or altered microbial activity. Furthermore, dominant tree species and the lability of litter they produce can influence aggregation processes. Materials and methods: we measured water-stable aggregate size distribution and aggregate-associated organic matter (OM) content in soils from two watersheds and beneath four hardwood species at the USDA Forest Service Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA, where one watershed has received (NH4)(2)SO4 fertilizer since 1989 and one is a reference/control of similar stand age. Bulk soil OM, pH, and permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) were also measured. Research highlights: fertilized soil exhibited decreased macro-aggregate formation and a greater proportion of smaller micro-aggregates or unassociated clay minerals, particularly in the B-horizon. This shift in aggregation to soil more dominated by the smallest (<53 mu m) fraction is associated with both acidification (soil pH) and increased microbially processed C (POXC) in fertilized soil. Intra-aggregate OM was also depleted in the fertilized soil (52% less OM in the 53-2000 mu m fractions), most strongly in subsurface B-horizon soil. We also document that tree species can influence soil aggregation, as soil beneath species with more labile litter contained more OM in the micro-aggregate size class (<250 mu m), especially in the fertilized watershed, while species with more recalcitrant litter promoted more OM in the macro-aggregate size classes (500-2000 mu m) in the reference watershed.

Across 18 small-scale lychee orchards in northern Thailand, we evaluated the roles of different wild insects as pollinators and predators of pests in fruit production. Quantitative assessments showed that bees (Family Apidae) were strongly dominant (83%) among insect flower visitors, comprising four species in tribes Apini and four in Meliponini. Experimental manipulations of inflorescences showed that fruit production in these orchards was: (1) dependent on flower visits by wild insects because enclosure of inflorescences in mesh bags decreased fruit set (to one-fifth) and (2) not greatly limited by pollinator deficiencies, because hand pollination of unbagged flowers did not enhance fruit set. Pollination success, as indicated by the proportion of unmanipulated flowers setting fruit, correlated positively across orchards with the abundance of large-bodied Apidae (>7 mm; most were Apis species) and of Apini, and negatively with abundance of small-bodied Apidae and of all Meliponini, despite the latter being the commonest flower visitors. We conclude that larger-bodied bees are most likely to travel sufficiently far to import genetically diverse pollen, in this landscape-scale mosaic where non-orchard habitats (both agriculture and treed patches) were sufficient to sustain wild pollinators.","[Sinhaseni, Khwankhao] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","Sinhaseni, K (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",kimmim.sinhaseni@griffithuni.edu.au,,,"Griffith UniversityGriffith University; Biology Department, Chiang Mai University","We thank Chokkul Pakronsit and his family and the lychee farmers of Ban Mae Sa Mai for site access and permission to experiment; Lily Weissgold, Mukda Chantakun, and Pornladda Chaithong for assistance in the field.

Here, we focus on how a ubiquitous mutualism, arbuscular mycorrhiza, influences temporal stability of a key ecosystem process, ecosystem respiration. We discriminated between two forms of temporal stability, temporal variability and resilience, and hypothesized that excluding arbuscular mycorrhiza would be detrimental for both of them. We analyzed a set of 10 parallel manipulation experiments to assess how excluding arbuscular mycorrhiza modulates temporal stability compared to other common experimental factors. We quantified the temporal variability of ecosystem respiration and the resilience to experimental perturbations (i.e., pulses, stresses, and a disturbance) following manipulations of mycorrhizal state. We observed lower temporal variability in the absence of arbuscular mycorrhiza in discord to our main hypothesis. Manipulating arbuscular mycorrhiza had a stronger impact on temporal variability than the pulse (application of urea), the stress (addition of salt), and a disturbance (experimental defoliation) but weaker than excluding primary producers or comparing across different plant species. Resilience to experimental perturbations declined in non-mycorrhizal microcosms. We present an empirical study on how mutualisms impact temporal stability. Arbuscular mycorrhiza differentially alters temporal variability and resilience, highlighting that generalizing across different forms of temporal stability could be misleading.","[Veresoglou, Stavros D.; Yang, Gaowen; Mola, Magkdi; Manntschke, Annette; Mating, Moritz; Forstreuter, Manfred; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany; [Yang, Gaowen; Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Veresoglou, SD (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany.",sveresoglou@zedat.fu-berlin.de,"Yang, Gaowen/P-7854-2019","Yang, Gaowen/0000-0001-5154-011X",Deutsche Forschunsgemeinschaft project Metacorrhiza [VE 736/2-1],"The study was funded by the Deutsche Forschunsgemeinschaft project Metacorrhiza (VE 736/2-1).

Invader disruption of native mutualistic interactions is a mechanism expected to have negative effects on native plant species. Specifically, disruption of native plant-fungal mutualisms may provide non-mycorrhizal plant invaders an advantage over mycorrhizal native plants. Invasive Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) produces secondary chemicals toxic to soil microorganisms including mycorrhizal fungi, and is known to induce physiological stress and reduce population growth rates of native forest understory plant species. Here, we report on a 11-yr manipulative field experiment in replicated forest plots testing if the effects of removal of garlic mustard on the plant community support the mutualism disruption hypothesis within the entire understory herbaceous community. We compare community responses for two functional groups: the mycorrhizal vs. the non-mycorrhizal plant communities. Our results show that garlic mustard weeding alters the community composition, decreases community evenness, and increases the abundance of understory herbs that associate with mycorrhizal fungi. Conversely, garlic mustard has no significant effects on the non-mycorrhizal plant community. Consistent with the mutualism disruption hypothesis, our results demonstrate that allelochemical producing invaders modify the plant community by disproportionately impacting mycorrhizal plant species. We also demonstrate the importance of incorporating causal mechanisms of biological invasion to elucidate patterns and predict community-level responses.","[Roche, Morgan D.; Bialic-Murphy, Lalasia; Kivlin, Stephanie N.; Kalisz, Susan] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Roche, Morgan D.; Pearse, Ian S.; Sofaer, Helen R.] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Sofaer, Helen R.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Volcano, HI 96718 USA","Roche, MD (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.; Roche, MD (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",mroche2@vols.utk.edu,,"Bialic-Murphy, Lalasia/0000-0001-6046-8316; Roche, Morgan D/0000-0002-2276-3944","National Science Foundation Long Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) [NSF DEB 0958676, NSF DEB 1457531, NSF DEB 144552]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSF Graduate Research Internship; Invasive Species Program of the U.S. Geological Survey","This project was funded by National Science Foundation Long Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) awards to SK (NSF DEB 0958676, NSF DEB 1457531, NSF DEB 144552), NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and NSF Graduate Research Internship to M.

This work analyzes how habitat loss influences pollinators, effective pollination and yield of soybean crops. The study area comprises ten sites adjacent to forest patches surrounded by a soybean matrix in central Argentina (eight sites in the season 2014-2015 and two sites in the season 2015-2016). Pollination was estimated by pollen deposition and frequency of flower visitors. Pollen deposition on stigmas and seed set were measured comparing open plants and plants with pollinator exclusion. These response variables were compared considering increasing distance to the forest edge and an increasing gradient of forest patch size. Bees were the most frequent visitors of soybean flowers, especially honeybees, but also at least three native bee species were recorded. Open plants showed higher rates of stigmatic pollen deposition than plants with pollinator exclusion, but seed set was similar. Total insect visitation rates, especially of native insects, decreased with distance to the forest edge and so did pollen deposition. Pollen deposition and seed set increased with increasing forest patch size for plants located near and far from the forest edge, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the contribution of native pollinators from local forest patches is important for effective pollination across the landscape. Small patches of forest (approximately 1 ha.) guarantee pollinators to ensure plant yields similar to the yields of plants growing close to large patches, but only at short distances; while larger forest patches provide better pollination services for the crop at larger distances from the forest edge. However, we encourage further studies because results suggest that other factors may also influence soybean pollination and production. (C) 2020 Gesellschaft fur okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Pollinators may exert negative selection on the herbivore-induced plasticity of chemical defenses when floral signals and rewards are indirectly affected, provoking deterrent effects on these mutualists. We investigated the influence of constant herbivory and pollination on the evolved patterns and degree of herbivore-induced plasticity in chemical plant defenses and floral morphometry and volatiles in fast-cycling Brassica rapa plants. To do this, we used plants from an evolution experiment that had evolved under bee/hand pollination and herbivory manipulated in a 2 x 2 factorial design during six generations, producing four selection treatments. We grew sibling plant pairs from each of the four selection treatments of the last generation and infested one group with herbivores and left the other uninfested. Herbivore-induced plasticity was analyzed within- and between-selection treatments. We found support for the hypothesis that constant herbivory favors the evolution of higher constitutive yet lower herbivore-induced plasticity in defenses. However, this only occurred in plants that evolved under hand pollination and constant herbivory. Bee pollination had a strong influence on the evolution of herbivore-induced plasticity of all traits studied. Plants that evolved under bee pollination, with and without constant herbivory, showed remarkably similar patterns of herbivore-induced plasticity in their defense- and floral traits and had a higher number of plastic responses compared to plants with hand pollination. Such patterns support the hypothesis that bee pollination influenced the evolution of herbivore-induced plasticity, most likely via indirect effects, such as links between defense- and floral traits. We conclude that interactions other than herbivory, such as pollination, may impact herbivore-induced plasticity, through indirect effects and metabolic trade-offs, when it contributes to trait evolution in plants.","[Ramos, Sergio E.; Schiestl, Florian P.] Univ Zurich, Dept Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ramos, Sergio E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Schiestl, FP (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",florian.schiestl@systbot.uzh.ch,,"Ramos, Sergio E./0000-0003-4734-839X",European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) [281093]; European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2011) [281093]; Consejo de Ciencia y Tecnologia CONACYT-Mexico [CVU-346745],"European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013 We acknowledge the invaluable help of A.

Therefore, pollinator friendly plantings are often used to enrich habitats in bee conservation efforts. As part of these plantings, non-native plants may provide valuable floral resources, but their effects on native bee communities have not been assessed in direct comparison with native pollinator friendly plantings. In this study, we performed a common garden experiment by seeding mixes of 20 native and 20 non-native pollinator friendly plant species at separate neighboring plots at three sites in Maryland, USA, and recorded flower visitors for 2 years. A total of 3,744 bees (120 species) were collected. Bee abundance and species richness were either similar across plant types (midseason and for abundance also late season) or lower at native than at non-native plots (early season and for richness also late season). The overall bee community composition differed significantly between native and non-native plots, with 11 and 23 bee species being found exclusively at one plot type or the other, respectively. Additionally, some species were more abundant at native plant plots, while others were more abundant at non-natives. Native plants hosted more specialized plant-bee visitation networks than non-native plants. Three species out of the five most abundant bee species were more specialized when foraging on native plants than on non-native plants. Overall, visitation networks were more specialized in the early season than in late seasons. Our findings suggest that non-native plants can benefit native pollinators, but may alter foraging patterns, bee community assemblage, and bee-plant network structures.","[Seitz, Nicola; Leonhardt, Sara D.] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Seitz, Nicola; vanEngelsdorp, Dennis] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Leonhardt, SD (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Wurzburg, Germany.; Leonhardt, SD (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",leonhardt@wzw.tum.de,"Leonhardt, Sara Diana/AAI-6901-2020","Leonhardt, Sara Diana/0000-0002-8154-9569","Deutscher Akademischer AustauschdienstDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Explorers Club; Bavarian Gender Equality Grant of the Bavarian State Ministry of Science; Graduate School of Life Sciences, Wurzburg","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst; Graduate School of Life Sciences, Wurzburg; Explorers Club; Bavarian Gender Equality Grant of the Bavarian State Ministry of Science",,67,9,9,9,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Not only is a large proportion of the aboveground diversity lost, but the belowground soil microbiome, which is important for the sustainability of soil function, is massively altered. Intermixing oil palms with native tree species promotes vegetation biodiversity and stand structural complexity in plantations, but the impact on soil fungi remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the diversity and community composition of soil fungi three years after tree diversity enrichment in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra (Indonesia). We tested the effects of tree diversity, stand structural complexity indices, and soil abiotic conditions on the diversity and community composition of soil fungi. We hypothesized that the enrichment experiment alters the taxonomic and functional community composition, promoting soil fungal diversity. Fungal community composition was affected by soil abiotic conditions (pH, N, and P), but not by tree diversity and stand structural complexity indices. These results suggest that intensive land use and abiotic filters are a legacy to fungal communities, overshadowing the structuring effects of the vegetation, at least in the initial years after enrichment plantings.","[Ballauff, Johannes; Polle, Andrea] Univ Goettingen, Forest Bot & Tree Physiol, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Zemp, Delphine Clara] Univ Goettingen, Biodivers Macroecol & Biogeog, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Schneider, Dominik; Daniel, Rolf] Univ Goettingen, Genom & Appl Microbiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Schneider, Dominik; Daniel, Rolf] Univ Goettingen, Gottingen Genom Lab, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Irawan, Bambang] Univ Jambi, Fac Forestry, Jln Raya Jambi Ma Bulian KM 15 Mendalo Darat Kode, Jambi 36361, Indonesia","Ballauff, J (corresponding author), Univ Goettingen, Forest Bot & Tree Physiol, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",jballau@gwdg.de; delphine-clara.zemp@forst.uni-goettingen.de; dschnei1@gwdg.de; irawanbam@yahoo.com; rdaniel@gwdg.de; apolle@gwdg.de,"Daniel, Rolf/AAQ-5933-2021","Daniel, Rolf/0000-0002-8646-7925; Schneider, Dominik/0000-0002-1134-5026; Polle, Andrea/0000-0001-8697-6394",DFG Collaborative Research Center CRC 990 [192626868],"This research was funded by the DFG Collaborative Research Center CRC 990, grant no 192626868 (B07 to A.P., B02 to R.D., and B11).",,105,0,0,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-2607,,MICROORGANISMS,Microorganisms,OCT,2020,8,10,,,,,,,1577,10.3390/microorganisms8101577,,,17,Microbiology,Microbiology,OM8BE,WOS:000586242100001,33066264,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-30,

However, effects of various tree species on composition and activity of soil microbiota and the relevant controls remain poorly understood. We evaluated the influence of tree species associated with two different mycorrhizal types, ectomycorrhiza (EcM) and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), on growth, biomass and metabolic activity of soil fungal and bacterial communities using common garden tree species experiments throughout Denmark. The soil microbial communities differed between six European tree species as well as between EcM (beech, lime, oak and spruce) and AM (ash and maple) tree species. The EcM tree species had higher fungal biomass, fungal growth and bacterial biomass, while AM species showed higher bacterial growth. The results indicated that microbial community composition and functioning differed between groups of tree species with distinct litter qualities that generate soil C/N ratio and soil pH differences. The mycorrhizal association only partly explained litter quality and soil microbial species differences since lime was more similar to AM tree species. In addition, our results indicated that tree species-mediated soil pH and C/N ratio were the most important variables shaping microbial communities with a positive effect on bacterial and a negative effect on fungal growth rates. The results suggest that tree species-mediated microbial community composition and activity may be important drivers of the different vertical soil C distribution previously observed in AM and EcM tree species.","[Hedenec, Petr; Nilsson, Lars Ola; Zheng, Haifeng; Gundersen, Per; Schmidt, Inger Kappel; Vesterdal, Lars] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Rousk, Johannes] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Microbial Ecol MEMEG, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Hedenec, P (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",peh@ign.ku.dk,"Rousk, Johannes/E-9741-2010; Gundersen, Per/B-2192-2008; Hedenec, Petr/H-6073-2017; Vesterdal, Lars/D-5227-2011; Schmidt, Inger Kappel/A-6230-2015","Rousk, Johannes/0000-0002-4985-7262; Gundersen, Per/0000-0002-9199-4033; Hedenec, Petr/0000-0002-9425-8525; Vesterdal, Lars/0000-0003-0309-3735; Nilsson, Lars Ola/0000-0003-4514-3657; Schmidt, Inger Kappel/0000-0003-3880-2060","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)Swedish Research Council Formas; Marie Curie under the 6th Framework Programme (EU); Royal Physiographic Society of Lund (Kgl.

Those morphological and chemical traits can form highly correlated sets of traits. It is not always clear which of these are used by pollinators as primary targets of selection and which would be indirectly selected by being linked to those primary targets. Quantitative genetics tools for predicting multiple traits response to selection have been developed since long and have advanced our understanding of evolution of genetically correlated traits in various biological systems. We use these tools to predict the evolutionary trajectories of floral traits and understand the selection pressures acting on them. Results We used data from an artificial selection and a pollinator (bumblebee, hoverfly) evolution experiment with fast cyclingBrassica rapaplants to predict evolutionary changes of 12 floral volatiles and 4 morphological floral traits in response to selection. Using the observed selection gradients and the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix) of the traits, we showed that the observed responses of most floral traits including volatiles were predicted in the right direction in both artificial- and bumblebee-selection experiment. Genetic covariance had a mix of constraining and facilitating effects on evolutionary responses. We further revealed that G-matrices also evolved in the selection processes. Conclusions Overall, our integrative study shows that floral signals, especially volatiles, evolve under selection in a mostly predictable way, at least during short term evolution. Evolutionary constraints stemming from genetic covariance affected traits evolutionary trajectories and thus it is important to include genetic covariance for predicting the evolutionary changes of a comprehensive suite of traits. Other processes such as resource limitation and selfing also need to be considered for a better understanding of floral trait evolution.","[Zu, Pengjuan; Schiestl, Florian P.; Gervasi, Daniel] Univ Zurich, Dept Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Zollikerstr 107, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zu, Pengjuan] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Li, Xin; Runcie, Daniel] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Guillaume, Frederic] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Guillaume, F (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",frederic.guillaume@ieu.uzh.ch,"Guillaume, Frederic/D-5021-2011","Guillaume, Frederic/0000-0003-0874-0081; Runcie, Daniel/0000-0002-3008-9312",European UnionEuropean Commission [281093]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PP00P3_144846],"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013, FP7/20072011) under grant agreement no. 281093.

In this context, a long-term fertilizer experiment (37 years) was set up in the black soil of northeast China. We examined interaction impacts of elevated fertilizer and host selection processes on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities in wheat rhizosphere soil using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The soil samples were subjected to five fertilization regimes: no fertilizer (CK) and low N (N-1), low N plus low P (N1P1), high N (N-2), and high N plus high P (N2P2) fertilizer. Long-term fertilization resulted in a significant shift in rhizosphere soil nutrient concentrations. The N fertilization (N(1)and N-2) did not significantly change rhizosphere AMF species diversity, but N plus P fertilization (N(1)P(1)and N2P2) decreased it compared with CK. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that the rhizosphere AMF communities in CK, N-1, N-2, N(1)P(1)and N(2)P(2)treatments were distinct from each other. The AMF communities were predominantly composed of Glomeraceae, accounting for 30.0-39.1% of the sequences, and the relative abundance of family Glomeraceae was more abundance in fertilized soils, while family Paraglomeraceae were increased in N(1)and N(2)compared with CK. Analysis shown that AMF diversity was directly affected by soil C:P ratio but indirectly affected by plant under long-term fertilization. Overall, the results indicated that long-term N and P fertilization regimes changed rhizosphere AMF diversity and community composition, and rhizosphere AMF diversity was both affected by soil C:P ratio and plant.","[Wang, Qingfeng; Chu, Changbin; Wu, Shuhang] Shanghai Acad Agr Sci, Ecoenvironm Protect Res Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ma, Mingchao; Jiang, Xin; Guan, Dawei; Cao, Fengming; Li, Jun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Dan] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Soil Fertil & Environm Sources, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Kang, Yaowei] Zhaoqing Univ, Coll Life Sci, Zhaoqing, Peoples R China","Wu, SH (corresponding author), Shanghai Acad Agr Sci, Ecoenvironm Protect Res Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.; Li, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wushuhang88@163.com; lijun01@caas.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFF0201801]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41573066, 41771284]; National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2015CB150506]; Foundation for Safety of Agricultural Products by Ministry of Agriculture, China [GJFP201801202]; Key Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects in the Field of Agriculture of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission [18391902600]","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFF0201801), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41573066 and 41771284), the National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program: 2015CB150506), the Foundation for Safety of Agricultural Products by Ministry of Agriculture, China (GJFP201801202), and Key Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects in the Field of Agriculture of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission (No. 18391902600).",,53,1,1,7,19,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

A highly effective N-2-fixing Rhizobium yanglingense strain CCBAU 01603 was used as the ancestral strain and was cultured continuously with/without addition of extra alkaline reagent (KOH) in laboratory conditions for approximately 500 generations. Total 60 evolved clones obtained were checked for their adaptation to higher alkaline pH level and inoculated to their host plant Caragana microphylla to evaluate their symbiotic efficiencies. Most of the evolved clones showed increased adaptation to higher alkaline pH but all of them decreased symbiotic efficiencies, resulting in the formation of irregular root nodules with lower nitrogenase activity, production of abnormal bacteroids, and accumulation more starch grains in uninfected nodule cells. Further demonstration of lower symbiotic efficiencies came from the down-regulated expression of genes related to nitrogen fixation in the bacteroids by transcriptome comparison. In addition, genes related to transporters and other diverse functions were up- or down-regulated in the evolved clones in free-living conditions (like yjiS gene) or in symbiotic situations, demonstrating the significant variations in cellular physiology and symbiosis. Our study revealed that the enhancement of alkaline adaptation but loss of symbiotic efficiencies of the evolved clones had happened during the long-term evolution in alkaline environments where no selective pressures from host plant, offering new insight into the molecular mechanism and direction of rhizobial evolution in nature.

Only the following direct effects are well pronounced: an increase in the content of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus after the application of corresponding fertilizers, as well as a rise in pH as a result of liming. Plants are more sensitive indicators of changes in the conditions of nitrogen nutrition. They are characterized by active absorption of additional nitrogen, and the isotopic composition of nitrogen in them becomes heavier. The degree of these effects depends on the initial nitrogen availability. In addition to these direct effects, changes in the nitrogen status of plants also reflect changes in the transformation of nitrogen-containing compounds in soil and in the nitrogen nutrition of plants taking place due to an increased availability of phosphorus and lower acidity under the most phosphorus-depleted and most acid conditions, respectively. These impacts lead to the mobilization of soil organic nitrogen and are likely to reduce the role of mycorrhiza in plant nitrogen nutrition. As a result, a heavier isotopic composition of nitrogen is formed in some plant species.","[Makarov, M. I.; Onipchenko, V. G.; Malysheva, T. I.; Kadulin, M.

Although mycorrhizal fungi are crucial for nutrient acquisition and can receive a large fraction of annual net primary production, most studies do not explicitly include carbon flux to mycorrhizal fungi in ecosystem C budgets. We measured annual production of plant components (foliage, wood, fine roots) and mycorrhizal fungi across temperate forest stands varying in species composition. Production of mycorrhizal fungi was estimated using both mass balance and isotopic techniques. Total plant production varied from about 600 g C m(-2) y(-1) in nearly pure deciduous broadleaf stands down to about 300 g C m(-2) y(-1) in conifer-dominated stands. In contrast, the production of mycorrhizal fungi was highest in conifer-dominated stands, varying from less than 25 g C m(-2) y(-1) in deciduous broadleaf stands to more than 175 g C m(-2) y(-1) in nearly pure conifer stands. Isotopic data indicated that both tree species composition and ecosystem nitrogen (N) availability influenced rates of fungal production. The large investment in mycorrhizal fungi in low-N, conifer-dominated stands demonstrated that a full accounting of ecosystem carbon fluxes to plant and fungal components may help resolve current discrepancies observed in broadscale forest carbon budgets, especially across forest types.","[Ouimette, Andrew P.; Ollinger, Scott, V; Lepine, Lucie C.; Vadeboncoeur, Matthew A.; Hobbie, Erik A.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Stephens, Ryan B.; Rowe, Rebecca J.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Tumber-Davila, Shersingh J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Ouimette, AP (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",Andrew.Ouimette@unh.edu,"Ollinger, Scott V/N-3380-2014","Ollinger, Scott V/0000-0001-6226-1431; Tumber-Davila, Shersingh Joseph/0000-0001-7336-3943; Ouimette, Andrew/0000-0003-3016-5730","USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1114804, 1638688, 0614266]; Northeastern States Research Cooperative [12DG11242307065]; Hubbard Brook Long Term Ecological Research program [NSF 1114804]; NH EPSCoR Program NSF Research Infrastructure Improvement Award [EPS 1101245]; NASA Carbon Cycle Science Awards [NNX08AG14G, NNX14AJ18G]; NASA Terrestrial Ecology Award [NNX11AB88G]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Project [1006881]; New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station","Thoughtful reviews by Michael Ryan, Rebecca Sanders-DeMott, Adrien Finzi, Gary Lovett, and Steve Frolking significantly improved the quality of the manuscript.

The pilot accounts address air quality, water quality, biodiversity, carbon storage, recreation, and pollination for selected years from 2001 to 2015. Results illustrate how information from ecosystem accounts can contribute to policy and decision making. Using an example from Atlanta, we also show how ecosystem accounts can be considered alongside other SEEA accounts to give a more complete picture of a local area's environmental-economic trends. The process by which we determined where to place metrics within the accounting framework, which was strongly informed by the National Ecosystem Services Classification System (NESCS), can provide guidance for future ecosystem accounts in the U.S. and other countries. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps that limit the inclusion of certain ecosystem services in the accounts and suggest future research that can close these gaps and improve future U.S. ecosystem accounts.","[Warnell, Katherine J.

Because species are connected through complex interaction networks, the arrival of a new species is likely to affect various species across the community, as observed in plant biological invasions. However, plant invasions usually represent extreme scenarios in which the community is strongly dominated by the alien species, confounding the effects of a change in species composition with a massive increase in floral resource availability. Our study addresses changes in plant community composition involving native species, a common phenomenon under the current climate change scenario in which plants are modifying their distribution ranges. We experimentally manipulated patches of a natural scrubland community by introducing a native plant (henceforth colonizing plant). To avoid introducing a disproportionate amount of floral resources we adjusted the number of flowers of the colonizing plant to the amount of floral resources locally available in each patch. We had two objectives: (1) to analyse the effects of the arrival of a new plant on the pollinator community, the rearrangement of plant-pollinator interactions and the structure of the plant-pollinator network; (2) to evaluate potential consequences for pollination and the reproductive success of resident plant species. The colonizing plant acted as a magnet species, attracting bumble bees and facilitating interactions to other plants through spill-over. The introduction of the colonizing plant also affected the structure of plant-pollinator networks (colonized networks were more generalized and more nested than control networks) and modified the arrangement of plant and pollinator species into modules. Ultimately, these changes resulted in higher heterospecific (but not conspecific) pollen deposition and had contrasting effects on the reproductive success of two resident plant species (higher fruit set and lower seed set, respectively). Our study shows that relationships between plants and pollinators are rapidly rearranged in response to novel situations (even when the new plant is not overly dominant), with important functional consequences on pollination and plant reproductive success. Our study establishes a link between network structure and pollination and plant reproductive success, which may be mediated by differences among pollinator species in foraging behavior.","[Hernandez-Castellano, Carlos; Rodrigo, Anselm; Stefanescu, Constanti; Calleja, Juan Antonio; Reverte, Sara; Bosch, Jordi] CREAF, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain; [Rodrigo, Anselm] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain; [Gomez, Jose Maria] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, ES-04120 Almeria, Spain; [Stefanescu, Constanti] Museu Ciencies Nat Granollers, E-08400 Granollers, Catalonia, Spain; [Calleja, Juan Antonio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Cambio Global CIBC UAM, Dept Biol, Unidad Bot, E-28049 Madrid, Spain","Hernandez-Castellano, C (corresponding author), CREAF, E-08193 Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.",c.hernandez@creaf.uab.cat,"Reverte, Sara/AAC-5134-2020; Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017; Calleja Alarcon, Juan Antonio/M-1639-2014","Reverte, Sara/0000-0002-2924-3394; Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664; Hernandez-Castellano, Carlos/0000-0003-0211-6018; Calleja Alarcon, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-6586-0939; Rodrigo, Anselm/0000-0001-6341-0363","Spanish MINECO [CGL2013-41856-P, FPU14/03082, BES-2014-068735]","We thank Rebecca E.

Likewise, one or more of these species may have arisen through historical hybridization between taxa. Here, we aim to elucidate the occurrence of hybridization among three Dyckia spp. (Bromeliaceae) from southern Brazil. We used seven nuclear and six plastid microsatellite loci to assess patterns of genetic diversity, population structure and hybridization in the three species. Furthermore, we performed manual crosses between species to test compatibility and fertility. The results showed that Dyckia julianae has an intermediate molecular profile, low gene flow occurs between Dyckia hebdingii and Dyckia choristaminea and higher gene flow occurs between D. julianae and the other two species. Plastid microsatellites identified 12 haplotypes that are shared among the species. The manual crosses between D. julianae and the other two species produced viable seeds, but no crosses between D. hebdingii and D. choristaminea generated fruits. Our data suggest that the reproductive barrier between D. julianae and the other two species is permeable. Further investigation into the hybrid origin hypothesis of D. julianae should be undertaken, as well as the mechanisms involved in reproductive isolation between D. hebdingii and D. choristaminea.","[Hirsch, Luiza D.; Zanella, Camila M.; Aguiar-Melo, Camila; Costa, Lais M.

They likely emerged and diversified through independent horizontal transfers of key symbiotic genes. To replay the evolution of a new rhizobium genus under laboratory conditions, the symbiotic plasmid of Cupriavidus taiwanensis was introduced in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, and the generated proto-rhizobium was submitted to repeated inoculations to the C. taiwanensis host, Mimosa pudica L. This experiment validated a two-step evolutionary scenario of key symbiotic gene acquisition followed by genome remodeling under plant selection. Nodulation and nodule cell infection were obtained and optimized mainly via the rewiring of regulatory circuits of the recipient bacterium. Symbiotic adaptation was shown to be accelerated by the activity of a mutagenesis cassette conserved in most rhizobia. Investigating mutated genes led us to identify new components of R. solanacearum virulence and C. taiwanensis symbiosis. Nitrogen fixation was not acquired in our short experiment. However, we showed that post-infection sanctions allowed the increase in frequency of nitrogen-fixing variants among a non-fixing population in the M. pudica-C. taiwanensis system and likely allowed the spread of this trait in natura. Experimental evolution thus provided new insights into rhizobium biology and evolution.","[de Moura, Ginaini Grazielli Doin; Remigi, Philippe; Masson-Boivin, Catherine; Capela, Delphine] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LIPM, INRAE, F-31320 Castanet Tolosan, France","Capela, D (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LIPM, INRAE, F-31320 Castanet Tolosan, France.",ginaini-grazielli.doin-de-moura@inrae.fr; philippe.remigi@inrae.fr; catherine.masson@inrae.fr; delphine.capela@inrae.fr,,"Capela, Delphine/0000-0003-3891-672X; Remigi, Philippe/0000-0001-9023-3788","French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-16-CE20-0011-01]; Laboratoire d'Excellence (LABEX) TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41]; French Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation (MESRI); European UnionEuropean Commission [845838]","This research was funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR-16-CE20-0011-01) and the Laboratoire d'Excellence (LABEX) TULIP (ANR-10-LABX-41).

Plant-fungal interactions are important for plant community assembly, but quantifying these relationships remains challenging. High throughput sequencing of fungal communities allows us to identify plant-fungal associations at a high level of resolution, but often fails to provide information on taxonomic and functional assignment of fungi. 2. We transplanted seeds of Pinus cembra a cross an elevational gradient (1850-2250 m a.s.l.) and identified environmental factors and known fungal associates important for seedling establishment and survival. We then applied null model tests to identify taxonomically unassigned fungi associated with pine recruitment. 3. Early seedling establishment was determined by abiotic environmental factors, while seedling survival was predominantly affected by biotic environmental factors (i.e., the abundance of a fungal pathogen known from literature and the distance to adult trees). Null model tests identified known mycorrhizal partners and a large number of unknown operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with seedling survival, including saprotrophic and pathogenic species. These results highlight that unknown fungal OTUs, which are usually discarded from analyses, could play a crucial role for plant survival. 4. Synthesis. We conclude that high throughput metabarcoding paired with null model tests, is a valuable approach for identifying hidden plant-fungal associations within large and complex DNA metabarcoding datasets. Such an approach can be an important tool in illuminating the black box of plant-microbe interactions, and thus understanding ecosystem dynamics.","[Merges, Dominik; Balint, Miklos; Schmitt, Imke; Manning, Peter; Neuschulz, Eike Lena] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany; [Merges, Dominik; Schmitt, Imke] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany","Merges, D (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany.; Merges, D (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",dominik.merges@senckenberg.de,"Manning, Peter/I-6523-2012","Manning, Peter/0000-0002-7940-2023; Neuschulz, Eike Lena/0000-0001-7526-2580",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [NE 1863/2-1],This research has been funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG; NE 1863/2-1).,,89,4,4,4,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

These altered interactions, in turn, may exert diversity-driven selection pressure to which plants respond with phenotypic changes. Diverse plant communities may favour the survival and fitness of individuals with traits that avoid competition. Conversely, monocultures may accumulate species-specific pests favouring greater investment in defence traits. Yet, it is unknown how altered plant rhizosphere interactions influence the plant diversity-driven selection for altered plant phenotypes. We tested for plant diversity-driven selection on plant above-ground traits and how these traits are modified by their rhizosphere microbial communities after 11 years in experimental plant monocultures and mixtures. Plants propagated from monocultures or mixtures were grown in combination with their 'home' versus 'away' arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) or non-AMF microbes in two separate experiments using five and eight plant species, respectively. We hypothesized that plants in monocultures may be selected for better defence and better performance in association with rhizosphere microbial communities compared with plants in mixtures. Monoculture and mixture plants significantly differed in their above-ground phenotypes. As predicted, plant traits related to defence (greater leaf mass per area and leaf dry matter content, reduced leaf damage) were more pronounced in monoculture plants in both experiments. Effects of the rhizosphere microbial communities, which generally enhanced plant growth, tended to be species-specific. Significant three-way interactions between diversity-driven selection, AMF treatment and plant species showed that home versus away effects could be positive or negative, depending on plant species. We conclude that long-term differences in plant diversity lead to selection for altered plant phenotypes. Such differences may be further modified in association with the AMF microbial communities derived from the different plant diversity treatments, but often outcomes are species-specific. This suggests that plant species differ in their capacity to respond to diversity loss and associated changes in rhizosphere microbial communities, making it complicated to predict community-level responses to such loss.

Nutt., in central Alberta, Canada, by examining the effects of spatial patterns and overstory canopy on flower and fruit production. S. canadensis is more abundant and productive (more fruit) at forest edges and in forest gaps, suggesting a dependence on higher light conditions than is typical of late-seral forests. We used path analysis to demonstrate that flower and fruit production exhibited density-dependent effects at a scale of 50 m(2) around focal female plants. Fruit production was positively affected by male intraspecific density (pollen supply) and negatively affected by female intraspecific density (pollen competition), but not correlated with overall intraspecific density. The effects of sex-differentiated density are partly due to pollinator responses to male plant density. Flower production was positively affected by overall intraspecific density. A pollen supplementation trial doubled fruit production relative to a control, demonstrating that local male density (pollen availability) and pollinator activity can limit fruit production in S. canadensis. Canopy cover was negatively related to both flower and total fruit production, with approximately one-third (34%) of the total effect of canopy on fruit production due to the effect of canopy on flower production. The commonly observed negative association between canopy cover and fruit production in buffaloberry, therefore, is partly a result of the reduction first in flower number and second in fruit set. This study clarifies the mechanisms associated with the often-noted observation, but not previously assessed at the level of individuals, that reproductive output in S. canadensis is density dependent, limited by canopy cover through reductions in both flowering and fruit set, and pollinator limited. These findings hold implications for managing animal species that depend on the fruit of S. canadensis and suggest future directions for research on dioecious and actinorhizal species.","[Bateman, Tyler J.; Nielsen, Scott E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada","Bateman, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",tbateman@ualberta.ca; scottn@ualberta.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [RGPIN-2014-04842],"This research was funded by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant, #RGPIN-2014-04842.",,94,1,1,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,JAN,2020,12,1,,,,,,,37,10.3390/d12010037,,,15,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KK8XK,WOS:000513019300012,,gold,,,2021-09-30,

In particular, this may have implications for the ways in which we manage noxious weeds, which may spread more quickly if they experience stronger mutualistic interactions. We grew the invasive nodding thistle, Carduus nutans, in two experimental treatments in the field: either passively warmed with open top chambers or at ambient temperatures. We collected pollen from thistles in each treatment and analysed the total protein, lipid, and carbohydrate content. We observed no difference in the pollen protein or carbohydrate content, but the total lipid content of the pollen was significantly higher in warmed plants. We conducted a total of 12.75 h of observations of putatively mutualistic, flower-visiting insects. In addition, we spent 4.17 h collecting bees that visited thistle inflorescences in the treatments, allowing us to identify them to species. We found a significant increase in the abundance of flower-visiting insects in the observations, but not bee abundance in collections. In addition, there was no treatment effect on the number of flower-visiting morphotypes in the observations, or bee species richness in the collections. However, a nonparametric test did identify a significant effect of warming on the composition of flower-visiting morphotypes in observations and bee species in collections. Overall, the warming treatment significantly increased lipid content of the pollen, but had relatively weak effects on insect visitation patterns. However, these effects may be amplified at larger spatial and temporal scales or higher temperatures.","[Russo, Laura] Univ Tennessee, Inst Agr, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Russo, Laura; Keller, Joseph; Shea, Katriona] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, State Coll, PA 16802 USA; [Vaudo, Anthony D.; Grozinger, Christina M.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Pollinator Res, Huck Inst Life Sci, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA 16803 USA; [Vaudo, Anthony D.] Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Russo, L (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Inst Agr, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.; Russo, L (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, State Coll, PA 16802 USA.",lrusso@utk.edu; jak573@psu.edu; advaudo@gmail.com; christina.grozinger@gmail.com; k-shea@psu.edu,"Shea, Katriona/B-7954-2008","Shea, Katriona/0000-0002-7607-8248","Penn State Center for Pollinator Research (Apes Valentes grant); United States Department of Agriculture NIFA-AFRI [2014-02219, 2016-67011-24710]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1313115, DEB-1556444]; H2020 Marie Curie Sklodowska Fellowship [FOMN-705287]","This research was funded by the Penn State Center for Pollinator Research (Apes Valentes grant), United States Department of Agriculture NIFA-AFRI, grant #2014-02219 and #2016-67011-24710, National Science Foundation, grant #DMS-1313115 and #DEB-1556444, H2020 Marie Curie Sklodowska Fellowship #FOMN-705287.",,28,4,4,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,JAN,2020,11,1,,,,,,,20,10.3390/insects11010020,,,10,Entomology,Entomology,KL0NT,WOS:000513130200042,31881659,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-30,

How bacteria optimize regulatory circuitries is crucial to understand bacterial adaptation. Here, we analyzed the experimental evolution of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum into legume symbionts after the transfer of a natural plasmid encoding the essential mutualistic genes. We showed that the Phc quorum sensing system required for the virulence of the ancestral bacterium was reconfigured to improve intracellular infection of root nodules induced by evolved Ralstonia. A single mutation in either the PhcB autoinducer synthase or the PhcQ regulator of the sensory cascade tuned the kinetics of activation of the central regulator PhcA in response to cell density so that the minimal stimulatory concentration of autoinducers needed for a given response was increased. Yet, a change in the expression of a PhcA target gene was observed in infection threads progressing in root hairs, suggesting early programming for the late accommodation of bacteria in nodule cells. Moreover, this delayed switch to the quorum sensing mode decreased the pathogenicity of the ancestral strain, illustrating the functional plasticity of regulatory systems and showing how a small modulation in signal response can produce drastic changes in bacterial lifestyle. IMPORTANCE Rhizobia are soil bacteria from unrelated genera able to form a mutualistic relationship with legumes. Bacteria induce the formation of root nodules, invade nodule cells, and fix nitrogen to the benefit of the plant. Rhizobial lineages emerged from the horizontal transfer of essential symbiotic genes followed by genome remodeling to activate and/or optimize the acquired symbiotic potential. This evolutionary scenario was replayed in a laboratory evolution experiment in which the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum successively evolved the capacities to nodulate Mimosa pudica and poorly invade, then massively invade, nodule cells. In some lines, the improvement of intracellular infection was achieved by mutations modulating a quorum sensing regulatory system of the ancestral strain. This modulation that affects the activity of a central regulator during the earliest stages of symbiosis has a huge impact on late stages of symbiosis. This work showed that regulatory rewiring is the main driver of this pathogeny-symbiosis transition.","[Tang, Mingxing; Masson-Boivin, Catherine; Capela, Delphine] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, INRAE, LIPM, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Bouchez, Olivier] INRAE, GeT PlaGe, US 1426, Genotoul, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Cruveiller, Stephane] Univ Evry, Univ Paris Saclay, Inst Francois Jacob, CEA,Genoscope,Genom Metabol,LABGeM,CNRS, Evry, France; [Tang, Mingxing] Biopark, Paris, France; [Cruveiller, Stephane] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Inst Biomed & Biotechnol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Capela, D (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, INRAE, LIPM, Castanet Tolosan, France.",delphine.capela@inra.fr,,"Tang, Mingxing/0000-0002-0472-6461; Capela, Delphine/0000-0003-3891-672X","French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12-ADAP-0014-01, ANR-16-CE20-0011-01]; Laboratoire d'Excellence (LABEX) TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council",This work was supported by funds from the French National Research Agency (ANR-12-ADAP-0014-01 and ANR-16-CE20-0011-01) and the Laboratoire d'Excellence (LABEX) TULIP (ANR-10-LABX-41).

However, the importance of bats as pollinators has been overlooked, with a consequent lack of knowledge of the reliance of crops on bats for harvest yield and quality. We used exclusion experiments to determine the effect of different pollinator taxa on the yield and quality of pitayas (fruit of Stenocereus queretaroensis (F.A.C. Weber) Buxbaum), a major crop in central Mexico. We studied the three most economically important cultivars and wild individuals in the principal region for pitaya production. For each pollinator taxon we recorded fruit set and measured three key parameters of fruit quality: weight, sucrose concentration and seed set. We placed camera traps to determine pollinator identity and the effect of visitation rate on fruit quality. We found the primary pollinators of pitayas to be nectarivorous bats in the genus Leptonycteris. When bats were excluded from flowers and flowers were pollinated by other taxa (i.e. diurnal birds and insects), pitaya yield decreased by 35%, though pollination dependence varied between cultivars. Fruit quality decreased significantly in the absence of bat pollination across all cultivars, with fruits 46% lighter and 13% less sweet when pollinated by other taxa; reducing economic value, as size determines market price. Additionally, seed set (an indicator of effective pollination) was significantly lower in the absence of bat pollinators. Visitation rate had no effect on fruit quality. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that bats provide a vital ecosystem service by pollinating a crop of major socio-economic importance, and that consideration of both crop quality and yield are essential to fully understanding the benefits of bat pollination. A reduction of this service would result in a decrease in both the size and quality of the harvest, causing substantial loss of income for rural communities. Bats world-wide face many threats, and management efforts targeted to the enhancement of wild bat pollinator populations would preserve the sustainability of both bat-pollinated crops and wild plants.","[Tremlett, Constance J.; Chapman, Mark A.; Zamora-Gutierrez, Veronica; Peh, Kelvin S. -H.] Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Moore, Mandy] Univ Wollongong, Natl Inst Appl Stat Res Australia, Ctr Bioinformat & Biometr, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Chapman, Mark A.] Univ Southampton, Ctr Underutilised Crops, Southampton, Hants, England; [Zamora-Gutierrez, Veronica] Inst Politecn Nacl, CIIDIR, Unidad Durango, CONACYT, Durango, Mexico; [Peh, Kelvin S. -H.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Cambridge, England","Zamora-Gutierrez, V (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton, Hants, England.; Zamora-Gutierrez, V (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, CIIDIR, Unidad Durango, CONACYT, Durango, Mexico.",zamora.gtz@gmail.com,"Chapman, Mark/E-5260-2011; Zamora-Gutierrez, Veronica/AAB-6146-2020; Peh, Kelvin/C-3408-2013","Chapman, Mark/0000-0002-7151-723X; Zamora-Gutierrez, Veronica/0000-0003-0661-5180; Tremlett, Constance/0000-0001-5880-6582; Peh, Kelvin/0000-0002-2921-1341",University of Southampton; British Cactus and Succulent Society; Bat Conservation International; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L002531/1],"University of Southampton; British Cactus and Succulent Society; Bat Conservation International; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/L002531/1",,43,6,8,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

However, field trials confirming the benefits of microbes in large-scale applications using economically viable and efficient inoculation methods are still scarce. Microbial seed coating has a great potential for large-scale agriculture through the application of reduced amounts of PGPR and AM fungi inocula. Thus, in this study, the impact of seed coating with PGPR, Pseudomonas libanensis TR1 and AM fungus, Rhizophagus irregularis (single or multiple isolates) on grain yield and nutrient content of cowpea under low-input field conditions was evaluated. RESULTS Seed coating with P. libanensis + multiple isolates of R. irregularis (coatPMR) resulted in significant increases in shoot dry weight (76%), and in the number of pods and seeds per plant (52% and 56%, respectively) and grain yield (56%), when compared with non-inoculated control plants. However, seed coating with P. libanensis + R. irregularis single-isolate (coatPR) did not influence cowpea grain yield. Grain lipid content was significantly higher (25%) in coatPMR plants in comparison with control. Higher soil organic matter and lower pH were observed in the coatPMR treatment. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that cowpea field productivity can be improved by seed coating with PGPR and multiple AM fungal isolates under low-input agricultural systems.

We paired manipulative experiments to probe two mechanistic pathways through which plant invasion and warming may alter phenology and reproduction of native plant species. In the first, we tested how experimental warming (+1.7 degrees C) modulated flowering phenology and how this affected flowering overlap between a native plant (Dracophyllum subulatum) and an invasive plant (Calluna vulgaris L.). In the second experiment, we explored how variation in the ratio of native to invasive flowers, and the overall quantity of resources in a floral patch, affected the reproduction of the native species. We hypothesized that the flowering overlap of native and invasive plants would be altered by warming, given that invading plants typically exhibit greater phenological plasticity than native plants. Further, we hypothesized that pollination of native plant flowers would decrease in floral patches dominated by invasive plant flowers, but that this effect would depend on total floral density in the patch. As predicted, the invasive plant had a stronger phenological response to experimental warming than the native plant, resulting in increased flowering overlap between the native the invasive plants. There was a four-fold increase in the number of native flowers co-flowering with high densities of invasive flowers suggesting native plant competition for pollinators with invasive plants under a warmed climate. In the second experiment, we found depressed seed masses of the native species in high density floral patches that were dominated by invasive flowers relative to high density floral patches dominated by native flowers. At low floral densities, seed mass of native plants was unaffected by invasion. Together, these results demonstrate that by increasing their phenological overlap, warming may enhance the magnitude of existing competition for pollination exerted by an invasive plant on a native plant, particularly in plant patches with high floral density. Our results illustrate a novel pathway through which global change drivers can operate synergistically to alter an important ecosystem service: pollination.","[Giejsztowt, Justyna; Classen, Aimee T.; Deslippe, Julie R.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Giejsztowt, J (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",j.giejsztowt@gmail.com,"Classen, Aimee T/C-4035-2008; Classen, Aimee/AAM-5671-2021","Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; Giejsztowt, Justyna/0000-0002-3179-745X","Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment's Te Punaha Hihiko Fund [RTVU1511]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences ProgramUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0010562]","The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment's Te Punaha Hihiko Fund RTVU1511 supported this work.

To understand how selection by pollinators interacts with other selective factors and depends on environmental context, studies that address multiple selective agents are necessary. Here, I illustrate how antagonistic interactions, community context, and resource availability may influence selection on floral traits. I discuss approaches to quantify the context dependence of pollinator-mediated selection, emphasizing experimental studies that manipulate pollination regime in combination with other putative selective factors. I also discuss how context dependence may differ between floral traits that affect pollinator attraction versus pollination efficiency. Finally, I suggest some areas where important progress can be made. A better understanding of the context dependence of pollinator-mediated selection is essential to predict when, where, and how environmental change will alter selection on floral traits.","[Sletvold, Nina] Uppsala Univ, Plant Ecol & Evolut, Dept Ecol & Genet, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Norbyvagen 18D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Sletvold, N (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Plant Ecol & Evolut, Dept Ecol & Genet, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Norbyvagen 18D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",nina.sletvold@ebc.uu.se,,,,,,91,11,11,2,25,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1058-5893,1537-5315,,INT J PLANT SCI,Int.

However, effects of seasonality on foraging distances, particularly in tropical regions, are poorly understood. Here, we use translocation ('homing') experiments, the release of marked individuals at various distances from the nest, to investigate how homing abilities of the Neotropical stingless bee, Scaptotrigona aff. postica differ across the transition between wet and dry seasons (February-August) in a heterogenous tropical landscape in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We also determined nectar sugar concentrations of unmanipulated returning foragers to assess temporal changes in collected resource quality. Maximum and typical homing distances (i.e. distances where 90% and 50% of released bees are lost) were estimated to be 860 and 392 m, respectively, confirming that while some individuals travel long distances, most workers must remain close to nests during foraging trips. Homing distances and collected nectar sugar concentrations showed inverse temporal patterns, as homing range declined in later months (May to August), whereas nectar sugar concentrations increased over the same period. Thus, shorter homing distances in later 'dry season' months probably reflected an increased availability of floral resources compared with earlier months. Together, our findings highlight the limited spatial extent of foraging activities in S. aff. postica workers, and that bee homing distances vary with environmental conditions. These results provide useful information for both stingless bee colony management and conservation in humid tropical regions.","[Campbell, Alistair John; Correa Gomes, Rafael Leandro; da Silva, Karoline Chaves; Leon Contrera, Felipe Andres] Univ Fed Para, Lab Biol & Ecol Abellias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Rua Augusto Correa 1,Campus Basico, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Campbell, Alistair John] Embrapa Amazonia Oriental, Dept Entomol, BR-66095903 Belem, Para, Brazil","Campbell, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Fed Para, Lab Biol & Ecol Abellias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Rua Augusto Correa 1,Campus Basico, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil.; Campbell, AJ (corresponding author), Embrapa Amazonia Oriental, Dept Entomol, BR-66095903 Belem, Para, Brazil.",alistaircampbell87@googlemail.com,"Campbell, Alistair John/H-4401-2017; Contrera, Felipe/D-2952-2009","Campbell, Alistair John/0000-0001-8163-6737; Contrera, Felipe/0000-0002-7078-5048",CAPES/Embrapa [15/2014]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [300037/2018-0]; CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior)-BrazilCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001]; CNPq/MCTIC/IBAMA/Associacao ABELHA [32/2017 (400585/2018-9)],AJC was supported by postdoctoral grants from CAPES/Embrapa (15/2014) and CNPq (300037/2018-0) in completing this research.

However, ecologists rarely test the attractiveness of chosen plants to pollinators in the field. Here, we experimentally test whether plant species roles in pollination networks can be used to identify species with the most potential to recover plant-pollinator communities. Using published pollination networks, we calculated each plant's centrality and chose five central and five peripheral plant species for introduction into replicate experimental plots. Flower visitation by pollinators was recorded in each plot and we tested the impact of introduced central and peripheral plant species on the pollinator and resident plant communities and on network structure. We found that the introduction of central plant species attracted a higher richness and abundance of pollinators than the introduction of peripheral species, and that the introduced central plant species occupied the most important network roles. The high attractiveness of central species to pollinators, however, did not negatively affect visitation to resident plant species by pollinators. We also found that the introduction of central plant species did not affect network structure, while networks with introduced peripheral species had lower centralisation and interaction evenness than networks with introduced central species. To our knowledge, this is the first time species network roles have been tested in a field experiment. Given that most restoration projects start at the plant community, being able to identify the plants with the highest potential to restore community structure and functioning should be a key goal for ecological restoration.","[Maia, Kate P.; Memmott, Jane] Univ Bristol, Life Sci Bldg,24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Vaughan, Ian P.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Biosci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales","Maia, KP (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Life Sci Bldg,24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.",km14720@bristol.ac.uk,"Maia, Kate P./B-1122-2013; Vaughan, Ian/A-4782-2010","Maia, Kate P./0000-0002-2095-5731; Vaughan, Ian/0000-0002-7263-3822",,,,78,7,7,5,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2019,128,10,,,,,1446,1457,,10.1111/oik.06183,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JH0EI,WOS:000492447100007,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-30,

Depending on its spatial extent and the mobility of pollinators, this inflated kinship at the immediate neighbourhood can critically impoverish pollen quality. Despite the common occurrence of positive FSGS within plant populations, our knowledge regarding the role of long-distance pollination preventing reproductive failure is still limited. Using microsatellite markers, we examined the existence of positive FSGS in two low-density populations of the tree Pyrus bourgaeana. We also designed controlled crosses among trees differing in their kinship to investigate the effects of increased local kinship on plant reproduction. We used six pollination treatments and fully monitored fruit production, fruit and seed weight, proportion of mature seeds per fruit, and seed germination. Our results revealed positive FSGS in both study populations and lower fruit initiation in flowers pollinated with pollen from highly-genetically related individuals within the neighbourhood, with this trend intensifying as the fruit development progressed. Besides, open-pollinated flowers exhibited lower performance compared to those pollinated by distant pollen donors, suggesting intense qualitative pollen limitation in natural populations. We found positive fine-scale spatial genetic structure is translated into impoverished pollen quality from nearby pollen donors which negatively impacts the reproductive success of trees in low-density populations. Under this scenario of intrapopulation genetic rescue by distant pollen donors, the relevance of highly-mobile pollinators for connecting spatially and genetically distant patches of trees may be crucial to safeguarding population recruitment.","[Castilla, Antonio R.; Garrote, Pedro J.; Zywiec, Magdalena; Fedriani, Jose M.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves INBIO, Lisbon, Portugal; [Castilla, Antonio R.; Godoy, Jose A.; Xavier Pico, F.] CSIC, Dept Ecol Integrat, EBD, Seville, Spain; [Garrote, Pedro J.; Calvo, Gemma; Suarez-Esteban, Alberto; Delibes, Miguel; Fedriani, Jose M.] CSIC, Dept Biol Conservac, Estn Biol Donana, Seville, Spain; [Zywiec, Magdalena] Polish Acad Sci, W Szafer Inst Bot, Krakow, Poland; [Fedriani, Jose M.] CSIC UVEG GV, Ctr Invest Desertificac CIDE, Moncada, Spain","Castilla, AR (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves INBIO, Lisbon, Portugal.",acastilla@isa.ulisboa.pt,"Castilla, Antonio R./A-3877-2019; Godoy, Jose Antonio/B-9288-2008; Pico, Xavier/E-5697-2016; Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018","Castilla, Antonio R./0000-0002-4124-738X; Godoy, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-7502-9471; Pico, Xavier/0000-0003-2849-4922; Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621; Garrote, Pedro J./0000-0001-8662-0945; Zywiec, Magdalena/0000-0002-5992-4051","Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2010-21926/BOS]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [IF/00728/2013, SFRH/BD/130527/2017, SFRH/BPD/115781/2016]; Wladyslaw Szafer Institute of Botany Polish Academy of Sciences [CGL2007-63488/BOS]; Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion [CGL2016-77720-P]","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: CGL2010-21926/BOS; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: IF/00728/2013, SFRH/BD/130527/2017 and SFRH/BPD/115781/2016; Wladyslaw Szafer Institute of Botany Polish Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: CGL2007-63488/BOS; Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion, Grant/Award Number: CGL2016-77720-P",,74,4,4,5,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from abandoned field had higher root colonization potential. This could explain the higher performance of the sown specialists inoculated with the abandoned field inoculum compared to those inoculated with dry grassland inoculum. This difference disappeared when specialists were transplanted instead of sown. The results do not provide any support for higher performance of specialists inoculated with dry grassland inoculum.

Subsequently, we compared the model predictions with species occurrence and the results of the field germination experiment while considering two germination stagesasymbiotic (early stage) and symbiotic. And finally, we attempted to identify possible drivers of species' landscape distribution (i.e., dispersal, availability of habitat patches, or fungal associates). We have discovered that different habitat characteristics determined the distribution of different orchids. The species also differed in terms of availability of suitable habitat patches and patch occupancy (the highest being E. atrorubens with 80%). Landscape distribution of the species was primarily restricted by the availability of fungal associates (the most important factor for C. rubra) and by the availability of suitable habitat patches (the most important in case of N. nidus-avis). Despite expected easy dispersal of spores, orchid distribution seems to be limited by the availability of fungal associates in the landscape. In contrast, the availability of orchid seeds does not seem to limit their distribution.

Still, the legacy effects of cover crops (CCs) and the major factors driving the AM fungal community are not well known; neither is the influence of the specific CC. This work describes a field experiment established in Central Spain to test the effect of replacing winter fallow by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) or vetch (Vicia sativa L.) during the intercropping of maize (Zea mays L.). We examined the community composition of the AMF in the roots and rhizosphere soil associated with the subsequent cash crop after 10 years of cover cropping, using Illumina technology. The multivariate analysis showed that the AMF communities under the barley treatment differed significantly from those under fallow, whereas no legacy effect of the vetch CC was detected. Soil organic carbon, electrical conductivity, pH, Ca and microbial biomass carbon were identified as major factors shaping soil AMF communities. Specific AMF taxa were found to play a role in plant uptake of P, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cd, which may shed light on the functionality of these taxa. In our conditions, the use of barley as a winter CC appears to be an appropriate choice with respect to promotion of AMF populations and biological activity in agricultural soils with intercropping systems. However, more research on CC species and their legacy effect on themicrobial community composition and functionality are needed to guide decisions in knowledge-based agriculture.

However, the widespread generalists among mutualists and their large geographical ranges allow alien plants to be integrated into networks. The role of residence time also has to be accounted for, as it takes time for a species to spread and adapt to a new area. We investigated how residence time, auto-fertility and pollinator dependence affect reproductive output and invasion success of Asteraceae in Germany. We conducted a multi-species common-garden experiment along an alien-native continuum including 42 species of natives, archaeophytes and neophytes (casual and established), subjecting plant individuals either to free access or exclusion of pollinators. Pollinator dependence does not play a crucial role in invasion success, with most Asteraceae being able to self-fertilize. Surprisingly, both established neophytes and natives showed higher abilities to self-fertilize, while archaeophytes and casual neophytes were more attractive to pollinators. In contrast to casual neophytes, the established neophytes' strategy was associated with a large reproductive output. Yet, auto-fertility was not associated with range size, since archaeophytes reached the largest range sizes. Elucidating how breeding systems affect invasion success is crucial for predicting and managing invasions.","[Corli, Anna; Sheppard, Christine S.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, August von Hartmann Str 3, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Corli, Anna] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via S Epifanio 14, Pavia, Italy","Sheppard, CS (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, August von Hartmann Str 3, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",anna.corli01@universitadipavia.it; christine.sheppard@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Corli, Anna/0000-0003-0672-4969; Sheppard, Christine S./0000-0002-7847-2310",German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SH 924/1-1],"This research was funded by the German Research Foundation, grant number SH 924/1-1.",,64,2,2,3,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2223-7747,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,APR,2019,8,4,,,,,,,108,10.3390/plants8040108,,,16,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,HX3MN,WOS:000467296200031,31018600,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-30,

Promoting a more diverse mammalian herbivore community, including large and megaherbivores, may result in positive cascade effects for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Therefore, reintroducing an ecologically functional substitute of an extinct large herbivore could mitigate current biodiversity declines and foster semi-natural grassland conservation. To test this hypothesis, we set up a 3-year rewilding experiment where 12 feral horses were introduced in three 10-hectare enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure). We used community-weighted mean plant functional traits to elucidate plant community changes induced by grazing through time. We also investigated the effects of this experimental treatment on insect pollinated plants and on pollinator habitat use. The grassland community exerted a mixed tolerance/avoidance response to grazing. This resulted in plant functional compositional changes which favoured prostrate plant species with higher specific leaf area, characteristic of ruderal communities. Plant species richness was higher in grazed compared to ungrazed areas. Butterfly and bumblebee habitat use, as well as feeding and resting activities were also higher in grazed areas. Moreover, the number of pollinators increased with plant species richness.Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that, to enhance the diversity of a given herbivore community with ecological replacements of extinct wild horses can have significant effects on the functional composition of grasslands. It can also mitigate plant species declines, in particular bee-dependent plants, and boost pollinator habitat use. Novel management alternatives are urgently needed to reverse the negative effect of land abandonment in European agricultural landscapes. Thus, rewilding interventions with large mammalian herbivores may offset current biodiversity declines by maintaining important functional links between plants and pollinators in grassland ecosystems.

The first was a split-plot design: Rhizobium (with or without inoculation) and three cropping systems (faba bean/maize intercropping and corresponding monocultures). The second and third experiments were both single-factorial randomized block designs with nine cropping systems (maize intercropped with faba bean, chickpea, soybean, or oilseed rape, and the corresponding monocultures). Soil aggregates were determined by the wet sieving method. Microbial biomass and community composition in 2015 and 2016 were determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and high throughput sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA.ResultsSoil macro-aggregates (> 2mm) in intercropping systems increased by 15.5-58.6% across three sites and two years, an effect derived partly from increased relative abundance of soil Sordariales, from enhanced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biomass, or from reduced relative abundance of Nitrospirae, depending on soil type.ConclusionsIntercropping alters soil microbial community composition and further facilitates soil aggregation. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning.","[Tian, Xiu-li; Li, Xiao-fei; Ding, Guo-chun; Christie, Peter; Li, Long] China Agr Univ, Beijing Key Lab Biodivers & Organ Farming, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Key Lab Plant & Soil Interact,Chinese Minist Educ, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Cheng-bao; Bao, Xing-guo; Yang, Si-cun] Gansu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Soils Fertilizers & Water Saving Agr, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ping] Ningxia Acad Agr & Forestry, Inst Crop Sci, Yinchuan 750105, Ningxia, Peoples R China","Li, L (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Beijing Key Lab Biodivers & Organ Farming, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Key Lab Plant & Soil Interact,Chinese Minist Educ, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",lilong@cau.edu.cn,"Li, Long/A-4998-2013; Christie, Peter/B-7919-2008","Li, Long/0000-0003-0523-3308; Christie, Peter/0000-0002-1939-7277; ding, guo-chun/0000-0002-5468-5979; Tian, Xiuli/0000-0002-8555-3821",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31430014],We appreciate Prof. Huiru Peng from China Agricultural University for her great help in statistical analysis of results.

Among such insect-pollinated crops, oilseed rape (Brassica napes) is increasingly cultivated worldwide. However, the degree to which seed set in B. napus depends on insect pollination is still under debate. To compare research approaches for estimating pollinator dependency, we reviewed the relevant literature published between 1956 and 2018. The majority of the studies were conducted in Europe (75%) on winter cultivars (77%) and monitored honeybees (52%). Our main findings are: (1) Dependency on insect pollination differs among cultivars and regions. (2) Field observations provide more realistic and comparable results than observations on caged plants. (3) Field conditions, soil nutrient availability, and pest management practices all influence insect dependency and subsequent yield. (4) Plot size conditions pollinator behaviour, as pollination success can be related to insect density or diversity depending on the size of the plot. (5) Insect numbers vary according to the observation distances within a field. (6) Comparison between studies is complicated by the use of different proxies to assess final yield, which may not be equivalent. We provide several recommendations to improve the reliability of future studies of oilseed rape pollination and of insect pollination dependency such as choosing open field observations compared to bag, cage or greenhouse studies, registering field conditions (pests, pesticides, fertilisation level) and defining yield as total seeds per plant to take into consideration compensation mechanisms.","[Ouvrard, Pierre; Jacquemart, Anne-Laure] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Agron Genet Reprod Populat Res Grp, Croix Sud 2,Box L7-05-14, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium","Jacquemart, AL (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Agron Genet Reprod Populat Res Grp, Croix Sud 2,Box L7-05-14, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",anne-laure.jacquemart@uclouvain.be,,"Ouvrard, Pierre/0000-0002-2805-4583","Fonds pour la formation a la Recherche dans 'Industrie et dans 'Agriculture (FRIA, Belgium)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS","P.

Conservation measures that are easy to implement and accepted by farmers are needed to halt a further loss of pollinators in large areas under intensive agricultural management. Here we report the results of a replicated long-term study involving networks of mostly perennial flower strips covering 10% of a conventionally managed agricultural landscape in southwestern Germany. Results: We demonstrate the considerable success of these measures for wild bee and butterfly species richness over an observation period of 5 years. Overall species richness of bees and butterflies but also the numbers of specialist bee species clearly increased in the ecological enhancement areas as compared to the control areas without ecological enhancement measures. A three to five-fold increase in species richness was found after more than 2 years of enhancement of the areas with flower strips. Oligolectic bee species increased significantly only after the third year. Conclusions: In our long-term field experiment we used a large variety of seed mixtures and temporal variation in seeding time, ensured continuity of the flower-strips by using perennial seed mixtures and distributed the measures over c. 10% of the landscape. This led to an increase in pollinator abundance, suggesting that these measures may be instrumental for the successful support of pollinators. These measures may ensure the availability of a network of diverse habitats and foraging resources for pollinators throughout the year, as well as nesting sites for many species. The measures are applied in-field and are suitable for application in areas under intensive agriculture. We propose that flower strip networks should be implemented much more in the upcoming CAP (common agricultural policy) reform in the European Union and promoted more by advisory services for farmers.","[Buhk, Constanze; Oppermann, Rainer; Bleil, Richard; Luedemann, Julian] Inst Agroecol & Biodivers IFAB, Bocklinstr 27, D-68163 Mannheim, Germany; [Buhk, Constanze] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany; [Schanowski, Arno] ILN, Sandbachstr 2, D-77815 Buhl, Germany; [Maus, Christian] Bayer AG, Bee Care Ctr, D-40789 Monheim, Germany","Buhk, C (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany.",buhk@uni-landau.de,,"Buhk, Constanze/0000-0003-1408-0446","Bayer AGBayer AG [610996063, 611132244, 611755309]; BayerBayer AG","The study was supported by Bayer AG (https://www.bayer.com), Grant numbers 610996063, 611132244, 611755309 received by the Institute of Agroecology and Biodiversity (IFAB) in Mannheim (RO).

Under in situ conditions, the biotic and abiotic factors determining the composition and distribution of orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) communities remain largely unexplored. Therefore in situ experiments are needed to better understand the interactions between orchids and fungi. A seedling-trap experiment was conducted in the Reserva Biologica San Francisco, a well-known biodiversity hotspot located in the Andes of southern Ecuador. The objective was to investigate the effect of orchid species, site, elevation or temporal variation on the assembly and structure of OMF associated with Cyrtochilum retusum and Epidendrum macrum. The OMF community composition was determined using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region. The results exhibited 83 OMF operational taxonomic units belonging to Tulasnellaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae, Serendipitaceae and Atractiellales. It was observed that the composition of the OMF communities was different among orchid species and temporal variation but was not different among sites. The results further support that orchids have a core of keystone OMF that are ubiquitously distributed and stable across temporal change, whereas the majority of these fungi are randomly associated with the plants.","[Cevallos, Stefania; Declerck, Stephane] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Lab Mycol, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Cevallos, Stefania; Pablo Suarez, Juan] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Ciencias Biol, Loja, Ecuador","Suarez, JP (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Ciencias Biol, Loja, Ecuador.",jpsuarez@utpl.edu.ec,"Suarez, Juan Pablo/D-1839-2009","Suarez, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-9453-5545; Cevallos, Stefania/0000-0001-5638-5112",,,,77,9,9,2,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

From the statistical analysis, it can be seen that the performance of MFC was not influenced by the interaction between the initial COD and time, pH and time, pH and initial COD, time and initial COD. However, the interaction between the inoculum composition and time, pH and the inoculum composition, initial COD and inoculum composition significantly influenced the performance of MFC. Based on the RSM results, best performance (power density and COD removal efficiency) was obtained when the inoculum composition, initial COD, pH and time were about 1:1, 26.690 mg/L, 7.21 and 15.50 days, respectively. The predictions from the model were in close agreement with the experimental results suggesting that the proposed model could adequately represent the actual relationships between the independent variables generating electricity and the COD removal efficiency.","[Islam, M.

Reduced carbon partitioning to mycorrhizal fungi (i.e., per unit photosynthesis) is the hypothesized underlying mechanism, as mycorrhizal abundance and plant dependence on these symbionts typically decrease with increasing nutrient availability. In a mesocosm experiment with Zea mays, we investigated the effect of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition and of mycorrhizal inoculation on BPE. Photosynthesis and respiration were measured at mesocosm scale and at leaf scale. The growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was assessed with ingrowth bags while also making use of the difference in delta C-13 between C-4 plants and C-3 soil. Mesocosms without AMF, that is, with pasteurized soil, were used to further explore the role of AMF. Plant growth, photosynthesis, and BPE were positively affected by P, but not by N addition. AMF biomass also was slightly higher under P addition, but carbon partitioning to AMF was significantly lower than without P addition. Interestingly, in the absence of AMF, plants that did not receive P died prematurely. Our study confirmed the hypothesis that BPE increases with increasing nutrient availability, and that carbon partitioning to AMF plays a key role in this nutrient effect. The comparison of inoculated vs. pasteurized mesocosms further suggested a lower carbon cost of nutrient uptake via AMF than via other mechanisms under nutrient rich conditions.","[Verlinden, Melanie S.; Ven, Arne; Verbruggen, Erik; Janssens, Ivan A.; Vicca, Sara] Univ Antwerp, Res Ctr Excellence Plants & Ecosyst, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Wallander, Hakan] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Verlinden, MS (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Res Ctr Excellence Plants & Ecosyst, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",Melanie.Verlinden@uantwerpen.be,"Vicca, Sara/I-3637-2012; Verbruggen, Erik/AAF-1018-2019; Janssens, Ivan A/P-1331-2014","Vicca, Sara/0000-0001-9812-5837; Verbruggen, Erik/0000-0001-7015-1515; Janssens, Ivan A/0000-0002-5705-1787; Verlinden, Melanie/0000-0002-2077-6776; Wallander, Hakan/0000-0002-9220-4590",Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)FWO; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [ERC-SyG-610028 IMBALANCE-P]; ClimMani COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [ES1308]; Methusalem of the Research Council UA,"This research was supported by the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO), by the European Research Council grant ERC-SyG-610028 IMBALANCE-P, by the ClimMani COST Action (ES1308) and by Methusalem funding of the Research Council UA.

Protists on the other hand play an acknowledged role in plant N acquisition, and there is increasing evidence for a close interaction with AMF. In a split root set up, we investigated the distinct roles of mycorrhiza (Rhizophagus irregularis), protists (Acanthamoeba castellanii), and their interaction on plant N uptake, within-root system allocation patterns, and shoot-to-root ratio of winter wheat. In addition, we applied a quantitative metabolomics approach to characterize associated changes in soil microbial communities by microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis from rhizosphere soil. AMF markedly altered plant shoot-to-root allometry by reducing root biomass of wheat, and mycorrhiza partly took over root system functioning. Protists promoted shoot and root growth, and improved plant N uptake by the release of N from consumed bacterial biomass, a mechanism known as microbial loop. The shoot system however responded little to these alterations of the root system and of the rhizosphere community composition, indicating that the plants optimized shoot growth despite varying investment into roots. Mycorrhiza reduced root biomass and plant N, especially in the combined treatments with protists by changing within root system allocation of N and root biomass. These systemic effects on root allocation pattern suggest that mycorrhiza also gained control over N provided by protist grazers. Protists and mycorrhiza altered rhizosphere bacterial communities in contrasting but consistent ways as shown by quantitative shifts in microbial PLFA profiles. Remarkably, the changes in bacterial community composition were systemically conveyed within the root system to the split-root chamber where the symbionts were lacking. Accordingly the synergistic effects of protists and mycorrhiza indicated systemic effects on nutrient- and on root-allocation within root systems as an emergent property that could not be predicted from single treatments with mycorrhiza or protists alone. The tight plant and microbial feed backs uncovered in this study have far reaching implications for understanding the assembly of plant microbiomes, and testify central roles of both protists and mycorrhizas in the assembly process.","[Henkes, Gunnar Jakob; Scheu, Stefan; Bonkowski, Michael] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, Dept Biol, Darmstadt, Germany; [Kandeler, Ellen; Marhan, Sven] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Soil Biol, Inst Soil Sci & Land Evaluat, Stuttgart, Germany; [Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Anim Ecol, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany; [Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, Gottingen, Germany; [Bonkowski, Michael] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Terr Ecol, Dept Biol, Cologne, Germany; [Bonkowski, Michael] Cluster Excellence Plant Sci CEPLAS, Cologne, Germany","Bonkowski, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, Dept Biol, Darmstadt, Germany.; Bonkowski, M (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Terr Ecol, Dept Biol, Cologne, Germany.; Bonkowski, M (corresponding author), Cluster Excellence Plant Sci CEPLAS, Cologne, Germany.",m.bonkowski@uni-koeln.de,,"Kandeler, Ellen/0000-0002-2854-0012",European Union Marie Curie BIORHIZ Research Network,"The authors thank Garvin Schulz for his help with the DFA analysis, Heather Hillers for revising an earlier version of the manuscript and two reviewers for their helpful comments.

Experimental assembly of tree species allows separation of the respective effects of plant community composition (biotic components) and soil properties (abiotic components), enabling much greater statistical power than can be achieved in observational studies. We therefore analyzed these contributions by assessing, via pyrotag sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) rDNA region, fungal communities in young subtropical forest plots included in a large experiment on the effects of tree species richness. Spatial variables and soil properties were the main drivers of soil fungal alpha and beta-diversity, implying strong early-stage environmental filtering and dispersal limitation. Tree related variables, such as tree community composition, significantly affected arbuscular mycorrhizal and pathogen fungal community structure, while differences in tree host species and host abundance affected ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition. At this early stage of the experiment, only a limited amount of carbon inputs (rhizodeposits and leaf litter) was being provided to the ecosystem due to the size of the tree saplings, and persisting legacy effects were observed. We thus expect to find increasing tree related effects on fungal community composition as forest development proceeds.","[Weissbecker, Christina; Wubet, Tesfaye; Lentendu, Guillaume; Buscot, Francois] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, Halle, Germany; [Weissbecker, Christina] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Wubet, Tesfaye; Bruelheide, Helge; Buscot, Francois] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Lentendu, Guillaume] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Ecol, Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Kuehn, Peter; Scholten, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, Chair Soil Sci & Geomorphol, Tubingen, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Halle, Germany","Weissbecker, C (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, Halle, Germany.; Weissbecker, C (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany.",christina.weissbecker@ufz.de,"Buscot, Francois/A-4125-2016; WeiSSbecker, Christina/AAK-1919-2020; Lentendu, Guillaume/ABF-4468-2020; Wubet, Tesfaye/C-6241-2012; Scholten, Thomas/E-4024-2012; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Kuhn, Peter/A-9146-2009","Buscot, Francois/0000-0002-2364-0006; WeiSSbecker, Christina/0000-0002-8212-6170; Lentendu, Guillaume/0000-0003-3826-6253; Wubet, Tesfaye/0000-0001-8572-4486; Scholten, Thomas/0000-0002-4875-2602; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Kuhn, Peter/0000-0002-4417-5633","German Research Foundation (DFG) within the framework of the Research Unit FOR 891 'BEF-China'German Research Foundation (DFG) [BU 941/12-2, BR1698/10-2]; Sino-German Center [GZ 785]; Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through the Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE)","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the framework of the Research Unit FOR 891 'BEF-China' [Grant Nos.

Climate change is rapidly altering thermal environments across the globe. The effects of increased temperatures in already warm environments may be particularly strong because organisms are likely to be near their thermal safety margins, with limited tolerance to additional heat stress. 2. We conduct an in situ field experiment over 2years to investigate the direct effects of temperature change on an early-season solitary bee in a warm, arid region of the Southwestern USA. Our field experiment manipulates the thermal environment of Osmia ribifloris (Megachilidae) from larval development through adult emergence, simulating both previous cooler (c. 1950; nest boxes painted white) and future warmer (2040-2099; nest boxes painted black) climate conditions. In each year, we measure adult emergence phenology, linear body size, body mass, fat content and survival. 3. Bees in the warming treatment exhibit delayed emergence phenology and a substantial increase in phenological variance. Increases in temperature also lead to reductions in body mass and fat content. Whereas bees in the cooling and control treatments experience negligible amounts of mortality, bees in the warming treatment experience 30%-75% mortality. 4. Our findings indicate that temperature changes that have occurred since c. 1950 have likely had relatively weak and non-negative effects, but predicted warmer temperatures create a high stress thermal environment for O.ribifloris. Later and more variable emergence dates under warming likely compromise phenological synchrony with floral resources and the ability of individuals to find mates. The consequences of phenological asynchrony, combined with reductions in body mass and fat content, will likely impose fitness reductions for surviving bees. Combined with high rates of mortality, our results suggest that O.ribifloris may face local extinction in the warmer parts of its range within the century under climate change. 5. Temperature increases in already warm ecosystems can have substantial consequences for key components of life history, physiology and survival. Our study provides an important example of how the responses of ectothermic insects to temperature increases in already warm environments may be insufficient to mitigate the negative consequences of future climate change.","[CaraDonna, Paul J.; Iler, Amy M.] Chicago Bot Garden, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA; [CaraDonna, Paul J.] Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, Evanston, IL USA; [CaraDonna, Paul J.; Cunningham, James L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA; [CaraDonna, Paul J.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Iler, Amy M.] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, Aarhus, Denmark","CaraDonna, PJ (corresponding author), Chicago Bot Garden, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA.",pcaradonna@chicagobotanic.org,"Iler, Amy Marie/Y-7201-2019","Iler, Amy Marie/0000-0002-3354-7593",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE 11-43953]; Danish National Research FoundationDanmarks Grundforskningsfond,"NSF, Grant/Award Number: DGE 11-43953; Danish National Research Foundation",,63,18,20,3,73,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Soil samples were collected from two field experiments treated for 5years with three fertilization systems (Control - no fertilization; Mineral - NPK fertilization; and Organic - Farmyard manure fertilization). Soil samples containing soil and root fragments of rapeseed (Brassica napus L., non-mycorrhizal plant) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L., mycorrhizal plant) collected from the field plots were used as native microbial inoculum sources to maize plants. Maize plants were sown in pots containing these inoculum sources for four months under glasshouse conditions. Colonization of wheat roots by AMF, AMF community structure, AMF diversity (Shannon's index), AMF dominance (Simpson's index) and growth of maize were investigated. Sixteen AMF species were identified from rhizosphere soil samples as different species of genera Acaulospora, Claroideoglomus, Dentiscutata, Funneliformis, Gigaspora, Quatunica, Racocetra, and Rhizoglomus. Maize plants grown in manure-fertilized soils had a distinct AMF community structure from plants either fertilized with mineral NPK-fertilizer or non-fertilized. The results also showed that inoculum from non-mycorrhizal plants combined with mineral fertilization decreased AMF diversity (Shannon's index), AMF dominance (Simpson's index) and growth of maize. Our findings suggest that non-mycorrhizal plants, such as B. napus, can negatively affect the presence and the effects of soil inoculation on maize growth. Also, our results highlight the importance of considering the long-term effect of rapeseed cultivation system on the reduction of population sizes of infective AMF, and its effect on succeeding annual crops.","[Feitosa de Souza, Tancredo Augusto; Santos, Djail] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soils & Rural Engn, Agrarian Sci Ctr, BR-58397000 Areia, Paraiba, Brazil","de Souza, TAF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soils & Rural Engn, Agrarian Sci Ctr, BR-58397000 Areia, Paraiba, Brazil.",tancredo_agro@hotmail.com,"de Souza, Tancredo Augusto Feitosa/I-3314-2019; Santos, Djail/P-9035-2014","de Souza, Tancredo Augusto Feitosa/0000-0001-8729-5478; Santos, Djail/0000-0003-2207-3115",,,,77,7,8,4,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0334-5114,1878-7665,,SYMBIOSIS,Symbiosis,OCT,2018,76,2,,,,,139,149,,10.1007/s13199-018-0546-3,,,11,Microbiology,Microbiology,GT5WF,WOS:000444580100006,,,,,2021-09-30,

Wetlands are transition ecosystems between aquatic and terrestrial systems, where shallow water stands or moves over the land surface. The presence of AMF in wetlands suggests that they are ecologically significant; however, their function is not yet clearly understood. With the aim of determining the overall magnitude and direction of AMF effect on wetland plants associated with them in pot assays, we conducted a meta-analysis of data extracted from 48 published studies. The AMF effect on their wetland hosts was estimated through different plant attributes reported in the studies including nutrient acquisition, photosynthetic activity, biomass production, and saline stress reduction. As the common metric, we calculated the standardized unbiased mean difference (Hedges' d) of wetland plant performance attributes in AMF-inoculated plants versus non-AMF-inoculated plants. Also, we examined a series of moderator variables regarding symbiont identity and experimental procedures that could influence the magnitude and direction of an AMF effect. Response patterns indicate that wetland plants significantly benefit from their association with AMF, even under flooded conditions. The beneficial AMF effect differed in magnitude depending on the plant attribute selected to estimate it in the published studies. The nature of these benefits depends on the identity of the host plant, phosphorus addition, and water availability in the soil where both symbionts develop. Our meta-analysis synthetizes the relationship of AMF with wetland plants in pot assays and suggests that AMF may be of comparable importance to wetland plants as to terrestrial plants.","[Khan Ramirez-Viga, Thai; Castillo-Arguero, Silvia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Av Univ 3000,Circuito Exterior S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Aguilar, Ramiro] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, CC 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Aguilar, Ramiro] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Nacl Anal & Sintesis Ecol LANASE, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Chiappa-Carrara, Xavier] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super Merida, Ave Colon 503-F, Merida 97000, Yucatan, Mexico; [Guadarrama, Patricia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Unidad Multidisciplinaria Docencia & Invest Sisal, Puerto Abrigo S-N, Sisal 97356, Yucatan, Mexico; [Ramos-Zapata, Jose] Univ Autonoma Yucatan, Dept Ecol Trop, Carretera Merida Xmatkuil Km 15-5, Merida 97100, Yucatan, Mexico","Chiappa-Carrara, X (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super Merida, Ave Colon 503-F, Merida 97000, Yucatan, Mexico.",chiappa@unam.mx,,"Ramirez Viga, Thai Khan/0000-0002-2724-9282; Aguilar, Ramiro/0000-0003-4741-2611","Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); Ensenanza de las metodologias para establecer las bases ecologicas de la restauracion y conservacion de humedales costeros PAPIME-DGAPA (Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos para la Innovacion y Mejoramiento de la ensenanza) [PE204012]; Diversidad vegetal y fungica del sistema lagunar de la Carbonera, Reserva Estatal de Cienagas y Manglares de la costa norte de Yucatan CONABIO (Comision Nacional para el Conocimiento y uso de la Biodiversidad) [JF078]; Bases metodologicas para la restauracion ecologica de ecosistemas costeros: de las dunas a los humedales PAPIME-DGAPA (Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos para la Innovacion y Mejoramiento de la ensenanza) [PE207216]; Consideraciones bio-ecologicas para establecer zonas prioritarias para la conservacion de la biodiversidad costera de Yucatan PAPIIT-DGAPA (Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica) [IN219515]; Diversidad funcional y diversidad taxonomica de la comunidad de peces que habita en el sistema de humedales de la costa norte de Yucatan PAPIIT-DGAPA (Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica) [IN220318];  [PIP 20150371];  [PICT 2016-0764]","To Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and to Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia.; R.

We measured CO2 effluxes from different soil components (ground surface litter, roots, mycorrhizae, soil organic matter) at a large-scale burn experiment designed to simulate a severe but realistic potential future scenario for the region (Fire plot) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, over 1year, and compared these measurements to replicated data from a nearby, unmodified Control plot. After four burns over 5 years, soil CO2 efflux (R-s) was similar to 5.5 t C ha(-1) year(-1) lower on the Fire plot compared to the Control. Most of the Fire plot R-s reduction was specifically due to lower ground surface litter and root respiration. Mycorrhizal respiration on both plots was around similar to 20% of R-s. Soil surface temperature appeared to be more important than moisture as a driver of seasonal patterns in R-s at the site. Regular fire events decreased the seasonality of R-s at the study site, due to apparent differences in environmental sensitivities among biotic and abiotic soil components. These findings may contribute toward improved predictions of the amount and temporal pattern of C emissions across the large areas of tropical forest facing increasing fire disturbances associated with climate change and human activities.","[Metcalfe, Daniel B.] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Metcalfe, Daniel B.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Rocha, Wanderley; Brando, Paulo M.] Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, Canarana, Brazil; [Balch, Jennifer K.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Brando, Paulo M.] Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA USA; [Doughty, Christopher E.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England","Metcalfe, DB (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden.",dbmetcalfe@gmail.com,"Brando, Paulo/AAC-9396-2019; Brando, Paulo M/C-4302-2012","Brando, Paulo/0000-0001-8952-7025; Brando, Paulo M/0000-0001-8952-7025; Metcalfe, Daniel/0000-0001-8325-9269",Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation [1656]; Jackson Foundation,"Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1656; Jackson Foundation",,79,11,12,3,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Here, we conducted a removal experiment to examine how AMF suppression and plant functional group (PFG) removal affect above-ground productivity and community composition in a grassland, and to determine whether AMF alter the compensation ability of the remaining plants. LocationInner Mongolian grassland, China. MethodsWe suppressed AMF activities by applying Topsin((R))-M as a soil drench and selectively removed PFGs to give three treatments (no removal, removal of C-3 grasses and removal of both C-4 grasses and forbs). We then measured various plant, soil and AMF parameters for each treatment combination. ResultsThe addition of Topsin-M effectively reduced mycorrhizal root colonization across all of the PFG removal treatments. Furthermore, above-ground productivity was significantly impacted by both the presence of AMF and the removal of PFGs. When C-3 grasses were removed, neither C-4 grasses nor forbs compensated for the biomass decline, and the presence of AMF did not affect their compensation ability. Conversely, C-3 grasses could completely compensate for the removal of both C-4 grasses and forbs, but the presence of AMF reduced their compensation ability. The removal of both C-4 grasses and forbs dramatically increased the shoot P content of C-3 grasses but AMF slightly decreased this. In contrast, AMF significantly increased the plant P content of C-4 grasses and forbs across all three PFG removal treatments. ConclusionOur results highlight the importance of AMF in structuring natural above-ground productivity under various biodiversity loss scenarios, and indicate that AMF will be able to modify vegetation dynamics in response to the future loss of plant diversity.","[Yang, Xin; Guo, Yanping; Zhang, Yingjun] China Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yue] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jishan] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Paratacultural Sci, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Zhang, YJ (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangyj@cau.edu.cn,,"Yang, Xin/0000-0002-3834-1092",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31472137]; Major State Basic Research Development Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB138805]; Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [CARS-34],"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31472137; Major State Basic Research Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2014CB138805; Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System (CARS-34)",,57,3,3,3,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

However, due to the inconsistent results reported in various publications, the response patterns of symbionts associated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to eCO(2) remains still unclear. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to identify how eCO(2) affected mycorrhizal fungi and if there is a significant different response between AM and ECM symbionts. Our results demonstrated that eCO(2) increased mycorrhizal plants biomass (+26.20%), nutrient contents [+2.45% in nitrogen (N), and +10.66% in phosphorus (P)] and mycorrhizal fungal growth (+22.87% in extraradical hyphal length and +21.77% in mycorrhizal fungal biomass), whereas plant nutrient concentrations decreased (-11.86% in N and -12.01% in P) because the increase in plant biomass was greater than that in nutrient content. The AM plants exhibited larger increases in their biomass (+33.90%) and in their N (+21.99%) and P contents (+19.48%) than did the ECM plants (+20.57% in biomass, -4.28% in N content and -13.35% in P content). However, ECM fungi demonstrated increased responses of mycorrhizal fungal biomass (+29.98%) under eCO(2) compared with AM fungi (+6.61%). These data indicate different patterns in the growth of AM and ECM symbionts under eCO(2): AM symbionts contributed more to plant growth, while ECM symbionts were more favorable to mycorrhizal fungal growth. In addition, the responses of plant biomass to eCO(2) showed no significant difference between short-term and long-term groups, whereas a significant difference in the responses of mycorrhizal fungal growth was found between the two groups. The addition of N increased plant growth but decreased mycorrhizal fungal abundance, and P addition increased total plant biomass and extraradical hyphal length, but shoot biomass largely increased in low P conditions. Mixtures of mycorrhizal fungi affected the total plant and root biomasses more than a single mycorrhizal fungus. Clarifying the different patterns in AM and ECM symbionts under eCO(2) would contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and plant symbionts under the conditions of global climate change as well as of the coevolution of flora with Earth's environment.","[Dong, Yuling; Sun, Hao; Yang, Weichao; Xu, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Pollut Ecol & Environm Engn, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Dong, Yuling; Sun, Hao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhenyu] Liaoning Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Biol & Chem Engn, Benxi, Peoples R China","Xu, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Pollut Ecol & Environm Engn, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",xuhui@iae.ac.cn,,,Non-profit Research Foundation for Agriculture [201103039],This work was supported by the Non-profit Research Foundation for Agriculture (201103039).,,116,14,14,9,65,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Recent work suggests that biotic interactions among plants and between plants and soil organisms drive key aspects of resource use complementarity. Here, we provide a conceptual framework for integrating positive biotic interactions across guilds of organisms, more specifically between plants and mycorrhizal types, to explain resource use complementarity in plants and its consequences for plant competition. Our overarching hypothesis is that ecosystem functioning increases when more plant species associate with functionally dissimilar mycorrhizal fungi because differing mycorrhizal types will increase coverage of habitat space for and reduce competition among plants. We introduce a recently established field experiment (MyDiv) that uses different pools of tree species that associate with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi to create orthogonal experimental gradients in tree species richness and mycorrhizal associations and present initial results. Finally, we discuss options for future mechanistic studies on resource use complementarity within MyDiv. We show how mycorrhizal types and biotic interactions in MyDiv can be used in the future to test novel questions regarding the mechanisms underlying biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships.","[Ferlian, Olga; Cesarz, Simone; Craven, Dylan; Hines, Jes; Bruelheide, Helge; Buscot, Francois; Haider, Sylvia; Herrmann, Sylvie; Pruschitzki, Ulrich; Schaedler, Martin; Weigelt, Alexandra; Wubet, Tesfaye; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Ferlian, Olga; Cesarz, Simone; Hines, Jes; Pruschitzki, Ulrich; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Craven, Dylan; Schaedler, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Barry, Kathryn E.; Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge; Haider, Sylvia; Heklau, Heike; Kuehn, Paul] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Buscot, Francois; Herrmann, Sylvie; Wubet, Tesfaye] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Wagg, Cameron] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Ferlian, O (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.; Ferlian, O (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",olga.ferlian@idiv.de,"Barry, Kathryn/AAI-5160-2021; Schadler, Martin/H-3176-2011; Wubet, Tesfaye/C-6241-2012; Cesarz, Simone/A-8468-2012; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Buscot, Francois/A-4125-2016; Wagg, Cameron/O-4318-2019; Craven, Dylan/K-2717-2012; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Cesarz, Simone/AAA-8702-2020; Haider, Sylvia/M-2990-2014","Barry, Kathryn/0000-0001-6893-6479; Schadler, Martin/0000-0001-9700-0311; Wubet, Tesfaye/0000-0001-8572-4486; Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Buscot, Francois/0000-0002-2364-0006; Wagg, Cameron/0000-0002-9738-6901; Craven, Dylan/0000-0003-3940-833X; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Haider, Sylvia/0000-0002-2966-0534; Kuhn, Paul/0000-0001-7916-3782",European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [677232]; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118],"NE, OF, and UP acknowledge support by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement no. 677232).

Here, we hypothesized that herbivore exclusion changes the AMF community and alters the ability of AMF to enhance plant tolerance to grazing. We grew the perennial bunchgrass, Themeda triandra Forssk in inoculum from soils collected in the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment where treatments representing different levels of herbivory have been in place since 1995. We assessed AMF diversity in the field, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and compared fungal diversity among treatments. We conducted clipping experiments in the greenhouse and field and assessed regrowth. Plants inoculated with AMF from areas accessed by wild herbivores and cattle had greater biomass than non-inoculated controls, while plants inoculated with AMF from where large herbivores were excluded did not benefit from AMF in terms of biomass production. However, only the inoculation with AMF from areas with wild herbivores and no cattle had a positive effect on regrowth, relative to clipped plants grown without AMF. Similarly, in the field, regrowth of plants after clipping in areas with only native herbivores was higher than other treatments. Functional differences in AMF were evident despite little difference in AMF species richness or community composition. Our findings suggest that differences in large herbivore communities over nearly two decades has resulted in localized, functional changes in AMF communities. Our results add to the accumulating evidence that mycorrhizae are locally adapted and that functional differences can evolve within small geographical areas.","[Gonzalez, Jonathan B.; Petipas, Renee H.; Brody, Alison K.] Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05465 USA; [Gonzalez, Jonathan B.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Sect Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Petipas, Renee H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Petipas, Renee H.; Veblen, Kari E.; Brody, Alison K.] Mpala Res Ctr, Box 555, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Franken, Oscar; Kiers, E.

This is particularly true in short-rotation coppices (SRCs), where questions of food displacement and fertilization are causes of concern for researchers and policy makers. We set out to thoroughly test if current inoculation methods, coupled with reduced fertilization, can demonstrate a growth benefit in SRC willows on marginal lands. Roughly 21,600 Salix miyabeana Seeman ('SX61' and 'SX64') were planted in a hierarchical design with inoculation treatments randomized first, cultivars randomized second, and fertilization treatments randomized third. This process was repeated across three fields of different marginal soil type (which, in our experiment, were given the descriptive names Sandy, Rocky, and Dry). The inoculum species, Rhizoglomus irregulare Blaszk., Wubet, Renker & Buscot Sieverd., G.A. Silva & Oehl and Hebeloma longicaudum (Pers.) P. Kumm., were chosen as they are most likely to be commercially available, and because they represent both arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal inoculum types. Growth was measured over 2.5 years, or three growing seasons. Fertilization treatment (75 kg/ha Nitrogen), however, was only applied during the second growing season. Our results conclusively showed no benefit from mycorrhizal inoculation across fields that exhibited significantly different growth rates, as well as significant differentiation from fertilization.","[Pray, Thomas Joseph; St-Arnaud, Marc; Labrecque, Michel] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Biodivers Ctr, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Pray, Thomas Joseph; St-Arnaud, Marc; Labrecque, Michel] Jardin Bot Montreal, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Nissim, Werther Guidi] Univ Florence, Dept Agrifood Prod & Environm Sci, I-50121 Florence 4, Italy","Labrecque, M (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Biodivers Ctr, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.; Labrecque, M (corresponding author), Jardin Bot Montreal, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.",tjpray@gmail.com; werther.guidinissim@unifi.it; marc.st-arnaud@umontreal.ca; michel.labrecque@umontreal.ca,"Nissim, Werther Guidi/K-5784-2016; St-Arnaud, Marc/D-1184-2017","Nissim, Werther Guidi/0000-0001-6738-0122; St-Arnaud, Marc/0000-0002-7181-9895","Agri-Food Innovation Support Program of the Quebec Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food","This study was conducted with the financial assistance of Agri-Food Innovation Support Program of the Quebec Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

We studied the effects of increased nutrient availability on the seedlings of six tree species in montane forests of southern Ecuador insitu. After five years of continued N, P, or N+P addition, naturally grown seedlings of each of the two most common species at each elevation (1000, 2000, and 3000m asl) were harvested for analyses of leaf morphology, nutrient content, herbivory, and tissue biomass allocation. Most species showed increased foliar N and P concentrations after addition of each respective element. Leaf tissue N:P ratios of >20 in the control plants of all species suggest that P is more growth-limiting in these forests than N. Leaf morphological responses to nutrient addition were species and nutrient specific, with some species (Hedyosmum purparescens, Graffenrieda emarginata) exhibiting increased specific leaf area (SLA), and others (Graffenrieda harlingii) increased leaf area ratios (LAR). Pouteria torta (1000m) had lower SLA and LAR after P addition. Increased herbivory was only evident in G. emarginata (after N and N+P addition). Only the species from 3000m asl modified biomass allocation after nutrient addition. In general, N and N+P addition more strongly affected the species studied at the upper elevations, whereas P addition had a similar range of effects on the species at all elevations. We conclude that the responses of the studied tropical montane forest tree seedlings to chronic N and P addition are highly species-specific and that successful adaptation to increased nutrient availability will depend on species-specific morphological and physiological plasticity.","[Carate-Tandalla, Daisy; Leuschner, Christoph; Homeier, Juergen] Univ Goettingen, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Untere Karspuele 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Camenzind, Tessa] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Plant Ecol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Camenzind, Tessa] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, Berlin, Germany","Homeier, J (corresponding author), Univ Goettingen, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Untere Karspuele 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",jhomeie@gwdg.de,"Homeier, Jurgen/G-1662-2011","Homeier, Jurgen/0000-0001-5676-3267","German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of DFG research unitGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG HO 3296/2, HO 3296/4, FOR 816]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)","We gratefully acknowledge Marlene Kroner, Maria Lopez, Adrian Thiele, Jaime Pena, and Patricio Salas for assistance in the field, Anne Bergmann for help with leaf analysis, Antje Foerster for assisting in the AMF analyses and Simon Queenborough for advice in the statistical analyses.

Studies addressing single plant-animal interactions are common, but studies simultaneously considering multiple plant-animal interactions in a landscape context are still scarce. We selectively excluded flower-visiting insects on phytometer plants and quantified how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions shaped the reproductive success of a common annual plant, wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis). Floral herbivory by larvae of rape pollen beetles (Meligethes spp.) strongly reduced fruit production, but could be minimized by insecticide application. Total seed production (the product of fruit production and seeds per fruit) strongly increased with pollinator visitation. On average, pollinator access to plants enhanced seed numbers by 754%. Insecticide treatment almost redoubled this number. The landscape composition (proportion of semi-natural habitats in 1000 m radius) surrounding phytometer plants did not affect plant-animal interactions, presumably due to the high dispersal ability of both the pollen beetles and the major pollinators (syrphid flies, bumblebees). In conclusion, pest control increased reproductive success only in the case of sufficient pollination.","[Grass, Ingo; Bohle, Victoria; Tscharntke, Teja; Westphal, Catrin] Univ Goettingen, Dept Crop Sci, Agroecol, Grisebachstr 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Tscharntke, Teja] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Grass, I (corresponding author), Univ Goettingen, Dept Crop Sci, Agroecol, Grisebachstr 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",ingo.grass@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Grass, Ingo/H-7609-2019; Westphal, Catrin/F-9560-2015; Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014","Grass, Ingo/0000-0001-7788-1940; Westphal, Catrin/0000-0002-2615-1339; ",,,,49,7,8,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,FEB,2018,9,2,,,,,,,e02106,10.1002/ecs2.2106,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FY8CT,WOS:000427091200014,,gold,,,2021-09-30,

However, this role is often assumed, with limited or no experimental quantification of its real value. We examined publication trends in the research on ES provided by insects, ascertaining which ES and taxa have been more intensively investigated, and which methodologies have been used, with particular emphasis on experimental approaches. We first performed a systematic literature search to identify which ES have been attributed to insects. Then we classified the references retrieved according to the ES, taxonomic group and ecosystem studied, as well as to the method applied to quantify each ES (in four categories: no quantification, proxies, direct quantification and experiments). Pollination, biological control, food provisioning, and recycling organic matter are the most studied ES. However, the majority of papers do not specify the ES under consideration, and from those that do, most do not quantify the ES provided. From the rest, a large number of publications use proxies as indicators for ES, assuming or inferring their provision through indirect measurements such as species abundances, species density, species richness, diversity indices, or the number of functional groups. Pollinators, predators, parasitoids, herbivores, and decomposers are the most commonly studied functional groups, while Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera are the most studied taxa. Experimental studies are relatively scarce and they mainly focus on biological control, pollination, and decomposition performed in agroecosystems. These results suggest that our current knowledge on the ES provided by insects is relatively scarce and biased, and show gaps in the least-studied functional and taxonomic groups. An ambitious research agenda to improve the empirical and experimental evidence of the role played by insects in ES provision is essential to fully assess synergies between functional ecology, community ecology, and biodiversity conservation under current global changes.

However, the assumption that moths are also involved in pollination in New Zealand is underpinned by relatively little research. Here we review the evidence for moth pollination of flowering plants in New Zealand and compare the quality of evidence available with that of the global literature. Globally, the majority of experimental studies have focused on the hawkmoths (Sphingidae) and other specialist pollinators, leaving a substantial gap in knowledge concerning the role of smaller and more generalist moths as pollinators. New Zealand lacks native Sphingidae; however, members of Geometridae, Noctuidae and Erebidae, all identified as pollinators globally, are mentioned as flower-visitors in New Zealand more than expected given their family sizes. In addition to these families, Oecophoridae are mentioned as flower-visitors in New Zealand but this has not been documented globally, suggesting new mutualisms may have evolved in New Zealand. Eight plant families: Alseuosmiaceae, Argophyllaceae, Campanulaceae, Gentianaceae, Goodeniaceae, Montiaceae, Pittosporaceae and Stylidiaceae, were mentioned in the context of moth pollination in New Zealand, but not in the global literature. The Orchidaceae family is most frequently mentioned in the context of moth pollination globally, but was not mentioned at all in the New Zealand literature, despite two endemic genera, Winika and Earina, showing floral features suggestive of moth pollination. The evidence to support pollination by moths in New Zealand comes predominantly from observations of flower-visitation and assumptions based on floral features. As this is not proof of effective pollen transfer, detailed experimental studies are required before the importance of moths as pollinators in New Zealand can be accurately gauged.","[Buxton, Max N.; Lord, Janice M.] Univ Otago, Dept Bot, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Anderson, Barbara J.] Landcare Res, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Buxton, Max N.] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Ruakura Res Ctr, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand","Buxton, MN (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Bot, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Buxton, MN (corresponding author), New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Ruakura Res Ctr, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",max.buxton@plantandfood.co.nz,"Lord, Janice Marjorie/A-8869-2012; Buxton, Max/AAQ-9618-2020","Lord, Janice Marjorie/0000-0001-8314-0428; Buxton, Max/0000-0002-8010-4963","MBIE; Miss E.L.

On the example of two closely related forms of the fusca group in Andalucia, it is shown how to handle the different criteria of the biospecies concept. One is the high specifity of attraction of a male bee followed by a complex pseudocopulation behaviour which enables the correct pollen transfer within the species. The high specifity is caused by a highly remarkable imitation of the sexual pheromones of the mimicked female of the pollinator. Sexual pheromones of animals act as intraspecific signals which result in attractions of only males of the same species. Exactly this specific behaviour is triggered by the Ophrys flower, too. Thus the pollinator male is attracted only to those flowers which have the correct mixture of the pheromone molecules. To further ensure success the pollinating males also select other characters of the Ophrys flower as labellum size, colour, labellum hair characters, phenology and possibly habitat selections etc. In the sexual reproduction behaviour of the male insect acts as pregamic isolation mechanisms for the given Ophrys like for their own female. We were successful in confirming the high specifity of the pollination mechanisms in numerous field experiments, mainly choice experiments, this in contrast o the statements of Hennecke & Munzinger (2013). They had argued that there were many different pollinator species listed in the literature for a given Ophrys species. However, they did not critically assess the reliability of these citations. For this, they would have had to critically read the primary literature and not only the secondary quotations like in Delforge (2005, 2016) or others. Therefore, they rehashed many of the old mistakes concerning wrong identifications of the bees or even the Ophrys taxons which had long been corrected. Especially a mixture of old and actual names of the same species in different combinations is annoying and seems to demonstrate that the authors are not really fit in the nomenclature of Ophrys and their pollinators. This is demonstrated by some examples, which are very confusing without knowledge of the bees. For example, these authors did not realize that a 3-4 mm bee (Andrena hesperia) could not serve as a pollinator of a 20 mm labellum of a large Ophrys omegaifera species. However, there are some cases with more than one pollinator. Besides the main pollinator the others I call them secondary pollinators which in those cases we could check their pollination contribution in the population is very weak. In many cases, these secondary visitors are mainly pollinaria thieves because they are only attracted and try to copulate. However, they seem learn very quickly that Ophrys is not a true female and will never visit another flower of this kind. In some quantitative field experiments (with Eucera nigrescens/longicornis on Ophrys holosericea) we could confirm this hypothesis. The conclusion of the two authors that Ophrys species are not species-specific regarding sexual attractivity does not correspond to our field experiments regarding olfactory compound investigations in biotests, and does not agree with the molecular data of population biology and with the genetic analyses. The other proof the authors used in their argumentations are the supposed frequency of hybrids. But this is also a spurious argument. Hybrids are only frequent in literature and not in nature. In places frequently visited by orchid enthusiasts, the number of observed hybrids is conspicuously high, which may indicate hand pollination. The aim of the two authors has been to reduce the many species within Ophrys because they cannot be discriminated. Consequently, they try to establish a simplified classification system without any biological background. A complete anthropomorphic typological systematic like the Index of accepted plant names is issued by Kew Gardens. However, this is in the 21st century, 150 years after Darwin, a kind of middle age taxonomy. They use a quite typological morphospecies concept like in the book of Pederson & Faurhold (2007). This does not fit with nature.

Indeed, a number of studies, including a highly cited meta-analysis, have concluded that the trend for such interactions is competitive. Here we provide evidence that publication bias and study design have obscured our ability to assess the pollinator-mediated impacts of alien plants. In a meta-analysis of 76 studies, we demonstrate that alien/native status does not predict the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions among plants. Moreover, we found no evidence that similarity in floral traits or phylogenetic distance between species pairs influences the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions. Instead, we report that aspects of study design, such as distance between the control and nearest neighbour, and/or the arrangement of study plants better predict the impact of a neighbour than does alien/native status. Our study sheds new light on the role that publication bias and experimental design play in the evaluation of key patterns in ecology. We conclude that, due to the absence of clear, generalisable pollinator-mediated impacts of alien species, management schemes should base decisions on community-wide assessments of the impacts of individual alien plant species, and not solely on alien/native status itself.","[Charlebois, Julia A.; Sargent, Risa D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Charlebois, JA (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",julia.a.charlebois@gmail.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank J.

Alternatively, researchers can take advantage of natural' experiments, where experimental control is exercised by careful site selection. Recent advances in developing protocols for designing these pseudo-experiments' commonly do not consider the selection of the focal region and predictor variables are usually restricted to two. Here, we advance this type of site selection protocol to study the impact of multiple landscape scale factors on pollinator abundance and diversity across multiple regions. Using datasets of geographic and ecological variables with national coverage, we applied a novel hierarchical computation approach to select study sites that contrast as much as possible in four key variables, while attempting to maintain regional comparability and national representativeness. There were three main steps to the protocol: (i) selection of six 100x100km(2) regions that collectively provided land cover representative of the national land average, (ii) mapping of potential sites into a multivariate space with axes representing four key factors potentially influencing insect pollinator abundance, and (iii) applying a selection algorithm which maximized differences between the four key variables, while controlling for a set of external constraints. Validation data for the site selection metrics were recorded alongside the collection of data on pollinator populations during two field campaigns. While the accuracy of the metric estimates varied, the site selection succeeded in objectively identifying field sites that differed significantly in values for each of the four key variables. Between-variable correlations were also reduced or eliminated, thus facilitating analysis of their separate effects. This study has shown that national datasets can be used to select randomized and replicated field sites objectively within multiple regions and along multiple interacting gradients. Similar protocols could be used for studying a range of alternative research questions related to land use or other spatially explicit environmental variables, and to identify networks of field sites for other countries, regions, drivers and response taxa in a wide range of scenarios.","[Gillespie, Mark A.

Yet, how genomes achieve the ecological transition initiated by the transfer of complex biological traits remains poorly known. Here, we used experimental evolution, genomics, transcriptomics and high-resolution phenotyping to analyze the evolution of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum into legume symbionts, following the transfer of a natural plasmid encoding the essential mutualistic genes. We show that a regulatory pathway of the recipient R. solanacearum genome involved in extracellular infection of natural hosts was reused to improve intracellular symbiosis with the Mimosa pudica legume. Optimization of intracellular infection capacity was gained through mutations affecting two components of a new regulatory pathway, the transcriptional regulator efpR and a region upstream from the RSc0965-0967 genes of unknown functions. Adaptive mutations caused the downregulation of efpR and the over-expression of a downstream regulatory module, the three unknown genes RSc3146-3148, two of which encoding proteins likely associated to the membrane. This over-expression led to important metabolic and transcriptomic changes and a drastic qualitative and quantitative improvement of nodule intracellular infection. In addition, these adaptive mutations decreased the virulence of the original pathogen. The complete efpR/RSc3146-3148 pathway could only be identified in the genomes of the pathogenic R. solanacearum species complex. Our findings illustrate how the rewiring of a genetic network regulating virulence allows a radically different type of symbiotic interaction and contributes to ecological transitions and trade-offs.","[Capela, Delphine; Marchetti, Marta; Clerissi, Camille; Perrier, Anthony; Guetta, Dorian; Gris, Carine; Masson-Boivin, Catherine] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LIPM, INRA, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Clerissi, Camille; Rocha, Eduardo P.

With the aim of obtaining in vivo produced ERM for gene expression analyses, a whole-plant bi-dimensional experimental system was devised and tested with three host plants and three fungal symbionts. In such a system, Funneliformis mosseae in symbiosis with Cichorium intybus var. foliosum, Lactuca sativa, and Medicago sativa produced ERM whose lengths ranged from 9.8 +/- 0.8 to 20.8 +/- 1.2 m per plant. Since ERM produced in symbiosis with C. intybus showed the highest values for the different structural parameters assessed, this host was used to test the whole-plant system with F. mosseae, Rhizoglomus irregulare, and Funneliformis coronatus. The whole-plant system yielded 1-7 mg of ERM fresh biomass per plant per harvest, and continued producing new ERM for 6 months. Variable amounts of high-quality and intact total RNA, ranging from 15 to 65 mu g RNA/mg ERM fresh weight, were extracted from the ERM of the three AMF isolates. Ammonium transporter gene expression was successfully determined in the cDNAs obtained from ERM of the three fungal symbionts by RT-qPCR using gene-specific primers designed on available (R. irregulare) and new (F. mosseae and F. coronatus) ammonium transporter gene sequences. The whole-plant experimental system represents a useful research tool for large production and easy collection of ERM for morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, suitable for a wide variety of AMF species, for a virtually limitless range of host plants and for studies involving diverse symbiotic interactions.","[Pepe, Alessandra; Giovannetti, Manuela] Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Via Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Sbrana, Cristiana] UOS Pisa, CNR, Inst Agr Biol & Biotechnol, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Ferrol, Nuria] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sistemas Simbiot, E-18008 Granada, Spain","Giovannetti, M (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Via Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",manuela.giovannetti@unipi.it,"SBRANA, CRISTIANA/AAQ-4983-2020",,University of Pisa; CNRConsiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),Financial support of University of Pisa and CNR is gratefully acknowledged.

However, the U.S. is witnessing a serious decline in the abundance and diversity of domestic and wild pollinators, which threatens U.S. food security. In response, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has created the Pollinator Habitat Initiative (CP-42) to induce landowners to create quality habitat for pollinators by planting beneficial crops and wildflowers on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)-eligible land. Landowners' potential conservation decisions under CP-42 and the resulting impact on land use decisions regarding crop production are not well-understood. We examine these issues by designing an economic experiment that simulates landowners' decisions to enroll in CP-42. As our motivating example, we focus on how CP-42 might affect crop production patterns and the resulting returns in Goshen County, Wyoming. The results indicate that about 16% of CRP-eligible land would be enrolled. Based on the relatively low CP-42 payment, our subjects remove only lower value crops from production. Our results suggest that (1) all dry wheat and sunflower production and a portion of barley, corn, and dry beans could be taken out of production when transferred to pollinator habitat, and (2) that habitat fragmentation would likely occur, which would reduce the efficacy of pollination. Overall, our results suggest that there are significant limits to the overall effectiveness of the CP-42 policy.","[Ritten, Chian Jones; Bastian, Christopher; Ehmke, Mariah D.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Panchalingam, Thadchaigeni] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Ritten, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",Chian.Jonesritten@uwyo.edu; Bastian@uwyo.edu; JRamses@uwyo.edu; panchalingam.1@buckeyemail.osu.edu; Mariah.Ehmke@uwyo.edu; gparkhurst2005@yahoo.com,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019; Ehmke, Mariah/J-1402-2019; Ritten, Chian Jones/AAA-8541-2021","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X; Ehmke, Mariah/0000-0003-0402-0896; ",Wyoming Open Spaces Initiative Competitive Grants Program,The authors appreciate the generous funding for this project from the Wyoming Open Spaces Initiative Competitive Grants Program.

Some habitats are supported through agri-environment scheme funding in the European Union, but their value for ecosystem service delivery has been questioned. An improved understanding of previous research approaches and outcomes will contribute to the development of more sustainable farming systems, improve experimental designs and highlight knowledge gaps especially for funders and researchers. Here we compiled a systematic map to allow for the first time a review of the quantity of evidence collected in Europe that semi-natural habitats support biological control, pollination and soil conservation. A literature search selected 2252 publications, and, following review, 270 met the inclusion criteria and were entered into the database. Most publications were of pest control (143 publications) with less on pollination (78 publications) or soil-related aspects (31). For pest control and pollination, most publications reported a positive effect of semi-natural habitats. There were weaknesses in the evidence base though because of bias in study location and the crops, whilst metrics (e.g. yield) valued by end users were seldom measured. Hedgerows, woodland and grassland were the most heavily investigated semi-natural habitats, and the wider landscape composition was often considered. Study designs varied considerably yet only 24% included controls or involved manipulation of semi-natural habitats. Service providers were commonly measured and used as a surrogate for ecosystem service delivery. Key messages for policymakers and funders are that they should encourage research that includes more metrics required by end users, be prepared to fund longer-term studies (61% were of only 1-year duration) and investigate the role of soils within semi-natural habitats in delivering ecosystem services.","[Holland, John M.; Crowley, Liam; James, Laura; Kor, Laura; Stevenson, David R.

Changes in predator communities might alter ecosystem services and subsequently sustainable management but these links have received little attention to date. Here, for the first time, we manipulated ant and flying vertebrate (birds and bats) access to oil palms in six smallholder plantations in Sumatra (Indonesia) and measured effects on arthropod communities, related ecosystem functions (herbivory, predation, decomposition and pollination) and crop yield. Arthropod predators increased in response to reductions in ant and bird access, but the overall effect of experimental manipulations on ecosystem functions was minimal. Similarly, effects on yield were not significant. We conclude that ecosystem functions and productivity in oil palm are, under current levels of low pest pressure and large pollinator populations, robust to large reductions of major predators.","[Denmead, Lisa H.; Darras, Kevin; Clouge, Yann; Grass, Ingo; Nurdiansyah, Fuad; Tscharntke, Teja] Univ Gottingen, Agroecol, Gottingen, Germany; [Denmead, Lisa H.] Toi Ohomai Inst Technol, Marine & Environm Management, Tauranga, New Zealand; [Clouge, Yann] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Lund, Sweden; [Diaz, Patrick; Nurdiansyah, Fuad; Fardiansah, Rico] Univ Jambi, Jambi, Indonesia; [Hoffmann, Munir P.] Univ Gottingen, Trop Plant Prod & Agr Syst Modelling, Gottingen, Germany","Darras, K (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Agroecol, Gottingen, Germany.",kdarras@gwdg.de,"Grass, Ingo/H-7609-2019; Nurdiansyah, Fuad/AAW-8132-2021; Nurdiansyah, Fuad/AAW-8131-2021; Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014; Hoffmann, Munir/AAB-6221-2019; Darras, Kevin Felix Arno/B-9672-2014","Grass, Ingo/0000-0001-7788-1940; Hoffmann, Munir/0000-0002-9791-5658; Darras, Kevin Felix Arno/0000-0002-9013-3784",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC 990 EFForTS],"We thank Derly Hartika, Marisi Italiansia, Leonarda Situmorang, Ilham, Fahrurozi, and Arie Perdana for all their help in the lab and the field.

However, herbivores can also impose selection on floral traits through a variety of mechanisms, including florivory and parasitism. Less well understood is whether floral and inflorescence architecture traits that influence a plant's tolerance to herbivory, such as compensatory regrowth, alter pollinator-mediated selection. Methods Because herbivore damage to Lythrum salicaria meristems typically leads to an increase in the number of inflorescences and the size of the floral display, an experiment was conducted to test whether simulated herbivory (i. e. clipping the developing meristem) could alter the magnitude or direction of pollinator-mediated selection on a suite of floral and inflorescence architecture traits. Using a pollen supplementation protocol, pollen limitation was compared in the presence and absence of meristem damage in order to quantify any interaction between pollinator and herbivore-mediated selection on floral traits. Key Results Surprisingly, in spite of an obvious impact on floral display and architecture, with clipped plants producing more inflorescences and more flowers, there was no difference in pollen limitation between clipped and unclipped plants. Correspondingly, there was no evidence that imposing herbivore damage altered pollinator-mediated selection in this system. Rather, the herbivory treatment alone was found to alter direct selection on floral display, with clipped plants experiencing greater selection for earlier flowering and weaker selection for number of inflorescences when compared with unclipped plants. Conclusions These findings imply that herbivory on its own can drive selection on plant floral traits and inflorescence architecture in this species, even more so than pollinators. Specifically, herbivory can impose selection on floral traits if such traits influence a plant's tolerance to herbivory, such as through the timing of flowering and/or the compensatory regrowth response.","[Thomsen, Christina J.

Facultative endosymbionts, including pathogens and mutualists, face changing and spatially structured environments during the symbiotic process, which impose diverse selection pressures. Here, we provide evidence that different selection regimes, involving different times spent in the plant environment, can result in either intra- or extracellular symbiotic adaptations. In previous work, we introduced the symbiotic plasmid of Cupriavidus taiwanensis, the rhizobial symbiont of Mimosa pudica, into the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and selected three variants able to form root nodules on M.pudica, two (CBM212 and CBM349) being able to rudimentarily infect nodule cells and the third one (CBM356) only capable of extracellular infection of nodules. Each nodulating ancestor was further challenged to evolve using serial ex planta-in planta cycles of either 21 (three short-cycle lineages) or 42days (three long-cycle lineages). In this study, we compared the phenotype of the 18 final evolved clones. Evolution through short and long cycles resulted in similar adaptive paths on lineages deriving from the two intracellularly infectious ancestors, CBM212 and CBM349. In contrast, only short cycles allowed a stable acquisition of intracellular infection in lineages deriving from the extracellularly infecting ancestor, CBM356. Long cycles, instead, favoured improvement of extracellular infection. Our work highlights the importance of the selection regime in shaping desired traits during host-mediated selection experiments.","[Marchetti, Marta; Clerissi, Camille; Yousfi, Yasmine; Gris, Carine; Capela, Delphine; Masson-Boivin, Catherine] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LIPM, INRA, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Clerissi, Camille; Rocha, Eduardo] Inst Pasteur, Microbial Evolutionary Genom, 25-28 Rue Dr Roux, F-75015 Paris, France; [Clerissi, Camille; Rocha, Eduardo] CNRS, UMR3525, 25-28 Rue Dr Roux, F-75015 Paris, France; [Bouchez, Olivier] INRA, GeT PlaGe, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Bouchez, Olivier] Univ Toulouse, GenPhySE, INRA, INPT,ENVT, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Cruveiller, Stephane] CNRS, UMR8030, 2 Rue Gaston Cremieux, F-91057 Evry, France; [Cruveiller, Stephane] CEA, Commissariat Energie Atom, DSV, IG,Genoscope LABGeM, 2 Rue Gaston Cremieux, F-91057 Evry, France; [Jauneau, Alain] UPS, CNRS, Federat Recherches Agrobiosci, Interact,Biodivers,Plateforme Imagerie TRI, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France","Masson-Boivin, C (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LIPM, INRA, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",catherine.masson@toulouse.inra.fr,"Rocha, Eduardo/B-7009-2009","Rocha, Eduardo/0000-0001-7704-822X","French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12-ADAP-0014-01]; French Laboratory of Excellence project 'TULIP' [ANR-10-LABX-41, ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02]; France Genomique National Infrastructure [ANR-10-INBS-09]; European Research Council starting grant [EVOMOBILOME] [281605]","We are grateful to Jacques Batut for helpful comments on the manuscript.

While inoculants are usually not necessary for plants cultivated outdoors on biologically active soil, they can be useful on sterile substrates, newly created artificial landscapes, and also in soils that have been managed using non-selective sterilization methods, such as fumigation. In a multi-year lysimeter experiment, we investigated the influence of a commercial mycorrhizal inoculum on water use efficiency and biomass production of maize (Zea mays), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis), sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), cup-plant (Silphium perfoliatum) and tall wheatgrass (Elymus elongatus subsp. ponticus cv. Szarvasi-1) when exposed to high or low ground-water levels. Results showed that all plants benefited from the mycorrhizal association. Mycorrhizal-inoculated plants were more successful in terms of dry matter production and water use than the non-mycorrhizal plants. The source of the mycorrhiza-autochthonous or introduced-made no significant difference. The results indicate that inoculation with mycorrhiza and promotion of the naturally abundant mycorrhiza in agricultural production systems can significantly contribute to a sustainable production of crops.

Although recent findings suggest that the disappearance of a certain pollinator functional group may cause niche expansions and/or shifts in other groups, no study has examined this prediction in natural communities with high plant and pollinator diversities. By comparing coastal pollination networks on continental and oceanic islands, we examined how community-level flower visit patterns are influenced by the relative biomass of long-tongued pollinators (RBLP). We found that RBLP significantly correlated with pollinator functional diversity and was lower in oceanic than in continental islands. Pollinator niches shifted with decreasing RBLP, such that diverse species with various proboscis lengths, especially short-tongued species, increasingly visited long-tubed flowers. However, we found no conspicuous negative impacts of low RBLP and the consequent niche shifts on pollinator visit frequencies to flowers in oceanic island communities. Notably, fruit set significantly decreased as RBLP decreased in a study plant species. These results suggest that niche shifts by other functional groups can generally compensate for a decline in long-tongued pollinators in natural communities, but there may be negative impacts on plant reproduction.","[Hiraiwa, Masayoshi K.; Ushimaru, Atushi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Human Dev & Environm, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan","Hiraiwa, MK (corresponding author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Human Dev & Environm, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",masayoshi.hiraiwa@gmail.com,"Ushimaru, Atushi/D-7036-2013","Ushimaru, Atushi/0000-0002-2051-1233","Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from the Japan Science Society; Kinki Branch of Ecological Society of Japan from The Japan Science Society for the Promotion of Science [16H02993]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H02993] Funding Source: KAKEN","This research was partly supported by a Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from the Japan Science Society, a grant for a young scientist from the Kinki Branch of Ecological Society of Japan, and grants-in-aid for A.

It has been thought that many large-flowered Rhododendron species are pollinated by local birds in the Himalayan regions because most of these species flower in spring at high elevation with cool atmospheric temperature. However, experimental evidence for the role of bird pollination in this hyper-diverse genus remains scarce. To examine the role of birds and insects in pollination, we observed floral visitors to 15 Rhododendron species with different floral sizes and abundant flowering individuals in the eastern Himalayas, Southwest China. To examine the role of birds and insects in female reproductive success in each species, cages were used to exclude birds but not insects from visiting flowers and net bags were used to exclude all floral visitors. Inflorescences where visitation was excluded did not produce fruits in any of the Rhododendron species, indicating that sexual reproduction in these species depended on pollinator visitation. Bird visits were generally less frequent than bee visits in the studied species. However, in the nine species on which bird visitors were observed, fruit and/or seed set were greatly reduced in inflorescences caged to exclude birds but not bees, compared to open-pollinated inflorescences. In the other six species on which bird visitation was not observed, fruit and seed set did not differ significantly between caged and open inflorescences except in one species (R. wardii). Manipulations to achieve selective exclusion of visitors demonstrated that birds could be effective pollinators for 10 out of 15 studied Rhododendron species in the eastern Himalayas. Floral characteristics of these Rhododendron species and weather conditions might favour the evolution of bird pollination systems in the East Himalayas.","[Huang, Zhi-Huan] Guangxi Inst Bot, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomou, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhi-Huan] Chinese Acad Sci, Guilin 541006, Peoples R China; [Song, Yun-Peng; Huang, Shuang-Quan] Cent China Normal Univ, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Sch Life Sci, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China","Huang, SQ (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Sch Life Sci, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",hsq@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31730012, 31700196]",This research was supported National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) grants no. 31730012 to S.-Q.H. and no. 31700196 to Z.-H.H.,,42,10,11,4,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2017,9,,,,,,,,plx062,10.1093/aobpla/plx062,,,10,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FS2TP,WOS:000419632200001,29308128,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-30,

Invasive non-native plants form interactions with native species and have the potential to cause direct and indirect impacts on those species, as well as the functioning of invaded ecosystems. 2. Many entomophilous invasive plants form interactions with resident pollinators; sometimes, these interactions are necessary for the reproductive success of the invader. However, the direct role native pollinators play in plant invasion is not well understood and varies according to invasive plant traits, including breeding system and pollination syndrome. 3. The majority of studies addressing impacts on plant-pollinator mutualisms have focussed on the indirect impacts of plant invasion for native plant pollination. Fewer studies have focussed on the direct effects of invasive plants on native flower visitors. 4. Impacts of invasive plants on native pollinators can occur at a range of scales: from the individual flower visitors (in terms of nutrition, health and fitness), to populations (size, density and growth rates), communities (richness, diversity and composition) and community-level interactions (insect-flower interaction networks). Most research to date has focussed on community-level impacts, with almost nothing known about the effects of invaders on native flower visitor individuals or populations. 5. Invasive plant traits, including reward quantity and quality, spatial and temporal availability and accessibility, modulate effects on native flower visitors, and thus, different plant species have different impacts. Similarly, flower visitors do not all respond in the same way to invasive plants. Thus, generalizations are difficult to make, but understanding impacts at the individual and population level for different visitor taxa is key to explaining community-level impacts. 6. There have been varied approaches to determining impacts, with most studies attempting to compare invaded vs. non-invaded habitats. The pros and cons of different approaches are discussed. 7. Since it is impractical to study every invasive plant in every ecological context in which it occurs, we recommend a better understanding of relevant individual-level traits to predict direct interactions between invasive plants and native pollinators.","[Stout, Jane C.; Tiedeken, Erin Jo] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Tiedeken, Erin Jo] Waterford Inst Technol, Natl Biodivers Data Ctr, Beechfield House,West Campus, Carriganore, Waterford, Ireland","Stout, JC (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland.",stoutj@tcd.ie,"Stout, Jane/AAS-8867-2020; Stout, Jane C/B-1631-2010","Stout, Jane/0000-0002-2027-0863; Stout, Jane C/0000-0002-2027-0863",,,,81,34,35,12,210,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Pollen limitation has direct implications in mating system and floral evolution, and negatively affects population dynamics. We assessed pollen limitation in the cactus Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus from the western Chihuahuan Desert. We performed a supplementary pollen treatment then compared outcomes with naturally pollinated flowers using generalized linear models (GLM) and a pollen limitation index (L). Floral aperture was compared between days of anthesis using a single ANOVA, whereas nectar production was contrasted between covered/uncovered flowers and days of anthesis using a factorial ANOVA. Results of both GLM and L show that seed set proportion decreases 0.22 as a result of pollen limitation in natural pollinated flowers contrasted with pollen-supplemented flowers. Most flowers opened two days, and floral aperture between the first and second day varied slightly. Nectar volume was higher in covered flowers, showing that floral visitors consume this reward. However, high variances in nectar volumes obscured potential differences between treatments. Competition for pollinators among flowers as a result of its synchronous flowering and patchy distribution, as well as limited bee abundance generated by anthropogenic disturbance, are the more plausible causes of pollen limitation in A. kotschoubeyanus.","[Martinez-Peralta, C.] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Escuela Estudios Super Jicarero, Carretera Galeana Tequesquitengo S-N, Jojutla 62909, Morelos, Mexico; [Mandujano, M.

During that time, many field methods have been developed to clarify the pollination effectiveness of each pollinator for visited flowers. Pollinator observations have been one of the most common methods to identify pollinators, and bagging and cage experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness of specific pollinators. In a previous study of Lycoris sanguinea var. sanguinea, its effective pollinators, the visitation frequencies of each floral visitor, and its reproductive strategies were not identified. This study reports the observation that small bees visited flowers that were partially opened ( breaking buds). To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been reported previously. Further, this study investigates the hypothesis that small bees can pollinate at that flowering stage. This study demonstrates the basic methods of field experiments in pollination ecology using L. sanguinea var. sanguinea. Pollinator observations and digital video showed the visitation frequencies of each floral visitor. Bagging and cage experiments revealed that these flowers could be pollinated fully and that breaking-bud pollination could be important for the pollination of this plant species. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed, and recent developments, including laboratory experiments, are described.","[Yamaji, Futa; Ohsawa, Takeshi A.] Chiba Univ, Dept Biol, Chiba, Chiba, Japan","Ohsawa, TA (corresponding author), Chiba Univ, Dept Biol, Chiba, Chiba, Japan.",asakawa@faculty.chiba-u.jp,,," [26.11613]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [14J11613] Funding Source: KAKEN",The authors thank the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on the manuscript.

However, remarkably few studies have examined geographic mosaics in resistance to floral antagonists or the consequences for other floral interactions. METHODS: Gelsemium sempervirens experiences frequent nectar robbing in northern Georgia, but rarely in southern Georgia. We conducted common-garden experiments in both locations using genotypes from each region and measured robbing, pollinator attraction, floral attractive and defensive traits, and plant reproduction. KEY RESULTS: Nectar robbing was more than four times higher in the north vs. south, and pollinator visits did not differ between gardens. Across both gardens, northern genotypes were half as likely to be nectar-robbed but received half as many pollinator visits as southern genotypes, suggesting evolution of resistance to robbing at a cost of reduced pollinator attraction. Plant-level traits, such as height and number of flowers, were more closely associated with resistance to robbing than floral size, shape, or chemistry. Northern genotypes had lower female and estimated male reproduction compared to southern genotypes at both locations, which could be due to costs of resistance to nectar robbing, or costs of adaptations to other biotic or abiotic differences between regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that geographic variation can play a strong role structuring interactions with floral antagonists and mutualists and provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that local resistance to nectar robbing imposes costs in terms of decreased pollinator attraction and reproduction.","[Adler, Lynn S.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Morrill Sci Ctr South 221, 611 N Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Leege, Lissa M.] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Biol, POB 8042-1, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Irwin, Rebecca E.] Dartmouth Coll, Life Sci Ctr, Dept Biol Sci, 78 Coll St, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Irwin, Rebecca E.] North Carolina State Univ, David Clark Labs 253, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Adler, LS (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Morrill Sci Ctr South 221, 611 N Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",lsadler@bio.umass.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0514398];  [NSF-DEB-0530850],"The authors thank J.

Honeybees have world-wide importance as crop pollinators. To ensure their persistence in agricultural systems, statistically robust field trials of plant protection products are vital. 2. We consider the implications of regulations from the European Food Safety Authority that require the detection of a 7% effect size change in bee colony sizes under field conditions. 3. Based on a power analysis, we argue that the necessary levels of replication (68 replicates) may pose practical constraints to field testing. 4. Policy implications. Regulatory studies benefit from data sources collated over a range of spatial scales, from laboratory to landscapes. Basing effect size thresholds solely on expert judgement, as has been done, may be inappropriate. Rather, definition through experimental or simulation studies that assess the biological consequences of changes in colony size for bee populations is required. This has implications for regulatory bodies outside the European Union.","[Woodcock, Ben A.; Heard, Matthew S.; Jitlal, Mark S.; Bullock, James M.; Pywell, Richard F.] NERC Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Maclean Bldg, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Rundlof, Maj] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Shore, Richard F.] NERC Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lib Ave, Lancaster Bailrigg LA1 4AP, England","Woodcock, BA (corresponding author), NERC Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Maclean Bldg, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",bawood@ceh.ac.uk,"Shore, Richard/A-2638-2012; Woodcock, Benjamin Alex/F-9199-2010; Bullock, James M/F-9997-2011; Pywell, Richard F/E-8738-2010","Shore, Richard/0000-0002-9337-8883; Woodcock, Benjamin Alex/0000-0003-0300-9951; Pywell, Richard F/0000-0001-6431-9959",Bayer Crop ScienceBayer AG; SyngentaSyngenta; Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency; Carl Tryggers Foundation for Scientific Research; Royal Physiographic Society; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [330-2014-6439]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish,"This work was carried out in preparation for a large-scale field experiment on the impacts of neonicotinoids on pollinators jointly funded by Bayer Crop Science and Syngenta.

Many invasive alien plants are, in contrast to many non-invasive ones, self-compatible and autofertile and thus do not fully depend on mates and pollinators for seed production. Nevertheless, they often still depend on pollinators for maximal reproduction. Indeed, it has been shown that many invasive plants can attract pollinators in the non-native range and may attract more of them than non-invasive plants do. This suggests that many introduced alien plants may have failed to become invasive because they are pollen-limited. 2. We used an experimental approach to test whether non-invasive alien species suffer higher pollen limitation and have lower autofertility than invasive aliens and natives. In a common garden, we assessed the degree of pollen limitation and autofertility of eight confamilial (or congeneric) triplets of native, invasive and non-invasive (but naturalized) alien plant species (totalling 24 species). Our breeding-system experiment included three treatments: pollen supplementation, open pollination and pollinator exclusion. We report three measures of pollen limitation and autofertility (fruit set, seed production per fruit and indices of pollen limitation and autofertility based on seed production per flower). 3. We found that the three plant groups had low degrees of pollen limitation and were almost all autofertile to some degree. Moreover, our phylogenetically informed analyses showed that the three plant groups did not differ significantly in their degrees of pollen limitation and autofertility. 4. Our results support previous findings that alien plants are able to attract pollinators in non-native regions. Nevertheless, because invasive and non-invasive naturalized alien species did not differ in their degrees of pollen limitation, our results suggest that pollen limitation may not play a major role in the spread of alien plants, once they have become naturalized.","[Razanajatovo, Mialy; van Kleunen, Mark] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Ecol, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Razanajatovo, M (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Ecol, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",mialy.razanajatovo@uni-konstanz.de,,"van Kleunen, Mark/0000-0002-2861-3701",International Max Planck Research School for Organismal Biology; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [KL1866/3-1],"We thank O.

In this study, genotypic and phenotypic variations among hexaploids and octoploids from H. lahue were assessed based on quantitative floral traits and ISSR markers. Additionally, gynoecium and breeding systems were analysed through anatomical analysis and hand-pollination experiments. Cytotypes are self-compatible, and the anatomy of the embryo sac remains similar in hexaploids and octoploids. AMOVA indicates that hexaploid populations are less genetically variable than octoploids (respectively 4 and 22 %, P < 0.001), thus the largest source of genetic variation for H. lahue lies among populations (82 %, P < 0.001), probably a combined effect of selfing, changes in population size, and local adaptation. Genetic variation between cytotypes was significant (16 %, P < 0.001), though unclear segregation among cytotypes was discovered through PCoA. A Mantel test indicated no relationship between geographic and genetic distances (r = 0.04; P = 0.37), possibly as a result of the combined effect of the recurrent origin of polyploids, gene flow restricted by selfing, and poor capacity for seed dispersal. In terms of floral measurements, eight measures of perigonium, androecium, and gynoecium varied significantly between cytotypes, though no clear grouping was defined by PCA. Presumably, complex variation in floral characters across cytotypes may result in the absence of distinct grouping by PCA. The combined use of ISSR markers and morphological characters revealed a complex relationship between H. lahue cytotypes shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.","[Stiehl-Alves, Eudes M.; Kaltchuk-Santos, Eliane; de Souza-Chies, Tatiana T.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Genet & Biol Mol, PoBox 15053, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Stiehl-Alves, Eudes M.; Flores, Alice M.; Heck, Juliana; Eggers, Lilian; de Araujo Mariath, Jorge E.; de Souza-Chies, Tatiana T.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Bot, Av Bento Goncalves,9500 Bloco 4 Predio 43432-2, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Silverio, Adriano] Univ Estadual Centro Oeste, Dept Ciencias Biol, 875 Rua Salvatore Renna, BR-85015430 Guarapuava, PR, Brazil","Stiehl-Alves, EM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Genet & Biol Mol, PoBox 15053, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.; Stiehl-Alves, EM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Bot, Av Bento Goncalves,9500 Bloco 4 Predio 43432-2, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",eudes.alves@ufrgs.br,"Mariath, Jorge/D-8748-2016; Chies, T* Souza-Chies OR/I-4534-2012; Silverio, Adriano/F-7121-2013","Chies, T* Souza-Chies OR/0000-0002-1818-8748; Silverio, Adriano/0000-0002-7064-4018; Eggers, Lilian/0000-0002-5187-1493; Stiehl-Alves, EudesM/0000-0003-1733-7315","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (PROTAX)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [562261/2010-9, 477533/2009-4, 478588/2011-9]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, via Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Genetica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul [142070/2009-2]","This study was funded by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (PROTAX, Grant no. 562261/2010-9; Edital Universal, Grant no. 477533/2009-4, and Edital Universal, Grant no. 478588/2011-9), and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, via Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Genetica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (Grant no. 142070/2009-2).",,64,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0378-2697,1615-6110,,PLANT SYST EVOL,Plant Syst.

One determinant of these neighborhoods is per-flower production of pollen and nectar, which is likely to respond to environmental influences. In this study, we explored environmental effects on pollen and nectar production and on pollination success in order to follow up a surprising result from a previous study: flowers of Ipomopsis aggregata received less pollen in years of high visitation by their hummingbird pollinators. A new analysis of the earlier data indicated that high bird visitation corresponded to drought years. We hypothesized that drought might contribute to the enigmatic prior result if it decreases both nectar and pollen production: in dry years, low nectar availability could cause hummingbirds to visit flowers at a higher rate, and low pollen availability could cause them to deposit less pollen per visit. A greenhouse experiment demonstrated that drought does reduce both pollen and nectar production by I. aggregata flowers. This result was corroborated across 6 yr of variable precipitation and soil moisture in four unmanipulated field populations. In addition, experimental removal of pollen from flowers reduced the pollen received by nearby flowers. We conclude that there is much to learn about how abiotic and biotic environmental drivers jointly affect pollen and nectar production and availability, and how this contributes to pollen and nectar neighborhoods and thus influences pollination success.","[Waser, Nickolas M.; Price, Mary V.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, POB 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Waser, Nickolas M.; Price, Mary V.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Waser, NM (corresponding author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, POB 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.; Waser, NM (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",nickolas.waser@ucr.edu,,,,,,51,56,56,4,113,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2016,97,6,,,,,1400,1409,,10.1890/15-1423.1,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DN6XN,WOS:000377219900004,27459771,Green Published,,,2021-09-30,

Understanding climate change effects on AMF, and the resulting plant responses, is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses at regional and global scales. We investigated how the effects of climate change on AMF-plant symbioses are mediated by soil water availability, soil nutrient availability, and vegetation dynamics. Methods: We used a combination of a greenhouse experiment and a manipulative climate change experiment embedded within a Mediterranean climate gradient in the Pacific Northwest, USA to examine this question. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine the direct and indirect effects of experimental warming on AMF colonization. Results: Warming directly decreased AMF colonization across plant species and across the climate gradient of the study region. Other positive and negative indirect effects of warming, mediated by soil water availability, soil nutrient availability, and vegetation dynamics, canceled each other out. Discussion: A warming-induced decrease in AMF colonization would likely have substantial consequences for plant communities and ecosystem function. Moreover, predicted increases in more intense droughts and heavier rains for this region could shift the balance among indirect causal pathways, and either exacerbate or mitigate the negative, direct effect of increased temperature on AMF colonization.","[Wilson, Hannah; Mueller, Rebecca] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Johnson, Bart R.] Univ Oregon, Dept Landscape Architecture, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Bohannan, Brendan; Pfeifer-Meister, Laurel; Bridgham, Scott D.] Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Wilson, H (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",hwilson1@uoregon.edu,"Bridgham, Scott/R-1557-2017; Bohannan, Brendan J.

Bee-friendly pest management, improving native bee habitats within agro-forest ecosystems and fostering the husbandry of native bee species are three widely recognized strategies to conserve the local pollinating fauna. We attempted at eliciting farmers' valuation of these measures and that of their potential effect on local native bees, by conducting a choice experiment with 198 longan (Dimocarpus longan) farmers. The results of a mixed logit model indicate a significant heterogeneity in farmers' preferences, part of which was explained by the respondents' attitude towards native bees, among other idiosyncratic variables such as gender. We also determined a generally positive willingness to pay for the above mentioned conservation measures, which implemented together were valued at approx. (sic)18.1 by the average household, all else equal. Additionally, avoiding a 50% native bee population decline was valued in average at (sic)40.5 per household.

Flower visitation, an important indicator of pollination services, is influenced by plant species richness. However, the spatio-temporal responses of different pollinator groups to plant species richness have not yet been analyzed experimentally. Here, we used an experimental plant species richness gradient to analyze plant-pollinator interactions with an unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. We observed four pollinator functional groups (honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees, and hoverflies) in experimental plots at three different vegetation strata between sunrise and sunset. Visits were modified by plant species richness interacting with time and space. Furthermore, the complementarity of pollinator functional groups in space and time was stronger in species-rich mixtures.

At reduced, low herbicide doses (below the recommended dose) plants can survive and display continuous and quantitative variation in dose-survival responses. Recurrent (directional) selection studies can reveal whether such a phenotypic variation in plant survival response to low herbicide dose is heritable and leads to herbicide resistance. In a common experimental garden study, we have subjected a susceptible population of self-pollinated hexaploid Avena fatua to low-dose recurrent selection with the ACCase-inhibiting herbicide diclofop-methyl for three consecutive generations. RESULTSSignificant differences in response to low-dose diclofop-methyl selection were observed between the selected progenies and parent plants, with a twofold diclofop-methyl resistance and cross-resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Thus, the capacity of self-pollinated A. fatua to respond to low-dose herbicide selection is marginal, and it is much lower than in cross-pollinated L. rigidum. Lolium rigidum in the same experiment evolved 40-fold diclofop-methyl resistance by progressive enrichment of quantitative resistance-endowing traits. CONCLUSIONCross-pollination rate, genetic variation and ploidy levels are identified as possible drivers affecting the contrasting capacity of Avena versus Lolium plants to respond to herbicide selection and the subsequent likelihood of resistance evolution at low herbicide dose usage.

In this study we show that two sunbird species were important for seed-set in low-growing, perchless plants of Hyobanche sanguinea and Lachenalia luteola on Kommetjie Slangkop, southern Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Remote video camera footage and field observations showed that malachite sunbirds (Nectarinia famosa) and orange-breasted sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea) perched on the,ground while visiting flowers of both plant species. Open inflorescences of both species yielded significantly higher seed-set than excluded inflorescences, which showed zero to near zero seed-set. Inflorescences shown on video to have been visited by sunbirds showed significantly higher seed-set than those for which video footage was not obtained, suggesting sunbirds are effective pollinators. Besides being the first documented pollinator information on these two species, our results expand upon the known traits associated with sunbird-pollination systems and suggest that low-growing sunbird-pollinated plants need not evolve perching structures in order to achieve effective visitation.

The risks to such mutualistic interactions from increasing temperature and more frequent extreme climatic events such as drought or advanced snow melt are assumed to depend on network specialization, species richness, local climate and associated parameters such as the amplitude of extreme events. Even though elevational gradients provide valuable model systems for climate change and are accompanied by changes in species richness, responses of plant-pollinator networks to climatic extreme events under different environmental and biotic conditions are currently unknown. Here, we show that elevational climatic gradients, species richness and experimentally simulated extreme events interactively change the structure of mutualistic networks in alpine grasslands. We found that the degree of specialization in plant-pollinator networks (H2') decreased with elevation. Nonetheless, network specialization increased after advanced snow melt at high elevations, whereas changes in network specialization after drought were most pronounced at sites with low species richness. Thus, changes in network specialization after extreme climatic events depended on climatic context and were buffered by high species richness. In our experiment, only generalized plant-pollinator networks changed in their degree of specialization after climatic extreme events. This indicates that contrary to our assumptions, network generalization may not always foster stability of mutualistic interaction networks.","[Hoiss, Bernhard; Krauss, Jochen; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Bioctr, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany","Hoiss, B (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Bioctr, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",bernhard.hoiss@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Krauss, Jochen/C-6216-2014","Krauss, Jochen/0000-0003-2304-9117",National Park Berchtesgaden; Bavarian Climate Programme; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [244090],"We thank Emily Martin, Gita Benadi, Diego Vazquez and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on the manuscript; Annette Leingartner for the cooperation in planning and implementing our experiment; The National Park Berchtesgaden and the owners of the study sites for support and permissions; Bernhard Merz, Hans-Peter Tschorsnig, Andreas Stark, Krzysztof Szpila, Sabine Prescher, Verner Michelsen and Dieter Doczkal for the Diptera determinations.

A critical challenge in disentangling the relative impacts of and interactions among local-scale factors is that these factors frequently covary due to feedbacks between plant and soil communities. For example, forest plots dominated by trees that associate with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi often differ from those dominated by trees that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in terms of their litter quality, microbial community structure and inorganic nutrient availability. Here, we evaluate the extent to which such factors alter leaf litter decomposition rates. To characterize variations in decomposition rates, we compared decay rates of high-quality litter (maple; AM) and low-quality litter (oak; ECM) across forest plots representing a gradient in litter matrix quality and nitrogen (N) availability driven by the relative proportions of AM and ECM trees in each plot. In experiment two, we added litter from two AM and three ECM tree species to forest plots with either a high-quality litter matrix and high N availability (i.e. AM-dominated plots) or a low-quality litter matrix and low N availability (i.e. ECM-dominated plots). In both experiments, we found that AM litter decomposed more rapidly than ECM litter, and this effect was enhanced in AM-dominated plots. Then, to separate the contributions of litter matrix effects from N availability effects, we added N fertilizer to a subset of plots from experiment two. Nitrogen addition increased decay rates of high-quality litter across all sites, but had no effect on low-quality litter, suggesting that low N availability, not litter matrix quality, constrains decomposition of high-quality litters. Hence, N availability appears to alter litter decomposition patterns independently of litter matrix properties.Synthesis. Our results indicate that shifts in the relative abundance of ECM- and AM-associated trees in a plot or stand have the potential to affect litter decay rates through both changes in litter quality as well as through alterations of the local-scale soil environment.","[Midgley, Meghan G.; Brzostek, Edward; Phillips, Richard P.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Brzostek, Edward] W Virginia Univ, Dept Biol, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Midgley, MG (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Jordan Hall,1001 E Third St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",mmidgley@mortonarb.org,"wang, jingyuan/H-8917-2013; Phillips, Richard P/C-6429-2009; 于, 贵瑞/C-1768-2014; wang, qiufeng/C-1654-2013; Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Phillips, Richard P./AAF-3937-2021; Guo, Dali/C-3498-2012; Tian, Jing/D-6786-2017","wang, jingyuan/0000-0001-7904-4695; 于, 贵瑞/0000-0002-1859-8966; Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Phillips, Richard P./0000-0002-1345-4138; Tian, Jing/0000-0002-8116-8520; Brzostek, Edward/0000-0002-2964-0576","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2013-67011-21095]; Indiana Academy of Science Senior Science Grant; Department of Energy-Office of Biological and Environmental Research-Terrestrial Ecosystem Science Program; US National Science Foundation (DEB, Ecosystem Studies Program) [1153401]","We would like to thank Terri Greene and Michael Chitwood for access to the Indiana University Research and Teaching Preserve.

However in contrast to other legumes, common bean has shown a lack of positive response to inoculation with Rhizobium in many cases. This has led to a limited use of rhizobial inoculants in this crop, especially in Europe. The adaptation of bacterial strains to the rhizosphere is a key factor in the success of any inoculant, especially in a promiscuous legume such as common bean. This research aimed at increasing common bean yields via inoculation with effective indigenous Rhizobium leguminosarum strains. Three highly effective strains (LCS0306, LBM1123 and ZBM1008) which were selected according to their effectiveness at BNF in hydroponic conditions were separately inoculated onto common bean in a field experiment. The experiment was carried out under three environments and three tillage systems: conventional-tillage (CONVT), no-tillage (NT) and a cover-crop (CC). The grain yield observed with seed inoculation was significantly higher than the yield obtained with uninoculated seed under CONVT and CC. However, under NT inoculation had no effect. Furthermore, under CONVT and CC, inoculation with R. leguminosarum LCS0306 produced even higher yields than those obtained in nitrogen-fertilised or control plots. This is the first attempt to explain the inoculation performance of common bean under different tillage systems in Europe. A gene-based hypothesis has been used to explain the effectiveness of indigenous common bean rhizobia as nitrogen fixers in this crop.","[Mulas, Daniel; Gonzalez-Andres, Fernando] Univ Leon, Inst Medio Ambiente Recursos Nat & Biodiversidad, Av Portugal 41, E-24071 Leon, Spain; [Seco, Victoria] Univ Leon, Dept Ingn & Ciencias Agr, E-24071 Leon, Spain; [Casquero, Pedro A.] Univ Leon, Escuela Super & Tecn Ingn Agr, E-24071 Leon, Spain; [Velazquez, Encarna] Univ Salamanca, Dept Microbiol & Genet, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain","Gonzalez-Andres, F (corresponding author), Univ Leon, Inst Medio Ambiente Recursos Nat & Biodiversidad, Av Portugal 41, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",fgona@unileon.es,"Casquero, Pedro A/L-6553-2014; Gonzalez-Andres, Fernando/L-6401-2014; Velazquez, Encarna/B-3669-2017","Casquero, Pedro A/0000-0002-4432-9794; Gonzalez-Andres, Fernando/0000-0002-1464-7118; Velazquez, Encarna/0000-0002-5946-7241; seco fernandez, maria victoria/0000-0001-9524-8268",Regional Government of Castile and Leon [LE002B05]; Spanish Ministry of EducationSpanish Government,"This research was supported by the Regional Government of Castile and Leon, project LE002B05.

These biotic associations were studied under either low N availability (unfertilized plots) and supplying the soil with an easily mineralizable organic fertilizer. Regardless of N fertilization, at the tillering stage, inoculation with AMF alone or in combination with PGPR increased the aboveground biomass yield compared to the uninoculated control. Inoculation with PGPR enhanced the aboveground biomass yield compared to the control, but only when N fertilizer was added. At the heading stage, inoculation with all microorganisms increased the aboveground biomass and N. Inoculation with PGPR and AMF PGPR resulted in significantly higher aboveground P compared to the control and inoculation with AMF only when organic N was applied. The role of microbe inoculation in N uptake was elucidated by the expression of nitrate transporter genes. NRT1.1, NRT2, and NAR2.2 were significantly upregulated by inoculation with AMF and AMF PGPR in the absence of organic N. A significant down-regulation of the same genes was observed when organic N was added. The ammonium (NH4+) transporter genes AMT1.2 showed an expression pattern similar to that of the NO3- transporters. Finally, in the absence of organic N, the transcript abundance of P transporters Pht1 and PT2-1 was increased by inoculation with AMF PGPR, and inoculation with AMF upregulated Pht2 compared to the uninoculated control. These results indicate the soil inoculation with AMF and PGPR (alone or in combination) as a valuable option for farmers to improve yield, nutrient uptake, and the sustainability of the agro-ecosystem.","[Saia, Sergio; Rappa, Vito; Ruisi, Paolo; Giambalvo, Dario; Frenda, Alfonso S.; Martinelli, Federico] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Agr & Forestali, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Saia, Sergio] Univ Palermo, Fdn A&S Lima Mancuso, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Abenavoli, Maria Rosa; Sunseri, Francesco] Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, Dipartimento Agr, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy","Martinelli, F (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Agr & Forestali, Viale Sci Ed 4, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",sergio.saia@unipa.it; federico.martinelli@unipa.it,"Saia, Sergio/K-7535-2012; Frenda, Alfonso Salvatore/AAP-4426-2020; Martinelli, Federico/F-7697-2013; Sunseri, Francesco/O-8013-2015; Ruisi, Paolo/L-9337-2015","Saia, Sergio/0000-0001-5465-8500; Sunseri, Francesco/0000-0001-5201-5413; Frenda, Alfonso Salvatore/0000-0002-2393-4936; Ruisi, Paolo/0000-0002-5807-6986","project Sviluppo tecnologico e innovazione per la sostenibilita e competitivita della cerealicoltura meridionale MIUR-UE of the Ministero denstruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR), Italy [PON01_01145-ISCOCEM]","The present research was funded by the project Sviluppo tecnologico e innovazione per la sostenibilita e competitivita della cerealicoltura meridionale MIUR-UE (PON01_01145-ISCOCEM) (person in charge: Dr. Giuseppe Di Miceli - Fondazione A. e S.

We examined soil chemical properties and communities of plants and soil microorganisms in clear-cuts and P. ponderosa stands thinned and maintained at low and medium tree densities for over 40 years along with high density (unthinned) stands. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in soils were analyzed to examine arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and microbial communities in the three thinning treatments and the unthinned stands with and without a recent broadcast burn. Additionally, two native bunchgrasses, Festuca arizonica and Muhlenbergia wrightii were grown in containers filled with intact soil cores collected from each field plot to more thoroughly compare the abundance of AM fungi and microbial communities across different stand densities and burn treatments. Tree thinning decreased litter cover and increased the abundance and diversity and altered community composition of both herbaceous vegetation and AM fungi. In the mineral soil layer, the pH, total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and PLFA profiles did not differ significantly among the four stand density or burn treatments. Mycorrhizal colonization of the container grown grasses did not significantly differ with tree density or burn treatments; however, F. arizonica roots had a strong trend for decreased colonization when grown in soil from high density (unthinned) tree cover. Soil from the containers with F. arizonica had a greater abundance of AM fungal spores. Furthermore, bacterial community composition varied with grass species. Concentration of biomarkers for bacteria were higher in soil that supported F. arizonica compared to soil in which M. wrightii was grown. Our results indicate that the creation of clear-cut openings in forests may increase the abundance and richness of AM fungal propagules and soil bacterial communities were surprisingly resilient to tree thinning and low-intensity fire treatments. These results suggest managing forests to create clear-cut openings generate conditions that favor understory native grasses and AM fungi that are linked to soil bacterial communities.

Such conflict, and adaptations to ameliorate or prevent the conflict, have been documented in African and neotropical acacias. Ant-acacia associations occur in Australia, but little is known of their ecology. Moreover, recent phylogenetic evidence indicates that Australian acacias are only distantly related to African and American acacias, providing an intercontinental natural experiment in the management of ant-pollinator conflict. We examined four populations of Acacia myrtifolia over a 400-km environmental gradient in southeastern Australia using ant and pollinator exclusion as well as direct observation of ants and pollinators to assess the potential for ant-pollinator conflict to affect seed set. Native bees were the only group of floral visitors whose visitation rates were a significant predictor of fruiting success, although beetles and wasps may play an important role as insurance pollinators. We found no increase in pollinator visitation or fruiting success following ant exclusion, even with large sample sizes and effective exclusion. Because ants are facultative visitors to A. myrtifolia plants, their presence may be insufficient to interfere greatly with floral visitors. It is also likely that the morphological location of extrafloral nectaries tends to draw ants away from reproductive parts, although we commonly observed ants on inflorescences, so the spatial separation is not strict. A. myrtifolia appears to maintain a generalized mutualism over a wide geographic range without the need for elaborate adaptations to resolve ant-pollinator conflict.","[Martinez-Bauer, Angelica E.; Martinez, Gerardo Ceron; Burd, Martin] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Murphy, Daniel J.] Royal Bot Gardens Melbourne, Natl Herbarium Victoria, Melbourne, Vic 3141, Australia; [Burd, Martin] Natl Evolutionary Synth Ctr, Durham, NC 27514 USA","Martinez-Bauer, AE (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",angelica.e.mtz.bauer@gmail.com,"; Murphy, Daniel/C-3781-2008","Burd, Martin/0000-0002-1175-2596; Murphy, Daniel/0000-0002-8358-363X","CONACyT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Mexico)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); SEP (Secretaria de Educacion Publica, Mexico); Monash University Faculty of ScienceMonash University; National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, Durham, North Carolina","We thank the Department of Sustainability and Environment of Victoria for permission to conduct the research (permit#10005111), and Parks Victoria, especially the rangers, for their kind support at the individual parks.

Distinguishing the effects of soil nutrients and soil mutualists may be critical in the context of restoration, but remains poorly understood. Additionally, we asked whether pioneer species and soil conditions influenced trade-offs or complementarities between vegetation production and species diversity. Location: Plant Growth Center, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, US, Methods: Using experimental seed addition in mesocosms, we investigated how the priority effects of different plant species influenced productivity, diversity and composition of the resulting plant community. We also experimentally manipulated soil nutrients and mycorrhizae to determine how they modified those priority effects. Results: We found that. species-specific priority effects of pioneers strongly governed the productivity, diversity and species composition of the resulting community. Pioneer grasses, one native and one non-native species, both preempted light and space, prevented the colonization and growth of the subsequent community and restricted community dispersion (i.e, differences in species composition among mesocosms). By contrast, the pioneer forb species had little influence on the recruitment and establishment of the later colonizing species, and supported the assembly of divergent communities. We found evidence to suggest that amendments of soil mutualists, but. not soil nutrients, modified the influence of one pioneer species on characteristics of the resulting community by enhancing community productivity and diversity in mesocosms with non-native grass pioneers. Across all treatments, species diversity declined as vegetation production increased, indicating an overall trade-off between productivity and diversity. However, relationships between productivity and diversity varied among pioneer treatments and mycorrhizal amendments. Conclusions: Our results eniphasize important interactions between priority effects and. the use of soil mycorrhizal amendments in restoration, as well as highlight how pioneer species and mycorrhizae influence potential trade-offs between restoration objectives aimed at enhancing productivity vs species diversity.","[Burkle, Laura A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Belote, R.

In temperate climates most plants bloom during a relatively well-defined peak, while comparatively few species flower before or after the community peak. Since a phylogenetical signal has been shown to exist in the determination of reproductive phenology, it is of interest to identify characters associated with the emergence of either type of behaviour. Here we report on the reproduction of the late-flowering shrub Colletia hystrix and discuss the results in the context of the whole genus Colletia. Colletia hystrix shares with its congeners deep flowers, associated with assemblages of long-mouthpart pollinators, and characters that maximise the chances of successful pollen receipt and export in a single pollinator visit (homogamy, a large stigma, and an extragynoecial compitum). Leaflessness and extreme spinescence of Colletia are suggested to be related (via compromised resource acquisition) to phenological displacement and its flower-level correlates.","[Medan, Diego; Pablo Torretta, Juan] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Catedra Bot Gen, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Medan, D (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Catedra Bot Gen, Ave San Martin 4453,C1417DSQ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",diemedan@agro.uba.ar,,"Torretta, Juan Pablo/0000-0001-8185-4822","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad de Buenos AiresUniversity of Buenos Aires","R.

Willingness to pay was estimated using a Bayesian mixed logit with two contrasting controls for attribute non-attendance, exclusion and shrinkage. The results suggest that the UK public have an extremely strong preference to avoid a status quo scenario where pollinator populations and pollination services decline. Total willingness to pay was high and did not significantly vary between the two pollination service outputs, producing a conservative total of 379M pound over a sample of the tax-paying population of the UK, equivalent to 13.4 pound per UK taxpayer. Using a basic production function approach, the marginal value of pollination services to these attributes is also extrapolated. The study discusses the implications of these findings and directions for related future research into the non-market value of pollination and other ecosystem services. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, we lack a quantitative understanding of their independent and interactive effects. In a population of the orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, we manipulated the intensity of pollination and herbivory in a factorial design to examine whether both interactions influence selection on flowering phenology, floral display, and morphology. Supplemental hand-pollination increased female fitness by 31% and one-quarter of all plants were damaged by herbivores. Both interactions contributed to selection. Pollinators mediated selection for later flowering and herbivores for earlier flowering, while both selected for longer spurs. The strength of selection was similar for both agents, and their effects were additive. As a consequence, there was no net selection on phenology, whereas selection on spur length was strong. The experimental results demonstrate that both pollinators and herbivores can markedly influence the strength of selection on flowering phenology and floral morphology, and cause both conflicting and reinforcing selection. They also indicate that the direction of selection on phenology will vary with the relative intensity of the mutualistic and antagonistic interaction, potentially resulting in both temporal and among-population variation in optimal flowering time.","[Sletvold, Nina; Agren, Jon] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Genet, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Moritz, Kim K.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Sletvold, N (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Genet, Norbyvagen 18 D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",nina.sletvold@ebc.uu.se,"Agren, Jon/E-6093-2011","Agren, Jon/0000-0001-9573-2463",Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission,"We thank A.

However, the extent to which plants with such traits actually depend on birds for seed production is seldom determined experimentally, and traits such as colour and scent production are often assessed only subjectively. We documented bird pollination and quantified floral traits in the critically endangered Satyrium rhodanthum (Orchidaceae) from mistbelt grasslands in the summer-rainfall region of South Africa. Direct observations and motion trigger camera footage revealed amethyst sunbirds as the only pollinators, despite the presence of other potential pollinators. Experimental exclusion of sunbirds significantly reduced pollination and fruit set to near zero. Pollination success in naturally pollinated plants was close to 100% in one year, and fruit set varied from 23 to 64% in other years. Pollen transfer efficiency was 5.8%, which is lower than in related insect-pollinated species, probably due to a tendency of birds to wipe pollinaria from their beak. Flowers of S.rhodanthum only reflect light in the red range of the spectrum, and they produce only a few aliphatic and monoterpene scent compounds at comparatively low emission rates. Nectar volume and sugar concentration varied between 2.7 and 3.7L and 23.7 and 25.9%, respectively. We conclude that S.rhodanthum is highly specialized for pollination by sunbirds. Colour, scent and nectar characteristics differ from insect-pollinated Satyrium species and are consistent with those expected for bird-pollinated flowers, and may contribute to lack of visitation by other potential long-tongued pollinators. Habitat loss probably underlies the critically endangered conservation status of S.rhodanthum, but the specialization for pollination by a single bird species means that reproduction in this orchid is vulnerable to losses in surrounding communities of plants that subsidize the energetic requirements of sunbirds.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 177, 141-150.","[Van der Niet, Timotheus; Cozien, Ruth J.] Nat Biodivers Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Van der Niet, Timotheus] Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Van der Niet, Timotheus; Cozien, Ruth J.; Johnson, Steven D.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa","Van der Niet, T (corresponding author), Nat Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",vdniet@gmail.com,"Johnson, Steven/P-2104-2019; van der Niet, Timotheus/B-8660-2019; Johnson, Steven D/F-1146-2010","Johnson, Steven/0000-0002-5114-5862; van der Niet, Timotheus/0000-0002-5250-8995; Johnson, Steven D/0000-0002-5114-5862; Cozien, Ruth/0000-0001-6800-5383",South African National Research Foundation (NRF)National Research Foundation - South Africa,"We thank Gavin and Lindi Walker, Roger Foster and Bruce and Robynne Allwood for allowing access to their farms for fieldwork.

We set up an experiment with the presence/absence of a non-AMF microbial community, where each pot contained a rotated and a non-rotated soil core. The results show that within our rotation design soil parameters such as water content, soil structure, pH, and C and N concentrations are not influenced by the regular rotation in the absence of AMF. Our study therefore clearly underlines the validity of the rotated hyphal in-growth core as an experimental control for AMF growth and activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies focused on this adaptation bring inconsistent results, however. Previously, we showed that different genotypes of Aster amellus exhibit different percentages of root colonization and that the species is adapted to the abiotic-soil environment combined with its native AMF isolate, but not to a specific AMF isolate alone. Here we asked whether plant populations of A. amellus are adapted to the whole native AMF community and whether there is co-adaptation between plants growing in their native soil and the native AMF community. In the first experiment, we used plants of one population of A. amellus from a marl region and plants of one population from a limestone region and planted them in non-sterile soil from both regions in a full factorial design. In the second experiment, plants from both regions were grown in their native sterilized soil and inoculated with their native AMF community or with the AMF community from the second region. Plants from each region established a specific level of root colonization, and AMF from each region formed a specific abundance of particular morphological structures in A. amellus roots. While we did not find any evidence that the plants are adapted to their whole-soil environment in terms of their growth, we did find evidence that adaptation of plants to native soil conditions could occur via adaptation of AMF to their native soil and plants and association of plants with specific type of AMF colonization. This type of adaptation could lead to the absence of adaptation in terms of plant growth.","[Pankova, Hana; Muenzbergova, Zuzana; Rydlova, Jana; Vosatka, Miroslav] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Muenzbergova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-12843 Prague 2, Czech Republic","Munzbergova, Z (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12843 Prague 2, Czech Republic.",zuzmun@natur.cuni.cz,"Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013; Pankova, Hana/H-1617-2014","Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220; Pankova, Hana/0000-0001-6012-541X; Vosatka, Miroslav/0000-0002-1378-3185",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P504/10/1486]; long-term research development project [RVO 67985939],We thank M.

Such experiments are purported to have important advantages of being time efficient and of standardizing motivation to move across individuals. Yet, we lack tests of whether movement behavior of translocated birds reflects natural behavior of unmanipulated birds. We compared the routine movement behavior of a tropical hummingbird, the Green Hermit (Phaethornis guy), to that of experimentally translocated individuals. We tested for differences in site selection patterns during movement at two spatial scales (point and path levels). We also compared movement rates between treatments. Behaviors documented during translocation experiments reflected those observed during routine movements. At the point level, both translocated and non-translocated birds showed similar levels of preference for mature tropical forest. At the path level, step selection functions showed both translocated and non-translocated hummingbirds avoiding movement across non-forested matrix and selecting streams as movement corridors. Movement rates were generally higher during translocation experiments. However, the negative influence of forest cover on movement rates was proportionately similar in translocation and routine movement treatments. We report the first evidence showing that movement behavior of birds during translocation experiments is similar to their natural movement behavior. Therefore, translocation experiments may be reliable tools to address effects of landscape structure on animal movement. We observed consistent selection of landscape elements between translocated and non-translocated birds, indicating that both routine and translocation movement studies lead to similar conclusions regarding the effect of landscape structure and forest composition on functional connectivity. Our observation that hummingbirds avoid non-forest matrix and select riparian corridors also provides a potential mechanism for pollen limitation in fragmented tropical forest.","[Volpe, Noelia L.; Robinson, W.

Geranium robertianum (Geraniaceae) is a broadly distributed species whose five-petaled flowers vary widely with respect to their degree of rotational asymmetry. In this study, we used a naturally occurring population of plants to investigate whether floral rotational asymmetry and leaf bilateral symmetry were phenotypically correlated with a series of fitness-related traits, and also used an experimental array with model flowers to investigate the preference of insect visitors for varying degrees of floral size and symmetry. We found that leaf asymmetry was not associated with any of the phenotypic traits measured, and that the degree of floral rotational asymmetry was strongly associated with decreased flower size and decreased pollen production. Our experimental arrays showed that insect visitors did not discriminate among model flowers on the basis of size or symmetry alone; however, insect visitors preferentially visited smaller, symmetric model flowers over larger, severely asymmetric model flowers. Taken together, our results suggest that floral and leaf symmetry in G. robertianum are not likely strong indicators of phenotypic quality, and that floral symmetry is unlikely to be a target of pollinator-mediated selection. However, the relationship between floral asymmetry and pollen production may provide a role for fecundity selection on symmetry in this species. These data importantly add to the growing literature on the adaptive nature of floral symmetry in the wild.","[Frey, Frank M.; Bukoski, Michael] Colgate Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA","Frey, FM (corresponding author), Colgate Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",ffrey@colgate.edu,,,Sherman Fairchild Foundation; Department of Biology; Research Council at Colgate University; Division of Natural Sciences at Colgate University,"We thank M.

Interactive effects of multiple drivers might cause species responses to differ from those in single-factor experiments; therefore, there is an urgent need for more multi-factor studies. Here, we assessed the growth and reproductive performance of multiple populations of a widespread grass of deciduous forests (Milium effusum) sampled along a latitudinal gradient and subjected to experimental manipulations of temperature and nitrogen availability. Common garden transplant experiments along the latitudinal gradient were used to manipulate temperatures and combined with experimental N addition to assess intraspecific responses of the study species to global-change drivers as well as to determine local adaptation. The total biomass, number of seeds and seedling emergence time of M. effusum increased when transplanted in the southern common garden. Apart from effects on the seed mass, the species did not respond to N addition alone. Yet, interactive effects between warming and N addition were found: N addition led to increased biomass growth but only in the northern common garden. Significant home-site advantages were apparent, most likely because of increased mycorrhizal colonization of roots of local transplants. We show that multiple global-change drivers may alter dynamics in understorey communities of temperate forests. Our study reinforces the need to increase our understanding of plant responses to future environmental changes by expanding the multi-factor research framework.","[Maes, Sybryn L.; De Frenne, Pieter; de la Pena, Eduardo; Gruwez, Robert; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab, B-9090 Melle Gontrode, Belgium; [Brunet, Jorg] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [de la Pena, Eduardo] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Terr Ecol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Chabrerie, Olivier; Decocq, Guillaume] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, CNRS, Edysan FRE 3498, F-80037 Amiens, France; [Cousins, Sara A.

A preliminary characterization-including (hydro)geochemistry, heavy metal concentration and their mobility in soil, bioprospecting for microbiology and botany-provided a data set for the development of a toolbox to deliver a microbially assisted phytoremediation process. Euphorbia pithyusa was selected as an endemic pioneer plant to be associated with a bacterial consortium, established with ten selected native strains, including metal-tolerant bacteria and producers of plant growth factors. The toolbox was firstly assessed in a greenhouse pot experiment. A positive effect of bacterial inoculum on E. pithyusa germination and total plant survival was observed. E. pithyusa showed to be a well-performing metallophyte species, and only inoculated soil retained a microbial activity with a high functional diversity, expanding metabolic affinity also towards root exudates. These results supported the decision to proceed with a field trial, investigating different treatments used singly or in combination: bioaugmentation with bacterial consortia, mycorrhizal fungi and a commercial mineral amendment. Microbial activity in soil, plant physiological parameters and heavy metal content in plants and in soil were monitored. Five months after the beginning, an early assessment of the toolbox under field conditions was carried out. Despite the cold season (October-March), results suggested the following: (1) the field setup as well as the experimental design proved to be effective; (2) plant survival was satisfactory; (3) soil quality was increased and bioaugmentation improved microbial activity, expanding the metabolic competences towards plant interaction (root exudates); and (4) multivariate analysis supported the data provided that the proposed toolbox can be established and the field trial can be carried forward.","[Sprocati, Anna Rosa; Alisi, Chiara; Pinto, Valentina; Montereali, Maria Rita; Marconi, Paola; Tasso, Flavia; Cremisini, Carlo] Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Sustainabl, Environm Characterizat Prevent & Recovery Unit, I-00123 Rome, Italy; [Turnau, Katarzyna; Goralska, Katarzyna] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Malopolska Ctr Biotechnol, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [De Giudici, Giovanni] Univ Cagliari, Dept Chem & Geol Sci, I-09127 Cagliari, Italy; [Bevilacqua, Marta; Marini, Federico] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Chem, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Pinto, V (corresponding author), Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Sustainabl, Environm Characterizat Prevent & Recovery Unit, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy.",valentina.pinto@enea.it,"Goralska, Katarzyna/AAR-5791-2021; Turnau, Katarzyna/ABG-6170-2020; De Giudici, Giovanni/AAI-4763-2020; Marini, Federico/I-3384-2012; Cremisini, Carlo/AAL-2350-2021","Marini, Federico/0000-0001-8266-1117; Pinto, Valentina/0000-0003-3871-9152; Turnau, Katarzyna/0000-0002-8875-0978; Alisi, Chiara/0000-0002-9849-2861; DE GIUDICI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA/0000-0001-8053-9388; Goralska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-3212-5268; Bevilacqua, Marta/0000-0002-3361-9219",EUEuropean Commission [EU 226870],"This study was supported by the EU training network 7FP UMBRELLA (EU 226870).

Yet, surprisingly little is known about how these two groups interact to impact belowground communities. Using the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE), where ungulate herbivores have been excluded for over 15 years, we examined how the presence of termites and ungulate herbivore exclusion affected species richness, community composition, and infectivity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We also measured plant richness and soil nutrients to examine how the effects of termites and ungulate exclusion may indirectly impact AMF communities. AMF richness and infectivity and plant richness were significantly lower on termite mounds than in off-mound areas. AMF infectivity and plant richness were significantly higher in off-mound areas, especially where herbivores had access. Our results revealed a strong suppressive effect of termites on AMF communities that was not enhanced or ameliorated by the presence of ungulate herbivores. Herbivores, by contrast, enhanced the relationship between plants and their fungal symbionts but only in the absence of the suppressive effects of termites. Our results underscore the importance of multiple drivers affecting the patterns of both above-and below-ground communities.","[Petipas, Renee H.; Brody, Alison K.] Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Petipas, Renee H.; Brody, Alison K.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Petipas, Renee H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Petipas, RH (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",rp382@cornell.edu,,"Petipas, Renee/0000-0002-8712-8183","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF DEB-0519223, LTREB BSR-97-07477, 03-16402, 08-16453]; Mpala Research Center; James Smithson Fund of the Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [4691-91]; African Elephant Program of the US Fish and Wildlife Service [98210-0-G563]","We thank Simon Akwam and Gilbert Busienei for assistance in the field, and Ashleigh Boyd and Jon Gonzalez for help in the lab.

Materials and methods Topsoil samples (0-0.20 m depth) from four sites where sewage sludge had been repeatedly applied during 14-53 years were analysed for total C, total N, pH and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Heavy metals were analysed in both soil and plant samples, and crop yields were recorded. Results and discussion At all four sites, sewage sludge application increased crop yield and soil organic carbon. Sludge addition also resulted in elevated concentrations of some heavy metals (mainly Cu and Zn) in soils, but high concentrations of metals (Ni and Zn) in plant materials were almost exclusively found in the oldest experiment, started in 1956. PLFA analysis showed that the microbial community structure was strongly affected by changes in soil pH. At those sites where sewage sludge had caused low pH, Gram-positive bacteria were more abundant. However, differences in community structure were larger between sites than between the treatments. Conclusions At all four sites, long-term sewage sludge application increased the soil organic carbon and nitrogen content, microbial biomass and crop yield. Long-term sewage sludge application led to a decrease in soil pH. Concentrations of some metals had increased significantly with sewage sludge application at all sites, but the amounts of metals added to soil with sewage sludge were found not to be toxic for microbes at any site.","[Borjesson, Gunnar; Kirchmann, Holger] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Katterer, Thomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Borjesson, G (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, POB 7014, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",gunnar.borjesson@slu.se,"Katterer, Thomas/L-2107-2013","Katterer, Thomas/0000-0002-1751-007X",SLF (The Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research) [H1033139]; Agricultural landscape section within the program for Environmental Monitoring and Assessment at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"We are grateful to Per-Goran Andersson at the Swedish Rural Economy and Agricultural Society Malmohus for access to the sites and data on metal analyses and yields at Petersborg and Igelosa.

However, whether and how floral traits are sexually selected in hermaphroditic plants remains less clear. Here, we use Passiflora incarnata to address how floral traits that affect pollination success are selected via female function. We manipulated the ecological context by limiting pollination and adding resources to expand the phenotypic distribution and alter the intensity of sexual selection. Total sexual selection favoured lower style deflexion because of its impact on pollen receipt and subsequent seed number. However, total selection on style deflexion was not significant, indicating additional selection on style deflexion through routes other than mating. Limited pollination and enhanced resources were expected to alter the distribution of pollen deposition and seed production and therefore intensify the Bateman gradient - the relationship between pollen receipt and seed production. Indeed, the Bateman gradient was strongest when pollination was limited, suggesting potential for sexual selection to influence floral trait evolution under these conditions. Overall, we found floral traits may be shaped by sexual selection through female reproductive success in this hermaphroditic plant. These results support manipulations to enhance the variance in mating as a mechanism to understand patterns of sexual selection.","[Dai, C.; Galloway, L.

These plants are pioneers and are important for the ecological restoration of mined areas. Costularia comosa, one of the most common sedges in this environment, was grown under field conditions on ultramafic soil, fertilized or not with phosphate and/or nitrogen. Results showed that the addition of phosphate to the soil induced a clear increase in mycorrhizal colonization of C. comosa and an increase in arbuscule abundance, reflecting the establishment of a functional mycorrhizal symbiosis. Significant positive correlations were found among mycorrhizal parameters and plant or soil phosphorus concentrations. Nitrogen fertilization did not affect mycorrhizal colonization of C. comosa. The improvement in mycorrhizal colonization by phosphate fertilization did not influence significantly nickel concentrations in the roots and shoots of plants. This study demonstrated that phosphate fertilization of ultramafic soil improved mycorrhizal colonization of C. comosa, with formation of a functional symbiosis under field conditions.","[Lagrange, Alexandre; Amir, Hamid] Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, LIVE, Noumea, New Caledonia; [L'Huillier, Laurent] IAC, Paita, New Caledonia","Amir, H (corresponding author), Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, LIVE, BP R4 98851, Noumea, New Caledonia.",hamid.amir@univ-nc.nc,,"L'HUILLIER, Laurent/0000-0001-6920-1618",SIRAS Pacific,"The authors gratefully acknowledge SIRAS Pacific for providing a part of the PhD grant of Alexandre Lagrange and for providing the experimental field.

Little is known about the forces triggering andromonoecy in the Apiaceae. In the present study, a natural population of the protandrous Chaerophyllum bulbosum was investigated to elucidate architectural constraints and effects of resource reallocation. Three sets of plants (each n 15) were treated by hand pollination, pollinator exclusion and removal of low-order inflorescences. Fifteen untreated plants were left as controls. Untreated plants produce umbels up to the third branch order, with increasing proportions of male flowers from 15 (terminal umbel) to 100 (third-order umbels). Fruit set correspondingly decreases from 70 (terminal umbel) to 10 (second-order umbels). Insignificant differences from hand-pollinated plants do not reveal any sign of pollinator limitation at the study site. Bagged individuals show the same increase in male flowers with age as untreated plants, indicating that the presence of andromonoecy is not induced by fruit set. After umbel removal, individuals tend to present a higher number of hermaphrodite flowers and fruits in the umbels of second and third order. Three plants (25 ) produced an additional branch order composed of 100 male umbels. Inherited andromonoecy and the plastic response to environmental conditions are interpreted as a self-regulating system saving investment costs and optimizing fruit set at the same time.","[Reuther, Kerstin; Classen-Bockhoff, Regine] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Spezielle Bot & Bot Garten, D-55099 Mainz, Germany","Reuther, K (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Spezielle Bot & Bot Garten, Bentzelweg 2, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",reutherk@uni-mainz.de,,,Zentrum fur Umweltforschung; Dr Marie-Friedericke Wagner-Stiftung (both Mainz University),"We thank the Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt Oppenheim/Mannheim for permission to conduct experiments in the study area, Eva Maria Griebeler (Mainz) for assistance with statistics, and Doris Franke (Mainz) for touching up our illustrations.

However, while we begin to understand the role of surface casts, it is still unclear to what extent plants utilize subsurface casts. We conducted a greenhouse experiment using large mesocosms (volume 45 l) to test whether (1) soil microsites consisting of earthworm casts with or without AMF (four Glomus taxa) affect the biomass production of 11 grassland plant species comprising the three functional groups grasses, forbs, and legumes, (2) different ecological groups of earthworms (soil dwellers-Aporrectodea caliginosa vs. vertical burrowers-Lumbricus terrestris) alter potential influences of soil microsites (i.e., four earthworms x two subsurface microsites x two AMF treatments). Soil microsites were artificially inserted in a 25-cm depth, and afterwards, plant species were sown in a regular pattern; the experiment ran for 6 months. Our results show that minute amounts of subsurface casts (0.89 g kg(-1) soil) decreased the shoot and root production of forbs and legumes, but not that of grasses. The presence of earthworms reduced root biomass of grasses only. Our data also suggest that subsurface casts provide microsites from which root AMF colonization can start. Ecological groups of earthworms did not differ in their effects on plant production or AMF distribution. Taken together, these findings suggest that subsurface earthworm casts might play a role in structuring plant communities by specifically affecting the growth of certain functional groups of plants.","[Zaller, Johann G.; Wechselberger, Katharina F.; Frank, Thomas; Drapela, Thomas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Integrat Biol & Biodivers Res, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Gorfer, Markus] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Appl Genet & Cell Biol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Wechselberger, Katharina F.; Hann, Patrick] Bio Forsch Austria, A-1220 Vienna, Austria; [Drapela, Thomas] Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Wanek, Wolfgang] Univ Vienna, Fac Life Sci, Dept Terr Ecosyst Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Zaller, JG (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Integrat Biol & Biodivers Res, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",johann.zaller@boku.ac.at,"Wanek, Wolfgang/E-7001-2012; Zaller, Johann G/A-9914-2009","Wanek, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2178-8258; Zaller, Johann G/0000-0001-7744-7378; Gorfer, Markus/0000-0003-3010-6044",Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [B20171-B16],"We are grateful to Marcel van der Heijden, Dragana Bandian, and Sylvia Klaubauf for the constructive discussions during the course of the experiment and advice on the AMF detection using PCR.

Carbon (C) was applied as (CO2)-C-13 to plants and nitrogen (N) was added as (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 to the soil. We hypothesized that C will be transferred from plants to the rhizosphere, subsequently in beech to ectomycorrhiza (EM), in ash to arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and finally to soil animals. We expected the C signal to be more effectively transferred to soil animals in EM as compared to AM systems since EM forms more extensive extramatrical mycelia as compared to AM. For N-15 we hypothesized that it will be taken up by both saprotrophic microorganisms and mycorrhizal fungi and then channeled to-soil animals. After five month, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of soil animals, EM and fine roots of beech and ash were measured. Litter and soil were hardly enriched in N-15 whereas fine roots of beech and ash were highly enriched suggesting that nitrogen in (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 was predominantly taken up by plants and mycorrhizal fungi but little by saprotrophic microorganisms. Roots of beech and ash were highly enriched in C-13 with maximum values in EM proving that C-13 was translocated into roots and mycorrhizal fungi. Soil animals were a priori assigned to primary decomposers, secondary decomposers and predators. Generally, signatures of soil animals did not significantly vary between beech and ash and therefore were pooled. Primary decomposers had low delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures similar to litter and soil confirming that rhizosphere C and microbial N are of limited importance for primary decomposer taxa. delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of secondary decomposers were higher than those of primary decomposers and spanned a large gradient indicating that certain secondary decomposers rely on root derived C and microbial N, however, none of the secondary decomposers had signatures pointing to exclusive feeding on EM. Unexpectedly, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures were highest in predators suggesting that they heavily preyed on secondary decomposer species such as the litter dwelling Collembola species Lepidocyrtus cyaneus and species not captured by the heat extraction procedure used for capturing prey taxa, presumably predominantly root associated nematodes. Overall, the results highlight that in particular higher trophic levels rely on carbon originating from other resources than litter with these resources channeled to dominant predators via litter dwelling Collembola species.

Intracellular accommodation that facilitates nutrient exchange between the two partners and protects bacteria from plant defense reactions has been a major evolutionary step towards mutualism. Yet the forces that drove the selection of the late event of intracellular infection during rhizobium evolution are unknown. To address this question, we took advantage of the previous conversion of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum into a legume-nodulating bacterium that infected nodules only extracellularly. We experimentally evolved this draft rhizobium into intracellular endosymbionts using serial cycles of legume-bacterium cocultures. The three derived lineages rapidly gained intracellular infection capacity, revealing that the legume is a highly selective environment for the evolution of this trait. From genome resequencing, we identified in each lineage a mutation responsible for the extracellular-intracellular transition. All three mutations target virulence regulators, strongly suggesting that several virulence-associated functions interfere with intracellular infection. We provide evidence that the adaptive mutations were selected for their positive effect on nodulation. Moreover, we showed that inactivation of the type three secretion system of R. solanacearum that initially allowed the ancestral draft rhizobium to nodulate, was also required to permit intracellular infection, suggesting a similar checkpoint for bacterial invasion at the early nodulation/root infection and late nodule cell entry levels. We discuss our findings with respect to the spread and maintenance of intracellular infection in rhizobial lineages during evolutionary times.","[Guan, Su Hua; Gris, Carine; Tasse, Lena; Maillard, Aline; Batut, Jacques; Masson-Boivin, Catherine; Capela, Delphine] INRA, LIPM, UMR441, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Guan, Su Hua; Gris, Carine; Tasse, Lena; Maillard, Aline; Batut, Jacques; Masson-Boivin, Catherine; Capela, Delphine] CNRS, LIPM, UMR2594, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Cruveiller, Stephane; Medigue, Claudine] CNRS UMR 8030, Evry, France; [Cruveiller, Stephane; Medigue, Claudine] Commissariat Energie Atom CEA DSV IG Genoscope LA, Evry, France; [Pouzet, Cecile; Leru, Aurelie] CNRS, Plateforme Imagerie TRI, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Pouzet, Cecile; Leru, Aurelie] UPS, Plateforme Imagerie TRI, Castanet Tolosan, France","Masson-Boivin, C (corresponding author), CNRS INRA, LIPM, INRA, UMR441, CS 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",catherine.masson@toulouse.inra.fr,,"Guan, Suhua/0000-0003-1927-1559",SPE INRA; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council;  [ANR-08-BLAN-0295-01],"We are grateful to E Rocha and J Cullimore for comments and M Marchetti for help in cytological work.

Plant traits likely to be involved in pollinator attraction include flower color, shape, and size. Furthermore, plant or flower density and the temporal flowering pattern may have an effect on reproduction. In this study, we examine the pollination ecology, breeding system, female reproductive output, and germination of two tropical understory species, Stenostephanus lobeliiformis (Acanthaceae) and Besleria melancholica (Gesneriaceae), which differ in these traits. Pollinator observations revealed that the dense flowering S. lobeliiformis with pinkish flowers received a higher diversity of pollinators, but visitor frequency measured as visits per flower per hour was much less (0.1 h(-1)) than that to B. melancholica, which has a smaller floral display of dull-colored flowers (1.5 h(-1)). Pollination experiments revealed that S. lobeliiformis but not B. melancholica is pollen-limited. In addition, both species are partially self-incompatible and depend on pollinators for outcrossing. Natural fruit set of open-pollinated unmanipulated flowers (control treatment) in both species is 22-26 %. Germination studies indicated inbreeding depression in S. lobeliiformis. We conclude that the pollination ecology of these species is influenced by a broad set of traits and that very different combinations of these traits can be successful in terms of reproduction.","[Stein, Katharina; Hensen, Isabell] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Geobot & Bot Garden, D-06108 Halle, Germany","Stein, K (corresponding author), Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Germany.",steinkatharina@hotmail.com,,,German National Academic Foundation,"We are grateful to the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu'' (REGUA), especially to Nicholas and Raquel Locke, for logistical support and the permission to work on the property.

A set of four traits, including a high pollen/low nectar floral reward strategy, homogamy, a dry stigma, and partial self-compatibility, appear to be central for K. weddellianus to accomplish sexual reproduction in the high-altitude Puna. The existence of an entirely different set of characteristics in the related species Ochetophila nana suggests that adaptation to reproduction at high altitudes can be achieved through different pathways. Hence, the final results may strongly diverge from the patterns found in lowland species of each lineage, or not.

The impact of long-term application of chemical fertilizer on AM fungal communities was investigated with respect to the time scale. Soils were collected from four plots with different fertilizer management in the long-term experimental field established in 1914. Lotus japonicus was grown in the soils in a greenhouse, while Glycine max was grown in the plots in the field. DNA was extracted from their roots, and the diversity and community compositions were analyzed based on occurrence of the AM fungal phylotypes defined by sequence similarity in the LSU rDNA. The 90-year-application of N and K in the absence of P increased AM fungal diversity and resulted in formation of a distinctive fungal community compared with those in the other treatments. This effect was not cancelled by single application of P. Whereas the impact of balanced application of N, P, and K was ambiguous. These observations suggest that the presence/absence of P-fertilizer has a major impact on AM fungal communities, but the action may appear only on a long time scale.","[Cheng, Ying; Ishimoto, Keiko; Kuriyama, Yuko; Osaki, Mitsuru; Ezawa, Tatsuhiro] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan","Ezawa, T (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",tatsu@res.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,"Ezawa, Tatsuhiro/B-7735-2012","Ezawa, Tatsuhiro/0000-0001-6188-7635; Cheng, Ying/0000-0002-4233-5330","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [22380042] Funding Source: KAKEN","The authors would like to thank Mr. M.

Ectomycorrhizal fungi are considered to play this vital role for trees in nitrogen (N)-limited boreal forests. We followed symbiotic carbon (C)N exchange in a large-scale boreal pine forest experiment by tracing 13CO2 absorbed through tree photosynthesis and 15N injected into a soil layer in which ectomycorrhizal fungi dominate the microbial community. We detected little 15N in tree canopies, but high levels in soil microbes and in mycorrhizal root tips, illustrating effective soil N immobilization, especially in late summer, when tree belowground C allocation was high. Additions of N fertilizer to the soil before labelling shifted the incorporation of 15N from soil microbes and root tips to tree foliage. These results were tested in a model for CN exchange between trees and mycorrhizal fungi, suggesting that ectomycorrhizal fungi transfer small fractions of absorbed N to trees under N-limited conditions, but larger fractions if more N is available. We suggest that greater allocation of C from trees to ectomycorrhizal fungi increases N retention in soil mycelium, driving boreal forests towards more severe N limitation at low N supply.","[Nasholm, Torgny; Hogberg, Peter; Metcalfe, Daniel; Keel, Sonja G.; Hogberg, Mona N.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Nasholm, Torgny; Campbell, Catherine] SLU, Umea Plant Sci Ctr, Dept Forest Genet & Plant Physiol, SE-90185 Umea, Sweden; [Franklin, Oskar] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Keel, Sonja G.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Bern, Switzerland; [Keel, Sonja G.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Hurry, Vaughan] Umea Univ, Umea Plant Sci Ctr, Dept Plant Physiol, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Linder, Sune] SLU, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Keel, Sonja G.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Nasholm, T (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",torgny.nasholm@slu.se,"Hogberg, Peter/B-2916-2012; Hurry, Vaughan/A-8331-2008; Hogberg, Peter/AAU-1978-2021; Keel, Sonja G./AAE-4495-2019; Hogberg, Mona N./L-9635-2014","Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719; Hurry, Vaughan/0000-0001-5151-5184; Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719; Keel, Sonja G./0000-0002-2645-273X; Hogberg, Mona N./0000-0003-1258-7630; Franklin, Oskar/0000-0002-0376-4140; Nasholm, Torgny/0000-0002-2275-2030",Kempe foundations; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (TC4F),"This study was financed by grants to T.N., M.N.H., P.H., V.H. and S.

Self-compatibility would, generally, be advantageous for long-distance dispersing species, as it provides reproductive assurance when density of mates is low. The heterostylous reproductive system, often associated with an incompatibility system, may be a constraint on the colonization of remote habitats. It is, therefore, surprising that the distylous shrub Waltheria ovata has colonized all of the Galapagos Islands, situated more than a thousand kilometres off the shore of Ecuador. The present study confirmed the reciprocal herkogamy of W. ovata. A comparison of mainland and the Galapagos Island populations showed a reduction in flower size, including distance between anthers and stigmas and size of anthers on the islands. Some reductions are quite large but not significantly different, mainly due to a high degree of variation among populations on the islands. The pin morph of W. ovata has undergone the most radical adaptive changes in morphology. Pollination experiments of W. ovata disclosed a leak in the incompatibility system on the Galapagos Islands, allowing higher selfing rates as well as intra-morph seed set compared to the mainland populations. This was most pronounced in the thrum morph. The deficient distylous reproductive system may be an adaptation to a pollinator and mate sparse environment on the Galapagos Islands. We conclude that the heterostylous mating system has changed in response to colonization of the Galapagos Islands, giving room for reproductive assurance by seed set after selfings and intra-morph pollinations.","[Bramow, Christina; Hartvig, Ida; Larsen, Signe Brandt; Philipp, Marianne] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Philipp, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",Marianp@bio.ku.dk,"Hartvig, Ida/E-4080-2015","Hartvig, Ida/0000-0002-1509-6864",Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation; Brodrene Hartmanns Fond; Torben og Alice Frimodts Fond,"We want to thank The National Park Service of Galapagos for permission to carry out our study and The Charles Darwin Research Station for arranging our travels.

They are characterized by a unique pollen transfer mechanism. To understand its functional significance and evolution, field investigations have been conducted in Gabon. Data from 28 (of 35) species from Central Africa are achieved. The pollen-ovule ratio (34-140:1; exception Sarcophrynium 2.5:1) falls into the range of facultative autogamous species. All investigated species were proven to be self-compatible; however, only two were autogamous. Natural fruit set was generally low (10.9 +/- 10%). The highest natural fruit set was found in Marantochloa purpurea (29.7%), Ma. grandiflora (33.5%) and the two autogamous species Halopegia azurea (31%) and Marantochloa leucantha (35%). Considerable higher fruit set could be reached in all species by hand-self-pollination. We conclude that autogamy is generally avoided through herkogamy based on secondary pollen presentation on the back of the style head - a central component of the specific pollen transfer mechanism. However, with respect to the consecutive visit of pollinators to several flowers of the same individual geitonogamy cannot be excluded. The aggregated pollen transfer via the explosive pollination mechanism might be interpreted as an adaptation to low pollinator visitation rate, pollen limitation might explain the low fruit set.

However, adaptation to the abiotic environment may significantly affect plant interactions with herbivores and pollinators. Local adaptation to the abiotic environment may constrain local adaptation to herbivores and pollinators under contrasting selection pressures, resulting in trade-offs in local adaptation. We studied local adaptation of a perennial herb, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria, in a reciprocal transplant experiment among four populations and measured plant fitness, pollination success and resistance to two specialist herbivores. We also estimated local adaptation of these two herbivores and generalist pollinators to their sympatric plant populations. Local adaptation was compared with within-population genetic variation, genetic and geographical divergence, and with divergence in terms of population size, environmental conditions and plant secondary chemistry. We further compared local adaptation to the environment, to local adaptation to herbivores and pollinators to detect possible trade-offs in local adaptation. The existence and degree of local adaptation varied among the plant populations. Plants from two populations were locally adapted to their sympatric leaf herbivores and plants from two populations were locally adapted to their abiotic environment. Herbivores from one population were locally adapted to their sympatric plant population. Local adaptation of V. hirundinaria to the seed predator increased with increasing among-population divergence in precipitation and temperature. Local adaptation to the seed predator and the environment increased with increasing population genetic variation. Local adaptation of V. hirundinaria in fitness and in herbivore resistance also correlated positively, suggesting lack of trade-offs in local adaptation. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that species interactions can lead to a mosaic of locally adapted plant, herbivore and pollinator populations. In addition to natural enemies, genetic variation, the abiotic environment and mutualistic interactions contribute to the evolution of local adaptation in long-lived plants. These results provide new insights into the patterns and causes of variation in local adaptation and are among the first to demonstrate that conflicting selection pressures within a population do not constrain local adaptation in multiple traits.","[Kalske, Aino; Muola, Anne; Laukkanen, Liisa] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Mutikainen, Pia] ETH Zentrum, Inst Integrat Biol ETH Zurich, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Leimu, Roosa] Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3RB, England","Kalske, A (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",aino.kalske@utu.fi,,"Kalske, Aino/0000-0003-3850-8996; Muola, Anne/0000-0003-1828-6425","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [8109859, 2608000711]; Societas Biologica Fennica Vanamo; Turku University Foundation (Seili Foundation)","We thank L. and J.

However, the implications of such movements in terms of pollination are not well understood. Recently, complex patterns of stamen movements have been identified in Loasaceae, Parnassiaceae, Rutaceae and Tropaeolaceae. In this study the stamen movements in Ruta graveolens (Rutaceae) and their impact on pollination are determined. Pollination effects of stamen movements were studied in Ruta graveolens, in which one-by-one uplifting and falling back is followed by simultaneous movement of all stamens in some flowers. Using 30 flowers, one stamen was manipulated either to be immobilized or to be allowed to move freely towards the centre of the flower but be prevented from falling back. Pollen loads on stigmas and ovule fertilization in flowers with or without simultaneous stamen movement were determined. Pollen removal decreased dramatically (P 0001) when the stamen was stopped from uplifting because its anther was seldom contacted by pollinators. When a stamen stayed at the flowers centre, pollen removal of the next freely moved anther decreased significantly (P 0005) because of fewer touches by pollinators and quick leaving of pollinators that were discouraged by the empty anther. Simultaneous stamen movement occurred only in flowers with low pollen load on the stigma and the remaining pollen in anthers dropped onto stigma surfaces after stamens moved to the flowers centre. In R. graveolens pollen removal is promoted through one-by-one movement of the stamen, which presents pollen in doses to pollinators by successive uplifting of the stamen and avoids interference of two consecutively dehisced anthers by falling back of the former stamen before the next one moves into the flowers centre. Simultaneous stamen movement at the end of anthesis probably reflects an adaptation for late-acting self-pollination.","[Ren, Ming-Xun; Tang, Jing-Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Ren, MX (corresponding author), Bot Inst Barcelona CSIC ICUB, Barcelona 08038, Spain.",rensanshan@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30970459, 31170356]","We thank Prof. Huan-Li Xu for insect identification and Dr Jordi Lopez-Pujol for helpful advice on an earlier version of this manuscript.

The aims of this study were to investigate the reproductive ecology of the flies and the plant, ascertain the importance of the flies as pollinators and examine the intimate association between flowering events and life history of the flies. We conducted sampling, observations and field pollination experiments. The flies were attracted by the odour of female-phase inflorescences in the early morning on the first day of anthesis. They fed, mated and oviposited in the inflorescences for 1 day. On the second day, the flies, covered with pollen grains, left the male-phase inflorescences for the next female-phase inflorescences. The immature forms of both fly species hatched, developed and pupated within the infructescences without damaging the fruits, and developed adults emerged when the mature infructescences dehisced. The flowering events and fly behaviours were well synchronized. In field pollination experiments, inflorescences bagged with a fine mesh (insect exclusion) produced almost no fruits, whereas those bagged with a coarse mesh (bee exclusion) produced as many fruits as the open-pollinated controls. These results indicate that these flies are the most efficient and specialised pollinators for their host, A. macrorrhizos. These flies, in return, depend on A. macrorrhizos for food and habitat through most of their life cycle.

Vriesea gigantea is a self-compatible bromeliad species distributed in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest and habitat destruction and fragmentation and collection have decreased the natural populations. We aim to describe the occurrence of inbreeding depression (d) in three natural populations of V. gigantea and to correlate this phenomenon with previous studies of fertility, genetic diversity, population genetic structure, gene flow, mating system and seed dispersal in this species. Fifty-four adult plants were sampled and 108 flowers were used for pollination treatments (selfing, outcrossing and control). For adult plants, we analysed plant and inflorescence height, flower numbers and seed set. In the progenies, evaluated parameters included seed germination and seedling survival rate. The results indicated low to moderate levels of inbreeding depression in V. gigantea (d = 0.02 to 0.39), in agreement with molecular data from a previous study. Vriesea gigantea populations tolerate some degree of inbreeding, which is consistent with previous results on fertility, mating system, genetic diversity and gene flow.

However, few empirical studies have explicitly tested the hypothesis of mate limitation in small populations of self-incompatible plants. To do so, we studied wild pear (Pyrus pyraster), which possesses a gametophytic self-incompatibility system. We determined the S-genotypes in complete samplings of all adult trees from 3 populations using a PCR-RFLP approach. We identified a total of 26 different S-alleles, homologous to S-alleles of other woody Rosaceae. The functionality of S-alleles and their Mendelian inheritance were verified in artificial pollination experiments and investigations of pollen tube growth. The smallest population (N = 8) harbored 9 different S-alleles and showed a mate availability of 92.9%, whereas the 2 larger populations harbored 18 and 25 S-alleles and exhibited mate availabilities of 98.4% and 99.2%, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that even small populations of gametophytic self-incompatible plants may exhibit high diversity at the S-locus and are not immediately threatened owing to reduced mate availability.","[Hoebee, S.

The identification and quantification of the pollination service provided by different taxa within the pollinator guild is a prerequisite for the successful establishment of nature conservation and crop management regimes. 2 Wild bees and hoverflies are considered to be valuable pollinators in agricultural and natural systems. Although some information on pollination efficiency of individual pollinator species is available, comparative studies of both taxa at different densities are rare. In the present study, the efficiency of the solitary mason bee Osmia rufa and two hoverfly species (Eristalis tenax and Episyrphus balteatus) as pollinators of oilseed rape Brassica napus was examined in a standardized caged plant breeding regime. Honeybee Apis mellifera colonies were used as a reference pollinator taxon. 3 Yield parameters responded differently to pollinator density and identity. Fruit set and number of seeds per pod increased with increasing pollinator density, although these were stronger in the mason bee than the hoverfly treatment. Weight per 1000 seeds did not respond to any pollinator treatment, indicating that seed quality was not affected. Oilseed rape yield in the highest tested densities of both pollinator taxa resulted in yield values close to the efficiency of small honeybee colonies. 4 Hoverflies required approximately five-fold densities of the red mason bees to reach a similar fruit set and yield. Thus, mason bees are more efficient in plant breeding and managed pollination systems. Both natural pollinator taxa, however, are of potential value in open and closed crop production systems.","[Jauker, Frank] Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol, Giessen, Germany; [Becker, Heiko C.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Gottingen, Germany; [Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Bayreuth, Germany; [Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Wurzburg, Germany","Jauker, F (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol, Giessen, Germany.",frank.jauker@bio.uni-giessen.de,"Jauker, Frank/I-5823-2017","Jauker, Frank/0000-0003-4137-9072; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf/0000-0003-1359-3944",,,,50,119,124,5,231,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-9555,1461-9563,,AGR FOREST ENTOMOL,Agric.

A considerable potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to promote plant growth and nutrition can be expected under these adverse conditions. We tested a hypothesis that both host plants and AMF have evolved edaphic tolerance, which enable them to cope with the conditions of serpentine habitats. A reciprocal transplant experiment with a full factorial design was conducted, involving serpentine and non-serpentine substrates, host plants (Knautia arvensis, Dipsacaceae) and AMF isolates. After three-month cultivation under greenhouse conditions, plant growth and nutrition and AMF development were assessed. Our results evidenced the edaphic differentiation and higher tolerance of both plants and fungi of serpentine origin to serpentine soil. The better performance of serpentine plants was likely based on their tolerance to magnesium accumulation in shoot tissues. The serpentine AMF isolate not only developed higher root colonisation in serpentine conditions, but it was also more efficient in the growth promotion of and phosphorus uptake by the serpentine plants. As it had only a slight impact on magnesium uptake and no influence on calcium and nickel uptake by the serpentine plants, the improved P nutrition seemed to be the crucial mechanism of the mycorrhizal promotion effect. In conclusion, our study proved the tolerance of a plant-mycobiont complex to specific conditions of serpentine soils, which may indicate that not only the individual components of serpentine communities but also their functional interactions are subjected to selective evolutionary forces.

Removal of half of the flowers reduced pollen removal, proportion of flowers receiving pollen, fruit set, and fruit mass compared to unmanipulated plants, while spur-tip removal increased fruit set and fruit mass but did not affect pollen removal or proportion of flowers receiving pollen. The effect of spur-tip removal on fruit mass was stronger among plants with intact number of flowers compared to plants with experimentally reduced number of flowers. The results demonstrate that number of flowers and spur length are direct targets of selection and may affect female fitness nonadditively.

Establishing temporal habitat patches, such as long-term set-aside, is potentially a valuable approach to support pollinator populations in intensively cultivated landscapes. The benefits of this approach are expected to differ between pollinator groups, because of fundamental differences in their ecology. 2. We studied the responses of two pollinator groups, bumblebees and diurnal Lepidoptera (butterflies and diurnal moths), to the vegetation succession in experimental set-aside during six consecutive years. The pollinators were monitored in 24 large treatment plots (50 x 50 m), sown with three different seed mixtures (competitive and two alternatives) and unmanaged or managed by mowing, and on 10 surrounding field margins. 3. The responses of the two pollinator groups to vegetation succession were distinctly different. Bumblebees showed a very strong positive response to the diverse seed mixture with abundant floral resources, and their abundance peaked in the first year. The species richness and abundance of Lepidoptera were increased gradually, suggesting differential colonization speeds of species and a gradual establishment of populations. Lepidopteran abundance reached the level of the field margins in 3 years, whereas the corresponding species richness level was not reached. The benefits of the alternative seed mixtures were less pronounced in Lepidoptera than in bumblebees. No effects of the mowing treatment on either species group were detected. 4. Within both pollinator groups, the response to vegetation succession was associated with species traits. In bumblebees, long-tongued species (indicating specialization) were increased during succession. In butterflies and diurnal moths, colonization success of species was strongly correlated with their wing span (indicating mobility). The most successful colonizers in butterflies were grass feeders and in diurnal moths the species feeding on leguminous plants at the larval stage. 5. Synthesis and applications. The ecological requirements of different pollinator groups should be taken into account when establishing set-aside. Supporting bumblebees is possible even on short-term set-aside, assuming nectar and pollen sources are made available. The occurrence of butterflies and diurnal moths is strongly driven by additional factors, such as the availability of larval host plants as well as adult mobility, which calls for set-aside management regimes to be in place for several years.","[Alanen, Eeva-Liisa; Kuussaari, Mikko] Finnish Environm Inst, Ecosyst Change Unit, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Hyvonen, Terho] MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Plant Prod Res, FI-31600 Jokioinen, Finland; [Harma, Oskari] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Alanen, EL (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst, Ecosyst Change Unit, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland.",eeva-liisa.alanen@ymparisto.fi,"Kuussaari, Mikko/Y-4070-2019","Kuussaari, Mikko/0000-0003-0264-9316",Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation,"We thank the editor and two anonymous referees for valuable comments on the earlier version of this manuscript; Janne Heliola for constructing and managing the experiment data base; Juha Poyry for valuable comments and for helping with the autocorrelation analysis; Erik Ockinger for valuable help with the analysis of species traits as well as Liisa Alanen for checking the English language.

Disruption of plant-pollinator relationships is predicted to cause plant mating system evolution, although this process has not been directly observed. This study demonstrates the immediate evolutionary effects of pollinator loss within experimental populations of a predominately outcrossing wildflower. Initially equivalent populations evolved for five generations within two pollination treatments: abundant bumblebee pollinators versus no pollinators. The populations without pollinators suffered greatly reduced fitness in early generations but rebounded as they evolved an improved ability to self-fertilize. All populations diverged in floral, developmental, and life-history traits, but only a subset of characters showed clear association with pollination treatment. Pronounced treatment effects were noted for anther-stigma separation and autogamous seed set. Dramatic allele frequency changes at two chromosomal polymorphisms occurred in the no pollinator populations, explaining a large fraction of divergence in pollen viability. The pattern of phenotypic and genetic changes in this experiment favors a sequential model for the evolution of the multitrait selfing syndrome observed throughout angiosperms.","[Roels, Sarah A.

Despite concerns that plants and pollinators might be at risk of such decoupling, there have been few attempts to test this hypothesis using detailed phenological data on insect emergence and flowering at the same localities. In particular, there are few data sets on pollinator flight seasons that are independent of flowering phenology, because pollinators are typically collected at flowers. To address this problem, we established standardized nesting habitat (trap nests) for solitary bees and wasps at sites along an elevational gradient in the Rocky Mountains, and monitored emergence during three growing seasons. We also recorded air temperatures and flowering phenology at each site. Using a reciprocal transplant experiment with nesting bees, we confirmed that local environmental conditions are the primary determinants of emergence phenology. We were then able to develop phenology models to describe timing of pollinator emergence or flowering, across all sites and years, as a function of accumulated degree-days. Although phenology of both plants and insects is well described by thermal models, the best models for insects suggest generally higher threshold temperatures for development or diapause termination than those required for plants. In addition, degree-day requirements for most species, both plants and insects, were lower in locations with longer winters, indicating either a chilling or vernalization requirement that is more completely fulfilled at colder sites, or a critical photoperiod before which degree-day accumulation does not contribute to development. Overall, these results suggest that phenology of plants and trap-nesting bees and wasps is regulated in similar ways by temperature, but that plants are more likely than insects to advance phenology in response to springtime warming. We discuss the implications of these results for plants and pollinators, and suggest that phenological decoupling alone is unlikely to threaten population persistence for most species in our study area.","[Forrest, Jessica R.

In contrast to diploid-tetraploid complexes, hybridization between diploid and hexaploid individuals may lead to viable fertile tetraploid offspring, and thus the interactions between these ploidy levels can be more complex. We investigated the breeding barriers operating between diploid and hexaploid individuals of Aster amellus at a contact zone in Central Europe to understand the absence of hybrids (i.e., tetraploids) and mixed populations. Phenological segregation, assortative mating mediated by pollinators and crossing ability were assessed under natural and controlled conditions in diploid and hexaploid populations growing in close proximity. The results revealed low levels of reproductive isolation (RI) due to flowering phenology (RI = 11-45%) and pollinator behavior (RI = 17%), so that pollen transfer between diploids and hexaploids is possible. In contrast, almost complete reproductive isolation was observed due to a series of post-pollination barriers that significantly reduced the production of offspring from inter-cytotype crosses (RI = 99.9%), even though some tetraploids were detected in seeds and seedlings. We conclude that the absence of tetraploids at the contact zone is probably due to a combination of several factors, including spatial segregation, strong post-pollination barriers (such as gametic isolation, low viability of tetraploid seeds and/or inability of tetraploid plants to reach the flowering stage), and to a lesser extent, temporal and behavioral segregation. Future studies should explore the fitness of tetraploids and the effect of different traits on the reproductive success and fitness of each cytotype. This will enable a fuller understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms acting in contact zones.","[Castro, Silvia; Loureiro, Joao] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal; [Castro, Silvia; Loureiro, Joao] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal; [Castro, Silvia; Muenzbergova, Zuzana] Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Raabova, Jana] Natl Museum, Dept Bot, Prague 19300 9, Czech Republic; [Castro, Silvia; Muenzbergova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Prague 12801, Czech Republic","Castro, S (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, POB 3046, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.",scastro@bot.uc.pt,"Loureiro, Joao/B-4830-2008; Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013; Castro, Silvia/C-2469-2008","Loureiro, Joao/0000-0002-9068-3954; Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220; Castro, Silvia/0000-0002-7358-6685","FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [BPD/41200/2007]; GACRGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P506/10/P188, 526/08/0706];  [MSM0021620828];  [AV0Z60050516];  [MK00002327201]","The authors thank T.

Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of this mode of pollination in Erica, the largest plant genus in the Cape flora of South Africa. The localized endemic Erica hanekomii appears to be adapted for pollination by rodents, on account of its low, mat-forming habit with many dull-coloured, pendulous flower heads, large volumes (up to c. 30 mu L per inflorescence) of sucrose-dominated nectar, hook-shaped styles and late winter flowering phenology. Rodents trapped in the vicinity of E. hanekomii plants had many thousands of Erica tetrads in their droppings. Nocturnal laboratory observation showed that Acomys subspinosus (Cape spiny mouse) is adept at manipulating E. hanekomii inflorescences and lapping nectar without destroying gynoecia. During terrarium experiments, pollen was deposited mainly on the rostrum, but also on the chest area and forelegs of A. subspinosus. No birds or insects were seen to visit E. hanekomii in the field. Whereas natural fruit set was 73%, inflorescences from which rodents, but not insects, were excluded using mesh cages, had fruit set of just 3.3%. Exclusion of all visitors resulted in zero seed production. Broken anther rings (a sign of flower visitation in Erica) were observed in 90.1% of flowers in the field and 92% of flowers exposed to rodents in the laboratory, but in virtually none of the flowers from which rodents were selectively excluded. This first record of a non-flying mammal pollination syndrome in Ericaceae raises interesting new questions about the origins of the rodent pollination system and the selective factors that lead to its evolution.

In the first experiment, the control plants were maintained at 90% field capacity (FC) and water-deficient plants were grown at 35% FC. The nitrogen fixation and growth parameters drastically decreased under water deficiency, however the three rhizobial strains, Rhizobium etli A32 (sensitive), Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 (tolerant), and Ensifer meliloti 4H41 (highly tolerant), showed different symbiotic performances. E. meliloti 4H41 allowed the best acetylene reduction activity (ARA) and biomass production and the highest number of large-sized nodules, while no significant effect was observed on lipid peroxidation, protein and legheamoglobin contents. The effect on antioxidant activities was the lowest. In the second experiment, plants were maintained at 90% FC during 45 days and then watering was stopped. The results showed that, the response to water deficit was quite similar for the three analyzed symbioses until 35% FC, but below this value of FC, symbiosis involving strain E. meliloti 4H41 was the most tolerant. This tolerance was accompanied, by in both experiments, by a stability of metabolic indices and protective antioxidant activities. These results suggest that, the relative tolerance of the nodules induced by strain 4H41 could be due to a constructive adaptation involving specific cortex structure and stress-adapted metabolic activities acquired during nodule formation and growth, rather than to a timely inducible response due to the stimulation of antioxidant enzymes. This suggestion should be confirmed through microscopic structure analysis and supplemental key enzymes in nodule metabolism such as sucrose synthase and malate dehydrogenase.","[Mhadhbi, Haythem; Chihaoui, Saifallah; Mhamdi, Rakia; Mnasri, Bacem; Jebara, Moez; Mhamdi, Ridha] Ctr Biotechnol Borj Cedria, Lab Legumes, Hammam Lif 2050, Tunisia","Mhadhbi, H (corresponding author), Ctr Biotechnol Borj Cedria, Lab Legumes, PB 901, Hammam Lif 2050, Tunisia.",mhadhbihay@yahoo.fr,"Mhadhbi, Haythem/D-9726-2013; Mhamdi, Ridha/D-9378-2013; Jebara, Moez/G-7588-2016","Mhamdi, Ridha/0000-0002-2999-7604; Jebara, Moez/0000-0002-2054-3892; Bacem, Mnasri/0000-0001-6385-4407; Mhadhbi, Haythem/0000-0003-0786-4269",,,,27,11,14,0,12,ACADEMIC JOURNALS,VICTORIA ISLAND,"P O BOX 5170-00200 NAIROBI, VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS 73023, NIGERIA",1684-5315,,,AFR J BIOTECHNOL,Afr.

Many of these herbs are clonal, patchily distributed, and produce large floral displays of nectar-rich 1-d flowers to attract hummingbird pollinators that may transport pollen over long distances. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of clonality, cross-proximity, and patchy distribution on the reproduction of the hummingbird-pollinated Amazonian herb Heliconia metallica. We experimentally pollinated flowers within populations with self-pollen and with pollen of different diversity, crossed flowers between populations, and added supplemental pollen to ramets growing solitarily or in conspecific patches. Only flowers pollinated early in the morning produced seeds. Selfed flowers produced seeds, but seed number and mass were strongly reduced, suggesting partial sterility and inbreeding depression after selfing. Because of pollen competition, flowers produced more seeds after crosses with several than with single donor plants. Crosses between populations mostly resulted in lower seed production than those within populations, suggesting outbreeding depression. Ramets in patches produced fewer seeds than solitary ramets and were more pollen-limited, possibly due to geitonogamy and biparental inbreeding in patches. We conclude that high rates of geitonogamy due to clonality and pollen limitation due to the short receptivity of flowers and patchy distribution constrain the reproduction of this clonal herb. Even in unfragmented rain forests with highly mobile pollinators, outbreeding depression may be a widespread phenomenon in plant reproduction.","[Schleuning, Matthias; Becker, Thomas; Matthies, Diethart] Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Schleuning, Matthias; Templin, Mathias] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Zool, Dept Ecol, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Templin, Mathias; Fischer, Markus] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Huaman, Vicky] Univ San Antonio Abad del Cusco, Fac Biol, Cuzco, Peru; [Vadillo, Giovana P.; Durka, Walter] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol BZF, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Vadillo, Giovana P.] Natl Univ San Marcos, Fac Biol Sci, Lima, Peru; [Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland","Schleuning, M (corresponding author), Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",mschleuning@senckenberg.de,"Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008; Durka, Walter/E-4667-2010; Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015","Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900; Durka, Walter/0000-0002-6611-2246; Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X; Vadillo, Giovana/0000-0002-0145-0367; Matthies, Diethart/0000-0003-2439-0501",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); German National Academic Foundation,"The authors thank PeruVerde for providing the opportunity to carry out this study around Manu Wildlife Center.

Grazing and mowing differ in their potential effects on plant gene flow and resulting population genetic structure. After assessing its breeding system, we investigated the effect of land use on the population genetic structure in the common grassland plant Veronica chamaedrys using 63 study populations on meadows, mown pastures and pastures in three regions in Germany, the so-called Biodiversity Exploratories. We determined plant density and analysed the genetic diversity, differentiation and small-scale genetic structure using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The breeding system of V chamaedrys turned out as self-incompatible and outcrossing. Its genetic diversity did not differ among land-use types. This may be attributed to large population sizes and the strong dispersal ability of the species, which maintains genetically diverse populations not prone to genetic drift. Genetic differentiation among populations was low (overall F(ST) = 0.075) but significant among the three regions. Land use had only weak effects on population differentiation in only one region. However, land use affected small-scale genetic structure suggesting that gene flow within plots was more restricted on meadows than on mown and unmown pastures.

In this study, we explored the relative contributions of biotic interactions and physical factors to habitat segregation in T. micrantha. Field surveys showed that soils from landslides were significantly richer in available phosphorus and harbored distinct arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities compared to gap soils. Greenhouse experiments designed to determine the effect of these abiotic and biotic differences showed that: (1) both landslide and gap species performed better in sterilized soil from their own habitat, (2) the availability of phosphorus and nitrogen was limiting in gap and landslide soils, respectively, (3) a standardized AMF inoculum increased performance of both species, but primarily on gap soils, and (4) landslide and gap species performed better when sterilized soils were inoculated with the microbial inoculum from their own habitat. A field experiment confirmed that survival and growth of each species was highest in its corresponding habitat. This experiment also showed that browsing damage significantly decreased survival of gap Trema on landslides. We conclude that belowground interactions with soil microbes and aboveground interactions with herbivores contribute in fundamental ways to processes that may promote and reinforce adaptive speciation.","[Pizano, Camila; Mangan, Scott A.; Herre, Edward Allen; Dalling, James W.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, APO, AA 34002 USA; [Pizano, Camila] Univ Los Andes, Dept Ciencias Biol, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Mangan, Scott A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Eom, Ahn-Heum] Korea Natl Univ Educ, Dept Biol, Chungbuk 363791, South Korea; [Dalling, James W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Pizano, C (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",pizanoc@ufl.edu,"Pizano, Camila/AAM-9324-2021","Pizano, Camila/0000-0003-4124-1348; Dalling, James/0000-0002-6488-9895; Eom, Ahn-Heum/0000-0002-6821-1088",Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute [003109000-5]; Andrew Mellon Foundation; Mars Corporation,"We thank A.

Changes in the plant-soil interactions that control decomposition, in particular, could alter carbon and nutrient cycling in soils and further alter other ecosystem functions. The effects of plant communities on decomposition may depend both on the type of tissue being decomposed and also on the different stages of the decomposition process. We used an experimental design where single plant functional groups were removed from a northern grassland to examine the role of plant identity in determining both short-term and long-term above- and belowground decomposition rates. Plant removals were conducted across fertilization and fungicide treatments to examine environmental context-dependency of functional group identity effects on decomposition. There were significant effects of plant functional group identity on aboveground decomposition, with the loss of grasses and forbs slowing decomposition, whereas the effects on belowground decomposition were rare and transient. Effects of plant identity on decomposition were consistent in both short- and long-term decomposition studies indicating that the influences of identity on the decomposition environment remained consistent throughout the different stages of the decomposition process. Both fertilizer and fungicide treatments affected overall decomposition rate, but there were few interactions between these treatments and plant removals. Although current species loss is likely to be happening in concert with environmental changes, the role a species plays in determining ecosystem functions such as decomposition may not be context-dependent in these northern environments, and this may provide greater predictive power in determining the effects of species loss with changing environments. Further, as plant identity shows significant effects on litter decomposition rates, the effects of current and predicted future biodiversity losses may depend specifically on which species are lost.","[McLaren, Jennie R.; Turkington, Roy] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","McLaren, JR (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",jmclaren@interchange.ubc.ca,"McLaren, Jennie/U-9130-2019","McLaren, Jennie/0000-0003-2004-4783",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Killam Foundation; Arctic Institute of North America,"This research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery grant to R.

The transfer of this knowledge to weed control management has not been fully explored. In part, this may be because it is difficult to quantify the economic impact of environmental weeds. This diminishes the prospects for expensive research and development required for integrated weed management. In this study, we examine the reproductive ecology of Phyla canescens, a species native to South America that is an aggressive agricultural and environmental weed in many parts of the world. We found that P. canescens is self-compatible, but not capable of automatic self-pollination. A vector is required to effect seed set. Field studies showed that 45% of seeds produced through open pollination are viable. Using exclosure cages, we showed that non-native Apis mellifera L. (honeybee) was the primary floral visitor and pollinator. Honeybee abundance was positively correlated with P. canescens abundance. Within the study site of 0.51 ha, almost 500 000 seeds ha-1 would be produced annually, as a result of honeybee pollination. This study shows that a shared evolutionary history is not required for honeybees to be successful pollinators. Facilitation is demonstrated through the obligate need for pollinators and the successful recruitment of the species through seed. Models for the control of feral honeybees in agricultural systems require development.","[Gross, C. L.; Gorrell, L.; Macdonald, M.

Genetic differentiation of quantitative traits among populations has been shown in many species, yet it can also be accompanied by other genetic changes, such as divergence in phenotypic plasticity and in genetic variance. Sideroxylonal (a formylated phloroglucinol compound or FPC) is an important chemical defence in eucalypts. The effect of environmental variation on its production is a critical gap in our understanding of its genetics and evolution. Methods The stability of genetic variation in sideroxylonal was assessed within and among populations of Eucalyptus tricarpa in three replicated provenance/progeny trials. The covariance structure of the data was also modelled to test whether genetic variances were consistent among populations and Fain's test was applied for major gene effects. Key Results A significant genotype x environment interaction occurred at the level of population, and was related to temperature range and seasonality in source populations. Within-population genetic variation was not affected by genotype x environment effects or different sampling years. However, within-population genetic variance for sideroxylonal concentration differed significantly among source populations. Regression of family variance on family mean suggested that this trait is subject to major gene effects, which could explain the observed differences in genetic variances among populations. Conclusions These results highlight the importance of replicated common-garden experiments for understanding the genetic basis of population differences. Genotype x environment interactions are unlikely to impede evolution or responses to artificial selection on sideroxylonal, but the lack of genetic variation in some populations may be a constraint. The results are broadly consistent with localized selection on foliar defence and illustrate that differentiation in population means, whether due to selection or to drift, can be accompanied by changes in other characteristics, such as plasticity and genetic variance.","[Harwood, Chris E.] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Sandy Bay, Tas 7005, Australia; [Andrew, Rose L.; Wallis, Ian R.; Foley, William J.] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Andrew, RL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, 3529-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",roseandr@interchange.ubc.ca,"Andrew, Rose/B-5929-2008; Harwood, Christopher/C-5060-2009; Foley, William J/C-8069-2009","Andrew, Rose/0000-0003-0099-8336; Harwood, Christopher/0000-0002-3830-4494; Foley, William J/0000-0001-8587-1814",Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC)Rural Industries R&D Corp [ANU 55A]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0667708]; RIRDC; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government,"We thank Lake Tyers Aboriginal Trust, Forests Victoria, Forests NSW and the Altmeier family for access to the experiments.

Ecosystem properties may be determined by the number of different species or groups of species in a community, the identity of those groups, and their relative abundance. The mass ratio theory predicts that the effect of species or groups of species on ecosystem properties will be dependent on their proportional abundance in a community. 2. Single plant functional groups (graminoids, legumes, non-leguminous forbs) were removed from a natural grassland in northern Canada to examine the role of group identity in determining both ecosystem properties and biomass compensation by remaining species. Removals were conducted across two different environmental treatments (fertilization and fungicide) to examine the context dependency of functional group identity effects. 3. The degree of biomass compensation in the first 4 years after removal was influenced by the identity of the functional group removed and also of those remaining. When graminoids were removed, none of the remaining functional groups compensated for the loss of biomass. Graminoids partially compensated for the removal of forbs or legumes, with the degree of compensation depending on environmental treatments. 4. Light interception, soil moisture and soil nutrients were all influenced by functional group identity, with graminoids having a greater impact than expected based on their biomass contribution to the community. Legumes, in contrast, had very little effect on any of the ecosystem properties measured. 5. For most ecosystem properties measured, the role of plant functional groups was not context dependent; functional groups had the same effect on ecosystem properties regardless of fertilization or fungicide treatments. 6. Synthesis. We have shown that the effects of losing a functional group do not solely depend on the group's dominance. In this northern grassland, there are greater effects of losing graminoids than one would predict based on their biomass contributions to the community, and functional group identity plays a critical role in determining the effects of diversity loss.","[McLaren, Jennie R.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","McLaren, JR (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",jmclaren@interchange.ubc.ca,"McLaren, Jennie/U-9130-2019","McLaren, Jennie/0000-0003-2004-4783",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Killam Foundation; Northern Scientific Training Program; Mountain Equipment Co-op Environment Fund; Western Ag Innovations,"We thank S.D.

Scalesia cordata is a tree occurring only in the southern part of Isabela as small, remnant populations of larger forests. We studied the reproductive ecology of a population protected in an enclosure in order to reveal the extent to which the reproductive system limits the recruitment of young individuals. Pollinator observations revealed that each capitulum received, on average, 2.5 visits per hour and exposed receptive stigmas received many pollen grains. Even so, the seed set and recruitment of trees was poor. Crossing experiments showed that S. cordata produced about twice as many fertile seeds after outcrossing than after selfing. In addition, self-pollinated capitula flowered for a longer time than outcrossed capitula (3.8 +/- 1.1 days vs. 2.1 +/- 0.8 days). These results may suggest that the species is partly self-incompatible, as other species of the genus. The small population size, with its potential derived consequences, is most certainly a prominent threat to S. cordata. The pressure from introduced plant species found in the enclosure also contributes to the seemingly poor condition of the population. To recover S. cordata, we suggest enlarging the enclosure, removing the introduced plant species and continuing to cultivate plants as a genetic reserve. Introducing new genetic material is likely to increase the seed set of the population.

We investigated sugar preferences of the Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa), using experiments in which birds were offered paired choices between energetically equivalent solutions over a range of sugar concentrations. The birds preferred hexose at low (5%) concentration and sucrose at high (25%) concentration; they showed no preference at 10%, 15%, and 20% concentrations. The birds regulated energy intake by adjusting volumetric Consumption, except on a 5% concentration diet, where they failed to maintain energy balance. They also exhibited a strong preference for concentrated solutions, given a choice between 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% sucrose solutions. We discuss the significance of these results in terms of the nectar composition Of sunbird-pollinated plants.
