These systems are classic testing grounds for hypotheses about community assembly. However, old field succession can be difficult to predict: seemingly similar fields often diverge in terms of species composition and environmental conditions. Here, we test the relative roles of contingency and stochasticity in driving vegetative successional dynamics. We draw on three decades of surveys in 24 old fields at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (Minnesota, USA), and focus on five drivers that are known to shape local plant communities: soil fertility, fire, climate, competition, and demography. These drivers can contribute to contingency when they act consistently across fields and years (e.g., soil nitrogen accumulation, experimental fire regimes, or average climate), or to stochasticity when their effects are variable (e.g., annual variations in weather, or colonization and mortality events). We proceed in two steps. First, we fit regressions estimating abundance, colonization, and mortality for eight major functional groups in relation to these five drivers. We then use these regressions to parameterize a series of metacommunity simulation models, and test whether observed levels of stochasticity and variation in the drivers are sufficient to explain successional divergence. All drivers were significantly associated with plant species abundances, colonization, and mortality. Contingent factors strongly altered predicted successional trajectories. However, replicate simulations with similar conditions followed similar successional trajectories, suggesting that stochastic processes did not lead to divergence. This robustness of successional dynamics may be explained by compensatory trade-offs. For example, species that were abundant late in succession typically suffered from low colonization rates and high mortality rates early in succession. Synthesis. Average successional dynamics among old fields at Cedar Creek follow largely consistent trends. Though dynamics of individual fields vary, much of this variation can be explained by contingent factors. Stochastic processes appear not to be sufficiently strong to create divergent successional trajectories among fields with similar sets of drivers. Our results therefore suggest that divergence among successional trajectories in chronosequences may be the result of predictable contingent factors, rather than unpredictable stochastic fluctuations.","[Clark, Adam Thomas; Tilman, Dave] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Clark, Adam Thomas] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Physiol Div, Leipzig, Germany; [Clark, Adam Thomas] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Synth Ctr Biodivers Sci sDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Clark, Adam Thomas] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; [Knops, Johannes M.

Non-aggressive invasive species that avoid conflict, but are also highly competitive are much less common in the literature. We revealed the absence of aggression in the highly successful invasive Asian house gecko in direct encounters with both conspecifics, and with an ecologically similar, aggressive native Australian house gecko. Abstract Invasive species are implicated in native species declines globally, but predicting the effect of specific invaders on a given native species remains difficult. Many successful invaders are highly aggressive, whereas others are not. The highly successful invasive Asian house gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, has achieved a pantropical distribution. We investigated direct interactions between H. frenatus and a sympatric native Australian house gecko (Gehyra dubia) to determine the strength and nature of aggressive exclusion and which species may be competitively superior. Intraspecific aggression was strong in the native, and individuals were more aggressive as residents than as intruders, suggesting this species shows site defence. In contrast, the invasive species displayed little aggression in intraspecific encounters. Overall, residents of the native species were more aggressive than residents of the invasive species. Aggression in the native species was influenced by the degree of aggression of the intruding gecko, but not by the species of intruder. Aggression from invasive residents was low and was not influenced by either the intruder's species or their behavior. Our study suggests that native Australian house geckos (G. dubia) are unlikely to be directly displaced by invasive H. frenatus, but rather that this native gecko will aggressively defend its resources when necessary. In this case, the tolerance of the invasive species for others in close proximity may contribute to its success.","[Cisterne, Adam; Schwarzkopf, Lin] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Pike, David A.] Rhodes Coll, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38112 USA","Cisterne, A (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",adam.cisterne@my.jcu.edu.au,"Schwarzkopf, Lin/C-1242-2012","Schwarzkopf, Lin/0000-0002-1009-670X; Cisterne, Adam/0000-0002-9133-5388",,,,60,3,4,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Throughout their range, observations have been made of a dominance shift favouring D. r. bugensis where the two species co-occur. Although both dreissenids have been widely studied, the mechanisms driving this dominance shift are not completely understood. Our long-term and short-term field experiments assessed a selection of species traits related to growth and settlement, which may be linked to a competitive benefit for either of both species. We assessed relative population densities in time and space, mortality, and inter- and intraspecific interactions in relation to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, and light intensity, using 14 x 14 cm PVC settlement plates. Dreissenids were identified, counted and measured over 11 years in the waterbody where D. r. bugensis was first discovered in Western Europe. Dreissena polymorpha appeared to have a competitive benefit over D. r. bugensis by being able to settle earlier, i.e. in spring, while other studies indicate the opposite. As salinities in the study region were relatively high in spring, this discrepancy may be explained by a higher salinity tolerance of D. polymorpha, as is known from the literature. In addition, Common Coots predated D. r. bugensis clusters. Dreissena polymorpha were not usually found in such clusters. Regardless of these competitive benefits for D. polymorpha, D. r. bugensis is the dominant species in the region. One possible explanation could be the fact that D. r. bugensis was found in similar densities on both light exposed and shaded fouling plates. Dreissena polymorpha on the other hand, was practically absent on light-exposed plates after 12 months. Therefore, a wider range of habitats seems to be suitable for the settlement of D. r. bugensis. Another driver of the dominance shift can be linked to it having faster growth than D. polymorpha, especially during spring. More generally, D. r. bugensis occurred in higher population densities on plates with D. polymorpha than on plates with only D. r. bugensis. Dreissena polymorpha individuals may thus induce the settlement of additional individuals of D. r. bugensis. A final reason for the dominance of D. r. bugensis concerns its low winter mortality. While the number of D. polymorpha individuals more than halved over the winter 2016-2017, no significant decrease in numbers of D. r. bugensis was recorded.","[D'Hont, Anouk; Gittenberger, Adriaan] GiMaRIS Marine Res Inventory & Strategy Solut, Rijksstr Weg 75, NL-2171 AK Sassenheim, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Nat Biodivers Ctr, Dept Marine Zool, Pesthuislaan 7, NL-2333 BA Leiden, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Leiden Univ, Ctr Environm Studies CML, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol Leiden, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Hendriks, A.

Recent access to a marine subsidy, especially if gained following apex predator loss, may facilitate coyote expansion along coastal routes and amplify the effects of mesopredator release. Our goal was to quantify and contextualize past and present marine resource use by coyotes on the central coast of California via stable isotope analysis. We measured delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in coyotes, their competitors, and their food resources at two modern sites, seven archaeological sites spanning in age from 3000 to 750 BP, and from historical (AD 1893-1992) coyote and grizzly bear hair and bone sourced from coastal counties. We found evidence for marine resource use by modern coastal California coyotes at one site, Ano Nuevo, which hosts a mainland northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) breeding colony. Seals and sea lions account for 20% of Ano Nuevo coyote diet throughout the year and this marine subsidy likely positively impacts coyote population size. Isotopic data suggest that neither historic nor prehistoric coyotes consumed marine-derived foods, even at sites near ancient mainland seal rookeries. Marine resource use by some contemporary California coyotes is a novel behavior relative to their recent ancestors. We hypothesize that human alteration of the environment through extirpation of the California grizzly bear and the more recent protection of marine mammals likely enabled this behavioral shift.","[Reid, Rachel E.

The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth and is experiencing a poleward climate migration from a polar to subpolar environment. This has resulted in a range expansion of the ice-intolerant gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) and a coincident decrease in ice-obligate Adelie penguins (P.adeliae) near Palmer Station, Anvers Island, WAP. Ecologically similar species that share a limited prey resource must occupy disparate foraging niches in order to co-exist. Therefore, we determined the extent of foraging and dietary niche segregation between Adelie and gentoo penguins during the austral breeding season near Palmer Station. This research was conducted across six breeding seasons, from 2009 to 2014, which allowed us to investigate niche overlap in the context of interannual resource variability. Using biotelemetry and diet sampling, we found substantial overlap in the diets of Adelie and gentoo penguins, who primarily consumed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba); however, our results showed that Adelie and gentoo penguins partitioned this shared prey resource through horizontal segregation of their core foraging areas. We did not find evidence that Antarctic krill were a limiting resource during the breeding season or that climate-induced sympatry of Adelie and gentoo penguins resulted in competition for prey or caused the subsequent differing population trajectories. This apparent absence of resource competition between Adelie and gentoo penguins throughout this study implies that current population trends in this region are governed by other biological and physical factors. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the mechanistic processes that influence top predator populations in the context of climate-driven ecosystem shifts.","[Pickett, Erin P.; Torres, Leigh G.; Friedlaender, Ari S.] Oregon State Univ, Marine Mammal Inst, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Newport, OR 97331 USA; [Fraser, William R.; Patterson-Fraser, Donna L.] Polar Oceans Res Grp, Sheridan, MT USA; [Cimino, Megan A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Friedlaender, Ari S.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Pickett, EP (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Marine Mammal Inst, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Newport, OR 97331 USA.",erin.p.pickett@gmail.com,,,"U.S. National Science Foundation, Office of Polar ProgramsNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OPP-0823101, PLR-1326167, PLR-1440435]; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1326541] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","U.S. National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs, Grant/Award Number: OPP-0823101, PLR-1326167 and PLR-1440435",,96,8,8,5,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Time constraints can be used as indicators of ecological stress. Here we test whether time constraints can help us understand group sizes, distribution patterns, and community sizes of forest guenons (Cercopithecus/Allochrocebus). Forest guenons typically live in small to medium sized one-male-multifemale groups and often live in communities with multiple forest guenon species. We developed a time-budget model using published data on time budgets, diets, body sizes, climate, and group sizes to predict maximum ecologically tolerable group and community sizes of forest guenons across 202 sub-Saharan African locations. The model correctly predicted presence/absence at 83% of these locations. Feeding-foraging time (an indicator of competition) limited group sizes, while resting and moving time constraints shaped guenon biogeography. Predicted group sizes were greater than observed group sizes but comparable to community sizes, suggesting community sizes are set by competition among guenon individuals irrespective of species. We conclude that time constraints and intraspecific competition are unlikely to be the main determinants of relatively small group sizes in forest guenons. Body mass was negatively correlated with moving time, which may give larger bodied species an advantage over smaller bodied species under future conditions when greater fragmentation of forests is likely to lead to increased moving time. Resting time heavily depended on leaf consumption and is likely to increase under future climatic conditions when leaf quality is expected to decrease.","[Korstjens, Amanda H.] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Poole BH14 5BB, Dorset, England; [Lehmann, Julia] Univ Roehampton, Dept Life Sci, London SW15 5PJ, England; [Dunbar, R.

In spite of its importance, less is known about its community-scale effects on aquatic ecosystems compared with those of nutrient loading. Understanding light limitation is also important for ecosystem management, as human activities have been rapidly altering light availability to aquatic ecosystems. Here we show that decreasing light can paradoxically increase phytoplankton abundance in shallow lakes. Our results, based on field manipulation experiments, field observations and models, suggest that, under competition for light and nutrients between phytoplankton and submersed macrophytes, alternative stable states are possible under high-light supply. In a macrophyte-dominated state, as light decreases phytoplankton density increases, because macrophytes (which effectively compete for nutrients released from the sediment) are more severely affected by light reduction. Our results demonstrate how species interactions with spatial heterogeneity can cause an unexpected outcome in complex ecosystems. An implication of our findings is that partial surface shading for controlling harmful algal bloom may, counterintuitively, increase phytoplankton abundance by decreasing macrophytes. Therefore, to predict how shallow lake ecosystems respond to environmental perturbations, it is essential to consider effects of light on the interactions between pelagic and benthic producers.","[Yamamichi, Masato; Yoshida, Takehito] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Kazama, Takehiro] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Reg Environm Res, Lake Biwa Branch Off, 5-34 Yanagasaki, Otsu, Shiga, Japan; [Tokita, Kotaro; Urabe, Jotaro] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Div Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Katano, Izumi] Nara Womens Univ, Dept Chem Biol & Environm Sci, Nara, Japan; [Doi, Hideyuki] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Simulat Studies, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Yoshida, Takehito] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kita Ku, Kyoto, Japan; [Hairston, Nelson G., Jr.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Yamamichi, M (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.",c-yamamichi@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Yamamichi, Masato/F-8836-2019; Yoshida, Takehito/O-9983-2014; Yoshida, Takehito/ABB-2490-2020; Urabe, Jotaro/ABI-7692-2020","Yamamichi, Masato/0000-0003-2136-3399; Yoshida, Takehito/0000-0001-9178-3634; Yoshida, Takehito/0000-0001-9178-3634; Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X; Kazama, Takehiro/0000-0002-2612-5202; Doi, Hideyuki/0000-0002-2701-3982; Katano, Izumi/0000-0002-1657-619X","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H02642, 16K18618, 16H04846, 15K00596, 25281052, 26291088, 25291094, 16H02522]; Hakubi Center for Advanced Research and John Mung Program of Kyoto University","This project was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) 15H02642 to J.U., M.Y., I.K., H.D. and T.Y., 16K18618 and 16H04846 to M.Y., 15K00596 to I.K., 25281052 and 26291088 to T.Y., and 25291094 and 16H02522 to J.U.

Despite these similarities, the White-eyed Vireo is widely distributed and common, whereas the Black-capped Vireo has a restricted breeding range and is currently federally endangered in the United States and Mexico. Here we address this apparent paradox with a comparative ecological study of co-occurring Black-capped and White-eyed vireos. We studied vireos in shrublands and woodlands in central Texas, USA, in 2013 and 2014. We used point count surveys (n = 256) and nest monitoring (n = 144) to determine arrival dates, settlement patterns, nest site selection, and nest survival relative to temporal and habitat factors. Additionally, we conducted reciprocal playback trials (n = 16) to test for the presence of interspecific aggression. White-eyed Vireos arrived first and established territories in both habitats with equal probability. Black-capped Vireos arrived after White-eyed Vireos and settled in greater numbers in shrubland habitat. White-eyed Vireos initiated nests earlier than Black-capped Vireos and selected nest sites surrounded by taller, more mature, and more densely wooded vegetation. For both species, nest survival declined as the season progressed and was greatest in tall, mature vegetation. Lower nest success in Black-capped Vireos (27% vs. 40%), although equivocal, supports earlier findings and suggests that the flexibility demonstrated by White-eyed Vireos confers a reproductive advantage. Playback trials failed to detect evidence of interspecific aggression, suggesting that competition with White-eyed Vireos is not limiting the Black-capped Vireo.","[Kovar, Daniel G.; Sperry, Jinelle H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Sperry, Jinelle H.] Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Champaign, IL USA; [Cimprich, David A.] Environm Div, Ft Hood, TX USA","Kovar, DG (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",daniel.g.kovar@gmail.com,"Kovar, Daniel/AAH-1493-2020",,US ArmyUnited States Department of Defense; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,"This project was funded by the US Army through an agreement between the Natural Resources Management Branch at Fort Hood, US Army ERDC, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Dual-guild herbivory also can muddle plant signals used by specialist natural enemies to locate prey, further complicating the net impact of herbivore-herbivore interactions in naturally diverse settings. While dual-guild herbivore communities are common in nature, consequences for top-down processes are unclear, as chemically mediated tri-trophic interactions are rarely evaluated in field environments. Combining observational and experimental approaches in the open field, we test a prediction that chewing herbivores interfere with top-down suppression of phloem feeders on Brassica oleracea across broad landscapes. In a two-year survey of 52 working farm sites, we found that parasitoid and aphid densities on broccoli plants positively correlated at farms where aphids and caterpillars rarely co-occurred, but this relationship disappeared at farms where caterpillars commonly co-occurred. In a follow-up experiment, we compared single and dual-guild herbivore communities at four local farm sites and found that caterpillars (P.rapae) caused a 30% reduction in aphid parasitism (primarily by Diaeretiella rapae), and increased aphid colony (Brevicoryne brassicae) growth at some sites. Notably, in the absence of predators, caterpillars indirectly suppressed, rather than enhanced, aphid growth. Amid considerable ecological noise, our study reveals a pattern of apparent commensalism: herbivore-herbivore facilitation via relaxed top-down suppression. This work suggests that enemy-mediated apparent commensalism may override constraints to growth induced by competing herbivores in field environments, and emphasizes the value of placing chemically mediated interactions within their broader environmental and community contexts.","[Blubaugh, Carmen K.] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29678 USA; [Blubaugh, Carmen K.; Asplund, Jacob S.; Philips, Christopher R.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.; Morra, Matthew J.; Popova, Inna E.] Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Soil & Entomol Sci, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Reganold, John P.] Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.] Univ Idaho, Dept Entomol Nematol & Plant Pathol, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Morra, Matthew J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Soil & Water Syst, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29678 USA.; Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",cblubau@clemson.edu,"Morra, Matthew/P-1216-2019; Morra, Matthew J/B-1723-2008","Morra, Matthew/0000-0003-3842-1575; Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102; Popova, Inna/0000-0002-2004-1411",USDA NIFA ORG award [2015-09273],"We are grateful to Elizabeth Magill and Sabrina Judson for field and lab assistance, to Olivia Smith for helping with figures, and to Paul Nabity, Ian Kaplan, Adrienne Godschalx, and Robert Schaeffer for comments on previous drafts of this manuscript.

More recent theory holds that species evolve narrow physiological tolerances in aseasonal regions, with temperature being an important determining factor in such zones. We tested how abiotic (temperature) and biotic (competition) factors set range limits and structure bird communities along strong, opposing, temperature-seasonality and species-richness gradients in the Himalayas, in two regions separated by 1500 km. By examining the degree to which seasonal elevational migration conserves year-round thermal niches across species, we show that species in the relatively aseasonal and speciose east are more constrained by temperature compared with species in the highly seasonal west. We further show that seasonality has a profound effect on the strength of competition between congeneric species. Competition appears to be stronger in winter, a period of resource scarcity in the Himalayas, in both the east and the west, with similarly sized eastern species more likely to segregate in thermal niche space in winter. Our results indicate that rather than acting in isolation, abiotic and biotic factors mediate each other to structure ecological communities.","[Srinivasan, Umesh; Elsen, Paul R.; Wilcove, David S.] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Program Sci Technol & Environm Policy, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Elsen, Paul R.; Wilcove, David S.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Tingley, Morgan W.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Srinivasan, U (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Program Sci Technol & Environm Policy, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",umesh.srinivasan@gmail.com,"Tingley, Morgan W/F-8519-2011; Elsen, Paul/H-9567-2019","Tingley, Morgan W/0000-0002-1477-2218; Elsen, Paul/0000-0002-9953-7961; Wilcove, David/0000-0002-1354-0503","High Meadows Foundation, Princeton University; University of Connecticut; Princeton Environmental Institute Walbridge Fund","Funding for this study came from the High Meadows Foundation, Princeton University, the University of Connecticut, and the Princeton Environmental Institute Walbridge Fund.",,58,22,23,2,26,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

We evaluated six varieties of S. melongena, 22 accessions of wild related species and 42 interspecific hybrids between cultivated eggplant and wild relatives for phenolics content, fruit flesh colour, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and fruit flesh browning. Wild relatives generally had a higher content in phenolics and a broader range of variation than cultivated eggplant. Chlorogenic acid was the predominant ( > 65.0%) phenolic acid in cultivated eggplant and its primary genepool wild ancestor S. insanum, while for the other wild species on average represented < 50% of the chromatogram peak area. Fruit flesh colour was lighter in S. melongena than in the wild species, while PPO activity and browning was much higher in wild species of the secondary and tertiary genepools. Interspecific hybrids between S. melongena and S. insanum were intermediate in their characteristics, while those with secondary and tertiary genepool species were more similar to the wild species. No significant correlations were found between total phenolics or chlorogenic acid contents and fruit flesh browning, but PPO activity was correlated to both the degree of browning (r = 0.404) and colour difference (r = 0.458). The results indicate that wild species can contribute to improving the bioactive properties of eggplant without affecting negatively fruit flesh colour and browning.","[Kaushik, Prashant; Gramazio, Pietro; Vilanova, Santiago; Prohens, Jaime] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Conservac & Mejora Agrodiversidad Valenciana, Camino Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Raigon, Maria D.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Quim, Camino Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Plazas, Mariola] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas, Camino Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain","Prohens, J (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Conservac & Mejora Agrodiversidad Valenciana, Camino Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",prakau@doctor.upv.es; piegra@upv.es; sanvina@upvnet.upv.es; mdraigon@qim.upv.es; jprohens@btc.upv.es; maplaav@btc.upv.es,"Gramazio, Pietro/O-3143-2017; De La O Plazas Avila, Maria/AAA-8711-2019; vilanova, santiago/AAA-5743-2019; Prohens, Jaime/H-2228-2015","Gramazio, Pietro/0000-0003-2226-7999; De La O Plazas Avila, Maria/0000-0001-8090-7312; vilanova, santiago/0000-0003-4939-9713; Prohens, Jaime/0000-0003-1181-9065; Kaushik, Prashant/0000-0002-3145-2849","initiative Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives - Government of Norway [GS13044, GS17011]; European Union's Horizon - Research and Innovation Framework Programme [677379]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (from MINECO/FEDER) [AGL2015-64755-R]; ICARIndian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia","This work has been funded in part by the initiative Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives, which is supported by the Government of Norway (GS13044 and GS17011).

However, these behavioral interactions within (intraspecific) and between (interspecific) species are costly as they can be energetically expensive and cause injury or death. To avoid these agonistic interactions, numerous species alter their behaviors and resource requirements. Spatial variation in nest site competition allows for investigation of concurrent variation in territorial defense behavior. Further, among species with bi-parental nest defense, behavioral similarity in territorial defense may benefit pairs. Here, we studied territorial aggression between two eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) populations (North Carolina and Alabama, USA) that differ in avian community structure; those in North Carolina have recently begun to experience strong interspecific competition for nesting cavities by tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a competitive pressure that is relatively new for North Carolina bluebirds (similar to 35-40 years) and is absent in Alabama populations. We found that bluebirds in North Carolina are more aggressive to simulated territorial intrusions compared to their Alabama counterparts. Behavioral similarity (here, in aggression) between partners is strong and similar in both populations. These results suggest that bluebirds in North Carolina may have to maintain higher baseline aggression during territory establishment and nest construction to co-occur with highly aggressive tree swallows, but that, in both populations, behavioral similarity between partners may be adaptive. Finally, we acknowledge the preliminary nature of this study and the need for expanding the behavioral studies to other sites in the southeastern United States. Greater regional coverage would exclude the possibility of alternative drivers of the observed behavioral differences between the North Carolina and Alabama populations.","[Albers, Alexandria N.; Jones, John Anthony; Siefferman, Lynn] Appalachian State Univ, Biol Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Jones, John Anthony] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Siefferman, L (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Biol Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",sieffermanlm@appstate.edu,,"Jones, John/0000-0003-2615-1248","Appalachian State University, Office of Student Research","We thank Wendy Hood for logistical assistance at the Alabama population.

Playback experiments, currently limited to interactions involving group-living large carnivores, demonstrate that attending to cues indicative of the immediate presence of heterospecific competitors plays a substantial role in influencing competition among these species. Group-living species vocalize regularly to signal to one another, and competitors can readily eavesdrop on these acoustic cues. Solitary large carnivores also vocalize to conspecifics, but much less frequently, reducing the ease with which heterospecific competitors can eavesdrop. Eavesdropping could nonetheless play a substantive role in mediating competition among solitary large carnivores if the benefits of responding to the acoustic cues of heterospecific competitors (reducing risk or locating resources) are sufficiently large. Behavioral interactions between solitary large carnivore species are almost never observed, and there have been no experimental tests of their reactions to cues indicative of the immediate presence of other solitary large carnivores. We used an automated playback system to test the responses of a solitary large carnivore (black bear, Ursus americanus) to vocalizations of their similarly solitary competitor (cougar, Puma concolor), presenting both cougar and control vocalizations to free-living bears foraging along shorelines in British Columbia, Canada. Both mothers with cubs and solitary bears were significantly more likely to advance and vocalize toward cougar than control playbacks, mothers producing one or both of two distinct vocalizations and solitary bears producing just one. Cougars could either represent a potential risk to bears (particularly cubs), or a source of resources, as bears are known to regularly scavenge cougar kills. Our results are consistent with bears eavesdropping on cougars for both these reasons. As with group-living species, eavesdropping may be common among solitary large carnivores, and may be an important driver of competition between these species.","[Suraci, Justin P.; Clinchy, Michael; Roberts, Devin J.; Zanette, Liana Y.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Suraci, Justin P.] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC, Canada","Suraci, JP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",justin.suraci@gmail.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC),,40,1,1,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,SEP,2017,123,9,,,,,593,599,,10.1111/eth.12631,,,7,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FD9EB,WOS:000407824500002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Over six years, we surveyed 33 ponds where these species co-occur in western Kentucky, USA. We found that larval densities between species were positively correlated, and that habitat features had contrasting, species-specific effects. Larval sizes for each species showed negative intra-and interspecific relationships with larval densities of each species, but larval A. maculatum generally exerted the stronger relative interspecific effect. Overall, our study highlights that different characteristics of a population (i.e., body size or abundance) may be differentially affected by abiotic and biotic factors, even for ecologically similar, sympatric species. Understanding which traits are regulated by each component will advance our knowledge on how populations and communities are structured.","[Anderson, Thomas L.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.; Hartman, Bradley A.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, 2112 Biol Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Mott, Cy L.] Eastern Kentucky Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Moore 349, Richmond, KY 40475 USA; [Hartman, Bradley A.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 2112 Biol Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA.; Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, 2112 Biol Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA.",anderstl@gmail.com; cy.mott@eku.edu; bhartman@murraystate.edu; hwhiteman@murraystate.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354787]; Watershed Studies Institute; American Museum of Natural History Theodore Roosevelt Grant,"The authors thank C.

Among 15 focal species, CTmax ranged from 44.6 to 51.3 degrees C, and was strongly predictive of population responses to urban warming across 18 study sites (r(2) = 0.44).

Primates usually interact with their prey, predators, competitors and neutral species. Using 'all occurrence' sampling, we have studied inter-specific interactions of lion-tailed macaques with non-primate species found in their habitat. We observed that the percentage of total time spent on interactions with non-primates was less than 1. Also, the percentage of total time spent in interacting with competitors, predators and neutral species was less than 0.5. The lack of predation pressure and lack of opportunities for mixed-species associations for increasing foraging efficiency appear to be the major reasons for the absence of interactions with non-primates. By comparing with studies from other primate habitat regions, we observed that primates in South Asia interact much lesser with non-primates than those in South America and Africa. A previous study showed that the interactions of lion-tailed macaques even with other primate species in the Western Ghats are less than expected by chance.","[Erinjery, Joseph J.; Mohan, K.; Singh, Mewa] Univ Mysore, Biopsychol Lab, Mysuru 570006, India; [Erinjery, Joseph J.; Mohan, K.; Singh, Mewa] Univ Mysore, Inst Excellence, Mysuru 570006, India; [Kumara, Honnavalli N.] Salim Ali Ctr Ornithol & Nat Hist, Coimbatore 641108, Tamil Nadu, India; [Singh, Mewa] Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Evolutionary & Organismal Biol Unit, Bengaluru 560064, India; [Singh, Mewa] Natl Inst Adv Studies, Indian Inst Sci Campus, Bengaluru 560012, India","Singh, M (corresponding author), Univ Mysore, Biopsychol Lab, Mysuru 570006, India.; Singh, M (corresponding author), Univ Mysore, Inst Excellence, Mysuru 570006, India.; Singh, M (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Evolutionary & Organismal Biol Unit, Bengaluru 560064, India.; Singh, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Studies, Indian Inst Sci Campus, Bengaluru 560012, India.",mewasinghltm@gmail.com,"Erinjery, Joseph/J-8443-2019","Erinjery, Joseph/0000-0002-5690-838X","Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India","M.S. thanks the Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India for the J.

The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and spinycheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus) are invasive benthic predators that occupy and defend similar cryptic microhabitats, and thus may compete for shelter. The round goby expanded throughout the North American Great Lakes within 8 years of introduction, whereas another 6 years passed before it had spread through the upper St. Lawrence River. Here, we explore the premise that dense established populations of the invasive spinycheek crayfish slowed round goby colonization of the St. Lawrence River. We performed a series of videotaped laboratory experiments to determine if round gobies suffer from aggressive attacks or alter their behaviour (e.g. use of shelter and movement) in the presence of spinycheek crayfish. We also assessed the prolonged effects of food and shelter competition by comparing changes in the submerged mass of juvenile round gobies and spinycheek crayfish in conspecific and heterospecific pairs. Contrary to our predictions, round gobies more frequently initiated aggressive encounters with spinycheek crayfish, whereas the crayfish were more likely to flee or be evicted from their shelters. Furthermore, round gobies gained more body mass than spinycheek crayfish, regardless of conspecific or heterospecific pairing. Rather than impeding round goby colonization, spinycheek crayfish appear more likely to suffer energetic costs and an increased exposure to predation in the presence of round gobies.","[Church, Kathleen] Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Iacarella, Josephine C.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada","Ricciardi, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada.",tony.ricciardi@mcgill.ca,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN),"The authors are grateful to N.

This may result in increased competition both within species and between species. Many studies have demonstrated that when two previously non-overlapping species are forced to compete over a resource, one species is likely to become dominant over the other. This study explores the impact a larger species of fiddler crab (Tabuca elegans-previously known as Uca elegans) has when invading an area previously used solely by a smaller species (Austruca mjoebergi-previously known as Uca mjoebergi). Here we show that, while there are some detrimental effects of living next to a heterospecific, they are relatively minor. New heterospecific neighbours fight more regularly with resident crabs, but each fight is no longer or more escalated than those between the resident and a new conspecific male. The residents are not specifically targeted by intruding heterospecifics, thus, given the large advantage of having a heterospecific neighbour in terms of lowered competition for females, the overall impact of species mixing is probably not as negative as might have been predicted.","[Clark, H.

Weed-management techniques that reduce weed production need to be investigated to provide new approaches. The first step in this process is the determination of weed productivity in different competitive conditions. Field experiments were conducted in 2006 and 2008 in an experimental field in Padinska Skela to quantify growth and seed production of velvetleaf in maize, as well as in a velvetleaf monoculture. A density of velvetleaf ranging from 1 to 8 plants m-1 was artificially created. In a mixture with maize, velvetleaf was sown in crop rows. The growth of velvetleaf was estimated based on plant height, fresh aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI). Velvetleaf fecundity was determined as seed mass plant(-1) and seed mass m(-2). Differences between years in plant production were very prominent. In general, velvetleaf productivity in maize depended on its density. Intraspecific competition had a major influence on growth and seed production when velvetleaf density was from 4 to 8 plants m(-1) in maize rows. This information indicates that environmental conditions and weed density can promote/reduce inter-and intraspecific competition and help in the construction of population dynamics models to predict population density, seed bank and competitiveness of weeds and reduce inputs for weed management.","[Vrbnicanin, Sava; Bozic, Dragana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade 11080, Serbia; [Onc-Jovanovic, Eleonora] Inst PKB Agroekonom, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Saric-Krsmanovic, Marija] Pesticide & Environm Res Inst, Banatska 31b, Belgrade 11080, Serbia; [Pavlovic, Danijela] Inst Plant Protect & Environm, Drajzerova 9, Belgrade 11040, Serbia; [Malidza, Goran] Inst Field & Vegetable Crops, M Gorkog 30, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Jaric, Snezana] Univ Belgrade, Inst Biol Res Sinisa Stankov, Dept Ecol, Karnegijeva 4, Belgrade 11060, Serbia","Vrbnicanin, S (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade 11080, Serbia.",sava@agrif.bg.ac.rs,,"Pavlovic, Danijela/0000-0002-1365-7330; Jaric, Snezana/0000-0002-9356-7334","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III 46008, TR31073, 173018]; EU-FP7-REGPOT-AREA Project [316004]","We are grateful to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia for supporting this investigation (Projects III 46008, TR31073 and 173018) and EU-FP7-REGPOT-AREA Project No 316004.

Larval amphibians are model organisms to investigate the balancing of life history trade-offs because individuals must metamorphose before a wetland dries. Therefore, we deployed enclosures in a natural wetland to investigate the interactive effects of Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) density (50 or 100 tadpoles) and Brook Stickleback (Culaea inconstans) presence on survival and growth of tadpoles. We hypothesized that the effects of conspecific density on tadpole survival and growth would be dependent on the presence of fish predators. Stickleback predation significantly decreased Wood Frog survival; however, a trend of higher tadpole survival with fish was detected at high conspecific densities. Wood Frog time to and mass at metamorphosis was not significantly affected by either conspecific density or stickleback presence. Our results demonstrate that Brook Sticklebacks can play a significant role in regulating Wood Frog survival in a Subarctic wetland, but the impact is likely dependent on tadpole density. Therefore, this research highlights the dynamic and complex effects of competition and predation in a Subarctic wetland.

Environmental effects on traits impacting population dynamics are often overlooked in studies of parasitic wasp (parasitoid) competition. Lineages of the parasitoid Diachasma alloeum (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) differ in relative ovipositor length (a trait affecting the proportion of hosts available for parasitism). Since the size of natal hosts affects the overall body size of many adult parasitoids, outcomes of competition between D. alloeum lineages should be influenced by both their natal host's size and their inherited ovipositor: body size ratios. Previous genetic work showed the unexpected result that the apparently inferior competitor (the lineage with smaller ovipositors in its ancestral environment) has successfully colonized a new host. We present body size measurements and a phenomological model of competition showing that relative ovipositor sizes of the two lineages predict success of the apparently inferior wasp lineage in the new host. We present several variants of the model, including simulations: 1) wherein competitors have either ancestral trait values or trait values acquired in the novel environment; 2) that allow varying rates of constant immigration from the inferior competitor's source population; and 3) with stochastic immigration from both lineages' source populations. We show that ancestral trait differences and changes in environmentally mediated traits interact to affect outcomes of competition. Apparently inferior female parasitoids ('meek mothers') attacking a host in a novel environment can produce highly successful daughters if those daughters inherit large ovipositor: body size ratios and grow to a larger size in the new environment. Predictive models of parasitoid competition that consider effects of environmentally mediated trait changes may be particularly important for biocontrol programs wherein parasitoids are introduced into new environments or used to control novel hosts.","[Hamerlinck, Gabriela; Forbes, Andrew A.] Univ Iowa, Dept Biol, 430 Biol Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Lemoine, Nathan P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Lemoine, Nathan P.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA; [Hood, Glen R.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, South Bend, IN 46556 USA; [Abbott, Karen C.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Hamerlinck, G (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Biol, 430 Biol Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",gaby.hamerlinck@bioquest.org,"Forbes, Andrew/AAH-2218-2021","Forbes, Andrew/0000-0001-8332-6652; Abbott, Karen/0000-0001-5143-0690","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1145355]; National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis - NSF [DBI-1300426]; University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Div Of Biological InfrastructureNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1300426] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported by NSF (DEB-1145355) to AAF and by a Short-term Visitor award to GH and NPL by the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, an institute sponsored by NSF (DBI-1300426), with additional support from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville.",,54,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2016,125,10,,,,,1516,1527,,10.1111/oik.02701,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DZ1QY,WOS:000385615100014,,,,,2021-09-21,

Intraspecific interactions are then concentrated within clusters, and between-species interactions occur near cluster boundaries. Spread of a locally dispersing invader can become motion of an interface between the invading and resident species, and spatial competition will produce variation in the extent of invasive advance along the interface. Kinetic roughening theory offers a framework for quantifying the development of these fluctuations, which may structure the interface as a self-affine fractal, and so induce a series of temporal and spatial scaling relationships. For most clonal plants, advance should become spatially correlated along the interface, and width of the interface (where invader and resident compete directly) should increase as a power function of time. Once roughening equilibrates, interface width and the relative location of the most advanced invader should each scale with interface length. We tested these predictions by letting white clover (Trifolium repens) invade ryegrass (Lolium perenne). The spatial correlation of clover growth developed as anticipated by kinetic roughening theory, and both interface width and the most advanced invader's lead scaled with front length.

Understanding competitive interactions between invaders and functionally similar native species provides an important benchmark for predicting the consequences of invasion. However, even though having a broad dietary niche is widely considered a key factor determining invasion success, little is known about the effects of competition with functionally similar native competitors on the dietary niche breadths of invasive species. We used a combination of field experiments and field surveys to examine the impacts of competition with a functionally similar native crab species on the population densities, growth rates and diet of the globally widespread invasive red swamp crayfish in an African river ecosystem. The presence of native crabs triggered significant dietary niche constriction within the invasive crayfish population. Further, growth rates of both species were reduced significantly, and by a similar extent, in the presence of one another. In spite of this, crayfish maintained positive growth rates in the presence of crabs, whereas crabs lost mass in the presence of crayfish. Consequently, over the 3-year duration of the study, crab abundance declined at those sites invaded by the crayfish, becoming locally extinct at one. The invasive crayfish had a dramatic effect on ecosystem structure and functioning, halving benthic invertebrate densities and increasing decomposition rates fourfold compared to the crabs. This indicates that replacement of native crabs by invasive crayfish likely alters the structure and functioning of African river ecosystems significantly. This study provides a novel example of the constriction of the dietary niche of a successful invasive population in the presence of competition from a functionally similar native species. This finding highlights the importance of considering both environmental and ecological contexts in order to predict and manage the impacts of invasive species on ecosystems.","[Jackson, Michelle C.; Grey, Jonathan; Miller, Katie] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Jackson, Michelle C.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Ctr Invas Biol, Hatfield, South Africa; [Grey, Jonathan] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lib Ave, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Britton, J.

They can respond either by being attracted to (potential mates, preferred habitats) or avoiding (predators, competitors) the source of the stimuli. Coral reef fishes use chemical cues to detect habitats, avoid predators and recognise conspecifics. However, the extent to which chemical cues are used to detect and respond to potential competitors, has received little attention. Here we test olfactory preferences for conspecifics and heterospecifics in newly settled juvenile coral reef fishes. Juveniles of 4 common coral-associated damselfish species: Dascyllus melanurus, Dascyllus reticulatus, Chrysiptera arnazae and Pomacentrus moluccensis, were subjected to olfactory choice tests. Three of the 4 species (excluding P. moluccensis) demonstrated preferences for waterborne conspecifics odours. All species exhibited an avoidance towards heterospecific odours; this aversion was consistently greatest towards P. moluccensis. A neutral response toward heterospecifics was only evident in two instances (1) between the two congeneric Dascyllus species, with D. melanurus toward D. reticulatus, and (2) with C. arnazae toward D. melanurus. While it is already known that the presence of conspecifics plays a vital role in settlement site selection, we show here that the presence of heterospecifics may also be key in determining the spatial distributions of juveniles across areas of coral reef.

The mesopredator release hypothesis proposes that apex predators control medium-sized predator populations through competition and/or intraguild predation. The decline of apex predators thus leads to an increase in mesopredators, possibly with a negative impact on prey populations. Information about the abundance of mammalian tundra predators, wolf (Canis lupus), wolverine (Gulo gulo), lynx (Lynx lynx), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) was collected from local active outdoors people during semi-structured interviews in 14 low arctic or sub-arctic settlements in western Eurasia. The perceived abundance of red fox decreased with higher wolf abundance and in more arctic areas, but the negative effect of wolves decreased in more arctic and therefore less productive ecosystems. The perceived abundance of arctic fox increased towards the arctic and in areas with colder winters. Although there was a negative correlation between the two fox species, red fox was not included in the model for perceived arctic fox abundance, which received most support. Our results support the mesopredator release hypothesis regarding the expansion of red foxes in subarctic areas and indicate that top-down control by apex predators is weaker in less productive and more arctic ecosystems. We showed that local ecological knowledge is a valuable source of information about large-scale processes, which are difficult to study through direct biological investigations.","[Ehrich, Dorothee; Stromeng, Marita A.; Killengreen, Siw T.] Arctic Univ Norway, Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Ehrich, D (corresponding author), Arctic Univ Norway, Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",dorothee.ehrich@uit.no,"Killengreen, Siw/G-9205-2016; Ehrich, Dorothee/F-6492-2015","Ehrich, Dorothee/0000-0002-3028-9488",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [S192040/S30]; Norwegian Environment Agency,"We thank L.

Here, juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from two allopatric populations (LaHave and Sebago) being used for reintroduction into Lake Ontario were placed into two natural stream sites differing in the presence of ecologically similar rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We assessed the effects of competition in the natural streams on fitness-related traits and habitat use of the Atlantic salmon. We then compared these effects to those observed in artificial streams from a previous study. Atlantic salmon in natural streams had reduced fitness-related traits that were associated with suboptimal microhabitats in the presence of rainbow trout, but utilised optimal microhabitats in their absence. In the presence of rainbow trout, the two Atlantic salmon populations exhibited comparable recapture proportions to each other, but the individuals from the Sebago population had better performance (body size and condition) than those from the LaHave population. Responses of both Atlantic salmon populations to competition with rainbow trout were generally similar in both direction and magnitude when compared to results from the artificial stream study. The combined results suggest that native species restoration efforts should be focused on candidate populations that are ecologically suitable to reintroduction environments, as well as on suitable habitats that do not contain exotic competitors. Moreover, this study highlights the value of controlled experiments in artificial environments for predicting fitness-related performance in natural environments.","[Houde, Aimee Lee S.; Neff, Bryan D.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Smith, Andrew D.; Peres-Neto, Pedro R.] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H2X 1Y4, Canada; [Wilson, Chris C.] Trent Univ, Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Aquat Res & Monitoring Sect, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Peres-Neto, Pedro R.] Univ Quebec, Canada Res Chair Spatial Modelling & Biodivers, Montreal, PQ H2X 1Y4, Canada","Neff, BD (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",bneff@uwo.ca,"Wilson, Chris C/J-4851-2012","Wilson, Chris C/0000-0002-9528-0652; Peres Neto, Pedro/0000-0002-5629-8067",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters; Toronto Region Conservation Authority,"The research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through a postgraduate student research award to ASH and a Strategic Project Grant to BDN and PRPN.

Thus, competitive interactions may take place. Fish have been introduced to many formerly fishless lakes, which has profoundly affected the competitive and predatory relations in these waters. In this paper we review recent findings on duck fish competitive interactions in boreal lakes. On a general level, analyses based on presence/absence data of fish have indicated that ducks can be negatively affected by fish. More rigorous studies where fish density has been considered have corroborated the pattern emerging from presence/absence studies. For the Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) and Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis), the effect of competition has been tested experimentally. In general, it appears that diving ducks such as Common Goldeneye, which forage in open water, are the most affected by fish, Common Teal (Arias crecca) is intermediate, whereas Mallard (A. platyrhynchos), which forage among the shore vegetation, is little affected. Likelihood or the strength of competition between ducks and fish may also depend on habitat productivity and structure. Numbers of invertebrates are higher among vegetation where there are less fish preying on them. Duck fish interactions are important to take into account when planning wetland creation and restoration for ducks. There is also an urgent need to mitigate the effects of fish introductions in wetlands.","[Nummi, Petri; Vaananen, Veli-Matti; Holopainen, Sari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Poysa, Hannu] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Yliopistokatu 6, Joensuu 80100, Finland","Nummi, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petri.nummi@helsinki.fi,"Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021","Holopainen, Sari/0000-0002-3271-4468; Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633",,,,80,13,13,0,17,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,2016,93,1,,,,,67,76,,,,,10,Ornithology,Zoology,DL3FU,WOS:000375520400008,,,,,2021-09-21,

The plastic foraging behaviour of carnivores is likely to be influenced by a suite of factors. Here, we studied spotted hyaena diet during two contrasting periods in terms of lion population abundance to investigate the changes in spotted hyaena foraging strategies in response to changes in expected intraguild interactions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. The analysis of hyaena scats and feeding sites of GPS-tracked individuals revealed that during the period of high lion abundance, spotted hyaena consumption and preference for very large prey (elephant and giraffe) increased, while that of large (buffalo) and medium-sized prey (zebra, wildebeest and kudu) decreased, despite an increase in spotted hyaena foraging group size. These results suggest a shift from active predation to scavenging as the potential risk of kleptoparasitism by lions and intraguild competition increased. However, the likely increase of lion predation on very large prey due to the increased proportion of adult males in the lion population could also result in intraguild facilitation by providing spotted hyaenas with additional food sources and thus promote coexistence between these species. Our findings suggest that changes in the numerical abundance of competing species can affect their diet and prey preference, which could ultimately increase the intensity of competition (and facilitation) between carnivores and may thus impact prey populations and possibly ecosystem functioning.","[Periquet, S.; Valeix, M.; Fritz, H.] Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, CNRS UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Claypole, J.] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Ctr Wildlife Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Drouet-Hoguet, N.] CNRS CIRAD HERD Programme Hwange LTER, Main Camp Res, Dete, Zimbabwe; [Salnicki, J.] Hyaena Res & Conservat Project, Woollahra, Australia; [Mudimba, S.] Zimbabwe Pk & Wildlife Management Author, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Revilla, E.] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Biol Conservac, E-41080 Seville, Spain","Periquet, S (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, CNRS UMR 5558, Bat Gregor Mendel,43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",stephanie.periquet@gmail.com,"Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010; Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014; Periquet, Stephanie/J-9979-2019; Revilla, Eloy/B-5100-2008","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661; Periquet, Stephanie/0000-0001-8901-3729; Revilla, Eloy/0000-0001-5534-5581","HERD project (Hwange Environmental Research Development) - Agence Nationale de la Recherche (FEAR)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-08-BLAN-0022]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (Programme Zones Ateliers); RP-PCP; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [C151-08]; ENS of Lyon; UCBL Lyon1; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation - FEDERSpanish Government [CGL2009-07301/BOS, CGL2012-35931/BOS]","The Zimbabwe Research Council and the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZPWMA) are kindly acknowledged for providing the opportunity to carry out this research.

The objective of this study was to examine competition between larval Cricket Frogs (Acris blanchardi), which are showing declines in parts of their range, and other anurans including Bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus), Green Frogs (Lithobates clamitans), and Cope's Gray Treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis). Using two separate experiments, we examined competitive interactions between larvae of (1) Cricket Frogs and different size classes of Bullfrogs; and (2) Cricket Frogs and Green Frogs, Cricket Frogs and Cope's Gray Treefrogs, or all three species together. We found no effect of either recently hatched or overwintered Bullfrog larvae on Cricket Frog metamorphosis. However, we found that Green Frogs reduced Cricket Frog survival and that Cope's Gray Treefrogs increased Cricket Frog time to metamorphosis. Because Cricket Frog populations have an annual life cycle, they might be sensitive to factors that influence recruitment, including competition with some species. Dispersal and landscape connectivity could be vital for maintaining Cricket Frog populations in areas with high densities of competitors (i.e., Green Frogs and Treefrogs). Conversely, the lack of competition between Cricket Frogs and Bullfrogs could explain why both species are able to coexist.","[Youngquist, Melissa B.; Downard, Kevin; Boone, Michelle D.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Youngquist, MB (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",youngqmb@miamioh.edu,,"Youngquist, Melissa/0000-0003-2721-1871",Miami University Undergraduate Summer Scholars Program,We thank S.

To overcome this problem, several studies have predicted local abundances (at the sample unit level) from species occurrence distribution models (SODMs), with differences in predictive performance among studies. Surprisingly, the ability of SODM to predict regional abundances of an entire area of interest has never been tested, despite the fact that it is an essential parameter for species conservation and management. We tested whether local and regional abundances of 21 terrestrial bird species could be predicted from SODMs in an exhaustively surveyed island, and examined the variation explained by species-specific traits. Location La Palma Island, Canary Islands. Methods We firstly assessed two types of algorithms representing the two main families of SODMs. We built models using presence/absence (boosted classification trees) and presence/background (MaxEnt) data as a function of relevant environmental predictors and tested their ability to predict the observed local abundances. The predicted probabilities of occurrence (P-i) were translated into animal numbers (n) using the revisited equation n(i)=-ln(1-P-i), and we obtained regional abundances (for the whole island). Results Predictive ability of presence/absence models was superior than that of MaxEnt. At the regional level, the observed average densities of all species were highly predictable from occurrence probabilities (R-2=93.5%), without overall overestimation or underestimation. Interspecific variation in the accuracy of predicted regional density was largely explained (R-2=73%), with habitat breath and variation in local abundance being the traits of greatest importance. Main conclusions Despite uncertainties associated with local predictions and the idiosyncrasies of each species, our procedures enabled us to predict regional abundances in an unbiased way. Our approach provides a cost-effective tool when a large number of species are involved. Furthermore, the influence of species-specific traits on the prediction accuracy provides insights into sampling designs for focal species.","[Carrascal, Luis M.; Aragon, Pedro; Lobo, Jorge M.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Palomino, David] Wildlife Consultor, Guadarrama 28440, Spain","Carrascal, LM (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, C Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",lmcarrascal@mncn.csic.es,"Aragon, Pedro/B-2598-2009; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016; Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008; Lobo, Jorge M/E-2309-2013","Aragon, Pedro/0000-0002-6849-7274; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Lobo, Jorge M/0000-0002-3152-4769","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science and Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2011-28177/BOS, CGL2014-56416-P]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [RYC-2011-07670]","This study is a contribution to the projects CGL2011-28177/BOS and CGL2014-56416-P of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science and Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, respectively.

However, lack of knowledge of the indirect consequences of invasions, combined with poor understanding of how their ecological effects depend upon competitive attributes of the receiving community, hinders our ability to manage and predict the effects of invasive species on ecosystems. We established an experiment using a combination of both additive and substitutive experimental designs to explore the effects of the globally spreading mysid shrimp Hemimysis anomala on the biological structure of outdoor pond mesocosms in the absence and presence of a functionally similar native competitor, Mysis salemaai. The naturally smaller H.anomala had considerably stronger effects on primary producers, multiple aspects of consumer assemblages and overall biological structure of the ponds in comparison with the functionally similar native. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects was generally independent of the presence of M.salemaai and even total mysid density. Hemimysis anomala reduced both the abundance and diversity of zooplankton assemblages significantly, triggering a strong trophic cascade on phytoplankton and a simultaneous increase of benthic invertebrate biomass. These findings indicate that invasion by H.anomala may exacerbate the effects of nutrient enrichment on lakes. Our results demonstrate that introduced species can, irrespective of the presence of functionally similar natives, induce complex changes to ecosystems that reach beyond direct consumptive effects. Moreover, the cascading indirect effects of invasion can exacerbate the impacts of other stressors. Disregarding the complexity of indirect effects therefore risks underestimating significantly the global ecological footprint of biological invasions.","[Penk, Marcin; Irvine, Kenneth; Donohue, Ian] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Irvine, Kenneth] UNESCO IHE Inst Water & Educ, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Donohue, Ian] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Trinity Ctr Biodivers Res, Dublin 2, Ireland","Penk, M (corresponding author), Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.",penkm@tcd.ie,"Donohue, Ian/A-7270-2010; Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013","Donohue, Ian/0000-0002-4698-6448; Penk, Marcin/0000-0001-5619-1991; Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064","Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [ECS/2009/01, GOIPD/2014/129]; Ecological Consultancy Services Limited","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments, which helped to improve the quality of the manuscript.

However, it is not clear whether such forms of competition can predict the collapse of communities and associated shifts in ecosystem function in the face of environmental change. Here, we use phylogenetic and functional trait data to test whether communities of two ecologically important guilds of tropical birds (frugivores and insectivores) are structured by species interactions in a fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. In both guilds, we found that forest patch size, quality, and degree of isolation influence the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of communities, with small, degraded, or isolated forest patches having an increased signature of competition (i.e., phylogenetic and functional trait overdispersion in relation to null models). These results suggest that local extinctions in the context of fragmentation are nonrandom, with a consistent bias toward more densely occupied regions of niche space. We conclude that the loss of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is mediated by niche-based competitive interactions among species, with potentially far-reaching implications for key ecosystem processes, including seed dispersal and plant damage by phytophagous insects.","[Bregman, Tom P.; Seddon, Nathalie; MacGregor, Hannah E.

We studied the population structure of three predominantly self-pollinating wild Lactuca species (Lactuca serriola, L. saligna, and L. aculeata). Seeds for this study were collected from individual plants in northern Israel, along a line transect, and two populations per each Lactuca species. The distance between neighboring plants sampled for seeds varied from 1.5 to 37 m. The transect length at single sites ranged from 47.2 to 151.8 m. The taxonomic status of 67 individual plants was morphologically validated during greenhouse multiplication. Both genetic structure and diversity were analyzed by using 11 EST-SSR loci and 230 AFLP markers. Relatively low genetic diversity values were observed, increasing in the following order: L. aculeata < L. serriola < L. saligna. Network analysis clearly separated samples according to their taxonomic determination; also reflecting the gene diversity as well as the genetic distance values among the three species. Nevertheless, given the predominantly selfing character of these species, populations were not uniform (genetically and morphologically). It seems that overall genetic variation in a population increases at its periphery, due to the presence of plants with non-indigenous alleles, which are most likely coming from migration and subsequent interpopulation or interspecific hybridization. Mantel tests generally indicated a positive association between genetic distance and micro-geographical distance of a particular population, primarily due to the outlier samples collected at a population's periphery.","[Kitner, Miloslav; Majesky, Lubos; Kristkova, Eva; Jemelkova, Michaela; Lebeda, Ales] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Slechtitelu 11, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Beharav, Alex] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel","Lebeda, A (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Slechtitelu 11, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic.",ales.lebeda@upol.cz,"Kitner, Miloslav/I-1223-2012; Lebeda, Ales/AAA-5277-2019","Kitner, Miloslav/0000-0002-3762-8067; Lebeda, Ales/0000-0003-3601-583X; Majesky, Lubos/0000-0002-8860-5703","Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University in Olomouc [PrF-2013-003, IGA_Prf_2014001]; Ministry of Education, Youth and SportsMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [MSM 6198959215]; Czech Ministry of AgricultureMinistry of Agriculture, Czech Republic [QH 71254]; European Social Fund, Education for Competitiveness Operational Programme [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0004]; Research Authority, University of Haifa, Israel","M.K., L.M., E.K., M.J., A.L. were supported by the Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University in Olomouc (PrF-2013-003, and IGA_Prf_2014001), Project MSM 6198959215 (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports), and Project QH 71254 (Czech Ministry of Agriculture); and LM was supported by the European Social Fund, Education for Competitiveness Operational Programme (CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0004).

We examined possible mechanisms for reducing this competition by examining the diving behaviour of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) after equipping 34 seals (11 females, 23 males) foraging from three locations; Romo, Denmark and Lorenzenplate and Helgoland, Germany, in the Wadden Sea area with time-depth recorders. Analysis of 319,021 dives revealed little between-colony variation but appreciable inter-sex differences, with males diving deeper than females, but for shorter periods. Males also had higher vertical descent rates. This result suggests that males may have higher overall swim speeds, which would increase higher oxygen consumption, and may explain the shorter dive durations compared to females. Intersex variation in swim speed alone is predicted to lead to fundamental differences in the time use of three-dimensional space, which may help reduce consumptive competition in harbour seals and other colonial pinnipeds.","[Wilson, Rory P.; Kay, William P.; Bone, Andrew; Hobson, Victoria J.] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Swansea Lab Anim Movement, Biosci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Wilson, Rory P.] Dusternbrooker, GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Kiel, Germany; [Liebsch, Nikolai] Customized Anim Tracking Solut, Moffat Beach, Qld, Australia; [Gomez-Laich, Agustina] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Nacl Patagon, Chubut, Argentina; [Siebert, Ursula] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Busum, Germany","Siebert, U (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Busum, Germany.",ursula.siebert@tiho-hannover.de,"Kay, William Penry/AAE-9069-2021","Kay, William/0000-0001-6855-7153","German Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, research project MINOS; German Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, research project MINOSplus; National Park Service; Schleswig-Holstein Ministry of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Areas","This study was supported by the German Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety as part of the research projects MINOS and MINOSplus.

However, accessing high trees and their fauna remains difficult; thus, how ants and spiders interact in the canopy remains unclear. To better understand the interspecific interactions between these two dominant arthropod groups, we investigated their spatial distributions at the canopy surface in a tropical rain forest in Borneo. We sampled ants and spiders six times between 2009 and 2011 by sweeping with an insect net at the tree crown surfaces of 190 emergent or tall (20m in height) trees. We collected 438 ant individuals belonging to 94 species and 1850 spider individuals (1630 juveniles and 220 adults) belonging to 142 morphospecies (adults only) from a total of 976 samples. The fact that we collected four times more spider individuals than ant individuals suggests that fewer ants forage at the tree crown surface than previously thought. The number of spider individuals negatively correlated with the number of ant individuals and the number of ant species, indicating significant exclusivity between ant and spider spatial distributions at the tree crown surface. Niche-overlap between the two taxa confirmed this observation. Although our data do not address the causes of these spatial distributions, antagonistic interspecific interactions such as interference behaviors and intra-guild predation are ecological mechanisms that give rise to exclusive spatial distributions.","[Katayama, Motoki; Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko; Tanaka, Hiroshi O.; Itioka, Takao] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan; [Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Endo, Tomoji] Kobe Coll, Sch Human Sci, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan; [Hashimoto, Yoshiaki] Univ Hyogo, Div Phylogenet, Inst Nat & Environm Sci, Museum Nat & Human Act, Sanda, Hyogo, Japan; [Yamane, Seiki] Kagoshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Kagoshima 890, Japan","Itioka, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan.",ichioka.takao.5m@kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [D-04]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and CultureMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [24570109]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24570109] Funding Source: KAKEN","Our study was conducted in accordance with the Memorandums of Understanding signed between the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC, Kuching, Malaysia) and the Japan Research Consortium for Tropical Forests in Sarawak (JRCTS, Sendai, Japan) in November 2005, and between the Sarawak Forest Department (SFD, Kuching, Malaysia) and JRCTS in December 2012.

However, other factors also contribute to these patterns. For example, theoretical studies as well as two survey-based studies have all suggested that dispersal may also impact these patterns. While natural communities commonly have nonrandom patterns of negative co-occurrence, understanding how different processes drive these patterns requires further research. We tested the influence of dispersal on co-occurrence patterns using a zooplankton mesocosm experiment with four different dispersal treatments varying in the number of dispersers delivered into mesocosms on regular intervals. Our dispersal treatments were intended to adjust the relative importance of dispersal and competition experienced within mesocosms (i.e., high dispersal results in a relatively low influence of competition on species composition and vice versa). Higher dispersal translated into increased zooplankton species richness and inter-mesocosm compositional similarity, and also changed species occupancy patterns such that species occurrences were more even across mesocosms in higher-dispersal treatments. Dispersal treatments also differed markedly in species co-occurrence patterns. Negative co-occurrence patterns were significant for all but the lowest-dispersal treatment, peaked in the intermediate-dispersal treatments, and declined in the highest-dispersal treatment. Stability analyses illustrate that co-occurrence differences are robust to the exclusion of any single mesocosm in null model analyses. Dispersal treatments did not significantly differ with respect to abiotic variation, which has been recognized as a potential driver of negative co-occurrence patterns. These results suggest that not only can dispersal influence patterns of negative co-occurrence via changes to species richness and distribution (occupancy patterns among mesocosms), but the degree to which they do so varies nonlinearly with the strength of dispersal. Critically, because negative co-occurrence patterns were nonsignificant when the contribution of dispersal was lowest, it is possible that dispersal contributes strongly to many observed patterns of negative co-occurrence. Consequently, great care should be taken prior to interpreting significant co-occurrence tests as a product of species interactions.","[Schamp, Brandon S.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, PQ P6A 2G4, Canada; [Arnott, Shelley E.; Joslin, Katelyn L.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Schamp, BS (corresponding author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, PQ P6A 2G4, Canada.",brandon.schamp@algomau.ca,,"Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We thank D.

This study assessed the importance of anthropogenic foods to the diets of red foxes and arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus (L., 1758)), and competition for food resources between the two species in Prudhoe Bay. We used stable isotope analysis of fox tissues to infer diet during summer and winter for both red and arctic foxes, and lifetime diet for red fox. While the contribution of anthropogenic foods in late summer for both species' diets was low (similar to 10% to 15%), the contribution in late winter was higher and varied between species (red foxes = 49%; arctic foxes = 39%). Estimates of lifetime diet in red foxes suggest consistent use of anthropogenic foods. We found moderate overlap of fox diets, although red foxes appeared to be more specialized on lemmings, whereas arctic foxes had a more diverse diet. Availability and consumption of anthropogenic foods by red foxes, particularly in winter, may partially explain their year-round presence in Prudhoe Bay.","[Savory, G. A.; Hunter, C.

Insecticides are agents of environmental disturbance that can potentially change ecological relationships and competitive outcomes, but this subject has seldom been examined. As the co-existing cereal grain beetle species Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky and Rhyzopertha dominica F. share a common realized niche, directly competing for the same resources, they were used as models in our study. Intraspecific competition experiments were performed with increasing insect densities and insecticide doses in additive and replacement series using various density combinations of both beetle species maintained on insecticide-free or -sprayed grains. Insecticide-mediated release from competitive stress was not observed in our study of intraspecific competition in grain beetles. The insecticide enhanced the effect of insect density, particularly for the maize weevil S. zeamais, further impairing population growth at high densities. Therefore, insecticide susceptibility increased with intraspecific competition favoring insecticide efficacy. However, the effect of insecticide exposure on competitive interaction extends beyond intraspecific competition, affecting interspecific competition as well. Sitophilus zeamais was the dominant species when in interspecific competition prevailing in natural conditions (without insecticide exposure), but the dominance and species prevalence shifted from S. zeamais to R. dominica under insecticide exposure. Therefore, high conspecific densities favored insecticide efficacy, but the strength of the relationship differs with the species. In addition, the insecticide mediated a shift in species dominance and competition outcome indicating that insecticides are relevant mediators of species interaction, potentially influencing community composition and raising management concerns as potential cause of secondary pest outbreaks.","[Cordeiro, Erick Mauricio G.; Correa, Alberto S.; Guedes, Raul Narciso C.] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Correa, Alberto S.] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Dept Entomol & Acarol Agr, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Guedes, RNC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",guedes@ufv.br,"Guedes, Raul Narciso Carvalho/L-3924-2013; Cordeiro, Erick MG/P-7042-2015; Correa, Alberto S/C-4683-2014","Guedes, Raul Narciso Carvalho/0000-0001-6229-7549; Correa, Alberto S/0000-0002-3788-7480",Minas Gerais State Foundation of Research Aid (FAPEMIG)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); CAPES Foundation (Brazilian Ministry of Education)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology,"Funding was provided by the following Brazilian agencies: Minas Gerais State Foundation of Research Aid (FAPEMIG; www.fapemig.br), the CAPES Foundation (Brazilian Ministry of Education; www.capes.gov.br), and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq; Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology; www.cnpq.br).

This strain, formerly considered of the Zygosaccharomyces bailii species, has been used to study Z. bailii physiology, in particular, its extreme tolerance to acetic acid stress at low pH. The analysis of the genome sequence described in this work indicates that strain ISA1307 is an interspecies hybrid between Z. bailii and a closely related species. The genome sequence of ISA1307 is distributed through 154 scaffolds and has a size of around 21.2 Mb, corresponding to 96% of the genome size estimated by flow cytometry. Annotation of ISA1307 genome includes 4385 duplicated genes (similar to 90% of the total number of predicted genes) and 1155 predicted single-copy genes. The functional categories including a higher number of genes are 'Metabolism and generation of energy', 'Protein folding, modification and targeting' and 'Biogenesis of cellular components'. The knowledge of the genome sequence of the ISA1307 strain is expected to contribute to accelerate systems-level understanding of stress resistance mechanisms in Z. bailii and to inspire and guide novel biotechnological applications of this yeast species/strain in fermentation processes, given its high resilience to acidic stress. The availability of the ISA1307 genome sequence also paves the way to a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the generation and selection of more robust hybrid yeast strains in the stressful environment of wine fermentations.","[Mira, Nuno P.; Dias-Valada, Filipa; Palma, Margarida; Roque, Filipa C.; Guerreiro, Joana F.; Sa-Correia, Isabel] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Biol & Chem Engn, IBB,Dept Bioengn, Ave Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Muensterkoetter, Martin; Gueldener, Ulrich] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Bioinformat & Syst Biol, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Santos, Julia; Rodrigues, Fernando; Leao, Cecilia] Univ Minho, Sch Hlth Sci, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Santos, Julia; Rodrigues, Fernando; Leao, Cecilia] Univ Minho, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, Sch Hlth Sci, ICVS PT Govt Associate Lab 3Bs, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Maria Joao] Univ Minho, Ctr Mol & Environm Biol CBMA, Dept Biol, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal","Sa-Correia, I (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Biol & Chem Engn, IBB,Dept Bioengn, Ave Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",isacorreia@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Rodrigues, Fernando/T-5299-2018; Sousa, Maria Joao/H-8775-2013; Guldener, Ulrich/G-5227-2012; Munsterkotter, Martin/L-3436-2019; Leao, Cecilia/B-5051-2013; Santos, Julia M/D-4894-2013; Guerreiro, Joana F/M-4898-2015; Palma, Margarida/K-8797-2012; Munsterkotter, Martin/C-5288-2017; Guerreiro, Joana/AAD-1104-2019; Mira, Nuno P/E-2965-2012; Sa-Correia, Isabel/H-4054-2011","Rodrigues, Fernando/0000-0001-8436-9398; Sousa, Maria Joao/0000-0001-9424-4150; Guldener, Ulrich/0000-0001-5052-8610; Munsterkotter, Martin/0000-0002-0044-2381; Santos, Julia M/0000-0002-4035-0692; Guerreiro, Joana F/0000-0003-1960-603X; Palma, Margarida/0000-0002-1151-9014; Munsterkotter, Martin/0000-0002-0044-2381; Guerreiro, Joana/0000-0003-1960-603X; Mira, Nuno P/0000-0001-7556-0385; Sa-Correia, Isabel/0000-0003-2208-5183; Leao, Cecilia/0000-0003-1311-7884","FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission; FEDER through POFC-COMPETE [PEst-OE/EQB/ LA0023/2011, PTDC/AGR-ALI/102608/2008, PEst-C/BIA/ UI4050/2011, SFRH/BPD/73306/2010, SFRH/ BD/80065/2011]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [F3705]","This research was supported by FCT and FEDER through POFC-COMPETE [contracts PEst-OE/EQB/ LA0023/2011_ research line: Systems and Synthetic Biology PTDC/AGR-ALI/102608/2008, PEst-C/BIA/ UI4050/2011, and post-doctoral grant to M.P.

This has led to significant challenges in teasing apart the various mechanisms thought to underpin multispecies groups. One potentially useful approach for gaining an understanding of this process is to identify the rules that best predict the observed distribution of individuals across these groups. In order to gain an insight into the decision-making process that might generate patterns of heterospecific associations, we collected data on the number and distribution of nests in breeding colonies that contained 3 species of weaverbird. We found no evidence of segregation by species, either within or between colonies. Using agent-based simulations of males applying different rules of attraction and repulsion to conspecifics or heterospecifics, we found that the best-fitting rule contained no heterospecific attraction. In this rule, individuals picked colonies based on an optimal distribution of conspecific nests. Given that nests are an important sexual signal in weavers, our findings suggest that this rule is biologically relevant: Males are seeking an optimal trade-off between attracting females via lekking and competing for mates if too many conspecific nests are present.","[Farine, Damien R.; Downing, Philip A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Downing, Charles P.] Uganda Virus Res Inst, Entebbe, Uganda","Downing, PA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",philip.downing@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Farine, Damien R./Y-2454-2019; Downing, Philip/AAZ-7086-2020","Farine, Damien R./0000-0003-2208-7613; Downing, Philip/0000-0002-5286-3153",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [AdG 250164]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [1222007] Funding Source: researchfish,D.R.F. was funded by an European Research Council grant (AdG 250164) awarded to Prof. Ben C.

Many plant species show a trade-off between stress tolerance and competitive ability. Our hypothesis was that competitive ability is higher for species less tolerant to drought. Bromus pictus and Pappostipa speciosa are two conspicuous grasses from semiarid Patagonian steppe with opposite morpho-functional characteristics. B. pictus is the most plastic, sheep-palatable and relatively drought-intolerant species and it is predicted to have higher aggressivity than P. speciosa, considering aggressivity as an index of competitive ability. A two-year field experiment was performed using a replacement series type-design with a fixed total density of two plants and three proportions of relative plant size. Two levels of water availability were evaluated. After, 24 months, there was no difference in competitive ability between species (comparing aggressivity values between species, AG). However, AG was higher for plants growing in minority and lower for plants growing in majority (in relation to their neighbor size) regardless of species identity. There was no tradeoff between stress tolerance and competitive ability. Taking into account that P. speciosa is clearly dominant and B. pictus is subordinate, it seems that plant-to-plant competition would not suffice to explain population abundance within this community.

In a wetland where distinct habitat shifts are missing we compared prey use of three generalist benthivorous sunfishes to look for evidence of ontogenetic, interspecific, and seasonal variation in prey composition. Diet analysis revealed evidence of diet ontogeny in warmouth (Lepomis gulosus, 30-152 mm standard length, SL), but not in bluespotted sunfish (Enneacanthus gloriosus, 30-47 mm SL) or dollar sunfish (Lepomis marginatus, 30-60 mm SL). Bluespotted and dollar sunfishes consumed small dipteran and amphipod prey and had similar diets in both seasons suggesting a potential for strong interspecific competition. In the dry season, warmouth shifted from using smaller insect prey to larger decapod and fish prey with increasing size. This shift to prey types that were little used by the other species reduced dietary niche overlap with the other sunfishes. After drought and re-flooding (in the wet season), decapods and small fish were less abundant in the wetland and the warmouth ontogenetic shift was less distinct. When matched for gape width, prey composition differed between warmouth and both dollar and bluespotted sunfishes in the wet season, suggesting differences in sunfish foraging modes, but prey use differences were less clear in the dry season when prey were abundant. Both warmouth ontogenetic diet shifts and seasonal variation in prey use (probably mediated by prey abundance) had strong influences on diet overlap and therefore the potential for intra- and interspecific competition between sunfishes in this wetland ecosystem.","[Bransky, Jacob W.; Dorn, Nathan J.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USA","Bransky, JW (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3200 Coll Ave, Davie, FL 33314 USA.",jacobbransky@gmail.com,,,,,,29,8,8,2,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Indirect interactions mediated by natural enemies shared among herbivorous insects have recently attracted much interest. While many studies have predicted a high potential for apparent competition, only a few have rigorously tested predictions derived from the food web structure in terms of realised population and community dynamics. 2. In this study, a quantified food web was used to identify pairs of herbivore species potentially tied by strong parasitoid-mediated interactions. The host populations and their parasitism rates over two consecutive years were then followed, during which time the abundance of one dominant host crashed. Following this natural experiment, imprints of asymmetrical, long-term apparent competition among hosts were sought in population growth rates. 3. The population growth revealed no signs of apparent competition as mediated by parasitoids: the abundance and parasitism rates of less abundant herbivores were uncorrelated with the relative growth rate of four dominant herbivore species with which they shared a major part of their parasitoids. Likewise, the population crash of the dominant herbivore, Cynips longiventris, did not detectably affect the abundances or parasitism rates of other herbivores with which it shared a major fraction of its parasitoids. 4. Overall, this case study fails to add evidence to previous suggestions that apparent competition may constitute a major force in structuring natural communities. However, it suggests that dynamics should not be inferred from static food web structure alone, but rather that predictions based on structure should be verified by empirical observations of realised population dynamics.","[Kaartinen, Riikka; Roslin, Tomas] Spatial Foodweb Ecol Grp, Dept Agr Sci, Helsinki, Finland","Kaartinen, R (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",riikka.kaartinen@slu.se,"Roslin, Tomas/E-8648-2016","Roslin, Tomas/0000-0002-2957-4791","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [129636, 126296, 129142]; Entomological Society of Helsinki","We thank Fiia Berghem, Katja Bonnevier, Janne Haaksluoto, Helena Rosenlew and many other field and laboratory assistants.

To locate hosts for their offspring, parasitic wasps, or parasitoids, use plant odour blends induced by herbivore feeding. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) may also be used by competitors and predators. Therefore, offspring of parasitoids that respond to the most conspicuous odours may find themselves more frequently involved in competition or predation risk. We studied cultivars of Brassica oleracea that are known to differ in volatile production that underlies attractiveness to parasitoids and asked whether variation in this parameter is associated with a heterogeneous distribution of intrinsic competition among parasitoid larvae and predation risk by hyperparasitoids that parasitize parasitoid larvae or pupae. We inoculated field-grown plants with Pieris caterpillars and, thereafter, exposed them to the natural parasitoid community. We measured the frequency of multiple incidences of parasitism in these herbivores. Cocoons of the parasitoids were collected to identify the degree of hyperparasitism associated with different Brassica cultivars. Pieris caterpillars on cultivars that were more attractive to Cotesia parasitoids were more commonly parasitized by several females of the same (superparasitism) or different wasp species (multiparasitism) than caterpillars on less attractive plants. Cocoons of parasitoids on attractive plants also more frequently produced hyperparasitoids. Our results show that there is heterogeneity in intrinsic competition and risk of hyperparasitism for parasitoids on different cabbage cultivars and that this heterogeneity is likely generated by variation in attraction of parasitoids to HIPVs of these cultivars. We conclude that parasitoids may find themselves between a rock and a hard place as cues for host presence may also predict high levels of competition and risk of predation. We speculate that this affects selection on parasitoid responses to plant odours and enhances selection on traits that make wasps better intrinsic or extrinsic competitors as well as selection for adaptive traits - such as crypsis - that protect them against hyperparasitoids.

However, data show mutualistic interactions to be common and persistent. Previous theory predicts persistence provided that mutualistic species are regulated by factors external to the mutualistic interaction (e.g., limiting background resources). Empirical data suggest that competition for the benefits provided by mutualistic partners could be a source of negative density-dependence that allows for population regulation, but there is little, if any, theoretical exploration of this mechanism. Here we develop mathematical models to investigate whether competition for benefits alone can allow the persistence of obligate mutualistic interactions. We consider the role of trade-offs in persistence, specifically, trade-offs between benefits acquired versus given and between competition for access to partners (competitive ability) and benefit acquisition. We find that competition for benefits alone is sufficient to promote the persistence of pairwise interactions and the assembly of a three-species community module from an initially pairwise interaction. We find that a trade-off between benefits acquired versus given reduces opportunities for cheating (because a species that acquires significantly more benefits than it gives drives its partner extinct), while a trade-off between competitive ability and benefit acquisition facilitates persistence when it is weak, but constrains persistence when it is strong. When both trade-offs operate simultaneously, persistence requires that each species acquire sufficient benefits to avoid being cheated by its partners, but not so much that it loses its competitive ability. The key finding is that competition for benefits provides a biologically-realistic mechanism for the long-term persistence of mutualistic interactions and the assembly of complex community modules from initially pairwise interactions.

However, our ability to predict the ecological consequences of biodiversity changes remains limited by our poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying biodiversity effects. We disentangled the contributions of light competition and residual neighborhood interactions in a 10-year-old biodiversity experiment with tropical trees that display overyielding, i.e., higher community-level yields in mixtures compared with monocultures. We developed models of individual tree growth that partition the effects of neighboring trees into shading and residual effects assumed to reflect primarily belowground interactions. These models reject the hypothesis that reduced light competition in mixtures is the only mechanism driving overyielding. After factoring out the effects of shading, litter production by neighbors was a far better predictor of tree growth than traditional crowding indices; it contributed to overyielding by producing pairwise interactions that ranged from competitive to facilitative, but which, on average, concentrated competition within species. Consistent with litter-mediated biodiversity effects, the magnitude of overyielding increased over time. Our results provide evidence for diversity effects extending beyond that of light and reveal the neglected role of litter-mediated interactions among trees.","[Sapijanskas, Jurgis; Potvin, Catherine; Loreau, Michel] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Sapijanskas, Jurgis] AgroParisTech ENGREF, Ecole Natl Genie Rural Eaux & Forets, Direct Sci, F-75015 Paris, France; [Potvin, Catherine] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Expt Ecol Stn, F-09200 Moulis, France","Sapijanskas, J (corresponding author), AgroParisTech ENGREF, 19 Ave Maine, F-75015 Paris, France.",jurgis.sapijanskas@polytechnique.org,,,French Ministry of Agriculture; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Canada Research Chair ProgrammeCanada Research Chairs; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"We are grateful to Jose Monteza for invaluable help in maintaining the experimental plantation and data collection.

Recent analyses suggest a strong likelihood of competition between eutherian predators and the endangered spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), although experiments are required to confirm this. If competition does occur, what are its likely effects on the long-term survival of spotted-tailed quoll populations? We used population viability analysis (PVA) to predict the fate of a hypothetical quoll population under various scenarios of competition. PVA showed that spotted-tailed quoll populations may be susceptible to extinction when faced with high densities of competitors. Model scenarios simulating exploitation competition and/or intraguild killing greatly reduced the population's probability of survival, leading in the worst-case scenario to almost certain extinction.","[Glen, A.

However, another hypothesis is that overfishing of piscivorous cod has caused an increased abundance of formerly predatory-controlled pelagic fish including herring Clupea harengus, which in turn has suppressed the recruitment of cod through predation on the early life stages of cod. Here we analyze 40 yr of trawl survey data in order to explore how the abundance of young herring affects cod recruitment, and how cod biomass affects the abundance of herring. In both cases we also take into account the effects of spawner biomass (of cod and herring, respectively) and sea temperature. We take a novel, explicitly spatial, approach by analyzing these effects on a local (185 x 167 km) scale. Our results indicate large spatial variability in ecological mechanisms. In the German Bight, high cod recruitment is associated with low herring abundance, low temperatures and high overall cod spawner biomass. This area used to contain a large portion of the cod recruits, and there is a strong correlation between the fraction of cod recruits found in this area and overall recruitment. In this area, herring recruitment is also negatively associated with the abundance of large cod. Thus, for this part of the North Sea, our findings are consistent with a reversal of dominance between cod and herring; however, herring may affect the cod by competition rather than by predation.","[Hjermann, Dag O.; Rouyer, Tristan; Stenseth, Nils C.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Fisher, Jonathan A.

To date, researchers have focused mostly on very similar species, such as 2 mammals or 2 birds of prey, occupying the same habitat. However, the situation where a predatory mammal may live sympatrically with a common bird of prey is probably more common. A good example is the coexistence of the red fox and the common buzzard. The relationship between these species with respect to spatial distribution, the abundance of a potentially important prey species (common vole), diet, trophic niche breadth, and niche overlap was studied in western Poland during 2006-2009. The distances between fox dens and buzzard nests were significantly shorter than would be expected by chance. The abundance of common vole was higher in sites where both predators were present than in the control sites, where neither predator was recorded. The trophic niche overlap between both predators was moderate (62.1%). However, the trophic niche breadth of the common buzzard was narrower (2.733) than that of the red fox (3.875), which implies that the fox is a more generalist predator.","[Jankowiak, Lukasz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Behav Ecol, Coll Biol, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Tryjanowski, Piotr] Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland","Jankowiak, L (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Behav Ecol, Coll Biol, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",jankowiakl@gmail.com,"Jankowiak, Lukasz/AAX-8117-2020","Jankowiak, Lukasz/0000-0002-3843-9778; Tryjanowski, Piotr/0000-0002-8358-0797",,,,42,8,8,0,43,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-0179,1303-6114,,TURK J ZOOL,Turk.

Certainly there have been copious, seminal works on competition in marine and freshwater ecosystems, most often on research executed at smaller ecological scales such as rocky intertidal zones, coral reefs, or littoral zones, and often involving experimental manipulation. Such studies have typically emphasized organisms with relatively high site fidelity, and all have focused primarily at the individual level. Here we springboard from those studies to explore competition among marine fishes at broader spatiotemporal scales, scales at which fish populations are distributed, scales at which their associated fisheries operate and are managed, and as observed under ambient (i.e., nonexperimental) system dynamics. Inferring that competition might be occurring among marine fishes requires four conditions: opposite population trajectories, high spatiotemporal overlap, high dietary overlap, and some indication of resource limitation. We used those criteria to examine cases of species pairings from the Northeast United States Large Marine Ecosystem to ascertain if there are broadly applicable rules of thumb to determine when competition might be a significant consideration. We assert that such rules exist, and where competition is strongly suspected, we provide an empirically based method of calculating first-order, model-free interaction terms that can scope the potential magnitude of competitive effects. We do so very much cognizant of several caveats and theoretical considerations; but our main premise is that estimating and evaluating competition for marine fishes from extant, commonly available data is feasible, is highly germane, and has many valuable applications for multispecies and ecosystem models as we move toward ecosystem-based fisheries management.","[Link, Jason S.] NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Auster, Peter J.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Auster, Peter J.] Sea Res Fdn Myst Aquarium, Groton, CT 06340 USA","Link, JS (corresponding author), NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 166 Water St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",Jason.Link@noaa.gov,"Auster, Peter/ABI-3568-2020","Link, Jason/0000-0003-2740-7161",NOAA Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary; National Marine Sanctuary Foundation; Florida State University,"We thank the organizers, especially PC Coleman, of the Mote Symposium on Species Interactions for inviting us to contribute this work and its associated keynote presentation.

In community ecology, chance is recognized as a key factor in community assemblage, but less is known about its role in intraguild processes leading to species coexistence. Here we study the relevance of resource unpredictability per se as a promoter of intraguild positive interspecific interactions and as a biodiversity enhancer in an Old World avian scavenger guild, which has evolved to feed upon spatially and temporally unpredictable resources, i.e., carcasses. We performed a large-scale field experiment in which 58 carcasses were disposed of and observed until complete consumption, either in continuously active supplementary feeding stations (predictable carcasses) or disposed of at random in the field (unpredictable carcasses). Richness of scavenger species was similar at unpredictable and predictable carcasses, but their relative abundances were highly uneven at predictable carcasses leading to higher scavenger diversity (Shannon index) at unpredictable carcasses. Facilitatory interspecific processes only occurred at unpredictable resources but were disrupted in predictable conditions because the dominant specialist species (in our case, the Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus) arrived earlier and in larger numbers, monopolizing the resource. Small, endangered scavengers congregated at supplementary feeding stations but profited less compared to unpredictable carcasses, suggesting that they could constitute an ecological trap. Our findings offer new insights into the relevance of unpredictability of trophic resources in promoting both positive facilitatory interspecific interactions and species diversity and thus maintaining the function of guilds. Finally, the preservation of randomness in resource availability and the processes associated with its exploitation should be a major goal of conservation strategies aimed to preserve scavenger guilds evolved under naturally unpredictable trophic resources.","[Cortes-Avizanda, A.; Carrete, M.; Donazar, J.

From this model, the density of a species is predicted to peak at its distribution centre (abundant-centre hypothesis), as well as maximum body size, both variables being predicted to decrease similarly towards range margins. These predictions have rarely been tested along the full distribution range of species using the same sampling effort along the range. We tested the hypotheses that density and maximum body size would peak at a species' distribution centre and decrease similarly towards range edges by surveying intertidal barnacles throughout their full vertical range of distribution. We studied Semibalanus balanoides, which occurs between elevations closely above the lowest tides and closely below the highest tides in rocky intertidal habitats from Atlantic Canada. Analyses of data from 7 contiguous elevation zones indicated that both density and maximum body size followed a unimodal vertical trend. However, both variables peaked at a higher elevation than the distribution centre, decreasing to very low values towards the lower range margin. Several lines of evidence suggest that interspecific interactions may be limiting barnacle development at low elevations and that abiotic stress may limit development at the highest elevation zone. Overall, our study reinforces the notion that density and body size predictions deduced from the abundant-centre model represent an oversimplification of reality.","[Scrosati, R. A.; Grant, J.

These factors included the abundance of other plant species, changes in water depth, water quality, and herbivory by insects. Abiotic factors like temperature, pH, DO, and conductivity varied among sites and, more importantly, over time. The same was true for S. minima biomass, coverage, and condition. Principal component analysis identified four components which together explained 64% of the variability in S. minima biomass. The first component correlated strongly with herbivory from Cyrtobagous salviniae Carder and Sands and Synclita obliteralis (Walker) as well as the abundance of the duckweed Spirodela polyrrhiza (L.) schleid. Temperature effects were strongly represented in the second principal component. A stepwise regression model that best predicted S. minima biomass incorporated conductivity, insect herbivory, and interspecific plant abundance. Broader dry vs. wet season influences were apparent and linked to temperature, water depth, and conductivity that covaried with S. minima biomass. Sites where water depth changed the most had the least S. minima. Insect herbivory did not increase under more stagnant conditions when plant populations were less mobile. Overall, S. minima populations cycled in southern Florida in response to a shifting array of abiotic and biotic factors. The relative importance of these factors was less clear although the influences of herbivory, temperature, and the presence of other plants were significant.

To gain insight into ensuing mechanisms that might alter indirect species interactions, we examined how behavioural responses to an upper-level predatory fish might differ between mesopredator species with different life histories. In rocky reefs of the northeast Pacific Ocean, adult lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are upper-level predators that use a sit-and-wait hunting mode. Reef mesopredators that are prey to adult lingcod include kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus), younger lingcod, copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and quillback rockfish (S. maliger). Across these mesopredators species, longevity and age at maturity increases and, consequently, the annual proportion of lifetime reproductive output decreases in the order just listed. Therefore, we hypothesized that the level of risk taken to acquire resources would vary interspecifically in that same order. During field experiments we manipulated predation risk with a model adult lingcod and used fixed video cameras to quantify interactions between mesopredators and tethered prey (Pandalus shrimps). We predicted that the probabilities of inspecting and attacking tethered prey would rank from highest to lowest and the timing of these behaviours would rank from earliest to latest as follows: kelp greenling, lingcod, copper rockfish, and quillback rockfish. We also predicted that responses to the model lingcod, such as avoidance of interactions with tethered prey, would rank from weakest to strongest in the same order. Results were consistent with our predictions suggesting that, despite occupying similar trophic levels, longer-lived mesopredators with late maturity have stronger antipredator responses and therefore experience lower foraging rates in the presence of predators than mesopredators with faster life histories. The corollary is that the fishery removal of top predators, which relaxes predation risk, could potentially lead to stronger increases in foraging rates for mesopredators with slower life histories.","[Frid, Alejandro; Marliave, Jeff] Vancouver Aquarium, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, Dept Biol Sci, N Miami, FL USA","Frid, A (corresponding author), Vancouver Aquarium, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",alejfrid@gmail.com,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003",Florida International University Division of Research,"The study was funded in its entirety through a Seed Funds Award to Michael R Heithaus from the The Florida International University Division of Research.

Intraguild prey may evolve antipredator defenses, superior competitive ability on shared resources, or the ability to use an alternative resource, any of which may alter the structure of the food web. We tested for evolutionary responses by threespine stickleback to a benthic intraguild predator, prickly sculpin. We used a comparative morphometric analysis to show that stickleback sympatric with sculpin are more armored and have more limnetic-like body shapes than allopatric stickleback. To test the ecological implications of this shift, we conducted a mesocosm experiment that varied sculpin presence and stickleback population of origin (from one sympatric and one allopatric lake). Predation by sculpin greatly increased the mortality of allopatric stickleback. In contrast, sculpin presence did not affect the mortality of sympatric stickleback, although they did have lower growth rates suggesting increased nonpredatory effects of sculpin. Consistent with their morphology, sympatric stickleback included more pelagic prey in their diets, leading to depletion of zooplankton in the mesocosms. These findings suggest that intraguild prey evolution has altered food web structure by reducing both predation by the intraguild predator and diet overlap between species.","[Ingram, Travis; Svanbaeck, Richard; Kratina, Pavel; Southcott, Laura; Schluter, Dolph] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ingram, Travis; Svanbaeck, Richard; Kraft, Nathan J.

Such size-dependent predation risk is very common in systems with intraguild predation (IGP), i.e. when predatory species interact through predation and competition. Theory on IGP predicts that community composition depends on productivity. When recently testing this prediction using a terrestrial experimental system consisting of two phytoseiid mite species, Iphiseius degenerans as the IG-predator and Neoseiulus cucumeris as the IG-prey, and pollen (Typha latifolia) as the shared resource, we could not find the predicted community shift. Instead, we observed that IG-prey excluded IG-predators when the initial IG-prey/IG-predator ratio was high, whereas the opposite held when the initial ratio was low, which is also not predicted by theory. We therefore hypothesized that the existence of vulnerable and invulnerable stages in the two populations could be an important driver of the community composition. To test this, we first demonstrate that IG-prey adults indeed attacked IG-predator juveniles in the presence of the shared resource. Second, we show that the invasion capacity of IG-predators at high productivity levels indeed depended on the structure of resident IG-prey populations. Third, we further confirmed our hypothesis by mimicking successive invasion events of IG-predators into an established population of IG-prey at high productivity levels, which consistently failed. Our results show that the interplay between stage structure of populations and reciprocal intraguild predation is decisive at determining the species composition of communities with intraguild predation.","[Montserrat, M.; Sabelis, M.

Nonetheless, it has become increasingly clear that mimicry is frequently imprecise. Indeed, the phenotypic match is often poor between mimics and models in many Batesian mimicry complexes and among co-mimics in many Mullerian mimicry complexes. Here, we consider whether such imperfect mimicry represents an evolutionary compromise between predator- mediated selection favoring mimetic convergence on the one hand and competitively mediated selection favoring divergence on the other hand. Specifically, for mimicry to be effective, mimics and their models/co-mimics should occur together. Yet, co-occurring species that are phenotypically similar often compete for resources, successful reproduction, or both. As an adaptive response to minimize such costly interactions, interacting species may diverge phenotypically through an evolutionary process known as character displacement. Such divergence between mimics and their models/co-mimics may thereby result in imperfect mimicry. We review the various ways in which character displacement could promote imprecise mimicry, describe the conditions under which this process may be especially likely to produce imperfect mimicry, examine a possible case study, and discuss avenues for future research. Generally, character displacement may play an underappreciated role in fostering inexact mimicry [Current Zoology 58 (4): 608-619, 2012].","[Pfennig, David W.; Kikuchi, David W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Pfennig, DW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",dpfennig@unc.edu,,"Kikuchi, David/0000-0002-7379-2788",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank Karin Pfennig, the members of the Pfennig lab, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Guanacos have declined because of competition with sheep for forage, high hunting pressure and habitat degradation. Peninsula Valdes is a protected area where sheep ranching is the predominant activity. A ranch formerly dedicated to sheep production was converted into a private wildlife reserve, from which all the sheep were removed in 2005. We studied changes in guanaco abundance inside and outside the reserve after sheep removal, and also plant cover of various vegetation types. We found that guanaco abundance was higher inside than outside the reserve, and increased by three-fold within 3 years. Total plant cover and grass cover were higher inside than outside the reserve. Our results showed that guanacos reacted rapidly to changes in management, and suggest that even at a high density guanacos would not be as damaging to the vegetation as sheep. Although management changes resulted in significant changes in guanaco abundance locally, the size of a protected area influences the persistence of wild populations.

During a mixed infection, higher within-host parasite growth is favored under the assumption that it is critical to the competitive success of the parasite. As within-host parasite growth may also increase damage to the host, a positive correlation is predicted between virulence and competitive success. However, when parasites must kill their hosts in order be transmitted, parasites may spend energy on directly attacking their host, even at the cost of their within-host growth. In such systems, a negative correlation between virulence and competitive success may arise. We examined virulence and competitive ability in three sympatric species of obligately killing nematode parasites in the genus Steinernema. These nematodes exist in a mutualistic symbiosis with bacteria in the genus Xenorhabdus. Together the nematodes and their bacteria kill the insect host soon after infection, with reproduction of both species occurring mainly after host death. We found significant differences among the three nematode species in the speed of host killing. The nematode species with the lowest and highest levels of virulence were associated with the same species of Xenorhabdus, indicating that nematode traits, rather than the bacterial symbionts, may be responsible for the differences in virulence. In mixed infections, host mortality rate closely matched that associated with the more virulent species, and the more virulent species was found to be exclusively transmitted from the majority of coinfected hosts. Thus, despite the requirement of rapid host death, virulence appears to be positively correlated with competitive success in this system. These findings support a mechanistic link between parasite growth and both anti-competitor and anti-host factors.","[Bashey, Farrah; Reynolds, Courtney; Sarin, Tara; Young, Sara K.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Bashey, F (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",fbasheyv@indiana.edu,,"Bashey-Visser, Farrah/0000-0002-7992-4577; Young-Baird, Sara/0000-0002-8915-3139","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0515832, 0919015]; Indiana Univ.; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0919015] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank H.

Jaguars [TS=7.56 +/- 1.279 (se) captures per 100 trap-nights (TN)] and grey foxes (31.5 +/- 6.073 captures per 100 TN) were commonly captured by cameras, while pumas (0.66 +/- 0.200 captures per 100 TN) and ocelots (0.55 +/- 0.209 captures per 100 TN) were rare. Model selection via Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that models including habitat variables generally performed better than models including co-predator activity. Felid captures were positively associated with small bird TS and with the width or length of surrounding roads, while fox counts showed few habitat associations. Ocelot activity was positively related to jaguar captures, an effect probably explained by their shared preference for areas with more roads. Pumas were negatively related to human activity and jaguars showed a similar, though non-significant, trend, suggesting that these felids may be sensitive to human disturbance even within protected areas. Results suggest that these predators do not spatially partition habitat and that the jaguar could function as an umbrella species for smaller sympatric carnivores.","[Davis, M. L.; Kelly, M.

To address this issue, we quantified the productivity of 60 species in monocultures and mixtures of varying species richness (2, 4, 8, 16, 60) and functional group number and composition (1, 2, 3,4; legumes, grasses, small herbs, tall herbs) and tested how species properties are related to species performance in mixtures in the third year after sowing. We analysed monoculture biomass, plant biomass from separately grown plant individuals (=estimate of plant growth rates), and the monoculture resource-use characteristics canopy height and structure (leaf area index) as indicators for light acquisition, and soil nitrate concentration (=estimate of depletion of plant available nitrogen) and biomass:N ratios (=estimate of biomass produced per unit plant N) as indicators for nitrogen acquisition and use. High monoculture productivity was related to different combinations of resource-use characteristics. The biomass of a species and its proportional contribution to mixture biomass correlated positively with species relative yields, suggesting that highly productive mixture species were most important for an overyielding of mixtures. Although monoculture biomass was a significant predictor for species performance in mixtures except for grasses, a combination of monoculture biomass, plant growth rates and resource-use traits associated with nutrient and light acquisition explained non-legume species performance best. Legume performance was best associated with their monoculture biomass and traits associated with light acquisition. In spite of the fact that high species performance in mixtures was associated with a species' competitive ability as represented by monoculture productivity, growth rates and resource-use traits, our results suggest that species uniqueness in resource acquisition strategies increases the chance for niche differentiation among overyielding species.

Surprisingly little is known about the relationship between functional traits and demographic rates of tree species under field conditions, particularly for non-tropical species. 2. We studied the interspecific relationship between key functional traits (wood density (WD), maximum tree height, specific leaf area, nitrogen (N) content of leaves, leaf size and seed mass), demographic rates (relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality rate (MR)) and climatic niche for the 44 most abundant tree species in Spain. 3. Demographic data were derived from the Spanish Forest Inventory, a repeated-measures scheme including c. 90 000 permanent plots spread over a territory of c. 500 000 km 2. Functional traits data came primarily from a more detailed forest inventory carried out in Catalonia, NE Spain. 4. Our study region covers a wide range of climatic conditions and, not surprisingly, the studied species differed markedly in their climatic niche. Despite that fact, our results showed that the variability in demographic rates across species was much more related to differences in functional traits than to differences in the average climate among species. 5. Maximum tree height and, particularly, WD, emerged as key functional traits, and were the best predictors of demographic rates in our study. These two variables also mediated the marginally significant relationship between RGR and MR, suggestive of a weak trade-off between growth and survival. 6. The main aspects of our results were not altered by the explicit incorporation of phylogenetic effects, suggesting that the observed relationships are not due to divergences between a few major clades. 7. Synthesis. Our study gives support to the notion that variation in functional traits across species allows them to perform largely independently of climatic conditions along environmental gradients.","[Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Vayreda, Jordi; Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, Unitat Ecol, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Mencuccini, Maurizio] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland","Martinez-Vilalta, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, Unitat Ecol, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.",jordi.martinez.vilalta@uab.es,"Mencuccini, Maurizio/B-9052-2011; Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi/D-3385-2014; Camarero, J.

Coincident with intense anthropogenic disturbance, the abundance of the Coastal Plain Toad (Incilius nebulifer) has increased significantly in degraded habitats. Subsequently, A. fowleri is found only in forested areas near permanent water bodies that are not preferred breeding habitat of I. nebulifer. We hypothesized that larval competition with I. nebulifer, a species that breeds in extremely ephemeral habitat commonly found in disturbed areas, contributed to A. fowleri's decline. We raised tadpoles in intra- and interspecific competition in artificial ponds under simulated permanent and temporary breeding habitat conditions. Competition with I. nebulifer tadpoles, but not pond drying, resulted in a decrease in body size measures and a lower rate of survival to metamorphosis for A. fowleri tadpoles. Incilius nebulifer tadpoles were slightly larger in drying than in permanent ponds and were larger and had a higher rate of survival to metamorphosis in interspecific tanks than in intraspecific tanks, suggesting that it is easier for I. nebulifer to outcompete other species than conspecifics. The Coastal Plain Toad's superior competitive ability in temporary breeding sites may have resulted in ecological displacement and is potentially contributing to a decline of regionally sympatric populations of Fowler's Toad in degraded landscapes.","[Vogel, Laura S.; Pechmann, Joseph H.

I evaluate these assertions and amend information about this South American case study. Categorizing deer along narrow characteristics may be too restrictive to allow accurate predictions about interactions. More effective is considering the magnitude of plasticity (behavioral, phenotypic, genetic). The dichotomy of native versus exotic deer masks situations where prevailing ecological conditions are far from 'native', such as absence of predators, and such results from artificial settings have limitations. Studies used to contrast effects on vegetation from exotic red deer (Cervus elaphus) versus native huemul did not analyze native deer and provided no data to support conclusions in the review. Huemul were concluded to have high trophic overlap with red deer whose diet, however, was determined in another habitat where the food item of supposed major overlap was absent, and suggesting that red deer might cause exploitation competition was not supported by cited data. There was no mention that huemul are foremost exposed to livestock rather than exotic deer. Concluding that exotic prey including red deer increase predator density resulting in increased predation of huemul (apparent competition), was not supported by cited studies. To the contrary, high-density puma (Puma concolor) could not prevent guanaco (Lama guanicoe) from increasing > 13-fold, nor that huemul expanded into these sites. Not only were those studies opposite to conclusions in the review, but none had studied huemul nor predator population trends. Data from little known species like huemul should be used with reservations when aiming at generalizations.","[Flueck, Werner T.] Univ Atlantida Argentina, Inst Nat Resources Anal, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Flueck, Werner T.] Natl Council Sci Res, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Flueck, Werner T.] Univ Basel, Swiss Trop Inst, Basel, Switzerland","Flueck, WT (corresponding author), Univ Atlantida Argentina, Inst Nat Resources Anal, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",wtf@deerlab.org,"Andrei, Graciela/V-7721-2017; Snoeck, Robert/V-3867-2017","Andrei, Graciela/0000-0003-2609-4896; Snoeck, Robert/0000-0002-7586-5434","El Retorno; Bariloche; Cyon GmbH, Switzerland","I thank Andrea Taylor, Associate Editor for Wildlife Research, for constructive criticism during four revisions involving five additional anonymous reviewers, which substantially improved the paper, although in the end it was declined.

Although populations harbour considerable diversity, most ecological studies still assume they are homogeneous. However, mounting evidence suggests that intraspecific diversity is not only common, but also important for interactions with community members. Here, intraspecific variation in Daphnia dentifera in haemoglobin content is shown to be a marker of hypolimnion use. 2. Hypolimnion use differed substantially within and among D. dentifera populations. Daphnia dentifera with haemoglobin resided primarily in the hypolimnion, while D. dentifera lacking haemoglobin migrated vertically. These 'deep' and 'migratory' D. dentifera had different seasonal phenologies and dynamics. 3. Deep and migratory D. dentifera had qualitatively different relationships with an important competitor, Daphnia pulicaria. Deep D. dentifera density was negatively correlated with D. pulicaria density, whereas migratory density was not correlated with D. pulicaria density. 4. Given that D. pulicaria tends to reside in the hypolimnion, this negative correlation probably reflects competition between D. pulicaria and the deep D. dentifera. This pattern would have been missed if only the relationship between the overall lake populations of D. dentifera and D. pulicaria had been studied. 5. Abundances of deep D. dentifera and D. pulicaria were both correlated with the size of the hypolimnetic refuge from fish predation, but in opposite directions. Lakes with large refuges generally had high D. pulicaria and low deep D. dentifera densities.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Duffy, MA (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",duffy@gatech.edu,"Duffy, Meghan A/E-6867-2016; Duffy, Meghan A/A-9376-2008","Duffy, Meghan A/0000-0002-8142-0802; ","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0235119, DEB-0827396]; George Lauff Research Award; Georgia Institute of Technology","This study would not have been possible without assistance in the field and laboratory from Bob Duffy, Spencer Hall and Pam Woodruff.

For exotic axis deer (Axis axis) and native white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to coexist one species should be superior at interference competition and the other species should be superior at exploitative competition. We generated and tested predictions, based on body size and diet breadth, about habitat selection by white-tailed deer in the presence and absence of axis deer, dominance relationships, and time at sites provisioned with high quality forage. We conducted our study in treatment (axis and white-tailed deer) and control (white-tailed deer only) areas when both species were present and after axis deer were removed. We conducted vehicle surveys to determine habitat use of both species. At provisioned feeding sites we recorded aggressive behaviors and amount of time species spent at feeding sites alone and together. In the treatment area white-tailed deer selection for wooded habitat increased 2.1 times after axis deer were removed, whereas habitat selection by white-tailed deer was constant in the control area over the same time. At feeding sites axis deer were dominant to white-tailed deer; both species spent a significantly greater amount of time alone than at feeders together, but amount of time that individuals of each species spent at feeders did not differ. Axis deer were superior at interference competition, but white-tailed deer were not superior at exploitative competition; thus, species coexistence is unlikely. Whether white-tailed deer are negatively impacted by axis deer at spatial scales larger than our experiment probably depends on abundance of axis deer at larger spatial scales. Experiments of species interactions with temporal and spatial controls that consider types of competitive interactions increase a manager's understanding of when and how native ungulates may be negatively impacted by exotic ungulates.","[Faas, Clinton J.; Weckerly, Floyd W.] SW Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA","Faas, CJ (corresponding author), SW Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",fw11@txstate.edu,,,Dallas Safari Club; Houston Safari Club,"We are grateful to C.

The present study provides direct evidence indicating that the oviposition behaviour of the two main mango fruit fly species, Ceratitis cosyra (Walker) and Bactrocera invadens Drew-Tsurata & White, is affected by secretions of the dominant arboreal ant Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille). When offered ant-exposed and unexposed mangoes in the absence of the ants, both fly species are reluctant to land on ant-exposed fruits and, when having landed, often take off quickly and fail to oviposit. The number of puparia collected from unexposed mangoes is approximately eight-fold higher than from ant-exposed ones. The results obtained from laboratory experiments and field observations confirm that adult fruit flies are more affected through repellence by ant cues than by direct predation. The use of cues by fruit flies in predator avoidance has implications for evolutionary ecology, behavioural ecology and chemical ecology.","[Van Mele, Paul] Africa Rice Ctr WARDA, Cotonou, Benin; [Vayssieres, Jean-Francois] UR HortSys, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Vayssieres, Jean-Francois; Adandonon, Appolinaire; Sinzogan, Antonio] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin","Van Mele, P (corresponding author), Africa Rice Ctr WARDA, 01 BP 2031, Cotonou, Benin.",p.vanmele@cgiar.org,,,"Conservation, Food and Health Foundation","We thank Mr Delou for his technical assistance and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are the most abundant large carnivores in many African ecosystems. We describe demographic patterns in a population of spotted hyenas observed continuously for 15.5 years, and assess the effects of per capita prey availability, interspecific competition, rainfall, anthropogenic disturbance, and disease on 2 key determinants of population dynamics: reproduction and survival. Annual reproduction., survival Of juveniles (i.e., recruitment to adulthood), and mortality of adults varied among years of the study. Per capita prey availability and group size both had positive effects on reproduction, whereas interspecific competition with lions had a negative effect. Competition with lions and rainfall both had negative effects on survival Of juveniles. We suggest that the negative effect of rainfall on survival may be mediated by increased rates of human-carnivore conflict during periods of heavy rain, although human population size did not influence survival or reproduction directly. Disease had no substantial effect on this hyena population, despite occurrence of at least 2 disease Outbreaks among sympatric carnivores during the study. By focusing on demographic processes that determine population growth (i.e., survival and reproduction), this study highlights the importance of both top-down and bottom-up forces acting on populations of large carnivores. These findings also add to a growing literature suggesting that interspecific competition may be more important than previously recognized in the dynamics Of Populations of large carnivores.","[Watts, Heather E.; Holekamp, Kay E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Watts, HE (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, 203 Nat Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",hewatts@ucdavis.edu,"Holekamp, Kay E/G-6054-2010","Watts, Heather/0000-0002-9888-825X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN0113170, IBN0343381, IOB0618022]; Michigan State University","We thank the Office of the President of Kenya for permission to conduct this research, and Kenya Wildlife Service, Narok County Council, and the Senior Warden of the Masai Mara National Reserve for assistance.

However, rarely has propagule size been experimentally manipulated to examine changes in invader behaviour, and propagule longevity and success. We manipulated propagule size of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile in laboratory and field studies. Laboratory experiments involved L. humile propagules containing two queens and 10, 100, 200 or 1000 workers. Propagules were introduced into arenas containing colonies of queens and 200 workers of the competing native ant Monomorium antarcticum. The effects of food availability were investigated via treatments of only one central resource, or 10 separated resources. Field studies used similar colony sizes of L. humile, which were introduced into novel environments near an invasion front. In laboratory studies, small propagules of L. humile were quickly annihilated. Only the larger propagule size survived and killed the native ant colony in some replicates. Aggression was largely independent of food availability, but the behaviour of L. humile changed substantially with propagule size. In larger propagules, aggressive behaviour was significantly more frequent, while L. humile were much more likely to avoid conflict in smaller propagules. In field studies, however, propagule size did not influence colony persistence. Linepithema humile colonies persisted for up to 2 months, even in small propagules of 10 workers. Factors such as temperature or competitor abundance had no effect, although some colonies were decimated by M. antarcticum. Synthesis and applications. Although propagule size has been correlated with invasion success in a wide variety of taxa, our results indicate that it will have limited predictive power with species displaying behavioural plasticity. We recommend that aspects of animal behaviour be given much more consideration in attempts to model invasion success. Secondly, areas of high biodiversity are thought to offer biotic resistance to invasion via the abundance of predators and competitors. Invasive pests such as L. humile appear to modify their behaviour according to local conditions, and establishment was not related to resource availability. We cannot necessarily rely on high levels of native biodiversity to repel invasions.","[Sagata, Katayo; Lester, Philip J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand","Lester, PJ (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",phil.lester@vuw.ac.nz,"Lester, Phil/A-1296-2008","Lester, Phil/0000-0002-1801-5687",NZ Aid Scholarship,"We thank Carrone Conroy, Alex Dixson, Catherine Duthie and Megan Sarty for assistance, and John Haywood for statistical advice.

The paper describes such phenomenon in a Formica rufa L. colony brought into conflict with a R cinerea Mayr colony when the former tried to extend its own territory at the expense of the latter. A territorially stable E rufa colony, neighbouring the same E cinerea colony, served as control. Workers of the expansive F. rufa colony were repeatedly observed to carry numerous ant corpses, empty pupal cocoons and insect leftovers from their nest to the place of confrontation with E cinerea, on a much bigger scale than workers of the stable E rufa colony. Corpse-carrying intensity was not correlated with the general activity level of foragers which suggests that corpse carriers could be a separate task group. Workers of a small colony of F. cinerea were also observed to surround their nest entrance with corpses of their nestmates and prey remains, taken out from inside the nest, in response to intensified traffic of workers of E rufa in the vicinity of their nest. These results are discussed in the context of a possible interrelation between ant aggressive behaviour and transport behaviour. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain the observed phenomenon: (1) explaining it as a by-product of the aggressive arousal of workers, and (2) ascribing to it a possible signalling function in conflict situations.","[Czechowski, Wojciech] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Marko, Balint] Univ Babes Bolyai, Dept Taxon & Ecol, Cluj Napoca 400006, Romania; [Godzinska, Ewa Joanna] Polish Acad Sci, M Nencki Inst Expt Biol, Dept Neurophysiol, Ethol Lab, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland","Czechowski, W (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",wcz@miiz.waw.pl; mbalint@biolog.ubbcluj.ro; e.godzinska@nencki.gov.pl,"Godzinska, Ewa/B-2622-2012; Marko, Balint/C-3081-2011","Godzinska, Ewa Joanna/0000-0001-6993-2082; Marko, Balint/0000-0001-6039-8231; Czechowski, Wojciech/0000-0001-9422-2453",EU FP 6European Commission [PL-TAF-3066]; Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw [407];  [31/1342];  [ID-552 PNII],"The field observations were made during WCz.'s stay at the Tvarminne Zoological Station, University of Helsinki, within the programme of scientific co-operation between the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Finland.

Each of these myrmecophiles has adapted in a highly specific way to the lifestyle of its host. We studied this diverse myrmecophile fauna of L. distinguenda as a new model for multispecies parasitism to gain a better understanding of fundamental coevolutionary processes. Our study focused on behavioural and on chemical integration and exploitation strategies of the different symbiont species. In addition, we examined potential counterstrategies of the host ant. Myrmecophiles were studied both in large free-living L. distinguenda colonies and in more detail in parts of colonies separated for observation. We found that at least five myrmecophile species imposed cost on their host by exploiting its resources. Their impact varied considerably depending on both the type of resources exploited and their abundance. Myrmecophile species were well integrated into host societies either by chemical mimicry of host cuticular hydrocarbons or by remaining chemically insignificant, lacking most characteristic recognition cues. Despite these chemical integration strategies, host ants were able to recognize and kill the alien intruders to various degrees. This important finding demonstrates that symbiont populations are actively counter-regulated by the host. By constructing a host-parasite interaction network, we finally suggest that host defences can maintain myrmecophile diversity by keeping parasite populations small. This reduces interguild competition, comparable to top-down effects of predators on lower trophic levels in ecological food webs. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We examine the potential for similar interactions among Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and two of its cavity kleptoparasites: southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) and Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus). We hypothesized that flying squirrels have a positive indirect effect on Red-cockaded Woodpeckers by suppressing Red-bellied Woodpeckers. We monitored occupancy of Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavities on 16 territories for one year, and then regularly removed flying squirrels from Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavities for one year on eight territories, each paired with a control. We predicted that flying squirrel removal would competitively release Red-bellied Woodpeckers, which in turn would preempt a positive occupancy response by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers. During the removal phase, flying squirrel occupancy decreased 53% on the removal territories relative to controls (0.46 vs. 0.96 cavities occupied per territory), while Red-bellied Woodpecker occupancy increased 46% (1.00 vs. 0.69 cavities per territory). Red-bellied Woodpecker occupancy increased 103% on the removals from July to December of the removal phase, when most Red-cockaded Woodpecker fledglings, potential helpers, and dispersers acquire cavities. Red-cockaded Woodpeckers failed to respond positively to the removals, apparently because Red-bellied Woodpeckers rapidly occupied the evacuated cavities. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that flying squirrels indirectly benefit Red-cockaded Woodpeckers by suppressing Red-bellied Woodpeckers. This indirect effect approximately counterbalanced the direct negative effect of flying squirrels on Red-cockaded Woodpeckers.","[Kappes, John J., Jr.; Davis, John M.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Kappes, JJ (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",kappes@vt.edu,,,Florida Army National Guard; Camp Blanding Training Site; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Clemson Field OfficeUS Fish & Wildlife Service,"D.

While in mobile species the outcome of interference at a local scale can usually be determined from differences in body size and behavior, the population-level consequences of such interactions vary depending on rates of settlement and recruitment at a site, which are not directly correlated to local reproductive success. Previous experimental studies in central Chile demonstrated that interference competition for refuges is the primary factor driving microhabitat segregation between the predatory crabs Acanthocyclus gayi and Acanthocyclus hassleri, with the latter species monopolizing galleries inside mussel beds and excluding A. gayi to rock crevices. Between April 2001 and March 2006 we quantified monthly recruitment rates in artificial collectors at 17 sites over 900 km of the central coast of Chile. Results show that recruitment rates of A. hassleri are almost two orders of magnitude lower than those of A. gayi, and that they are tightly and positively correlated among sites across the region, suggesting that at scales of kilometers larval stages of these species are affected by similar oceanographic processes. Total crab densities per site were also positively correlated between species and strongly associated to mussel cover, with overall low crab densities at all sites where mussel cover was lower than about 60%. At all sites with mussel cover > 60%, the ratio of A. gayi to A. hassleri density progressively decreased from recruits (2.6) to juveniles (0.5) to adults (0.04), overcoming initial differences in recruitment rates. The relative success of the inferior competitor at sites with low mussel cover does not appear to provide a potential mechanism favoring regional coexistence through dispersal to other sites (mass effects), because their densities were lower than at sites of high mussel cover. Yet, at many sites of low mussel cover the dominant competitor is virtually absent, allowing A. gayi to attain larger population sizes at the scale of the region. Thus, the factors limiting the dominant competitor from successfully utilizing other microhabitats seem to be the most critical factor in promoting both local and regional coexistence between these species.","[Navarrete, Sergio A.; Parrague, Mirtala; Wieters, Evie A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile; [Navarrete, Sergio A.; Parrague, Mirtala; Wieters, Evie A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile","Navarrete, SA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",snavarrete@bio.puc.cl,"Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013","Parrague, Mirtala/0000-0002-7899-3263",,,,54,10,10,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

As crosses between two distinct genotypes, hybrids might express fitness characteristics similar to either parent species, or they might produce unique phenotypic attributes that make them more or less than either parent species. We identified a potential hybrid zone among soft corals in a backreef community on Guam, where the broadcast- spawning species Sinularia maxima and S. polydactyla co- occur. Morphological and chemical traits con. rmed the intermediate and unique status of the putative hybrid. Laboratory cross- fertilization experiments using S. maxima and S. polydactyla gametes demonstrated that barriers to hybridization are absent and that the laboratory- reared hybrids developed specific characteristics identified in adult hybrid field populations. Changes in the populations of each parent species and the hybrid were monitored over a decade. While populations of the parent species declined significantly, the hybrid population doubled in percent cover over this period. We assessed responses to abiotic ( sedimentation) and biotic ( competition and predation) factors to determine whether the two parent species or the hybrids exhibited greater. tness. While sedimentation alone could not explain the decline in field populations of the parent species, sediment effects exact a significant cost to these soft corals over narrow spatial scales. Competition between the parent and hybrid soft corals explains some of the changes in the distribution and abundance of these species through time. The extracts of S. polydactyla had no effect against congeners, whereas those of S. maxima and the hybrid caused significant tissue necrosis. Field predation was significantly lower on the hybrid than on either parent species. Laboratory feeding assays demonstrated that the extracts of the hybrid were signi. cantly more deterrent than either S. maxima or S. polydactyla. Comparisons of the bioactive metabolites from the parent species, a hybrid compound, and a semi- purified mixture indicated that the hybrid is more deterrent than either of the parent species.

In many systems this separation is experimentally impossible without interfering with the natural behavior of the animals. Consequently, these studies can only demonstrate the combined effect of interference and exploitation on the forager's feeding rate, namely, it usually decreases in a decelerating rate as a function of density. We suggest here a simple experimental and statistical procedure that facilitates the separation of the effects of interference from those of exploitation. This procedure includes manipulation of both predator density and the foraging experiment duration. The statistical analysis is based on multiple linear regression. The working assumption is that exploitation can be neglected at the beginning of the foraging experiment because, initially, predators do not experience diminishing returns in prey capture rates. Using both the results of an individual-based simulation and a field experiment dataset of gerbils foraging for seeds in an artificial food patch located in the field, we demonstrate that our procedure can successfully detect and separate the effect of interference from the combined overall effect of competition (i.e., interference plus exploitation).","[Scharf, Inon; Filin, Ido; Ovadia, Ofer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Scharf, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",schari@bgu.ac.il; filin@bgu.ac.il; oferovad@bgu.ac.il,"Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012; Scharf, Inon/AAF-2343-2020","Scharf, Inon/0000-0002-8506-7161; Filin, Ido/0000-0001-6231-0029; Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,27,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",1438-3896,,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

Therefore, one might expect the relative importance of competition vs. facilitation to vary seasonally in ecosystems characterized by pronounced dry (abiotically stressful) and wet (benign) seasons. Herbivory also varies seasonally and can affect the net outcome of plant-plant interactions, but the interactive effects of seasonality and herbivory on the competition-facilitation balance are not known. I experimentally manipulated neighboring plants and herbivory during wet and dry periods for two species of grass: Cynodon plectostachyus and Pennisetum stramineum, in the semiarid Laikipia District of Kenya. These experiments indicate that Pennisetum was competitively dominant during the wet season and that it responded negatively to grazing, especially during the dry season. Cynodon showed more complex season- and herbivore-dependent responses. Cynodon experienced facilitation that was simultaneously dependent on presence of herbivores and on dry season. During the wet season Cynodon experienced net competition. These results illustrate how herbivory and seasonality can interact in complex ways to shift species-species competition-facilitation balance. Additionally, because Cynodon and Pennisetum are key players in a local successional process, these results indicate that herbivory can affect the direction and pace of succession.","[Veblen, Kari E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Veblen, Kari E.] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Veblen, KE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",keveblen@ucdavis.edu,"Veblen, Kari E./D-1439-2012","Veblen, Kari E./0000-0001-7523-3368",,,,77,58,59,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2008,89,6,,,,,1532,1540,,10.1890/07-0973.1,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,310OZ,WOS:000256540300007,18589518,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

However, trophic-level interactions, such as mesocarnivore release resulting from intraguild predation, may also be important mediators of cascades. From September 2001 to August 2004, we used spatial and seasonal heterogeneity in wolf distribution and abundance in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to evaluate whether mesopredator release of coyotes ( Canis latrans), resulting from the extirpation of wolves ( Canis lupus), accounts for high rates of coyote predation on pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana) fawns observed in some areas. Results of this ecological perturbation in wolf densities, coyote densities, and pronghorn neonatal survival at wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites support the existence of a species-level trophic cascade. That wolves precipitated a trophic cascade was evidenced by fawn survival rates that were four-fold higher at sites used by wolves. A negative correlation between coyote and wolf densities supports the hypothesis that interspecific interactions between the two species facilitated the difference in fawn survival. Whereas densities of resident coyotes were similar between wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites, the abundance of transient coyotes was significantly lower in areas used by wolves. Thus, differential effects of wolves on solitary coyotes may be an important mechanism by which wolves limit coyote densities. Our results support the hypothesis that mesopredator release of coyotes contributes to high rates of coyote predation on pronghorn fawns, and demonstrate the importance of alternative food web pathways in structuring the dynamics of terrestrial systems.","[Berger, Kim Murray] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildlife Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Berger, Kim Murray; Berger, Joel] Univ Montana, No Rockies Field Off, Wildlife Conservat Society, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Gese, Eric M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildlife Resources, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, USDA,Wildlife Serv, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Berger, KM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, No Rockies Field Off, Wildlife Conservat Society, 205 Nat Sci Bldg, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",kberger@wcs.org,"Gese, Eric M/B-4578-2011",,,,,70,122,125,7,228,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2008,89,3,,,,,818,828,,10.1890/07-0193.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,284AS,WOS:000254678200022,18459344,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

We conducted a field removal experiment to investigate potential interactions among salamanders across the steam-woodland ecotone and to determine the effects of such interactions on community structure. We used removals of a terrestrial salamander, Plethodon cinereus, and/or several species of semi-aquatic salamanders of the genus Desmognathus to investigate potential interactions between these genera and the semi-aquatic salamander Eurycea cirrigera. Although removals did not significantly decrease numbers of P. cinereus or Desmognathus on plots, distribution of E. cirrigera shifted unexpectedly closer to streams in response to removals of P. cinereus. Eurycea cirrigera may have been responding to demographic shifts of P. cinereus, as average snout-vent length and mass of P. cinereus decreased significanfly on removal plots.

Filter-feeding zooplankters, such as Daphnia, cope with resources fluctuations by adjusting their life-history as a function of balances in the energy allocation rules. Additionally, Daphnia populations often withstand interspecific competition within coexisting related species, and it is generally assumed that body size is a strategic trait conditioning exploitative ability and the related competitive advantage of species. The life-history responses of one Daphnia magna population and three Populations of Daphnia cf longispina to a discrete gradient of algae concentration were assessed. This experiment was focused on (i) how these distinct Populations regulate life-history when feeding over low, intermediate and high food-levels; and on (ii) whether the large-bodied D. magna can be better in exploiting resources over the gradient than can the smaller D. cf longispina populations. We found evidences that body size might not be the single trait influencing the exploitative ability of related species. The D. cf longispina populations were often better than D. magna in exploiting different levels of resources, and remarkable differences in fitness were found between these similar-sized individuals within food-level; indeed, these differences were frequently of higher scale than those found between the larger D. magna and any of the D. cf longispina populations.","[Pereira, J.

Additionally, we established single species systems of root-vole and field-vole populations in the winter of 2004. Home-range size was smaller and activity lower in field voles than in root voles, and food supplementation caused an increase in activity in both species. Activity and home-range size in either species was not affected by the presence of the other. Despite the different activity patterns of the two species, home range overlap between field voles and root voles did not differ from random in the food-supplemented plots. In the non-supplemented plots daily overlap was higher than expected. As predicted, we were not able to detect any interference competition between field and root voles during winter.

While these resource dynamics have been well documented, little is known about how this temporal heterogeneity influences competitive interactions. We examined the impacts of the temporal pattern of N supply on competitive intensity and ability in an N-limited desert shrub community. At our field site, the three codominant shrubs, Atriplex confertifolia, A. parryi, and Sarcobatus vermiculatus, differ in seasonal growth patterns, with A. confertifolia and S. vermiculatus achieving higher growth rates earlier in the growing season than A. parryi. We predicted that these timing differences in maximum growth rate may interact with temporal variation in N supply to alter competitive abilities over time. Seedlings of the two Atriplex species were planted either individually in field plots or as target plants surrounded by neighbor seedlings. After one year of establishment, the same amount of 15 N was applied to plots either as early spring pulses, mid spring pulses or continuously through the second growing season. Competitive effects were observed under continuous and pulsed N supply. Averaged across all target-neighbor treatments, competitive intensity was similar to 1.8-fold greater when N was pulsed compared to when N was supplied continuously, but overall, the outcome of competitive interactions was not influenced by N pulse timing. While the timing of resource supply did not differentially influence the competitive abilities of coexisting species in this system, the temporal pattern of resource supply did alter the intensity of competitive interactions among species. While additional studies in other systems are needed to evaluate the generality of these results, this study suggests that competitive intensity may not necessarily be a direct function of productivity or resource availability as traditionally assumed. Instead, the intensity of competitive interactions in resource-poor systems may depend upon the temporal pattern of resource supply.","USDA ARS, Eastern Oregon Agr Res Ctr, Burns, OR 97720 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA","James, JJ (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Eastern Oregon Agr Res Ctr, 67826 A Hwy 205, Burns, OR 97720 USA.",jeremy.james@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,37,19,20,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2007,152,4,,,,,721,727,,10.1007/s00442-007-0685-3,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,192TO,WOS:000248226100014,17351793,,,,2021-09-21,

We found no difference in availability of nesting habitat or food abundance in territories in which nests were and were not reused. We also found no support for the hypotheses that kingbirds benefited from nest reuse by breeding earlier, laying larger clutches, or fledging more young, and, contrary to expectations, females that reused nests laid significantly smaller eggs than females who built their own nests. Nest reuse was independent of age: a roughly equal number of females for which we had multiple years of data both reused nests and built new nests, but at different points in their lives. Competition for nest sites seems high at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge because many open-cup nesting species utilize similar nest sites in the limited zone of riparian vegetation.

The damselfishes Dascyllus aruanus and D. melanurus provide a useful test of this prediction because they exhibit largely allopatric geographic ranges that overlap near Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. To test whether this species pair exhibited responses in resource use that were consistent with competition theory, the depth distributions, coral substrata and diet of each species at allopatric and sympatric locations were compared. Where sympatric, the frequency of co-occurrence was examined and foraging ranges and diet on corals where the species do and do not co-occur were compared. Contrary to expectations, the species were more similar in depth, habitat use and diet in the sympatric region. Within this location, they sometimes co-existed in the same coral shelters, but much less often than would be expected with random assortment. Where they did co-exist, their diets converged. D. melanurus exhibited restricted foraging ranges and consumed smaller prey in the presence of D. aruanus, but not vice versa.

This study addresses the potential roles of habitat productivity and large herbivore grazing intensities on large-small herbivore foraging interactions. We examined effects of different intensity simulated grazing treatments on forage abundance and quality for Utah prairie dogs (Cynomys parvidens) in a low productivity ecosystem, and consequent effects on prairie dog individual growth rates, foraging preferences, and activity budgets. We hypothesized that simulated grazing would have predominantly facilitative impacts on Utah prairie dogs, as was found for black-tailed prairie dogs in higher productivity ecosystems. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of simulated grazing on forage nitrogen, digestibility, and biomass. Simulated grazing increased average forage nitrogen and digestibility while decreasing forage biomass. These effects were associated with reduced individual growth rates, increased juvenile foraging time, and reduced juvenile vigilance. Results suggest that the negative effects of reduced vegetation biomass greatly outweighed positive treatment effects in this study. However, prairie dogs in the moderate intensity defoliation treatment showed some preference for grazed plots over ungrazed plots, and this preference increased with time. Our study lends support to the idea that habitat productivity and herbivore densities may mediate shifts between facilitative and competitive interactions between different-sized herbivores.","Utah State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Cheng, E (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",Ellen.Cheng@umontana.edu,,,,,,49,17,18,0,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2006,147,3,,,,,546,555,,10.1007/s00442-005-0286-y,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,017PT,WOS:000235706200017,16328551,,,,2021-09-21,

Its colonies defend their whole foraging areas (territories) against other territorial ants, including F. sanguinea Latr., a common facultative slave-maker. The most frequent 'victim' of F. sanguinea is F. fusca L., a ubiquitous submissive ant species. On the basis of some earlier observations, the presumption was made that F. polyetena, when defending its own territories, would indirectly protect F. fusca, colonies, which nest within these territories, from F. sanguinea raids. It was expected that F. fusca should be more abundant in F. polyetena territories, than in F. sanguinea territories, while other subordinate ants, which are not potential slaves of F. sanguinea, should not show such difference. This hypothesis was supported by the results of the baiting experiments carried out in the Bialowieza Forest, NE Poland.

This spatial sorting is thought to be the result of niche pre-emption, where the first species to occupy a given habitat would exclude its relatives through competition. The evidence that competition shapes local species distributions is scant. I propose that hybridization thwarts the invasion of congeners. We know that crossing barriers between products of recent adaptive radiations typically are weak. Colonization of occupied patches would be sporadic, because invaders would be moving from habitats where they are adapted to those where they are not. Nearly all progeny of the scant invaders would be ill-adapted hybrids, because the pollen pool would consist almost exclusively of indigenous pollen. Only if aliens were predominantly inbreeders or apomicts would they have a chance of escaping the deluge of local pollen and becoming established in the occupied patch. The spatial reach of hybridization is much greater than that of competition.","Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78713 USA","Levin, DA (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78713 USA.",dlevin@uts.ccutexas.edu,,,,,,68,17,17,1,22,AMER SOC PLANT TAXONOMISTS,LARAMIE,"UNIV WYOMING, DEPT BOTANY 3165, 1000 E UNIVERSITY AVE, LARAMIE, WY 82071 USA",0363-6445,1548-2324,,SYST BOT,Syst.

The experiment was conducted in 16 different communities from two geographically distant areas (western Estonia and northern Norway). The results were compared with the results of previous experiments with Anthoxanthum odoratum from the same areas. Removal of neighbors had a positive effect on the biomass of both Solidago and Anthoxanthum, and this response was stronger in communities with higher productivity. Thus, the corrected index of relative competition intensity, CRCI, increased with increasing community productivity. Species richness was negatively correlated with CRCI in Estonia but not in Norway and not in the case of the pooled material. The results suggest that competitive exclusion operates at least in these communities which species pool is large. Our results indicate that the relationship between competition intensity and productivity is non-linear. In our data, competition prevails in communities where living plant biomass exceeds 200 g m(-2), whereas in less productive communities, competition remains undetected and direct plant-plant relationships might at times be even mutualistic. Moreover, we found that the relationship between competition intensity and productivity is strongly dependent on regional differences and is intimately connected to a concordant variation in the intensity of grazing. The least productive communities both in Estonia and in Norway are characterized by intensive grazing, which reduces importance of competition. Hence, the contrasting results corroborates the predictions of the hypothesis of exploitation ecosystems, predicting that trophic dynamics account for the relationship between competition intensity and primary productivity.","Estonian Agr Univ, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia","Sammul, M (corresponding author), Estonian Agr Univ, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Riia 181, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",lauoks@utu.fi,,,,,,93,27,27,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2006,112,1,,,,,138,148,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.13378.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,003HG,WOS:000234671800015,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Belowground interactions are still not very clear in this perennial-herbaceous association. This work was aimed at characterizing the development of the root systems of associated crops and the soil water dynamics. It also investigated whether water competition could be the cause of vine vigour and yield reductions. Experiments were conducted in a 4-year-old association (vine - tall fescue) and in a weed controlled vineyard. Water transfers in the soil were estimated on the basis of the soil water potential and soil hydrodynamic properties. The vine root system was concentrated in the soil under the row, whereas the intercrop highly colonized a soil compartment under the inter-row to a depth of approximately 1 m. Despite this spatial complementarity in root distribution, intercropping reduced the amount of soil water available for the vine crop. The low soil water content reduced soil water conductivity thereby limiting water transfers, despite a significant gradient in the soil water potential. This conductivity did not differ significantly between treatments but the intercrop enhanced the infiltration of winter rainwater, probably by limiting surface runoff. There was temporal complementarity in this association since the period of intense water uptake by the intercrop occurred earlier than noted for the vine under bare soil conditions. Nevertheless, the competition for water was limited by better refilling of the soil water profile during winter in the intercropped treatment. The intercrop clearly interacted with the vine and decreased its vegetative vigor. Since predawn leaf water potential and stomatal conductance did not differ among treatments, mechanism(s) other than competition for water (e.g. nutrient competition, allelopathy) may be responsible.","INRA, CIRAD, UMR Syst Fonctionnement & Conduite Syst Culture T, F-34398 Montpellier, France; ITV France, F-30230 Rodilhan, France","Celette, F (corresponding author), INRA, CIRAD, UMR Syst Fonctionnement & Conduite Syst Culture T, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",celette@cirad.fr,"CELETTE, Florian/G-4680-2018",,,,,60,80,86,4,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2005,276,1-2,,,,,205,217,,10.1007/s11104-005-4415-5,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,988VS,WOS:000233629900019,,,,,2021-09-21,

Based on identification of insects in stored-maize samples from 13 weekly sampling events, four topics were addressed: (i) the seasonal fluctuation in the insect community; (ii) ordination analysis was conducted to examine the association among insect taxa and to determine their distribution along abiotic and geographic gradients; (iii) the demographic characteristics of insect communities in maize samples with high abundance of either Plodia interpunctella (Plodia samples) or Sitophilus zeamais (Sitophilus samples); and (iv) to what extent natural enemies were spatially associated with their prey species. We identified a total of 18 different taxa, composed of adults and larvae of 14 determined species, and others identified to genus, family or order. Insect density was significantly higher in top samples compared to bottom samples, and the insect taxa occurred more frequently in top samples compared to bottom samples. In the ordination analysis, the three explanatory variables accounting for eastern, northern and vertical position of maize samples explained the largest part of the total variance. There was a gradual time trend with some of the insect species mainly occurring early or late in the monitoring period. Moisture content of the maize was the weakest of the significant explanatory variables, while temperature in the grain mass did not explain a significant part of the total variance. Plodia samples and Sitophilus samples had significantly different spatial distribution patterns and had markedly different insect species composition. Plodia samples were characterized by low abundance of all granivores and fungivores, except P. interpunctella. Conversely, Sitophilus samples had high abundance of T. castaneum, A. advena, and C. ferrugineus. Consequently, Sitophilus samples seemed to comprise more diverse insect communities than Plodia samples. Natural enemies were not significantly associated with their most common hosts. In a highly homogeneous habitat (stored maize), we demonstrated that stored-product insect species had significantly different distribution patterns mainly along geographic gradients. Stochasticity of the initial infestation process or interspecific competition are two of the possible explanations for the spatial segregation of stored-product insects, and the spatial segregation of insects on the same trophic level may have profound implications for the understanding of how these ecosystems develop over time and thereby how integrated pest management strategies are implemented to control insect pest populations.","Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Bot, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Nansen, C (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",cnansen@montana.edu,"Palmer, Michael W/A-2519-2008",,,,,40,15,15,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

We found 12 traits or trait groups that have been suggested as predictors of species sensitivity: population size; population fluctuation and storage effect; dispersal power; reproductive potential; annual survival; sociality; body size; trophic position; ecological specialisation, microhabitat and matrix use; disturbance and competition sensitive traits; rarity; and biogeographic position. For each trait we discuss the theoretical justification for its sensitivity to fragmentation and empirical evidence for and against the suitability of the trait as a predictor of fragmentation sensitivity. Where relevant, we also discuss experimental design problems for testing the underlying hypotheses. There is good empirical support for 6 of the 12 traits as sensitivity predictors: population size; population fluctuation and storage effects; traits associated with competitive ability and disturbance sensitivity in plants; microhabitat specialisation and matrix use; rarity in the form of low abundance within a habitat; and relative biogeographic position. Few clear patterns emerge for the remaining traits from empirical studies if examined in isolation. Consequently, interactions of species traits and environmental conditions must be considered if we want to be able to predict species sensitivity to fragmentation.

I studied prey type and predator size-prey size relationships of these snakes in four swamp-forest areas of southeastern Nigeria (West Africa): only N. fuliginoides was found in two of these areas, whereas both species were common in the other two areas. The feeding ecology of N. fuliginoides shifted greatly in the presence of its potential competitor, N. variegata, in terms of prey-type preferences and predatory behaviour as well as in terms of predator size-prey size relationships. In particular, the effects of the potential competitor on the feeding ecology of N. fuliginoides were (i) a shift toward eating many invertebrates from a diet based on many small vertebrates, (ii) a shift toward eating many terrestrial organisms from a diet based on many aquatic organisms, and (iii) a shift in mean prey size for females toward relatively larger prey from a diet based on smaller prey. The resulting effect was a clear partitioning of food resources between the two predator species in both the areas where they are sympatric, whereas N. fuliginoides had a wider dietary spectrum (covering that of the two species together) in the areas where its competitor is not found. The role of intraspecific competition seems less strong, as no apparent resource partitioning in prey type or prey size was observed between males and females of either species or in any study area. However, mean prey size was significantly greater for females than for males of both species and in all study areas, but depended on the significant reverse sexual size dimorphism observed in both species.","Italian Fdn Vertebrate Zool Ecol, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Inst Environm Studies Demetra, I-00139 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Italian Fdn Vertebrate Zool Ecol, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,39,29,30,0,7,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

We took a census on an hourly basis from dawn until dusk once a month for a year (July 1998-June 1999). Previous studies have focused largely on the RIFA's escape from natural enemies (e.g., phorid parasitoids) as an explanation for the ant's competitive success. Here, we show that the RIFA has additional advantages over its native congener. We found the RIFA had a significantly greater association than the TFA with extremes in ambient temperature, relative humidity, and light levels. However, M. minimum was found at temperatures that were significantly higher than for the RIFA. Native TFA-specific phorids had activity patterns that were similar to their host's. In addition, we documented the expansion of RIFA foraging territory in relationship to that of the TFA. This occurred throughout the year, so expansion was due to actual competitive takeover by mature RIFA colonies, rather than by establishment of new colonies.

Introduced species are, world-wide, one of the most serious threats to biodiversity. Grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis are one of many introduced species to have threatened a native congener; they are thought to have replaced red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris throughout much of the UK as a result of competition. The rate of competitive replacement may be influenced by habitat composition, with some red squirrel populations persisting for prolonged periods in the presence of greys in predominantly coniferous forest. 2. Here the similarity of red and grey squirrels' pattern of habitat use was investigated in Craigvinean forest in Scotland, UK, a site that has experienced apparent coexistence for up to 30 years. Overlap was examined in several dimensions: spatial overlap of home ranges, dynamic association and niche overlap. Habitat selection was examined at three levels: selection of core home range areas, selection of tree species within the home range, and the characteristics of patches used intensively by each squirrel species in comparison with random locations within their home range. 3. Although there was overlap between red and grey squirrel ranges, there were clear differences in the macrohabitats utilized, with red squirrels selecting areas of Norway spruce Picea abies and grey squirrels selecting riparian corridors of mixed woodland for their home ranges. Within their home ranges, habitat selection by individual red and grey squirrels was similar, but again with reds selecting Norway spruce and greys selecting patches of mixed conifers and broad-leaved trees. As no habitat variables consistently affected the microdistribution of red and grey squirrels within blocks or 'stands' of trees, stands that were used were thought to constitute good and relatively homogeneous habitats for squirrels of either species. 4. There was no evidence to suggest that red and grey squirrels avoided using the same areas at the same time, and potential niche overlap was considerable (0.77). However, partitioning of habitats may have reduced competition between red and grey squirrels and hence have contributed to red squirrel persistence at this site. 5. This work (i) reinforces earlier proposals that forest management offers a promising tool to assist the conservation of red squirrels; (ii) raises the issue of determining the spatial scale at which coexistence operates; and (iii) offers an illustration of how the management of invasive species can be mediated through the manipulation of niche availability.","Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Bryce, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",,,,,,,54,31,31,1,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Moreover, the majority of shell occupants are male and tube occupants are female. The possible role of gender in shell competition is therefore of interest. Shell competition between males and females inhabiting C. litteratum in the field was studied in the laboratory. Measurements showed that shield length and major chela length covaried positively for this species. Gender biased allometry favours males in major chela size. Tested pairs either differed in both shield length (body size) and major chela length, or were size matched by shield length and differed only in major chela length. Both individuals of a pair had damaged shells and were offered an intact shell which only one could occupy. Larger body size was an excellent predictor of success in gaining possession of the intact shell, even when the female was the larger. When body size was equal, larger major chela size was an excellent predictor of success.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; Bermuda Biol Stn Res, St Georges, Bermuda","Rodrigues, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",,"Rodrigues, Lisa J/A-2541-2009","Rodrigues, Lisa/0000-0002-0973-0451",,,,41,3,3,0,6,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0011-216X,,,CRUSTACEANA,Crustaceana,SEP,2002,75,,8,,,,1015,1023,,10.1163/15685400260569643,,,9,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,640RY,WOS:000180702800006,,,,,2021-09-21,

We conducted two manipulative field experiments in the soft-bottom intertidal zone during 19901991 in eastern Maine to assess effects of predation, intraspecific competition, and initial planting size on the survival and growth of cultured individuals of Mya. Experiment I (23 June 1990 to 13 June 1991) tested interactive effects of two planting sizes (small=8.5 mm shell length (SL); large=11.8 mm SL) and protective netting on fate and growth of clams. Animals of each size were added to separate experimental units within each of 60 1-m(2) areas delimited by a wooden box. To deter predators, 50 boxes were covered with a specific type of plastic netting that differed in aperture size (4.2, 6.4 and 12.8 mm) and degree of rigidity (flexible vs. extruded) while 10 boxes served as controls (without netting). Small clams grew at a faster rate than large clams, but both added approximately 18 mm of new shell by the end of the study. Growth was unaffected by netting size and rigidity, but 13% more clams were recovered alive after a year in protected vs. unprotected treatments (84% vs. 71%). Survival was independent of netting type. The presence of netting resulted in nearly a 3 x enhancement of wild spat (<15 mm SL) compared to unprotected controls (568.8+/-24.4 vs. 199.6+/-22.8 m(-2)). This result suggests that the decline of wild stocks in eastern Maine may not be related to recruitment failure, but to post-settlement events, such as predation, which remove clams from the intertidal. In Experiment II (15 April to 6 October 1991), clam (14.6+/-0.2 mm SL) density was manipulated across four levels from 333 to 2664 m(-2) in protected (extruded netting, 12.8 mm aperture) and unprotected 1-m(2) boxes. Survival within unprotected boxes was independent of stocking density (79%), but was inversely density-dependent in protected boxes (77% in the lowest density treatment increasing to a mean of 88% in the other three treatments). A negative cubic relationship explained the effect of density on growth. We present the first mariculture strategy for public stock enhancement or private entrepreneurs interested in rearing M. arenaria in Maine and the northeast US. Hatchery-reared juveniles 8-10 mm SL should be planted in the spring near or below mid tide levels at densities between 333 and 666 m(-2) and protected with flexible netting (6.4 mm aperture) raised several centimeters above the sediment surface. Netting should be removed from mud flats in the late fall before the threat of ice and severe winter storms. Animals should attain sizes between 25 and 30 mm SL during this time and reach a size refuge from burrowing and other predators. Growth to legal, commercial size (50.8 mm SL) should take another 2-4 years depending on geographic location and mean seawater temperature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The steady state with equal population densities is the globally stable fixed point. For the biased-rate cyclic advantage population, we can observe the different features of the steady states and their stabilities for even N and for odd N, and we call it as parity law. We obtain the following results on the parity law: (i) for odd number N all the species can coexist following the biased rate and we have the counterintuition for the change of equilibrium densities; (ii) for even N all the species cannot always coexist and it coincides with our intuition. We also analyzed mean-field approximation. It is revealed that most of the results of Monte Carlo simulation can be understood by mean-field approximation dynamics. However, equilibrium densities cannot be always predicted by mean-field approximation because of the spatial fixation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Far fewer studies have recorded relative success in terms of survival and even fewer studies have recorded fecundity under competition. Differences in size suppression are usually assumed to reflect differences in relative abilities to deny resources to competitors. However, most previous studies have failed to control or account for other sources of variation in the size suppression that plants experience under competition, i.e. variation between mixtures in the resource supply/demand ratio (approach to carrying capacity), or variation in the degree of niche overlap between competitors, or variation in the intensity of concurrent facilitative interactions between competitors. For future studies, much greater caution is required in recognizing these inherent limitations of traditional measures of competitive ability and, hence, guarding against unfounded conclusions or predictions about potential for competitive success that are based on these measures. There is also a significant challenge for future studies to adopt empirical approaches for minimizing these limitations. Some initial recommendations are considered here based on an emerging view of competitive ability measured in terms of traits associated with all three conventional components of Darwinian fitness, i.e. not just growth (plant size) but also survival and fecundity allocation (offspring production per unit plant size per unit time). According to this model, differences in competitive ability imply differences in the ability, despite intense competition (i.e. low resource supply/demand ratio), to recruit offspring into the next generation and thereby limit offspring recruitment by other plants. The important traits of competitive ability, therefore, are not only those that allow a plant to deny resources to competitors suppress their sizes and hence. maximize the plant's own size: but also those traits that allow the plant to withstand suppression from competition enough to persist, both as an individual (through survival) and across generations (through descendants).","Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Aarssen, LW (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",aarssenl@biology.queensu.ca,"Aarssen, Lonnie W./K-5778-2012",,,,,85,91,95,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2002,96,3,,,,,531,542,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.960314.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543QG,WOS:000175112200014,,,,,2021-09-21,

Field surveys were conducted at five sites differing in host composition in sub-tropical areas in Japan, at about two-months intervals. Argyrodes flavescens and A. bonadea were both found more frequently on webs of two Nephila species than expected from the web areas they occupied among webs of all web spiders. Seasonal dynamics of Argyrodes changed greatly according to whether N. clavata was present or not, indicating the importance of Nephila on Argyrodes populations. The peak density of A. bonadea came earlier than that of A. flavescens. Because A. flavescens is known to limit the number of A. bonadea on host webs, the decrease in the density of A. bonadea may be due to the effect of interspecific competition by A. flavescens.","Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biodivers Sci, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Miyashita, T (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biodivers Sci, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",,,,,,,12,10,11,0,6,AMER ARACHNOLOGICAL SOC,NEW YORK,"C/O NORMAN I PLATNICK, AMER MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, CENTRAL PK WEST AT 79TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10024 USA",0161-8202,,,J ARACHNOL,J.

This was to address the question of why giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) generally feed at a higher level in the canopy than is accessible to all other browsers. We defined a giraffe browse unit (GBU) as the length of twig corresponding to the average bite taken by giraffes from two staple browse plants: Acacia nigrescens and Boscia albitrunca. We sampled at three study sites in South Africa in the late dry season, at each site clipping GBUs at three heights above ground: 0.5 m, 1.5 m and 2.5 m; these representing the levels typically browsed by small, medium and large-bodied browsing ungulates respectively. For each GBU we measured leaf dry mass, total N, neutral detergent fibre and condensed tannin, using near-infrared spectroscopy calibrated by conventional laboratory analyses. We found no differences between height levels with regard to leaf chemistry concentrations, but leaf biomass per GBU was significantly higher at the 1.5-m and 2.5-m levels than at the 0.5-m level. The larger browsers thus gain a bite-size advantage by browsing above the reach of the smaller species. A likely reason for the reduced leaf biomass per GBU at the low browsing level is the tendency for small browsers to pluck individual leaves from shoots, while large browsers prune off whole shoots. We contend that our findings are analogous to those from parallel studies on the grazing guild, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the smaller members of ungulate guilds competitively displace the larger ones from shared feeding sites when resources become restricted. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the smaller members of each guild drive the grazing succession from behind and maintain browsing height stratification from below.","Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa","du Toit, JT (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",jtdutoit@zoology.up.ac.za,"du Toit, Johan T/D-3390-2009","du Toit, Johan T/0000-0003-0705-7117",,,,46,54,56,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2001,129,4,,,,,585,590,,10.1007/s004420100771,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,501LA,WOS:000172685100013,24577699,,,,2021-09-21,

When eggs of two or more species are deposited at the same time and patch, one can expect a high density of early-instar larvae. Thus, interspecific interactions should be evident. We studied the interaction of two species, Sympetrum fonscolombii and Orthetrum cancellatum, which typically co-occur in French rice fields. We experimentally simulated the laying of egg clutches of both species at the same time and site. Survival of O. cancellatum was reduced compared with that of controls without S. fonscolombii and also with that of S. fonscolombii in the two-species treatment. At the end of the experiment, mean head width of S. fonscolombii was greater than that of O. cancellatum, which may be one reason for the differential survival. In a second experiment we observed the behaviour of pairs of early-instar larvae of both species in different size combinations. Small larvae of S. fonscolombii reduced locomotory activity in the presence of larger O. cancellatum. In contrast, small O. cancellatum did not do so in the presence of larger S. fonscolombii. This behavioural difference may also cause asymmetric interspecific predation.","Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Zool, D-38092 Braunschweig, Germany","Suhling, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Zool, Fasanenstr 3, D-38092 Braunschweig, Germany.",f.suhling@tu-bs.de,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261",,,,56,16,18,1,11,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

However, its quantitative effects on local diversity, i.e. the relationship between the degree of aggregation in a community and community diversity, remain unexplored. In this paper, we tested whether stronger spatial aggregation does lead to the predicted higher local diversity. We compared six species rich Drosophila communities exploiting decaying fruits in central Panama, monitored over one full year (>25 generations). We found a clear positive relationship between the overall degree of aggregation and community diversity. In addition, aggregation over fruit trees was found to contribute greatly to the overall degree of aggregation and was largely responsible for the observed relationship between aggregation and diversity across communities. In addition, both diversity and aggregation strength were lower in communities in disturbed habitats, which was explained by altered spatial distribution of fruiting trees. This study. shows that the aggregation model cannot only explain coexistence, but also differences in local diversity.","Leiden Univ, Inst Evolutionary & Ecol Sci, Sect Anim Ecol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; Panama STRI, Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama","Krijger, CL (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Inst Evolutionary & Ecol Sci, Sect Anim Ecol, POB 9516, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",krijger@rulsfb.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,47,37,39,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We examined the association of the species with different types of substrate and investigated the frequency of limb loss and the life history characteristics of the three species. A. leptodactylus was found at more sites than A. astacus and A. torrentium. It was also present in much higher densities than the other two species. A. torrentium preferred areas with hard substrate, whereas A. astacus was more often found at sites with soft substrate and reed vegetation. A. leptodactylus was observed on soft and hard substrate. The frequency of limb loss was highest in A. astacus and more frequent at sites with a high density of A. leptodactylus. Limb loss in A. leptodactylus and A. torrentium was more frequent at sites with high self-densities. Females of the two Astacus species carried more eggs than A. torrentium females.

Evergreen lianas may impede the growth of their host trees in various ways, including competition for water. Hypotheses tested were that water relations status differs (a) between lianas and their host trees, and (b) between trees infested with lianas that were cut 3.5 months previously (treated trees) and control trees with intact lianas. Diurnal measurements of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and leaf water potential (Psi) were made on canopy leaves of treated and control trees and lianas at the start and end of the dry season. Lianas had higher (less negative) Psi values (mean and predawn) and higher diurnal g(s) (expressed as mean or sum of diurnal values) than mahogany trees, indicating that lianas had a higher demand for, and ability to obtain, water than their host trees. Control and treated trees had a similar water relations status, suggesting that removal of lianas had no effect on the water relations of the trees, even at the end of the dry season. We conclude that either both life forms have conservative water relations that were unaffected by water availability in our study, or that the trees and lianas have access to sufficient and different sources of water because of differences in their rooting depths. Our data are consistent with studies of temperate species, indicating that lianas do not interfere with water availability to their host trees.","Univ Aberdeen, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA","Barker, MG (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Cruickshank Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland.",,,"Perez-Salicrup, Diego R./0000-0002-7024-9042",,,,55,28,32,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV,2000,20,17,,,,,1167,1174,,,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,365TB,WOS:000089965600004,12651492,,,,2021-09-21,

Here we present a survey of the distribution of three coniferous-living Pants species and one of their main predators, the pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum), on nine isolated islands in Scandinavia. On all islands the coal tit (Parus ater) is the sole tit species when the pygmy owl is absent. The two larger species, the willow tit (P. montanus) and the crested tit (P. cristatus), only coexist with the coal tit when pygmy owls are present. We suggest that the coexistence of willow tits, crested tits and coal tits is the result of a combination of competition for food and predator-safe foraging sites. The smaller coal tit is superior in exploitation competition for food, while the two larger species have an advantage in interference competition for predator-safe foraging sites. The association between the distribution of the pygmy owl and the two larger tit species on isolated islands in Scandinavia is consistent with the idea that the pygmy owl is a keystone predator.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Kullberg, C (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",kullberg@zoologi.su.se,,,,,,37,20,21,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2000,89,1,,,,,41,45,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.890105.x,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,299ZB,WOS:000086227400005,,,,,2021-09-21,

This study examines the relationship between these two factors and the evolution of plant competitive strategies (plastic vs. fixed morphologies). In natural plant populations, shifts in light quality associated with foliar shade reliably indicate the presence of neighbors. These cues mediate plastic stem-elongation responses that often increase competitive ability and access to light. Using experimental light treatments (full sun, neutral shade, and foliar shade), genetic differences among populations of Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf) in average elongation and plasticity to foliar-shade cues were examined. Six populations, two from each of three site types (fields in continuous corn cultivation, fields undergoing corn-soy rotation, and weedy sites), were exposed to the light treatments at two stages in their life history. At the seedling stage, populations derived from cornfield sites exhibited higher, average elongation than populations from either rotating corn-soy fields or weedy areas. Because seedling elongation may delay shading of velvetleaf by corn, population differences may reflect adaptive responses to directional selection imposed by competitive conditions. However, the effects of simulated foliar shade on elongation were three times as great as the average population differences, and these comparatively higher levels of elongation were associated with an allocation cost. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity may limit the evolution of specialists; reliable environmental cues enable individuals to facultatively adopt highly elongated, costly phenotypes in crowded patches while avoiding the costs of that phenotype in less crowded microsites. At later life-history stages, populations experiencing competition with corn exhibited lower plasticity to light quality than populations derived from weedy areas. Elongation at later nodes is maladaptive in cornfields because velvetleaf is ultimately incapable of overtopping corn; individuals that elongate therefore experience the cost of allocating to stems but fail to improve leaf exposure. The decreased responsiveness of cornfield populations to light quality is consistent with theoretical predictions in which reduced plasticity is favored when environmental cues fail to mediate an adaptive response.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Weinig, C (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Box G-W, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",cweinig@brown.edu,"Langerhans, R.

We manipulated physical features of the habitat of gecko lizards and measured the effect on exploitation competition for insects. Increasing both the dispersion of food resources and microhabitat topography dramatically reduced interspecific competition. Adding topographic structure reduced the advantages of the larger, faster, invasive species. Interindividual spacing decreased, but intraspecific agonistic interference increased in the more territorial, resident species. Human structural alterations of the environment facilitate invasion and competitive displacement in this system.

Group hunting in social carnivores is generally thought to have evolved through natural selection for improved efficiency of prey capture, increased prey size apprehended or defence of the kill against intra- and interspecific kleptoparasitism. 2. We used a simple model to explore how variation in hunting group size or wild dogs in the Serengeti influences defence of kills against kleptoparasitism from spotted hyenas and the trade-off effects this has on intake rate per dog for a given prey size selected. 3. The analysis presented suggests that while kleptoparasitism substantially influences the amount of time a hunting group can access a kill, increases in access rime with increased hunting group size rarely fully compensate Cor the reduction in each dog's share of the carcass due to scramble competition among the dogs. 4. A profitability index, which includes limitations of the probability of capturing different sized prey, gut capacity, food depletion and access time, suggests that small hunting groups (1-2) would be particularly vulnerable to kleptoparasitism because they are usable to fully satiate themselves before spotted hyenas take over their kills. Intermediate-sized hunting groups may be most effective at meeting nutritional demands over a range of prey sizes. 5. While reasons for the recent extinction of the Serengeti wild dog population remain speculative, this paper contributes lo the debate by proposing that kleptoparasitism by spotted hyenas would have placed a major constraint on the ability of individual wild dog packs to recover from episodic disasters.","MACAULAY LAND USE RES INST, ABERDEEN AB9 2QJ, SCOTLAND","Carbone, C (corresponding author), UNIV ZIMBABWE, DEPT SCI BIOL, TROP RESOURCE ECOL PROGRAMME, POB MP 167, MT PLEASANT, HARARE, ZIMBABWE.",,"Gordon, Iain J/K-8636-2012; Gordon, Iain/S-8076-2019; du Toit, Johan T/D-3390-2009","Gordon, Iain J/0000-0001-9704-0946; Gordon, Iain/0000-0001-9704-0946; du Toit, Johan T/0000-0003-0705-7117",,,,37,87,88,0,59,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

It is now known that larval amphibians exposed to acid water may experience increased mortality or reduced rates of growth. At the interspecific level, species that respond differently to variation in abiotic factors such as pH may experience a shift in their interactions. I used naturally occurring pH levels (4.5, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0) in laboratory experiments to examine the effects of pH on the growth and predator-prey interaction of Ambystoma tigrinum and Pseudacris triseriata. Larvae of A. tigrinum exhibited reduced growth and increased developmental time at lower pH levels. However, pH had no significant effect on growth or developmental time in larvae of P. triseriata. In combination, these factors led to decreased predatory success of A. tigrinum larvae on P. triseriata larvae at lower pH levels.

However, the output of these varied models has not been compared with the results of experimental manipulations within the same system. Using a guild of tidepool sculpins, I tested whether the competition coefficients obtained from static and dynamic regression models were consistent with the results of experimental manipulations. Field manipulations revealed a competitive effect of Oligocottus maculosus on Clinocottus globiceps growth and no effect of C. globiceps on O. maculosus growth. The result of dynamic regression models most closely matched the results of the experiments. Static regression models, in contrast, were less consistent with experimental results, sometimes even predicting interactions with a different sign from those in experiments. I show that the inconsistency in the static regression models may result from the way covariance in carrying capacities directly affects variability in equilibrium population sizes, yielding an erroneous interaction coefficient. The dynamic regression models are free of equilibria assumptions and more accurately predicted a competitive effect of O. maculosus on C. globiceps but no effect of C. globiceps on O. maculosus. These analyses illustrate why dynamically derived measures of interaction strength, rather than static ones, may better predict effects of one species on another.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,SEATTLE,WA 98195",,,,,,,,49,77,77,2,18,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

By measuring drift from patches (snags) of various quality we determined the factors that influence habitat selection and drift of the predaceous stoneflies Acroneuria abnormis and Paragnetina fumosa. The presence of refugia (loose bark and leaf packs) was more important than hunger level and modified the effects of increased predator densities and aggressive interactions. Stoneflies concentrated to 8x natural densities with access to refugia remained longer on snags than a single stonefly without access to refugia. During periods of activity, refugia were defended with larger stoneflies always displacing smaller nymphs. During long periods of inactivity, two and sometimes three nymphs would rest side-by-side sharing the same refuge. Hunger level (starved versus satiated stoneflies), an indirect measure of a predator's response to prey availability, had no significant effect on drift or habitat selection regardless of the presence of refugia. Stonefly predators had a uniform distribution while their prey were clumped. Drift was deliberate and almost always delayed until night, usually at dusk or dawn. An examination of previous research plus the results of this study suggest that non-predatory intra- and interspecific interactions can be an important mechanism causing drift in streams.","SAVANNAH RIVER ECOL LAB,AIKEN,SC","RADER, RB (corresponding author), USDA,FOREST SERV,ROCKY MT FOREST & RANGE EXPT STN,LARAMIE,WY 82070, USA.",,,,,,,52,22,23,0,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1995,103,1,,,,,1,9,,10.1007/BF00328418,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RJ294,WOS:A1995RJ29400001,28306938,,,,2021-09-21,

These patterns of overlap may be sustained through entire seasons of lizard activity.

The distinction between a species' effect on resources and its response to reduced resource levels might help to solve these questions. Whereas classical competition theory predicts competitive exclusion of species with similar requirements, recent ideas stress that species diversity may be explained by a multitude of processes acting at different scales, and that similarities in competitive abilities often may facilitate coexistence.","LUND UNIV, DEPT ECOL THEORET ECOL, S-22362 LUND, SWEDEN; UPPSALA UNIV, DEPT ECOL BOT, S-75236 UPPSALA, SWEDEN","BENGTSSON, J (corresponding author), SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI, DEPT ECOL & ENVIRONM RES, SOIL ECOL SECT, POB 7072, S-75007 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,42,142,161,6,97,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,1872-8383,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

Specifically, we examined interactions among three species of grasshoppers (Melanoplus femur-rubrum, Spharagemon collare, and Phoetaliotes nebrascensis; Orthoptera, Acrididae) and herbaceous plants in experimental field cages placed over existing fertilized or unfertilized vegetation in a Minnesota old field. For the conditions inside these cages, we addressed whether (1) grasshopper diet predicted the presence of competition among grasshopper species, and (2) direct effects of grasshoppers on plants produced indirect interactions among plants, grasshoppers and soil nitrogen. Overall, M. femur-rubrum ate a greater proportion of forbs in cages, while the other two species ate primarily grasses. As expected, a pair of grasshopper species competed if they had similar diets. However, there were important exceptions that could be explained from observed indirect effects, although alternative explanations were also possible. First, all three grasshopper species significantly shifted their diets in the presence of other species, and these shifts occurred most often when competition was expected or occurred. Second, the two grass-feeding species reduced the biomass of the dominant grass (Schizachyrium scoparium) and increased available soil nitrogen and biomass of forbs. This effect may explain why the grass-feeding P. nebrascenis had a positive effect on the forb-feeding M. femur-rubrum on unfertilized plots. Overall, we show that direct effects of consumers on resources can predict competition and other important indirect interactions within a community.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA","RITCHIE, ME (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,62,25,26,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1993,94,4,,,,,516,527,,10.1007/BF00566967,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LM312,WOS:A1993LM31200008,28313992,,,,2021-09-21,

Both species are known to choose shelters high above the reef surface (although spinyheads displace roughheads downwards). To test the hypothesis that this preference is due to greater plankton availability in higher locations, fish were placed on artificial habitats located 15 cm and 100 cm above the surface of a natural reef. Both species experienced higher feeding rates, growth rates, and fecundities in high locations, and spinyhead rates generally exceeded roughhead rates at a given height. Under laboratory conditions, oxygen consumption by spinyheads was 1.6 times greater than that of roughheads and this corresponds well with the 1.8 ratio of feeding rates under controlled aquarium conditions. This information provides a partial explanation for the observed microhabitat distribution and resulting coexistence of these competing species: it is hypothesized that spinyheads have an advantage in agonistic interactions because of their higher metabolic rates, thus excluding roughheads from high sites, but that roughheads can persist at low sites because their lower metabolic rates result in lower food demands.

To examine the effects of the local environmental setting on the outcome of competition for space, pairs of octocoral and scleractinian corals actively competing for space were transplanted from this inshore reef to a mid-shelf one (Britomart) in a controlled experiment. The 2 areas differ in their physical characteristics and biological communities. Competition for space between Clavularia inflata (Coelenterata, Octocorallia), Briareum stechei (Octocorallia), and Acropora longicyathus (Coelenterata, Scleractinia) in all possible pairs was assessed. Controls included undisturbed paired and solo colonies in their natural environment. A second set of corals was relocated to the mid-shelf and returned to its original environment as a control for handling effects. Competitive advantage was estimated via growth rate. Frequency of overgrowth, tissue necrosis, whole colony mortality, and tissue bleaching were also monitored. In their natural environment, Clavularia and Briareum were competitively superior to Acropora. Briareum was superior to Clavularia. With respect to mid-shelf transplants: the competitive edge of Clavularia over Acropora was reversed; the advantage of Briareum over Clavularia was reduced; and the advantage of Briareum over Acropora remained unchanged. On the mid-shelf, transplanted Acropora and Clavularia controls both suffered high mortality due to increased predation and, in the former, apparently increased light penetration. The growth rate of Briareum increased on the mid-shelf. Competitive relationships between these species are complex and can be modified by environmental factors, The refuge of the branching coral A. longicyathus on Pandora Reef was its marginally higher growth rate. Most other coral species dt the study site, particularly the massives, appear to have succumbed to octocoral growth. Competitive advantage in some octocorals is apparently enhanced in inshore waters of the Great Barrier Reef in the presence of nutrient enrichment and lower levels of predation and light. Changes in local environmental factors in these inshore waters may be contributing to the observed increasing domination of Pandora Reef by octocorals.","JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND, DEPT CHEM & BIOCHEM, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIAN INST MARINE SCI, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4810, AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,,71,41,44,0,15,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

This resource was supplied as a series of discrete periodic pulses, preventing achievement of a strict equilibrium. Two mathematical models, based on the equations of Monod and Droop were parameterized from earlier, single-species experiments. These models were then tested for their ability to predict competitive dynamics in these and similar competition cultures. Chlorella outcompeted Scenedesmus in all cultures, regardless of the period of phosphorus pulses. This outcome was predicted qualitatively by both models, but the Droop model gave much more accurate estimates of the rate at which competitive exclusion proceeded. The Droop model also successfully predicted the trajectories of population density in bacteria-free competition cultures, and the rates of uptake of large phosphorus pulses applied to these cultures. This study suggests that competitive trends can be rapid in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium habitats. The traits that confer competitive ability in equilibrium habitats can also confer competitive ability in nonequilibrium habitats, which may limit the potential tradeoffs between species along gradients of environmental variability. Lack of equilibrium may nevertheless increase diversity if convergence of competitive strategies and life histories occurs, a possibility suggested by the competition models used in this study, and by other competition models.","MAX PLANCK INST LIMNOL, OKOPHYSIOL ABT, W-2320 PLON, GERMANY",,,,,,,,59,82,87,0,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,1991,62,2,,,,,231,243,,10.2307/3545269,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HB139,WOS:A1991HB13900013,,,,,2021-09-21,

Here, we demonstrate that phloem-feeding membracids (Publilia modesta) compete intraspecifically for the protective services of an ant mutualist (Formica altipetens). By experimentally increasing membracid densities in the field, we observed three negative effects due to competition for ants: (1) a 45%-59% reduction in the number of ants tending membracid aggregations, (2) a 63% increase in the abundance of a predatory salticid spider (Pellenes sp.), and (3) a 59% reduction in the mean number of membracid nymphs per plant. In total, the loss of protective services due to competition for mutualists translated into a 92% decrease in the production of newly eclosed membracid adults. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration that animal species compete for mutualists. In addition, our work indicates that mutualisms can be strongly influenced by the local biotic neighborhoods in which they occur and thus may be far more variable than previously thought.","NO ARIZONA UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, FLAGSTAFF, AZ 86011 USA","CUSHMAN, JH (corresponding author), MACQUARIE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,64,68,71,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

I report the results of an artificial pond experiment testing for interactions between the red spotted newt, Notophthalmus viridescens and the banded sunfish, Enneacanthus obesus. Increased E. obesus density reduced growth and survival of N. viridescens, but increased N. viridescens density did not significantly affect growth or survival of E. obesus. Increased intraspecific density reduced the growth of both species. There were no significant density effets of either Notophthalmus or Enneacanthus on the number, mass at metamorphosis, or larval period of N. viridescens efts, perhaps due to low reproduction in all treatments. Reproduction of E. obesus varied greatly among replicates, and did not respond to density treatments. A negative correlation between number of juvenile fish and mass indicated competition among juvenile E. obesus. Correlations among mass of adult and juvenile newts and fish were also negative, further suggesting competition between newts and fish. The strong negative effect of Enneacanthus on Notophthalmus provides a possible mechanism for the absence of newts from ponds in the Pine Barrens that contain sunfish.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",,,,,,,,32,12,13,0,5,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 7,1991,,1,,,,,1,8,,,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,EY838,WOS:A1991EY83800001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Similarity was measured using a guild classification and was assigned to three levels: intraspecific, intra-guild and inter-guild interactions. The guild classification was based upon 27 ecological traits associated with both niche properties (e.g. rooting depth) and competitive ability (e.g. plant height). The six species represented two distinct guilds of wetland plants: obligate and facultative annuals. The results confirmed two key predictions: The intensity of competition increased with increasing similarity between interacting plants, as predicted by the niche control paradigm. The asymmetry of competition decreased with increasing similarity, as predicted by the dominance control paradigm.

In this study, we analysed the alarm call system of lesser spot-nosed monkeys, a primate that spends most of its time in mixed-species groups while occupying the lowest and presumably most dangerous part of the forest canopy. In contrast to other primate species, we found no evidence for predator-specific alarm calls. Instead, males gave one general alarm call type ('kroo') to three main dangers (i.e., crowned eagles, leopards and falling trees) and a second call type ('tcha-kow') as a coordinated response to calls produced in non-predatory contexts ('boom') by associated male Campbell's monkeys. Production of 'kroo' calls was also strongly affected by the alarm calling behaviour of male Campbell's monkeys, suggesting that male lesser spot-nosed monkeys adjust their alarm call production to another species' vocal behaviour. We discuss different hypotheses for this unusual phenomenon and propose that high predation pressure can lead to reliance on other species vocal behaviour to minimise predation. Significance statement Predation can lead to the evolution of acoustically distinct, predator-specific alarm calls. However, there are occasional reports of species lacking such abilities, despite diverse predation pressure, suggesting that evolutionary mechanisms are more complex. We conducted field experiments to systematically describe the alarm calling behaviour of lesser spot-nosed monkeys, an arboreal primate living in the lower forest strata where pressure from different predators is high. We found evidence for two acoustically distinct calls but, contrary to other primates in the same habitat, no evidence for predator-specific alarms. Instead, callers produced one alarm call type ('kroo') to all predator classes and another call type ('tcha-kow') to non-predatory dangers, but only as a response to a specific vocalisation of Campbell's monkeys ('boom'). The production of both calls was affected by the calling behaviour of Campbell's monkeys, suggesting that lesser spot-nosed monkey vocal behaviour is dependent on the antipredator behaviour of other species. Our study advances the theory of interspecies interactions and evolution of alarm calls.","[Le Floch, Auriane; Bouchard, Alice; Gallot, Quentin; Zuberbuhler, Klaus] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Zuberbuhler, Klaus] Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol & Neurosci, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland","Le Floch, A (corresponding author), Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Neuchatel, Switzerland.",aurianelefloch@me.com,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X","Universite de Neuchatel; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [310030_185324, 31003A_166458]; Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Cote d'Ivoire; University of Neuchatel; `NCCR Evolving Language', Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [51NF40_180888]","Open Access funding provided by Universite de Neuchatel.

The contribution of biotic interactions to shaping broad-scale species distributions is, however, still debated, partly due to the difficulty of detecting their effects. We aim to test whether spatial exclusion between potentially competing species can be detected at the species range scale, and whether this pattern relates to fine-scale mechanisms of coexistence. Location Western Palearctic. Methods We develop and evaluate a measure of geographic avoidance that uses outputs of species distribution models to quantify geographic exclusion patterns expected if interspecific competition affects broad-scale distributions. We apply the measure to 10 Palearctic bat species belonging to four morphologically similar cryptic groups in which competition is likely to occur. We compare outputs to null models based on pairs of virtual species and to expectations based on ecological similarity and fine-scale coexistence mechanisms. We project changes in range suitability under climate change taking into account effects of geographic avoidance. Results Values of geographic avoidance were above null expectations for two cryptic species pairs, suggesting that interspecific competition could have contributed to shaping their broad-scale distributions. These two pairs showed highest levels of ecological similarity and no trophic or habitat partitioning. Considering the role of competition modified predictions of future range suitability. Main conclusions Our results support the role of interspecific competition in limiting the geographic ranges of morphologically similar species in the absence of fine-scale mechanisms of coexistence. This study highlights the importance of incorporating biotic interactions into predictive models of range shifts under climate change, and the need for further integration of community ecology with species distribution models to understand the role of competition in ecology and biogeography.","[Novella-Fernandez, Roberto; Doncaster, Charles Patrick; Razgour, Orly] Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Novella-Fernandez, Roberto] Tech Univ Munich, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Juste, Javier; Ibanez, Carlos] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Seville, Spain; [Juste, Javier] CIBER Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain; [Rebelo, Hugo] Univ Porto, CIBIO Inbio, Vairao, Portugal; [Russo, Danilo] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Wildlife Res Unit, Portici, Italy; [Alberdi, Antton] Univ Copenhagen, GLOBE Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kiefer, Andreas] Univ Trier, Dept Biogeog, Trier, Germany; [Kiefer, Andreas] NABU Nat & Biodivers Conservat Union, Berlin, Germany; [Graham, Laura] Univ Birmingham, Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Graham, Laura] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Biodivers Ecol & Conservat Grp, Laxenburg, Austria; [Paul, Hynek] Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton, Hants, England; [Razgour, Orly] Univ Exeter, Biosci, Exeter, Devon, England","Novella-Fernandez, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Wissensch Zentrum Weihenstephan, Terr Ecol Res Grp, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",r.novella@tum.de,"Ibanez, Carlos/H-7577-2015; Juste, Javier/B-9253-2013","Ibanez, Carlos/0000-0003-1181-7641; Graham, Laura Jane/0000-0002-3611-7281; Russo, Danilo/0000-0002-1934-7130; Juste, Javier/0000-0003-1383-8462; Novella-Fernandez, Roberto/0000-0003-4013-0646",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/M018660/1],"Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/M018660/1",,62,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

In India, recently invaded fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) has to compete with native lepidopterans to become successful in an exotic environment. Invasive FAW and native pink stem borer (PSB), Sesamia inferens belong to the same feeding guild, and hence they are intraguild competitors. FAW is an aggressive pest and is known to have a cannibalism/predation habit and hence a good model system to study the ecological interactions. The present study examined the incidence of different lepidopteran pests in maize fields for three years after the recent invasion. Incidence of FAW increased over the years compared to other lepidopteran pests. Laboratory and field intraguild competition studies were conducted to understand the survival and fitness of FAW and PSB larvae under different competition scenarios. Our study demonstrated that survival of FAW was reduced in intraspecific as compared to interspecific competition. However, survival of PSB was significantly reduced in interspecific competition due to intraguild predation by FAW. Fitness cost analysis of PSB pupae survived in competition with FAW larvae indicated that they were negatively affected with reduced pupal weight. Low field incidence of PSB and its lowest survival in the presence of intraguild competitor, i.e. FAW prove that PSB might get displaced from the maize ecosystem in the near future.","[Divya, J.; Kalleshwaraswamy, C.

However, not all introduced species become established. Understanding the factors that affect the establishment success of introduced species will help us improve species introductions for biocontrol and conservation purposes. Here we argue that important generalist arthropod predators, the Coccinellini ladybirds (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), are an ideal taxon for investigating the establishment process of introduced species. Coccinellini are introduced accidently via plant exports, as well as deliberately as biocontrol agents to reduce agricultural pests, and a few have become invasive species. Here, using work from invasive biology and biocontrol systems, we categorize the factors affecting the successful establishment of introduced species. These factors are 1) invasiveness of the species, 2) invasibility of the recipient ecosystem and 3) stochastic events that occur after the introduction. We review how factors such as diet and competition, dispersal ability, propagule population, disturbances and climate change can be studied within these three categories to better predict the establishment success of introduced ladybirds. Our review highlights that our current understanding of the differences between successful and unsuccessful species establishments is limited. To address this, we need direct comparisons of dispersal ability and both interspecific and intraspecific variation in ladybirds. We conclude that studies of ladybirds will help to develop theories that better characterize and predict establishment success and invasive potential.","[Edirisinghe, H. M.; Dale, J.; Wignall, A.

The development of rapid methods for reliable prediction of their impacts on crops is a major challenge in agricultural science and invasion biology. The use of comparative functional response tests could give insight in the potential impact of alien herbivorous snails on agricultural crops and natural vegetation. It has been hypothesised that invasive alien snails are superior competitors for resources in comparison with common native species, due to higher attack rates and lower handling times of their food. Applications of the functional response approach to terrestrial snails are scarce, despite offering a convenient test design and delivering meaningful mechanistic understanding of resource use of species. The main objectives of this study were (i) to determine the potential grazing effect of the common garden snail (Cornu aspersum) on some common agricultural crops, using the functional response approach, (ii) to determine whether the presence of an intraspecific and interspecific competitor affects food consumption of this species, and (iii) to assess the interspecific variation in impact for standardization of functional response tests for herbivorous snails. Food consumption of C. aspersum differed significantly for three crops: lettuce (Lactuca sativa), endive (Cichorium endivia var. lanfolia) and common corn salad (Valerianella locusta). The functional responses for consumption of Lactuca sativa differed significantly between individuals collected from wild and from cultured populations of C. aspersum. Furthermore, the food consumption (in dry weight) of C. aspersum differed between tests with presence of an intraspecific and interspecific competitor (i.e., C. aspersum and Cepaea nemoralis, respectively). So, the interspecific and intraspecific competition for resources should be considered in risk assessments in order to generate more reliable impact predictions of alien snail species and to improve our understanding of their interactions with other grazers.","[Thunnissen, N.

Whether plants consistently respond to specific aspects of the soil environment, or whether they express highly contingent foraging responses to combinations of factors is unclear. We conducted a growth room experiment with two plants species (Chenopodium glaucum L. and Chloris virgate Sw.) in which we manipulate plant competition, soil heterogeneity, earthworm presence to answer (1) whether root foraging strategies reflect combinations of these treatments, and (2) whether changes in root foraging are associated with altered competition and pot-level biomass yield. After five weeks of growth, we measured above- and below-ground biomass and root length of each individual in each of four soil zones (shared, owned, and two adjacent zones). These data were used to estimate the degree a plant was suppressed by its neighbors (competitive response), the coefficient of variation in root length among the four zones, and the degree to which a plant concentrated its roots in its home zone vs. in the zone of a neighbor (home aggregation index). Plant neighbors, earthworms, and soil heterogeneity influenced above- and belowground growth and foraging in species-specific ways. The homogenization effect of earthworms on the root distribution of C. glaucum growing alone was changed into heterogenization when it grew with its competitor. Though the root foraging strategy of C. glaucum was relatively conservative while that of C. virgate was relatively aggressive, neither species in this study presented a singular root foraging strategy, and instead, root placement was highly contingent upon local soil factors and planted social context. The avoidance root foraging strategy our plants demonstrated clearly reduced the competitive pressure and increased total productivity per pot which empirically links root foraging to competitive interaction. These findings suggest that the multiple soil-related predictors are integrated to determine the root foraging strategies with a species-specific variation in spatial root distribution, and the shifts in foraging strategy were associated with changes in the strength of plant-plant interactions and impacted total productivity. This work has potential impacts on understanding the contingent root performance, undetermined interspecific relationships and possible species coexistence in a context-specific environment.","[Wang, Ping; Hasnain, Muhammad; Wu, Donghui] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Veg, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Cahill, James] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Wu, DH (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Veg, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wudonghui@iga.ac.cn,,"Wang, Ping/0000-0002-4557-9146",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31770475]; Science & Technology Development Program of Jilin Province [20180101087JC]; National Science & Technology Fundamental Resources Investigation Program of China [2018FY100300],"This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31770475); the Science & Technology Development Program of Jilin Province (20180101087JC); and National Science & Technology Fundamental Resources Investigation Program of China (2018FY100300).

Biotic interactions may be particularly influential in the ecology of mammalian carnivores, which engage in strong predator-prey and competitive interactions. Regional, multi-scale data on distribution patterns of interacting carnivore species are key to informing our understanding of this issue. Location: Washington State, USA. Methods: Using a spatially extensive camera-trapping array, we examined the factors influencing distribution patterns of seven carnivore species at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We used single-species occupancy models to assess the relative influence of abiotic and biotic covariates on distribution of individual carnivore species, and two-species occupancy models to assess how dominant carnivores influence subordinate carnivore occupancy and detection. Results: Carnivore occupancy patterns responded more strongly to abiotic than biotic covariates at both spatial grains and extents of analysis. The influence of biotic variables decreased as the grain of analysis increased, while constraining our study area extent substantially decreased the explanatory power of abiotic variables. Interspecific interactions among carnivores influenced occupancy and detection across spatial scales. However, there was little evidence that interactions were more pronounced at finer temporal scales. Main Conclusions: Results demonstrate that at broad spatial extents, species distributions are largely dictated by abiotic factors, particularly climate. Although biotic factors related to habitat and prey were important factors for some species, they generally declined in importance as grain size of analysis increased, suggesting these interactions play out at finer resolutions. However, competitive and mutualistic interactions exerted an independent influence on distribution over broad extents and coarse grains of analysis, suggesting that failure to account for interactions may limit our ability to accurately model distributions of species and their responses to future large-scale disturbances.","[King, Travis W.; Thornton, Daniel H.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, POB 642812, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Vynne, Carly] Osprey Insights, Seattle, WA USA; [Miller, David] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fisher, Scott] Washington State Dept Nat Resources, Colville, WA USA; [Fitkin, Scott] Washington State Dept Fish & Wildlife, Winthrop, WA USA; [Rohrer, John] US Forest Serv, Okanogan Wenatchee Natl Forest, Winthrop, WA USA; [Ransom, Jason, I] Natl Pk Serv, North Cascades Natl Pk Serv Complex, Sedro Woolley, WA USA","King, TW (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, POB 642812, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",Travis.w.king@wsu.edu,"Ransom, Jason/AAT-4025-2020","Ransom, Jason/0000-0002-5930-4004",Conservation Research and Education Opportunities International; Seattle City Light Wildlife Research Grant; Department of the Interior Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center Research Fellowship; United States Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Conservation Northwest,Conservation Research and Education Opportunities International; Seattle City Light Wildlife Research Grant; Department of the Interior Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center Research Fellowship; Conservation Northwest; United States Forest Service.,,107,2,2,5,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Coexistence theory offers a tool for advancing this understanding by providing a framework to link short-term individual measurements with long-term population dynamics by directly quantifying the niche and average fitness differences between species. We observed that a pair of closely related and functionally similar annual plants with different origins-native Plectritis congesta and introduced Valerianella locusta-co-occur at the community scale but rarely at the local scale of direct interaction. To test whether niche and/or fitness differences preclude local-scale long-term coexistence, we parameterized models of competitor dynamics with results from a controlled outdoor pot experiment, where we manipulated densities of each species. To evaluate the hypothesis that niche and fitness differences exhibit environmental dependency, leading to community-scale coexistence despite local competitive exclusion, we replicated this experiment with a water availability treatment to determine if this key limiting resource alters the long-term prediction. Water availability impacted population vital rates and intensities of intraspecific versus interspecific competition between P. congesta and V. locusta. Despite environmental influence on competition our model predicts that native P. congesta competitively excludes introduced V. locusta in direct competition across water availability conditions because of an absence of stabilizing niche differences combined with a difference in average fitness, although this advantage weakens in drier conditions. Further, field data demonstrated that P. congesta densities have a negative effect on V. locusta seed prediction. We conclude that native P. congesta limits abundances of introduced V. locusta at the direct-interaction scale, and we posit that V. locusta may rely on spatially dependent coexistence mechanisms to maintain coexistence at the site scale. In quantifying this competitive outcome our study demonstrates mechanistically how a native species may limit the abundance of an introduced invader.","[Johnson, Jens C.; Williams, Jennifer L.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 217-1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 0B09, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, 217-1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 0B09, Canada","Johnson, JC; Williams, JL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 217-1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 0B09, Canada.",jensj27@mail.ubc.ca; jennifer.williams@geog.ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canadian Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation; British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund,"This research was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund.",,55,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,AUG 25,2020,12,5,,,,,,,plaa045,10.1093/aobpla/plaa045,,,11,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NX0ZP,WOS:000575447700001,33033590,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Interspecific competition among specialised co-occurring predators capturing termites should be high. Here we investigated various niche dimensions, namely temporal, spatial and trophic, of a couple of jumping spider species of the genusStenaelurillus(Stenaelurillus guttigerandS. modestus) from South Africa, to find whether these two species co-exist and along which niche dimension(s) they differentiate. The two species co-occurred in two out of five study sites. Body size was not significantly different between the species. The phenology was shifted so that one species matured earlier. Circadian activity was not different, as both species were diurnal and active at similar times. Both species preyed almost exclusively on termites. The fundamental trophic niche was very similar and rather narrow. The realised trophic niche at the prey order level of both species was similar, but at the genus level it was different. InS. modestusit was narrower, as it captured mainlyOdontotermes, whileS. guttigerexploited a few termite species. The size of prey captured was also similar between the two species. The frequency of intraguild predation was negligible. We conclude that bothStenaelurillusspecies are specialised termitophagous predators. The two species can coexist across broad spatial scales due to spatial segregation on the landscape. At the sites where they co-occur, the two species specialise on different termite prey, promoting local coexistence.","[Pekar, Stano; Petrakova Dusatkova, Lenka; Michalek, Ondrej] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Haddad, Charles R.] Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, Bloemfontein, South Africa","Pekr, S (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic.",pekar@sci.muni.cz,,,Masaryk University [MUNI/A/1078/2017]; National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [112127],"We would like to thank E.

Evolutionary changes can occur in the interaction dynamics between community members as they adapt to coexistence. Here, we report that the syntrophic interaction between Geobacter sulfurreducens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa coculture change in their dynamics over evolutionary time. Specifically, Geobacter sp. dominance increases with adaptation within the cocultures, as determined through quantitative PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. This suggests a transition from syntrophy to competition and demonstrates the rapid adaptive capacity of Geobacter spp. to dominate in cocultures with P. aeruginosa. Early in coculture establishment, two single-nucleotide variants in the G. sulfurreducens fob! and tetR genes emerged that were strongly selected for throughout coculture evolution with P. aeruginosa phenazine wild-type and phenazine-deficient mutants. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) proteomics revealed that the tetR variant cooccurred with the upregulation of an adenylate cyclase transporter, CyaE, and a resistance-nodulationdivision (RND) efflux pump notably known for antibiotic efflux. To determine whether antibiotic production was driving the increased expression of the multi-drug efflux pump, we tested Pseudomonas-derived phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PHZ-1-CA) for its potential to inhibit Geobacter growth and drive selection of the tetR and fabl genetic variants. Despite its inhibitory properties, PHZ-1-CA did not drive variant selection, indicating that other antibiotics may drive overexpression of the efflux pump and CyaE or that a novel role exists for these proteins in the context of this interaction. IMPORTANCE Geobacter and Pseudomonas spp. cohabit many of the same environments, where Geobacter spp. often dominate. Both bacteria are capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET) and play important roles in biogeochemical cycling. Although they recently in 2017 were demonstrated to undergo direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) with one another, the genetic evolution of this syntrophic interaction has not been examined. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of the cocultures before and after adaptive evolution to determine whether genetic selection is occurring.

In the western Canadian boreal forest, restoration of seismic lines-linear corridors cut for oil exploration-has been proposed to mitigate declines in woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) driven by altered predator-prey dynamics in industrialized landscapes. Seismic lines fragment caribou habitat, facilitate predator (wolves Canis lupus and black bears Ursus americanus) movements, and may enhance apparent competition from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces). Here, we tested the assumption that restoration provides immediate wildlife conservation benefits, using a caribou-boreal forest case study. We used camera traps to monitor seismic line use by caribou, their competitors, and predators following restoration in northeastern Alberta. We assessed species responses to four line strata: two restored (active and passive) and two unrestored (human-use and control). Three-to-six years after restoration, white-tailed deer preferred unrestored seismic lines over actively restored lines, while wolves preferred human-use lines but did not avoid restored lines. Caribou preferred lines in lowland habitat and lines surrounded by low linear density regardless of restoration. Species responses to restoration were muted, indicating that restoration alone may not be immediately effective in stabilizing threatened caribou populations. Our results highlight that wildlife responses to restoration must be tested. We recommend rigorous wildlife monitoring following restoration, particularly when the indirect, interspecific effects of habitat change drive species endangerment or recovery.","[Tattersall, Erin R.; Burgar, Joanna M.; Burton, A.

Dietary overlap is one of the numerous niche dimensions used to characterize resource partitioning and potential competition within a community. We characterize the diet, potential dietary niche overlap and prey preference of a large African carnivore guild on small fenced protected areas. To quantify the potential inter- and intraspecific foraging competition, we analysed 5,128 kills, representing 35 prey species made by African wild dogs Lycaon pictus (n = 553), cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus (1,427), lions Panthera leo (2,648) and leopards P. pardus (500). Our results show that large African carnivores in small protected areas are exposed to considerable overlap in dietary resource utilization. At the interspecific level, African wild dogs and cheetahs displayed the greatest vulnerability to potential dietary competition. Lions exhibited marked differences in prey preference, mass and species utilization compared to the other carnivores. African wild dogs and cheetah females with dependent offspring occupied the greatest potential for dietary competition within the large carnivore guild. Using a case study based on the preferred biomass of prey available, we estimate the sustainable density of large carnivores at a small fenced prospective African wild dog reintroduction site. African wild dogs displayed the lowest mean predicted density compared to all sympatric predators with an expected population size of 7 individuals. Our research highlights the need to assess the influence of competitive forces in structuring and restoring large predators to portions of their historical range by identifying species most vulnerable to a potential reintroduction attempt. In the absence of controlled experiments, elucidating the influences of exploitation competition is challenging, and only through manipulating sympatric species presence and densities can these complex interactions be fully understood.","[Vogel, John T.; Venter, Jan A.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management, George Campus,Madiba Dr, ZA-6530 George, Western Cape, South Africa; [Vogel, John T.] Eastern Cape Pk & Tourism Agcy, East London, South Africa; [Somers, Michael J.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Invas Biol, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol,Eugene Marais Chair Wildlife, Pretoria, South Africa","Venter, JA (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management, George Campus,Madiba Dr, ZA-6530 George, Western Cape, South Africa.",jan.venter@mandela.ac.za,/A-1523-2008,/0000-0002-5836-8823,,,,61,3,3,5,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Thus, these designs assume that all individuals will respond to contaminant exposure in a similar manner. Additionally, commonly used constant, static exposure regime designs neglect to recognize the spatial and temporal variation in contaminant plume structures as they move throughout fluid environments. The purpose of this study was to understand the effects of the structural characteristics (concentration, duration, and frequency) of temporally and spatially variant contaminant plumes on the personality of individuals. This experimental design aimed to construct a sensitive definition of exposure by connecting sublethal effects of toxicants and realistic exposure regimes. This study used escape response of Faxonius virilis crayfish from the predatory odor of Micropterus saltnoides prior to and following exposure to the herbicide, atrazine. Atrazine was delivered in pulses to flow through exposure arenas for a total of 47 h while manipulating the concentration, frequency, and duration of the herbicide pulses. Escape response of crayfish prior to exposure was used to categorize animals into bold and shy personalities. The change in escape response was analyzed and resulted in a personality-dependent behavioral sensitivity to the polluted environment. Individuals classified as bold showed increased change in response to predatory odor relative to shy animals. Bold animals exhibited decreased activity after exposure where no change was presented in shy individuals. Shifts in individual behavior have impacts on the population level (e.g. resource acquisition/value; interspecies competition) and the ecosystem level (e.g. food web dynamics; trophic cascades). This study demonstrates the importance of sensitive measures in ecological risk assessment methods.","[Steele, Alexandra N.; Moore, Paul A.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lab Sensory Ecol, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Steele, Alexandra N.; Moore, Paul A.] Univ Michigan, Biol Stn, Pellston, MI 49769 USA; [Moore, Paul A.] Bowling Green State Univ, JP Scott Ctr Neurosci Mind & Behav, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA","Moore, PA (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lab Sensory Ecol, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",pmoore@bgsu.edu,,,University of Michigan Biological StationUniversity of Michigan System; Larry and Linda Oman Graduate Scholarship; Bowling Green State University Faculty Research Committee; Fulbright Fellowship,"The authors would like to thank the Laboratory for Sensory Ecology for their continued support and feedback throughout this project.

Testing this pattern is difficult because of the complexity of distributions across wide geographical areas. An alternative strategy, however, is to measure species' distributional patterns along elevational gradients. We applied this strategy to examine whether lowland forest birds are indeed less common near their upper range limits on a Bornean mountain, and tested co-occurrence patterns among species for potential causes of attenuation, including signatures of habitat selection and competition at the periphery of their ranges. Location Mt. Mulu, Borneo. Taxon Rain forest birds. Methods We surveyed lowland forest birds on Mt. Mulu (2,376 m), classified their elevation-occupancy distributions using Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models, and examined co-occurrence patterns of species pairs for signatures of shared habitat patches and interspecific competition. Results For 39 of 50 common species, occupancy was highest at sea level then gradually declined near their upper range edges, in keeping with a rare periphery hypothesis. With respect to habitat selection, lowland species do not appear to cluster together at sites of patchy similar habitat near their upper range limits; neither are most lowland species segregated from potential montane competitors where ranges overlap. Main conclusions High relative abundance at sea level implies that species inhabit truncated niches and are not currently near the limits of their fundamental niche, unless unknown critical response thresholds exist. However, indirect effects of increasing temperature predicted under climate change scenarios could still influence lower range limits of lowland species indirectly by altering habitat, precipitation regimes and competitive interactions. The lack of non-random co-occurrence patterns implies that patchy habitat and simple pairwise species interactions are unlikely to be responsible for upper range limits in most species; diffuse competition across diverse rain forest bird communities could still play a role.","[Burner, Ryan C.; Sheldon, Frederick H.] Louisiana State Univ, Museum Nat Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Burner, Ryan C.; Sheldon, Frederick H.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Styring, Alison R.] Evergreen State Coll, Olympia, WA 98505 USA; [Rahman, Mustafa A.] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Resource Sci & Technol, Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Rahman, Mustafa A.] Univ Coll Sabah Fdn, Fac Nat Sci & Sustainabil, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia","Burner, RC (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, N-1433 As, Norway.",ryan.c.burner@gmail.com,"Burner, Ryan C./AAF-6638-2020","Burner, Ryan C./0000-0002-7314-9506",Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1241059]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [8753-10]; Louisiana Board of Regents,"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: 1241059; National Geographic Society, Grant/Award Number: 8753-10; Louisiana Board of Regents",,69,3,3,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Without manipulative experiments, assessing the role of foraging ecology and interspecific competition in structuring diet is challenging. Systems with regular pulses of resources act as a natural experiment to investigate the factors that influence the dietary niches of consumers. We used natural pulses of mast-fruiting of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) to test whether optimal foraging or competition structure the dietary niche breadth and overlap between two congener rodent species (Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus), both of which are generalist consumers. We reconstructed diets seasonally over a 2-year period using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15) of hair and of potential dietary items and measured niche dynamics using standard ellipse area calculated within a Bayesian framework. Changes in niche breadth were generally consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory, with both species consuming more beechnuts (a high-quality food resource) and having a narrower niche breadth during masting seasons compared to nonmasting seasons when dietary niches expanded and more fungi (a low-quality food source) were consumed. In contrast, changes in dietary niche overlap were consistent with competition theory, with higher diet overlap during masting seasons than during nonmasting seasons. Overall, dietary niche dynamics were closely tied to beech masting, underscoring that food availability influences competition. Diet plasticity and niche partitioning between the two Peromyscus species may reflect differences in foraging strategies, thereby reducing competition when food availability is low. Such dietary shifts may have important implications for changes in ecosystem function, including the dispersal of fungal spores.","[Stephens, Ryan B.; Lee, Thomas D.; Rowe, Rebecca J.] Univ New Hampshire, Nat Resources & Environm, 114 James Hall,56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Hobbie, Erik A.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Stephens, RB (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Nat Resources & Environm, 114 James Hall,56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",rbd8@wildcats.unh.edu,,"Stephens, Ryan/0000-0001-8524-9873","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Project [0229197, 1006881]; University of New Hampshire NRESS Student Support Fund; New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Project, Grant/Award Number: 0229197 and 1006881; University of New Hampshire NRESS Student Support Fund; New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station",,75,5,5,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

To understand how the semiaquatic bug communities are shaped, it was first verified whether there was a pattern of co-occurrence between species. It was subsequently tested whether the pattern found was related to environmental variables. Lastly, it was verified whether morphological divergence between species was present in the morphological and functional traits selected. 2. A pattern of species co-occurrence was found in the studied assemblage, related to both environmental variables and interspecific biological interactions. Pairs of species with negative, positive, and random co-occurrence were found. Traits related to predation competition, sexual competition, and interaction with the environment showed significant morphological divergence. 3. Therefore, more than one process defines species co-occurrence patterns in semiaquatic bug communities. It is suggested that environmental influence is related to species microhabitat preference. On the other hand, the morphological divergence found is related to competition and sharing of food resources.","[Guterres, Alana P.

So far, studies on plant nutrient relationships mostly focused on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), whereas potassium (K) received less attention. We evaluated whether plant responses to variation in nutrient availability are similar or different for the nutrients N, P and K and whether the same plant traits are decisive for the competitive ability of species along gradients of N, P and K availabilities. We studied plant trait responses of three temperate perennial grass species (Alopecurus pratensis, Agrostis capillaris and Anthoxanthum odoratum, each dominant under N limitation, P limitation and K limitation, respectively). Each gradient consisted of eight treatments (N1-N8, P1-P8, K1-K8), with N:P:K supply rates being 1:0.8:6 (N1), 128:0.8:6 (N8), 12:0.075:6 (P1), 12:9.6:6 (P8), 12:0.8:0.56 (K1) and 12:0.8:72 (K8) (total supply per plant individual in mg). Plant individuals were kept either in single-species pots (intraspecific competition) or in mixed-species pots (interspecific competition). After 2 months, plant biomass, leaf and root traits and root enzyme activity were measured. Most below-ground traits (e.g. total root length, root diameter) responded most strongly to competition as predictor variable and only secondly to the type of nutrient or their supply rates (unlike RGR(Total) and SLA). Leaf chlorophyll content and root enzyme activity responded most strongly to supply rate of nutrients and the interaction of nutrient type and supply rate, respectively. In line with our prediction, A. pratensis was the superior competitor under N limitation and A. odoratum was the superior competitor under K limitation (assessed by relative dominance [RD] and relative competitive strength [RCS]). Both species showed high investment in total root length. Opposite to our expectation, A. capillaris was a bad competitor under P limitation, with low root length but higher root phosphatase activity. Our results indicate that below-ground plant traits are decisive in nutrient-related competition between plant species. Further, competitive strength is determined by a high total root length per soil volume both under N and K limitation. Under P limitation, the model species A. capillaris showed a weak competitive performance either because it was lacking colonization with mycorrhiza and/or the high investment in phosphatase activity posed a trade-off with higher N investment in phosphatase production.

In nature, however, rarity can have costs, resulting in positive frequency-dependence (PFD) particularly when species are rare. Many processes can cause positive frequency-dependence, including a lack of mates, mutualist interactions, and reproductive interference from heterospecifics. When species become rare in the community, positive frequency-dependence creates vulnerability to extinction, if frequencies drop below certain thresholds. For example, environmental fluctuations can drive species to low frequencies where they are then vulnerable to PFD. Here, we analyze deterministic and stochastic mathematical models of two species interacting through both PFD and resource competition in a Chessonian framework. Reproductive success of individuals in these models is reduced by a product of two terms: the reduction in fecundity due to PFD, and the reduction in fecundity due to competition. Consistent with classical coexistence theory, the effect of competition on individual reproductive success exhibits negative frequency-dependence when individuals experience greater intraspecific competition than interspecific competition, i.e., niche overlap is less than one. In the absence of environmental fluctuations, our analysis reveals that (1) a synergistic effect of PFD and niche overlap that hastens exclusion, (2) trade-offs between susceptibility to PFD and maximal fecundity can mediate coexistence, and (3) coexistence, when it occurs, requires that neither species is initially rare. Analysis of the stochastic model highlights that environmental fluctuations, unless perfectly correlated, coupled with PFD ultimately drive one species extinct. Over any given time frame, this extinction risk decreases with the correlation of the demographic responses of the two species to the environmental fluctuations, and increases with the temporal autocorrelation of these fluctuations. For species with overlapping generations, these trends in extinction risk persist despite the strength of the storage effect decreasing with correlated demographic responses and increasing with temporal autocorrelations. These results highlight how the presence of PFD may alter the outcomes predicted by modern coexistence mechanisms.","[Schreiber, Sebastian J.; Strauss, Sharon Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Schreiber, Sebastian J.; Strauss, Sharon Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Yamamichi, Masato] Kyoto Univ, Hakubi Ctr Adv Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Yamamichi, Masato] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Schreiber, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Schreiber, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sschreiber@ucdavis.edu,"Yamamichi, Masato/F-8836-2019","Yamamichi, Masato/0000-0003-2136-3399","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1313418, 1716803]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H02642, 16K18618, 16H04846]; John Mung Program of Kyoto University; Hakubi Center for Advanced Research of Kyoto University; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 13-42841]","We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and R.

Whilst knowledge of the factors that drive the evolution of interspecific variation in sperm morphology is accumulating, we currently have little understanding of factors that may constrain evolutionary change in sperm traits. We investigated whether susceptibility to sperm abnormalities could represent such a constraint in songbirds, a group characterized by a distinctive helical sperm head shape. Specifically, using 36 songbird species and data from light and scanning electron microscopy, we examined among-species correlations between the occurrence of sperm head abnormalities and sperm morphology, as well as the correlation between sperm head abnormalities and two indicators of sperm competition. We found that species with more helically shaped sperm heads (i.e., a wider helical membrane and more pronounced cell waveform) had a higher percentage of abnormal sperm heads than species with less helical sperm (i.e., relatively straight sperm) and that sperm head traits were better predictors of head abnormalities than total sperm length. In contrast, there was no correlation between sperm abnormalities and the level of sperm competition. Given that songbird species with more pronounced helical sperm have higher average sperm swimming speed, our results suggest an evolutionary trade-off between sperm performance and the structural integrity of the sperm head. As such, susceptibility to morphological abnormalities may constrain the evolution of helical sperm morphology in songbirds.","[Stostad, Hanna N.; Rowe, Melissah; Johnsen, Arild; Lifjeld, Jan T.] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Oslo, Norway; [Rowe, Melissah] Univ Oslo, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, Dept Biosci, Oslo, Norway","Stostad, HN (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Oslo, Norway.",h.n.stostad@nhm.uio.no,,"Stostad, Hanna/0000-0002-1702-0177",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [230434/F20],MR was supported by a Young Research Talent grant from the Research Council of Norway (230434/F20).,,47,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

Here, we show-in four analytical models of interspecies competition-that broadly inflicted stressors disproportionately cause competitive exclusions within groups of ecologically similar species. As a result, we predict that ecosystems become progressively thinner-that is, they have progressively less functional redundancy-as broadly inflicted stressors become progressively more intense. This may negatively affect the temporal stability of ecosystem functions, but it also buffers ecosystem productivity against stress by favoring species less sensitive to the stressors. Our main result follows from the weak limiting similarity principle: species with more similar ecological niches compete more strongly, and their coexistence can be upset by smaller perturbations. We show that stressors can cause indirect competitive exclusions at much lower stressor intensity than needed to directly cause species extinction, consistent with the finding of empirical studies that species interactions are often the proximal drivers of local extinctions. The excluded species are more sensitive to the stressor relative to their ecologically similar competitors. Moreover, broadly inflicted stressors may cause hydra effects-where higher stressor intensity results in higher abundance for a species with lower sensitivity to the stressor than its competitors. Correlations between stressor impacts and ecological niches reduce the potential for indirect competitive exclusions, but they consequently also reduce the buffering effect of ecosystem thinning on ecosystem productivity. Our findings suggest that ecosystems experiencing stress may continue to provision ecosystem services but lose functional redundancy and stability.","[Burgess, Matthew G.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, 216 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Burgess, Matthew G.] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Fredston-Hermann, Alexa; Tilman, David; Gaines, Steven D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Gaines, Steven D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Burgess, MG (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, 216 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.; Burgess, MG (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",matthew.g.burgess@colorado.edu,"Gaines, Steven/Y-3234-2019","Fredston, Alexa/0000-0002-5449-7054; Burgess, Matthew/0000-0002-3750-4347",Waitt Foundation; University of Colorado Boulder; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; BIOSTASES Advanced Grant; European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [666971],The study received funding from the Waitt Foundation and the University of Colorado Boulder.

Consequently, several predictions have been made related to how species are assembled within communities according to flowering time. Strong overlap in flowering time among coexisting species may result from clustered abiotic resources, or contribute to improved pollination success. Conversely, low flowering time overlap (asynchrony) among coexisting species may reduce competition for soil, light, or pollinator resources and alleviate interspecific pollen transfer. Here, we present evidence that coexisting species in an old-field community generally overlap less in flowering time than expected under a commonly used and statistically validated null model. Flowering time asynchrony was more pronounced when abundance data were used (compared to presence-absence data), and when analyses focused on species that share bees as pollinators. Control and herbivore-exclusion plots did not differ in flowering time overlap, providing no evidence of the reduction in overlap expected to result from increased competition. Our results varied with the randomization algorithm used, emphasizing that the choice of algorithm can influence the outcome of null models. Our results varied between 2years, with patterns being less clear in the second year, when both growing season and flowering times were contracted. Finally, we found evidence that further supports a previous finding that higher plot-level flowering time overlap was associated with higher proportions of introduced species. Reduced flowering time overlap among species in our focal community may promote coexistence via temporal niche differentiation and reduced competition for pollinators and other abiotic resources.","[Jensen, Ashley M.; Schamp, Brandon S.; Belleau, Angela] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, 1520 Queen St East, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada","Schamp, BS (corresponding author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, 1520 Queen St East, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada.",Brandon.schamp@algomau.ca,,,Northern Ontario Heritage Foundation Internship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Undergraduate Student Research AwardNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Post-Secondary Education Fund for Aboriginal Learners Award; Algoma University Summer Work Program; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN-2015-04397],"This research was supported by a Northern Ontario Heritage Foundation Internship to A.

Although most Southern Hemisphere populations are slowly recovering, the influence of future climate change on their recovery remains unknown. We investigate the impacts of two anthropogenic pressures-historical commercial whaling and future climate change-on populations of baleen whales (blue, fin, humpback, Antarctic minke, southern right) and their prey (krill and copepods) in the Southern Ocean. We use a climate-biological coupled Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments (MICE) that links krill and whale population dynamics with climate change drivers, including changes in ocean temperature, primary productivity and sea ice. Models predict negative future impacts of climate change on krill and all whale species, although the magnitude of impacts on whales differs among populations. Despite initial recovery from historical whaling, models predict concerning declines under climate change, even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue, fin and southern right whales, and Atlantic/Indian fin and humpback whales. Predicted declines were a consequence of reduced prey (copepods/krill) from warming and increasing interspecific competition between whale species. We model whale population recovery under an alternative scenario whereby whales adapt their migratory patterns to accommodate changing sea ice in the Antarctic and a shifting prey base. Plasticity in range size and migration was predicted to improve recovery for ice-associated blue and minke whales. Our study highlights the need for ongoing protection to help depleted whale populations recover, as well as local management to ensure the krill prey base remains viable, but this may have limited success without immediate action to reduce emissions.","[Tulloch, Vivitskaia J.

Investigating these variations is important for making predictions regarding the dynamics of plant communities and carbon pools under global change. We conducted this study across 433 shrubland sites in northern China. We fitted structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the variation in the species-richness-biomass relationships of shrubs and herbs along a wetness gradient and general liner models (GLMs) to analyze how shrub or herb biomass affected the species-richness-biomass relationship of the other life form. We found that the positive species-richness-biomass relationships for both shrubs and herbs became weaker or even negative with higher water availability, likely indicating stronger interspecific competition within life forms under more benign conditions. After accounting for variation in environmental contexts using residual regression, we found that the benign effect of greater facilitation by a larger shrub biomass reduced the positive species-richness-biomass relationships of herbs, causing them to become nonsignificant. Different levels of herb biomass, however, did not change the species-richness-biomass relationship of shrubs, possibly because greater herb biomass did not alter the stress level for shrubs. We conclude that biodiversity in the studied plant communities is particularly important for plant biomass production under arid conditions and that it might be possible to use shrubs as nurse plants to facilitate understory herb establishment in ecological restoration.","[Guo, Yanpei; Liu, Hongyan; Jiang, Youxu; Tang, Zhiyao] Peking Univ, Inst Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yanpei; Liu, Hongyan; Jiang, Youxu; Tang, Zhiyao] Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yanpei; Schob, Christian; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schob, Christian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ma, Wenhong] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Life Sci, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Mohammat, Anwar] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Yu, Shunli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Changes, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Youxu] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland","Tang, ZY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Tang, ZY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zytang@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Tang, Zhiyao/B-8795-2008; Schob, Christian/B-6083-2008","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Schob, Christian/0000-0003-4472-2286; Tang, Zhiyao/0000-0003-0154-6403; Guo, Yanpei/0000-0001-7724-0473","National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFA0605101]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31770489, 31621091]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050300]; Chinese Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [20160610292]; University Research Priority Program Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich","This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Plan (#2017YFA0605101), National Natural Science Foundation of China (#31770489 and #31621091) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (#XDA05050300).

However, little is known about regional-scale environmental drivers of geographic distributions of termite species, and how these environmental factors impact co-occurrence among congeneric species. Here we focus on the southern Appalachian Mountains-a well-known center of endemism for forest biota-and use Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) to examine the distributions of three species of Reticulitermes termites (i.e., R. flavipes, R. virginicus, and R. malletei). To overcome deficiencies in public databases, ENMs were underpinned by field-collected high-resolution occurrence records coupled with molecular taxonomic species identification. Spatial overlap among areas of predicted occurrence of each species was mapped, and aspects of niche similarity were quantified. We also identified environmental factors that most strongly contribute to among-species differences in occupancy. Overall, we found that R. flavipes and R. virginicus showed significant niche divergence, which was primarily driven by dry-season precipitation. Also, all three species were most likely to co-occur in the mid-latitudes of the study area (i.e., northern Alabama and Georgia, eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina), which is an area of considerable topographic complexity. This work provides important baseline information for follow-up studies of local-scale drivers of these species' distributions. It also identifies specific geographic areas where future assessments of the frequency of true syntopy vs. micro-allopatry, and associated interspecific competitive interactions, should be focused.","[Hyseni, Chaz; Garrick, Ryan C.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA","Hyseni, C (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA.",chaz.hyseni@gmail.com; rgarrick@olemiss.edu,"Hyseni, Chaz/I-7633-2018","Hyseni, Chaz/0000-0003-2567-8013; Garrick, Ryan/0000-0002-4057-7061",American Philosophical Society; Bay Foundation; Paul Foundation; Eppley Foundation for Research; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; Washington Biologists' Field Club; University of Mississippi,"This work was supported by grants from the American Philosophical Society, Bay and Paul Foundations, Eppley Foundation for Research, National Geographic Society, Washington Biologists' Field Club, and start-up funds from the University of Mississippi.",,69,7,7,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2075-4450,,,INSECTS,Insects,JAN,2019,10,1,,,,,,,33,10.3390/insects10010033,,,13,Entomology,Entomology,HJ5DN,WOS:000457198700021,30669589,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

In this study, we tested the predictions that (i) H. verticillata invades sites with a higher prevalence of native species; (ii) co-occurrences between the invasive and natives depend on their degree of similarity in morphology and resource use and that (iii) native species morphologically similar to H. verticillata decreases in sites colonized by H. verticillata overtime, while occurrences of morphologically dissimilar species increase post-invasion. The incidences of H. verticillata and three taxa of dominant natives were inspected across 87 sites in a reservoir in South Brazil before and after invasion by H. verticillata. The predictions were tested through co-occurrence metrics and logistic regression analyses. The logistic regression indicated that H. verticillata invaded sites independently of the occurrence of dominant natives, but it co-occurred more than expected by chance with the morphologically dissimilar native Characeae species, Nitella sp. and Chara cf. guairensis. On the other hand, Egeria spp. (morphologically similar to H. verticillata) occurrences were not correlated with the presence of H. verticillata. Moreover, the probability of occurrence of Characeae increased significantly overtime in sites invaded by H. verticillata. These results indicate that H. verticillata invaded sites independently of environmental suitability and likely facilitated more dissimilar taxa, such as Characeae, but there was no evidence that it influenced Egeria spp. occurrences. The patches of H. verticillata probably provide favorable habitats for the establishment of Characeae.","[Silveira, M. J.; Thomaz, S.

Climate change is predicted to have profound consequences for multispecies coexistence, and thus, patterns of biological diversity. These consequences will be mediated by direct and indirect impacts of environmental change on species' vital rates and interactions. While the impacts of environmental change on individual species has received much attention to date, the consequences for coexistence mediated by changes in the strength and direction of multispecies interactions are not as well understood. 2. To investigate how coexistence dynamics may be sensitive to environmental change, we conducted a field experiment in a diverse semi-arid annual plant system. We imposed a water manipulation treatment in two sites that vary in aridity and associated rainfall. Focusing on four common annual plant species in these sites, we quantified the fecundity (seed production) of individuals in response to a gradient of intra- and interspecific competitor densities and aridity. We then used these fecundities to parameterize an annual plant population model and examine the influence of aridity and species identity on resultant coexistence dynamics (as a function of stabilizing niche differences and fitness inequalities). 3. While the responses of some vital rates and competitive impacts to watering varied somewhat predictably across sites, coexistence metrics encapsulating changes in these vital rates and interaction strengths did not. Fitness inequalities among our focal species were driven largely by differences in sensitivity to competition, which were almost always much greater than the magnitude of stabilizing niche differences. These findings were surprising given observational evidence suggesting that these species do coexist at local scales in these natural communities. 4. Synthesis. Our study is one of the first to explicitly consider the influence of environmental variation on the individual components of coexistence outcomes. We show that environmental change has the ability to influence coexistence not only through direct pathways (i.e., vital rates), but also indirect pathways (i.e., species interactions). Despite the consistency of many of the responses of these individual components to environmental variation, their combined influence on predictions of both current and future coexistence remains unclear.","[Wainwright, Claire E.; Lai, Hao R.; Loy, Xingwen; Mayfield, Margaret M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ecol Ctr, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Wainwright, Claire E.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [HilleRisLambers, Janneke] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lai, Hao R.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore, Singapore; [Lai, Hao R.] Yale NUS Coll, Singapore, Singapore; [Loy, Xingwen] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Wainwright, CE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ecol Ctr, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.; Wainwright, CE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",cewain@uw.edu,"Mayfield, Margaret M/B-7386-2012","Mayfield, Margaret M/0000-0002-5101-6542; Wainwright, Claire/0000-0002-3248-5482",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP140100574],"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP140100574",,51,12,12,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Habitat segregation between two species might help reduce the effects of interspecific competition and apex predators are of special interest in this context, because their interactions can have consequences for lower trophic levels. However, habitat segregation between sympatric large carnivores has seldom been studied. Based on monitoring of 53 brown bears (Ursus arctos) and seven sympatric adult gray wolves (Canis lupus) equipped with GPS collars in Sweden, we analyzed the degree of interspecific segregation in habitat selection within their home ranges in both late winter and spring, when their diets overlap the most. We used the K-select method, a multivariate approach that relies on the concept of ecological niche, and randomization methods to quantify habitat segregation between bears and wolves. Habitat segregation between bears and wolves was greater than expected by chance. Wolves tended to select for moose occurrence, young forests, and rugged terrain more than bears, which likely reflects the different requirements of an omnivore (bear) and an obligate carnivore (wolf). However, both species generally avoided human-related habitats during daytime. Disentangling the mechanisms that can drive interspecific interactions at different spatial scales is essential for understanding how sympatric large carnivores occur and coexist in human-dominated landscapes, and how coexistence may affect lower trophic levels. The individual variation in habitat selection detected in our study may be a relevant mechanism to overcome intraguild competition and facilitate coexistence.","[Milleret, Cyril; Andreassen, Harry Peter; Wabakken, Petter; Zimmermann, Barbara] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, Koppang, Norway; [Milleret, Cyril; Ordiz, Andres; Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway; [Chapron, Guillaume; Mansson, Johan; Tallian, Aimee; Wikenros, Camilla; Sand, Hakan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Kindberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Umea, Sweden; [Kindberg, Jonas; Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, Norway; [Tallian, Aimee] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Tallian, Aimee] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Milleret, C (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, Koppang, Norway.",cyril.milleret@gmail.com,"Kindberg, Jonas/AAA-5058-2020; Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019; Milleret, Cyril/AAW-2388-2021; Zimmermann, Barbara/AAA-2631-2019","Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524; Zimmermann, Barbara/0000-0001-5133-9379; Tallian, Aimee/0000-0002-7182-7377; Andreassen, Harry P./0000-0003-3421-1327; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457; Milleret, Cyril/0000-0002-8563-981X",WWF (Sweden); Olle Engkvists Foundation; Carl Tryggers Foundation; Office of Environmental Affairs in Hedmark County; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Foundation; Kolmarden Foundation; Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk; Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF); Hedmark University College; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; Swedish Carnivore Association; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Signhild Engkvists Foundation,WWF (Sweden); Olle and Signhild Engkvists Foundations; Carl Tryggers Foundation; Office of Environmental Affairs in Hedmark County; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Foundation; Kolmarden Foundation; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research; Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Research Council; Swedish Research Council Formas; Austrian Science Fund; Hedmark University College; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; Swedish Carnivore Association,,104,10,11,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In Ontario, potentially eleven species of carrion beetles (Coleoptera: Silphidae) live together and require vertebrate carrion for reproduction. Their reliance on an ephemeral and uncommon resource that is unpredictable in space and time is thought to create intense intra- and interspecific competition. Evidence suggests that burying beetle species reduce competition by partitioning carrion for breeding across different habitats, temperatures, and seasons. Here, we test predictions of an alternative axis for partitioning carrion: vertical partitioning between the ground and forest canopy. We conducted a survey of carrion beetles from May to July 2016 at the Queen's University Biological Station across 50 randomly generated points using baited lethal traps at zero and six metres. Ground traps yielded more species and individuals compared to those in the canopy, and the number of individuals and species caught increased through the season in both trap types. Ground and canopy traps were accurately distinguished by the presence or absence of three species: ground traps contained more Nicrophorus orbicollis and Necrophila americana, while canopy traps contained more Nicrophorus pustulatus. We trapped 253 N. pustulatus in the canopy, but only 60 on the ground. N. pustulatus is thought to be rare across its geographic range, but our results suggest it is uniquely common in canopy habitats, demonstrating a vertical partitioning of habitat and resources. Our results are consistent with N. pustulatus having diverged into canopy habitats as a strategy to coexist with closely related sympatric species when competing for similar resources. We still, however, do not know the traits that allow N. pustulatus to flourish in the canopy, exactly how N. pustulatus uses canopy resources for breeding, or the factors that restrict the expansion of other burying beetles into this habitat.","[Wettlaufer, Jillian D.; Burke, Kevin W.; Schizkoske, Adam; Martin, Paul R.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Beresford, David, V] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON, Canada","Wettlaufer, JD (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON, Canada.",12jw73@queensu.ca,,"Burke, Kevin/0000-0001-5941-6412",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN/355519-2013]; Summer Work Experience Program at Queen's University,"This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada grant to Paul R.

Recent theory suggests that differences in individual variation across competitors can affect species coexistence and community patterns. However, the degree of individual variation is flexible across wild populations and we still know little about the ecological drivers of this variation across populations of single species and, especially, across coexisting species. Here, we aimed to (a) elucidate the major drivers of individual niche variation in natural communities and (b) to determine how consistent this variation is across coexisting species and communities. We analysed natural patterns of individual-level niche variation in four species of coexisting generalist frogs across a wide range of tropical communities. Specifically, we used gut contents and stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) from frog species and their prey to quantify individual niche specialization. Then, we combined data on local community structure, availability of prey, phylogenetic relationships and predator-prey size models to test how this variation is related to four ecological factors which are predicted to be key drivers of individual specialization: intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, ecological opportunity (i.e., diversity of resources) and predation. We found that the degree of individual trophic specialization varied by up to ninefold across populations within the same species. This sizable variation in trophic specialization across populations was at least partially explained by gradients of density of competitors (both conspecifics and heterospecifics) and intraguild predation. However, the specific relationships between individual specialization and these ecological gradients were strongly species-specific. As consequences, the identity of the species with more individual variation changed among sites and there was typically no spatial correlation in the degree of individual specialization across coexisting species. Our results show that individual niche specialization within and across species can be strongly context-dependent and that hierarchies of individual variation among coexisting species are not necessarily consistent across communities. Recent theory suggests that this pattern could lead to concurrent changes in competitive interactions across sites and thereby could play a key role in species coexistence at the landscape level. Our results suggest that individual variation across and within coexisting species has the potential to affect not only species coexistence at local communities, but also regional diversity patterns.","[Costa-Pereira, Raul; Araujo, Marcio S.] Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Inst Biociencias, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Costa-Pereira, Raul] UNESP, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Biodiversidade, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Costa-Pereira, Raul; Rudolf, Volker H.

However, differences in the phenologies of species naturally vary across years and are altered by ongoing climate change around the world. By combining experiments that shifted the relative hatching of two competing tadpole species across a productivity gradient with simulations of inter-annual variation in arrival times I tested how phenological variation across years can alter the strength and outcome of interspecific competition. Shifting the relative timing of hatching (phenology) of a species fundamentally altered interspecific competition, and the effect of shifting the timing on competition was highly non-linear for most demographic rates. Furthemore, this relationship varied with productivity of the system. As a consequence, (a) shifts in relative timing of phenologies had small or large effects depending on the average natural timing of interactions, and (b) changes in the inter-annual variation in onset of interaction alone can alter species interactions in simulations even when mean phenologies (timing) remain unchanged across years. Studies on phenologies traditionally focus on directional shifts in the mean of phenologies, but these results suggest that we also need to consider inter-annual variation in phenologies of interacting species to predict dynamics of natural communities and how they will be modified by climate change.","[Rudolf, Volker H.

Understanding the interspecific and intraspecific competition is critical to developing management tools for such mixed-species forests. Aims An individual-based distance-dependent modeling approach was used to model the growth of dbh and to evaluate neighborhood effects for four species groups in Mexican mixed- species stands. Methods Twenty-two species were classified into four groups: Pinus (seven species), other conifers (three species), other broadleaves (four species), and Quercus (eight species). Four methods were used to select neighboring trees and 12 competition indices (CIs) were calculated. Comparisons of the neighboring trees selection methods and CIs and tests of assumptions about neighborhood effects were conducted. Results Intra-species-group competition significantly reduced diameter growth for all species groups, except for the Quercus group. The Pinus, other conifers, and Quercus groups had significant and negative neighborhood effects on the other broadleaves species group, and not vice versa. The Quercus group also had negative neighborhood effect on the Pinus and other conifers species groups, and not vice versa. The Pinus and other conifers species groups had negative neighborhood effects on each other.

Theory suggests, however, that these same priority effects make it difficult for species to coexist in the region unless individuals are continuously supplied from an external species pool, often an unrealistic assumption. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary hypothesis to solve this conundrum. We build a metacommunity model in which local priority effects occur between two species via interspecific interference. Within each species there are two genotypes: one is more resistant to interspecific interference than the other but pays a fitness cost for its resistance. Because of this trade-off, species evolve to become less resistant as they become regionally more common. Rare species can then invade some local patches and consequently recover in regional frequency. This eco-evolutionary buffering enables the regional coexistence of species despite local priority effects, even in the absence of immigration from an external species pool. Our model predicts that eco-evolutionary buffering is particularly effective when local communities are small and connected by infrequent dispersal.","[Wittmann, Meike J.; Fukami, Tadashi] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wittmann, Meike J.] Univ Vienna, Fac Math, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Wittmann, Meike J.] Bielefeld Univ, Fac Biol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany","Wittmann, MJ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Wittmann, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Math, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.; Wittmann, MJ (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Fac Biol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",meike.wittmann@uni-bielefeld.de,"Fukami, Tadashi/A-2934-2010","Fukami, Tadashi/0000-0001-5654-4785","Stanford Center for Computational Evolutionary and Human Genomics (CEHG); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [M 1839-B29]; Stanford University's Terman Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1737758, DEB 1149600, DEB 1555786]","For discussion and comments, we thank members of the community ecology group at Stanford, particularly Luke Frishkoff, Po-Ju Ke, Devin Leopold, Erin Mordecai, and Rachel Vannette, as well as Angela Brandt, Joachim Hermisson, Kotaro Kagawa, Mike McLaren, Akira Mori, Pleuni Pennings, and Dmitri Petrov.

The main efforts to answer this question have sought to identify non-random features of ecological systems that can reverse a negative complexity -stability relationship into a positive one, but are far from successful, especially in their generality. Here, using the traditional community matrix analysis, we show that variation in the density dependence of interspecific interactions, which should be ubiquitous in nature, can dramatically affect the complexity-stability relationship. More specifically, we reveal that a positive complexity -stability relationship arises when harmful interspecific effects have larger density dependence than beneficial ones, regardless of the signs (i.e. positive or negative) of their dependence. Furthermore, numerical simulations demonstrated the synergistic stabilizing effect of interaction type diversity and density-dependence variation. Thus, this concept of density-dependence variation advances our understanding of the complexity-stability relationship in the real world.","[Kawatsu, Kazutaka; Kondoh, Michio] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, 6-3 Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan","Kawatsu, K (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, 6-3 Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",kazutakawatsu@gmail.com,"Kondoh, Michio/AAE-4332-2019; Kawtasu, Kazutaka/B-1066-2010","Kawtasu, Kazutaka/0000-0003-4447-4761","JST CREST, JapanCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) [JPMJCR13A2]; JSPS (the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI [16H04846, 16K18625, 15K14610]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","This work was supported by JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR13A2, Japan and JSPS (the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI grant numbers 16H04846 for both authors, 16K18625 for K.K. and 15K14610 for M.K.

Terrestrial, kingless salamanders (genus Plethodon) coexist in predictable assemblages of body size guilds, but little is known about the behavioral mechanisms that promote such coexistence. Here, we considered the hypothesis that Plethodon salamanders use climbing behavior to reduce competitive interactions, thereby promoting coexistence through spatial partitioning. To explore this hypothesis, we quantified the frequency of climbing behavior at field sites where small-bodied (P. cinereus) and large-bodied (P glutinosus) species are always present, but an intermediate-bodied species (P. montanus) is either absent, introduced, or native. We observed that climbing behavior varied among size guilds so that the smallest species climbed most frequently, followed by the intermediate, and then the large species. Further, we identified several correlates of climbing behavior that may be shaped by intraspecific and interspecific competition. Climbing frequency was positively correlated with intraspecific competition and negatively correlated with interspecific competition in the small species, unrelated to competition in the intermediate species, and positively correlated with interspecific competition in the large species. Our results suggest that Plethodon size guilds might differentially utilize climbing behavior to facilitate spatial partitioning in dense populations and communities. Further, we show how competition intensity can shape the behavior of cohabitating species, and ultimately provide insight into how behavioral plasticity and microhabitat partitioning can promote species coexistence.","[Mezebish, Tori D.] Univ Maryland, Dept Anim & Avian Sci, 8127 Regents Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Blackman, August] Oberlin Coll, Dept Biol, Sci Ctr K123,119 Woodland St, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA; [Novarro, Alexander J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, 1210 Biol Psychol Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Novarro, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, 1210 Biol Psychol Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",Anovarro1@gmail.com,,"Novarro, Alexander/0000-0003-1806-7273","National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduate program at Mountain Lake Biological Station (MLBS), University of Virginia [NSF DBI-1461169]; Explorers Club Exploration Fund","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduate program at Mountain Lake Biological Station (MLBS), University of Virginia (grant number NSF DBI-1461169) and The Explorers Club Exploration Fund.",,40,2,2,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Although several studies have already been developed for Demospongiae, knowledge of ecological interactions in the class Calcarea is lacking. Some calcareous sponges are considered weak competitors for space and to have developed strategies to survive in highly dynamic environments, such as exploitation of micro refuges and epibiosis. We aimed to investigate the influence of intra-and interspecific interactions in the abundance, growth and lifespan of the calcareous sponge Clathrina aurea in south-eastern Brazil. Two peaks of abundance and area coverage were observed during the studied year, probably associated with reproductive effort. We found no evidence of intra-or interspecific competition between the sponge and the benthic community. Clathrina aurea was found using parts of other organisms as substrate (epibiosis), such as algae, demosponges and corals. It was seen that the interaction of the sponge with coral polyps positively affects the lifespan of sponge individuals and the interstices of corals probably promote a micro refuge for C. aurea against competitors for space and predators.","[Ribeiro, Barbara; Padua, Andre; Paiva, Paulo Cesar; Klautau, Michelle] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Ave Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Custodio, Marcio Reis] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Fisiol, Rua Matao,Travessa 14,321, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Klautau, M (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Ave Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",mklautau@biologia.ufrj.br,"Custodio, Marcio Reis/B-4981-2008; Padua, Andre/AAD-7779-2019; Padua, Andre/O-8287-2018; Paiva, Paulo C/I-6174-2012; de Paiva, Paulo Cesar/N-1234-2019; Klautau, Michelle/I-2041-2012","Custodio, Marcio Reis/0000-0002-7075-0478; Padua, Andre/0000-0002-6284-7739; Padua, Andre/0000-0002-6284-7739; Paiva, Paulo C/0000-0003-1061-6549; de Paiva, Paulo Cesar/0000-0003-1061-6549; Klautau, Michelle/0000-0002-5959-0776; Ribeiro Gomes, Barbara/0000-0002-8163-8908","PADI Foundation [7981]; Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [13/04084-4]; Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [302459/2014-6, 476597/2013-7]",This study was supported by grants received from PADI Foundation (Grant number #7981) and the Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) (Grant 13/04084-4).

A tritrophic distributed maturation time model for the coffee plant - CBB - three parasitoids (Phymastichus coffea,Cephalonomiastephanoderis, Prorops nasuta) system was proposed by Gutierrez et al. (1998). Based on this pioneering work, and improved models for coffee and CBB (Rodriguez et al., 2011, 2013), we present an updated version of the parasitoid models. The new elements in this analysis include: 1. New data on the biology and behavior of the parasitoids are added. 2. A fourth parasitoid (Cephalonomia hyalinipennis) is added to the system. 3. Interspecific competitive interactions among parasitoids (e.g., dyadic contests, intra-guild predation and hyperparasitism) and their effects on the control of CBB are explored. Because field data on the effectiveness of the parasitoids on CBB control is sparse, we assessed the efficacy of the parasitoids for control of CBB heuristically. The results are compared to prior analyses, and are related to field observations. Specifically, we found: 1. Control of CBB by betilid parasitoids (Cephalonomia stephanoderis, Cephalonomia hyalinipennis and Prorops nasuta) is ineffective because of their low reproductive capacity relative to CBB, their host-feeding behavior, and phenological mismatches with CBB life stages. 2. Of the parasitoids, the eulophid P. coffea has the greatest potential to suppress CBB infestation levels, though the fungal pathogen B. bassiana and insecticides are reported to have detrimental effects on its establishment and dynamics.

Competitive interactions are an important determinant of foraging rates; however, the relationship between the exploitation and interference components of competition has received little empirical or theoretical consideration. Moreover, little is known about the relationship between aggressive behavioural interactions and interference competition. Using a natural gradient of consumer and resource densities, we empirically examine how aggressiveness relates to consumer-consumer encounter rates and foraging for four species of Chaetodon reef fish spanning a range of dietary niche breadths. The probability of aggression was most strongly associated with both total consumer and resource densities. In contrast, total encounter rates were best predicted by conspecific consumer density, and were highest for the most specialised consumer (Chaetodon trifascialis), not the most aggressive (Chaetodon baronessa). The most specialised consumer, not the most aggressive, also exhibited the largest reduction in foraging rates with increasing consumer density. Our results support the idea of a positive link between the exploitation and interference components of competition for the most specialised consumer. Moreover, our results caution against inferring the presence of ecological interactions (competition) from observations of behaviour (aggression and agonism) alone.","[Blowes, Shane A.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Blowes, Shane A.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Blowes, Shane A.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Blowes, SA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Blowes, SA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Blowes, SA (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",sablowes@gmail.com,"Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020","Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Blowes, Shane/0000-0001-6310-3670",James Cook University; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Queensland Smart State Ph.D. fellowship; JCU Ecological Modelling Research Group,"We thank James Cook University and the Australian Research Council for financial support; SAB was also supported by a Queensland Smart State Ph.D. fellowship.

Throughout the western Atlantic, invasive Indo-Pacific lionfishes (Pterois spp.) are likely to compete with native mesopredators such as the graysby Cephalopholis cruentata, an ecologically similar serranid. In conjunction with a before-after-control-impact lionfish removal experiment, this study measured whether graysby population size, diet, and condition varied in relation to cohabitant lionfish biomass. Lionfish, graysby, and prey populations were surveyed and sampled along a contiguous reef ledge in Biscayne National Park, south Florida. Mesopredator diet was measured with stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and gut content analyses, and isotopic niches were used to compare patterns of inter-and intraspecific resource use diversity. The isotopic niches of graysby and lionfishes overlapped by 67%, suggesting similar population-level resource use. On sites with higher lionfish biomass, graysby isotopic niche was 34% smaller and overlapped 47% less with that of lionfishes, possibly indicating both a narrower breadth of resource use and associated interspecific niche segregation. Although gut content analyses suggested that graysby may consume less fishes on high lionfish biomass sites, prey fish populations did not vary accordingly, potentially inferring interference by lionfishes on graysby foraging behavior. However, graysby condition was not related to lionfish biomass, so the 2 species ultimately did not fit the classic definition of competitors. By discussing potential influences of lionfishes on graysby resource use, our research contributes useful information to the study of how invasive lionfishes may affect native predator communities.","[Curtis, Joseph S.; Wall, Kara R.; Stallings, Christopher D.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33705 USA; [Albins, Mark A.] Univ S Alabama, Mobile, AL 36608 USA","Curtis, JS (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33705 USA.",jcurtis@mail.usf.edu,,"Stallings, Christopher/0000-0002-3410-4540",Florida Sea Grant [R/LR-B-66H]; Guy Harvey Scholarship; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1144244]; Von Rosenstiel Endowed Fellowship from the College of Marine Science at the University of South Florida,"Funding for this work was provided by Florida Sea Grant (Project # R/LR-B-66H and the Guy Harvey Scholarship), the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (Award # 1144244), and the Von Rosenstiel Endowed Fellowship from the College of Marine Science at the University of South Florida.

This is largely because an insufficient number of studies have been performed on any one species to draw robust conclusions. Fortunately, though, the amount of research on the nesting behaviors of nestbox-breeding blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major) has increased dramatically in recent years and their nesting behaviors are now sufficiently well-studied to offer useful insights into intraspecific variation in avian nesting behaviors. Studies show that individuals of both species select nest sites based on the presence and/or absence of conspecifics and heterospecifics and whilst neighbors were assumed to adversely affect focal individuals by competing for resources, they are now considered beneficial as they provide information about habitat quality and contribute to anti-predator defenses. Nest-building females accurately gauge local weather conditions and respond to predictable variation in environmental conditions by building nests with variable amounts of cup lining material to create suitable nest microclimates for nestlings. Meanwhile, both species vary the amount of aromatic plant materials in their nests in relation to the abundance of nest-dwelling parasites and pathogens and as aromatic plant materials also play a role in sexual selection then nest materials can have multiple functions. The height of nests is negatively correlated with the local risk of predation but whilst predator avoidance favors lower nests, sexual selection favors taller nests. In fact, higher quality females build taller nests that contain more green plant material which in turn influences the amount of care provided by males. This suggests there is considerable intraspecific variation in nesting behaviors in blue and great tits, and in birds generally, and highlights that birds are adept at adaptively varying their nesting behaviors in response to multiple factors. There is, however, a paucity of evidence directly linking such variation in nest building behaviors to reproductive success or fitness more broadly and so further studies could usefully examine such links because trade-offs between competing selection pressures may constrain adaptive nesting behaviors.","[Mainwaring, Mark C.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Univ Ctr, Lancaster, England","Mainwaring, MC (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Univ Ctr, Lancaster, England.",m.mainwaring@lancaster.ac.uk,,,British Ecological Society,"I would like to thank Ian Hartley, Charles Deeming, Jim Reynolds, Marcel Lambrechts, and Michal Gladalski for many useful discussions about the nest building behaviors of blue tits and great tits, the British Ecological Society for funding some of my research, and three reviewers for providing extremely useful comments that improved this review.",,274,12,12,0,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

A large group can be beneficial to detect predators, share predation risk among individuals and cause confusion for an attacking predator. However, forming large groups also has disadvantages like higher detection and attack rates of predators or interspecific competition. With the current recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) in Scandinavia, we studied whether moose (Alces alces) respond by changing grouping behaviour as an anti-predatory strategy and that this change should be related to the duration of wolf presence within the local moose population. In particular, as females with calves are most vulnerable to predation risk, they should be more likely to alter behaviour. Methods: To study grouping behaviour, we used aerial observations of moose (n = 1335, where each observation included one or several moose) inside and outside wolf territories. Results: Moose mostly stayed solitary or in small groups (82% of the observations consisted of less than three adult moose), and this behavior was independent of wolf presence. The results did not provide unequivocal support for our main hypothesis of an overall change in grouping behaviour in the moose population in response to wolf presence. Other variables such as moose density, snow depth and adult sex ratio of the group were overall more influential on grouping behaviour. However, the results showed a sex specific difference in social grouping in relation to wolf presence where males tended to form larger groups inside as compared to outside wolf territories. For male moose, population-and environmentally related variables were also important for the pattern of grouping. Conclusions: The results did not give support for that wolf recolonization has resulted in an overall change in moose grouping behaviour. If indeed wolf-induced effects do exist, they may be difficult to discern because the effects from moose population and environmental factors may be stronger than any change in anti-predator behaviour. Our results thereby suggest that caution should be taken as to generalize about the effects of returning predators on the grouping behaviour of their prey.","[Mansson, Johan; Nicholson, Kerry L.; Wikenros, Camilla; Sand, Hakan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Prima, Marie-Caroline] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, 1045 Av Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","Mansson, J (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",johan.mansson@slu.se,,"Mansson, Johan/0000-0002-5189-2091",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; World Wildlife Fund for Nature (Sweden); Olle Foundation; Carl Tryggers Foundation; Oscar and Lili Lamms Foundation; Swedish Carnivore Association; Signhild Engkvists Foundation; FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas,"This study was financed by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, FORMAS, Norwegian Environment Agency, Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management, World Wildlife Fund for Nature (Sweden), Olle and Signhild Engkvists Foundations, Carl Tryggers Foundation, Oscar and Lili Lamms Foundation, and Swedish Carnivore Association.",,74,6,6,1,53,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1742-9994,,,FRONT ZOOL,Front.

The level of attraction and oviposition by the native species was assessed in a dual-choice assay. The evaluation was based on sex and stage of ovarian development of L. eximia adults to a resource not colonized (NCR) or colonized (RPC) with eggs, different instars, or densities of C. albiceps. A significant difference in attraction was observed based on sex and stages of ovarian development. Males and nongravid females were more attracted to RPC, whereas gravid females preferred NCR. Moreover, males exhibited the lowest response in all assays among the three sex categories examined. In general, adults preferably oviposited on NCR rather than RPC. Also, between the eggs and second instar treatments, L. eximia laid more eggs on RPC with eggs than second instars (predatory stage). Lucilia eximia attraction to second-instar C. albiceps at different densities was marginally significant. Overall, results indicate the invasive species, C. albiceps, is impacting the behavior of the native blow fly, L. eximia, with regards to its attraction and colonization of vertebrate carrion, which could explain why native blow fly populations have significantly decreased since the introduction of C. albiceps.","[Spindola, Aline F.] Univ Fed Pelotas, UFPel, IB, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Capao Do Leao, RS, Brazil; [Zheng, Le; Tomberlin, Jeffery K.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Thyssen, Patricia J.] Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, IB, Dept Anim Biol, Campinas, SP, Brazil","Spindola, AF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pelotas, UFPel, IB, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Capao Do Leao, RS, Brazil.",aline.spin@gmail.com; lzheng.chn@gmail.com; jktomberlin@TAMU.edu; thyssenpj@yahoo.com.br,,,"Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CAPES (Programa de Pos-graduacao em Parasitologia, UFPel - Pelotas - RS)","A.F.S. conducted this research as partial fulfillment of Master degree requirements at Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel).

This understanding is especially important when considering species that play critical roles in forest regeneration. Small mammals influence Neotropical forest regeneration following disturbance through their actions as seed dispersers and seed predators. In Panama, the Central American spiny rat (Proechimys semispinosus) and the armored rat (Hoplomys gymnurus) persist sympatrically despite a similar diet and seasonal food resource limitation. To study the relationship between these species, we conducted behavioral arena trials to analyze interspecific and intraspecific interactions. Our goal was to determine whether behavioral dominance between H. gymnurus and P. semispinosus exists, potentially reducing the intensity of aggressive competition and allowing the two species to coexist sympatrically. Aggression data were analyzed using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showing that species pairing was a significant predictor of aggression, supporting the existence of behavioral dominance by P. semispinosus over H. gymnurus. Investigative behavior data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and showed a significantly higher level of investigative behavior for P. semispinosus towards H. gymnurus during the dry season when resources are scarce compared to the wet season when resources are plentiful.","[Dupre, S.

The use by species of different habitats along the pond permanency gradient has been already studied, noting conflicting selective pressures from predation and desiccation risk. Here, we aim to discover physiological patterns related with this gradient. As a study system, we used the full anuran community of the NE Iberian Peninsula. We quantified growth rate, consumption rate, food assimilation and the proportion of energy allocated to growth, as well as gut length, for all species. Food consumption rate and growth allocation were the variables that defined tadpole growth, while food assimilation abilities and gut length seem to have a secondary or cryptic role in growth. More interestingly however, our data suggests a labile continuum of consumption-based versus allocation/assimilation-based growth strategies differentiating species. Differences among species follow predictions of adaptation to the pond permanency gradient selective pressures. Species from ephemeral ponds are more prone to use consumption-related growth tactics while species inhabiting ponds with longer hydroperiods are more efficient retaining and allocating energy into growth, although results seem partly shaped by strong interspecific competition. Physiological differences in growth and the usage of the assimilated energy could be an additional factor to understand how tadpoles adapt to the features of ponds they inhabit, as well as how they compete and coexist.","[Pujol-Buxo, Eudald; Garriga, Nuria; Richter-Boix, Alex; Llorente, Gustavo A.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim, Barcelona, Spain; [Pujol-Buxo, Eudald; Garriga, Nuria; Richter-Boix, Alex; Llorente, Gustavo A.] Univ Barcelona, IRBio, Barcelona, Spain; [Richter-Boix, Alex] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden","Pujol-Buxo, E (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim, Barcelona, Spain.; Pujol-Buxo, E (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, IRBio, Barcelona, Spain.",epujolbuxo@ub.edu,"Richter-Boix, Alex/E-3990-2012","Richter-Boix, Alex/0000-0002-8559-5191; Pujol-Buxo, Eudald/0000-0002-8149-457X; Garriga, Nuria/0000-0002-9603-4592",FPU fellowship from the Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y DeporteGerman Research Foundation (DFG),"We would like to thank Marc Franch and Albert Montori for helping in collection of the clutches for this study, Guillem Pascual for his help in the lab work, and Antigoni Kaliontzopoulou, Olatz San Sebastian and Urtzi Enriquez for useful comments and help.

Invasive alien predators, for example, can significantly disrupt recipient communities by consuming prey species or acting as an intraguild predator (IGP). Behavioural interactions are key components of interspecific competition between predators, yet these are often overlooked invasion processes. Here, we show how behavioural, non-lethal IGP interactions might facilitate the establishment success of an invading alien species. We experimentally assessed changes in feeding behaviour (prey preference and consumption rate) of native UK coccinellid species (Adalia bipunctata and Coccinella septempunctata), whose populations are, respectively, declining and stable, when exposed to the invasive intraguild predator, Harmonia axyridis. Using a population dynamics model parameterized with these experimental data, we predicted how intraguild predation, accommodating interspecific behavioural interactions, might impact the abundance of the native and invasive alien species over time. When competing for the same aphid resource, the feeding rate of A.bipunctata significantly increased compared to the feeding in isolation, while the feeding rate of H.axyridis significantly decreased. This suggests that despite significant declines in the UK, A.bipunctata is a superior competitor to the intraguild predator H.axyridis. In contrast, the behaviour of non-declining C.septempunctata was unaltered by the presence of H.axyridis. Our experimental data show the differential behavioural plasticity of competing native and invasive alien predators, but do not explain A.bipunctata declines observed in the UK. Using behavioural plasticity as a parameter in a population dynamic model for A.bipunctata and H.axyridis, coexistence is predicted between the native and invasive alien following an initial period of decline in the native species. We demonstrate how empirical and theoretical techniques can be combined to understand better the processes and consequences of alien species invasions for native biodiversity.","[Hentley, William T.; Beckerman, Andrew P.; Brien, Melanie N.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Hentley, William T.; Brien, Melanie N.; Hails, Rosemary S.] CEH, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Hentley, William T.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [Hentley, William T.; Jones, T.

Many coexistence mechanisms have been proposed, but they all involve some form of ecological differentiation among the competing species. The aggregation model of coexistence would predict coexistence of identical species if there would be a mechanism that generates spatially aggregated distributions that are not completely correlated among the species. Our aim is to demonstrate that continued dispersal, triggered by reproductive interference between ecologically identical species, is such a mechanism. This study has been motivated by species using ephemeral patchy resources, such as decomposing fruits, fungal sporophores, carrion, and dung. We analyse an individual-based model with sexual reproduction, in which the progeny develops in ephemeral resource patches and the new generation disperses to a new set of patches. We assume spatially restricted dispersal, that patches differ in detectability, and that unmated females continue dispersal. In the model, reproductive interference (males spend some time searching for and/or attempting to mate with heterospecific females) reduces the mating rate of females, especially in the less common species, which leads to increased dispersal and reduces spatial correlation in species' distributions. For a wide range of parameter values, coexisting species show a systematic difference in their relative abundances due to two opposing forces: (1) uncommon species have reduced growth rate (Allee effect), which decreases abundance; (2) an abundance difference between the species reduces interspecific spatial correlation, which in turn reduces interspecific competition and allows the rarer species to persist at low density. Our results demonstrate a new mechanism for coexistence that is not based on ecological differentiation between species.","[Ruokolainen, Lasse; Hanski, Ilkka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Viikinkaari 1,POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Ruokolainen, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Viikinkaari 1,POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",lasse.ruokolainen@helsinki.fi,,"Ruokolainen, Lasse/0000-0003-0951-9100","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [255350, 250444, 13579]","We thank Peter Chesson, Tony Ives, Tanjona Ramiadantsoa, Helene Weigang and Da-Yong Zhang for comments on early versions of the manuscript.

Individuals that engage in interspecific aggression often suffer fitness consequences if the benefits of securing resources do not outweigh the risks associated with agonism. In the southern Appalachians, interspecific aggression frequently occurs between chestnut-sided warblers, Setophaga pensylvanica, and golden-winged warblers, Vermivora chrysoptera, a species that is experiencing sharp declines in population numbers. Using a combination of correlative and experimental approaches, we explored two potential explanations for interspecific aggression: interspecific competition and mistaken identity. It is commonly inferred that aggressive interactions are the product of competition due to an ecological niche overlap. However, because these warblers have similar crown coloration and aggressive interactions appear stochastic, aggression may be a result of mistaken identity. First, in 2014, we documented spatial overlap of the two species and measured reproductive success and habitat preference (using remote sensing) of golden-winged warblers. We found that golden-winged warblers that settled among high densities of chestnut-sided warblers were more aggressive, but chestnut-sided warbler density did not negatively influence their reproductive success; rather, habitat structure best predicted reproductive success. Next, in 2015, we tested for misidentification using models of conspecifics and heterospecifics in simulated territorial intrusions. We found that both warbler species were equally likely to both types of models, and that the most aggressive individuals were more likely to attack models. Our results suggest that, from the golden-winged warbler's perspective, sympatry is not detrimental and aggression is probably a function of mistaken identity. Yet, these behavioural interactions should be maladaptive, which may lead to the segregation of habitat types or divergence in crown morphology between species.

For 43 evergreen tree species (> 1 cm dbh) in a 20-ha seasonal tropical rainforest plot in Xishuangbanna, China, we compared the ability of drought-tolerance traits, other physiological traits, and commonly measured functional traits to predict the spatial patterns expected from the assembly processes of habitat associations, niche-overlap-based competition, and hierarchical competition. We distinguished the neighborhood--scale (0-20 m) patterns expected from competition from larger-scale habitat associations with a wavelet method. Species' drought tolerance and habitat variables related to soil water supply were strong drivers of habitat associations, and drought tolerance showed a significant spatial signal for influencing competition. Overall, the traits most strongly associated with habitat, as quantified using multivariate models, were leaf density, leaf turgor loss point (pi(tlp); also known as the leaf wilting point), and stem hydraulic conductivity (r(2) range for the best fit models = 0.27-0.36). At neighborhood scales, species spatial associations were positively correlated with similarity in pi(tlp), consistent with predictions for hierarchical competition. Although the correlation between pi(tlp) and interspecific spatial associations was weak (r(2) < 0.01), this showed a persistent influence of drought tolerance on neighborhood interactions and community assembly. Quantifying the full impact of traits on competitive interactions in forests may require incorporating plasticity among individuals within species, especially among specific life stages, and moving beyond individual traits to integrate the impact of multiple traits on whole-plant performance and resource demand.","[Bartlett, M.

Pleistocene terrestrial ecosystems included a much greater diversity of megaherbivores (e.g., mammoths, mastodons, giant ground sloths) and thus a greater potential for widespread habitat degradation if population sizes were not limited. Nevertheless, based on modern observations, it is generally believed that populations of megaherbivores (>800 kg) are largely immune to the effects of predation and this perception has been extended into the Pleistocene. However, as shown here, the species richness of big carnivores was greater in the Pleistocene and many of them were significantly larger than their modern counterparts. Fossil evidence suggests that interspecific competition among carnivores was relatively intense and reveals that some individuals specialized in consuming megaherbivores. To estimate the potential impact of Pleistocene large carnivores, we use both historic and modern data on predator-prey body mass relationships to predict size ranges of their typical and maximum prey when hunting as individuals and in groups. These prey size ranges are then compared with estimates of juvenile and subadult proboscidean body sizes derived from extant elephant growth data. Young proboscideans at their most vulnerable age fall within the predicted prey size ranges of many of the Pleistocene carnivores. Predation on juveniles can have a greater impact on megaherbivores because of their long interbirth intervals, and consequently, we argue that Pleistocene carnivores had the capacity to, and likely did, limit megaherbivore population sizes.","[Van Valkenburgh, Blaire] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hayward, Matthew W.] Bangor Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hayward, Matthew W.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Hayward, Matthew W.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Ripple, William J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Troph Cascades Program, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Meloro, Carlo] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Roth, V.

There is concern over potential dietary competition among them, particularly in winter when their forage resources are scarcer, but little is known about their dietary interactions. Aim We aimed to determine diet composition and dietary overlap of the three ungulate species, and to assess the extent of potential dietary competition among them in order to enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying their co-existence. We predicted that the three species would widen their choice of forages in winter (December) compared with summer (June-July), and that there would be diet segregation among them, particularly in winter when food resources were scarcer. Methods We collected fresh faecal samples of the three species and reference forage samples from the field during our transect line surveys in the summers of 2012 and 2013, and winter of 2012 in Arjin Shan National Nature Reserve (ANNR) of Xinjiang Province, China. Slides of faecal samples were prepared for microhistological analysis, and plant fragments in faecal samples were identified under microscope. Relative percentage frequency of diet plant species, diet breadth and dietary overlap were calculated. Key results The three species consumed similar forage plants, but varied greatly in their percentage use of the available forages. Wild yak mainly fed on sedges in summer and graminoids in winter, supplemented with forbs. Kiang consumed mainly forbs in summer and browse in winter, and chiru mainly fed on graminoids and forbs in summer. Wild yak had the widest choice of forages, and kiang had the narrowest one in summer, but both wild yak and kiang became less selective in their food choice in winter, resulting in higher diet breadth. The dietary overlaps among them, as represented by Pianka's index, were generally low, ranging from 0.26 between chiru and kiang to 0.51 between wild yak and kiang. The dietary overlap between wild yak and kiang decreased from summer (0.51) to winter (0.35), suggesting an increased dietary divergence. Key conclusion Our study reveals that the three species are opportunistic feeders', able to cope with coarse forage resources. There is dietary segregation among them as indicated by low dietary overlap, suggesting risk of potential competition for diets. We suggest that competition may have shaped their dietary divergence, contributing to their co-existence in ANNR. Implication Although there is dietary segregation among the three species in ANNR, it is not possible to make definitive conclusions about interspecific competition from these results. Further studies are needed to investigate if there is spatial and habitat segregation among them, which may facilitate their dietary divergence and thus contribute further to their co-existence in ANNR. Continued efforts are also needed to monitor their population dynamics and status of forage resources in order to prevent overgrazing.","[Shi, Jianbin; Li, Xiaowen; Su, Xukun; Dong, Shikui] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Lu, Feiying; Zhang, Zihui] Capital Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100066, Peoples R China; [Xu, Huadong; Zhang, Xiang] Adm Bur Arjin Shan Natl Nat Reserve, Kuerle 841000, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jianbin] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON, Canada","Shi, JB (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Shi, JB (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON, Canada.",jbshi@bnu.edu.cn,,,Environmental Protection Public Benefits Scientific Research Program [201209033]; Science and Technology Support Program [2012BAC01B02]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31572281]; China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council [201306045024],"This study was financially supported by grants from Environmental Protection Public Benefits Scientific Research Program (201209033), Science and Technology Support Program (2012BAC01B02) and Natural Science Foundation of China (31572281).

Inferences regarding natural selection on SFPs are based primarily on interspecific comparative studies, and our understanding of natural within-species variation in SFPs and whether this relates to reproductive phenotypes is very limited. Here, we introduce an empirical strategy to study intraspecific variation in and selection upon the seminal fluid proteome. We then apply this in a study of 15 distinct populations of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. Results: Phenotypic assays of these populations showed significant differences in reproductive phenotypes (male success in sperm competition and male ability to stimulate female fecundity). A quantitative proteomic study of replicated samples of male accessory glands revealed a large number of potential SFPs, of which >= 127 were found to be transferred to females at mating. Moreover, population divergence in relative SFP abundance across populations was large and remarkably multidimensional. Most importantly, variation in male SFP abundance across populations was associated with male sperm competition success and male ability to stimulate female egg production. Conclusions: Our study provides the first direct evidence for postmating sexual selection on standing intraspecific variation in SFP abundance and the pattern of divergence across populations in the seminal fluid proteome match the pattern predicted by the postmating sexual selection paradigm for SFP evolution. Our findings provide novel support for the hypothesis that sexual selection on SFPs is an important engine of incipient speciation.","[Goenaga, Julieta; Yamane, Takashi; Roenn, Johanna; Arnqvist, Goeran] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Anim Ecol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Goenaga, Julieta] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Arnqvist, G (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Anim Ecol, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",goran.arnqvist@ebc.uu.se,"Arnqvist, Goran/E-6782-2015; Goenaga, Julieta/O-4643-2016","Arnqvist, Goran/0000-0002-3501-3376; Goenaga, Julieta/0000-0002-2894-1166; Goenaga, Julieta/0000-0002-9822-5800",Wenner-Gren Foundation; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [GENCON AdG-294333]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [621-2010-5266];  [JSPS 233967],"We acknowledge the support from the proteomics platform at the Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) for providing assistance with the proteomic parts of this study, and in particular E.

The functional response of predators to prey density is a fundamental measure of interaction strength and its characterisation is essential to understanding these processes. We used mesocosm experiments to quantify the functional responses of five ground beetle species that represent common generalist predators of north-west European arable agriculture. We investigated two mechanisms predicted to be key drivers of trophic interactions in natural communities: predator:prey body size ratio and multiple predator effects. Our results show regularities in foraging patterns characteristic of similarly sized predators. Ground beetle attack rates increased and handling times decreased as the predator:prey body-mass ratio rose. Multiple predator effects on total prey consumption rates were sensitive to the identity of the interacting species but not prey density. The extent of interspecific interactions may be a result of differences in body mass between competing beetle species. Overall these results add to the growing evidence for the importance of size in determining trophic interactions and suggest that body mass could offer a focus on which to base the management of natural enemy assemblages.,"[Ball, S.

While carry-over effects are ubiquitous in animal and plant systems, their impact on species interactions and coexistence are largely ignored in traditional coexistence theory. Here we used a combination of modelling and experiments with two competing species to examine when and how such environmental carry-over effects influence community dynamics and competitive exclusions. We found that variation in the natal habitat quality of colonizing individuals created carry-over effects which altered competitive coefficients, fecundity and mortality rates, and extinction probabilities of both species. As a consequence, the dynamics of competitive exclusion within and across habitat types was contingent on the natal habitat of colonizing individuals, indicating that spatial carry-over effects can fundamentally alter the dynamics and outcome of interspecific competition. Interestingly, carry-over effects persistently influenced dynamics in systems with interspecific competition for the entire duration of the experiment while carry-over effects were transient and only influenced initial dynamics in single-species populations. Thus carry-over effects can be enhanced by species interactions, suggesting that their long-term effects may often not be accurately predicted by single-species studies. Given that carry-over effects are ubiquitous in heterogeneous landscapes, our results provide a novel mechanism that could help explain variation in the structure of natural communities.","[Van Allen, Benjamin G.; Rudolf, Volker H.

Temperature treatments were scenarios identified from down-scaled global circulation models. Growth rates (mm/d) for juveniles and adults were measured at low (1000 individuals [ind]/m(2)) and high (20,000 ind/m(2)) densities in intraspecific and interspecific interaction trials under the 2 temperature regimes. Juveniles of both species grew at similar rates regardless of temperature and density. On the other hand, adults had dissimilar growth rates among treatments. Under current temperatures, P. antipodarum adults grew significantly faster than A. angasi adults when both species were kept at high densities in the interspecific treatment (interspecific-high) and faster than when they were kept at high densities but with conspecifics in the intraspecific treatment (intraspecific-high). However, we did not detect intra-or interspecific competition effects on either species. Thus, our results suggest that under current conditions, P. antipodarum gained from foraging with A. angasi (unidirectional facilitation effect). Under 2100 temperatures, the facilitative effect of A. angasi on P. antipodarum growth was not apparent, a result suggesting that the facilitation was directly related to the temperature conditions. Our research shows the importance of considering future temperature conditions as a factor that could alter species interactions and potentially influence the ecological effects of invasive species.","[Sardina, Paula; Thompson, Ross M.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Sardina, Paula] Univ Nacl Sur INBIOSUR, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Beringer, Jason] Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Roche, Dylan] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic 3125, Australia; [Thompson, Ross M.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Sardina, P (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",psardina@gmail.com; jason.beringer@monash.edu; droch@deakin.edu.au; ross.thompson@canberra.edu.au,"Beringer, Jason/B-8528-2008","Beringer, Jason/0000-0002-4619-8361","Argentinean Government Postdoctoral Award (Beca Post-doctoral para Jovenes Investigadores, CONICET); ARCAustralian Research Council [FT110100957, FT110100602]; Australian Commonwealth Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility [NCCARF FW11-05]","PS was supported by an Argentinean Government Postdoctoral Award (Beca Post-doctoral para Jovenes Investigadores, CONICET).

In recent studies, habitat traits have emerged as stronger predictors of species occupancy, abundance, richness and diversity than competition. However, in many cases, it remains unclear whether habitat also mediates processes more subtle than competitive exclusion, such as growth, or whether intra- and interspecific interactions among individuals of different species may be better predictors of size. 2. To test whether habitat traits are a stronger predictor of abundance and body size than intra- and interspecific interactions, we measured the density and body size of three species of larval salamanders in 192 ponds across a landscape. 3. We found that the density of larvae was best predicted by models that included habitat features, while models incorporating interactions among individuals of different species best explained the body size of larvae. Additionally, we found a positive relationship between focal species density and congener density, while focal species body size was negatively related to congener density. 4. We posit that salamander larvae may not experience competitive exclusion and thus reduced densities, but instead compensate for increased competition behaviourally (e.g. reduced foraging), resulting in decreased growth. The discrepancy between larval density and body size, a strong predictor of fitness in this system, also highlights a potential shortcoming in using density or abundance as a metric of habitat quality or population health.","[Ousterhout, Brittany H.; Anderson, Thomas L.; Drake, Dana L.; Peterman, William E.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Peterman, William E.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Ousterhout, BH (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 110 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",BOusterhout@gmail.com,"Peterman, William/H-7809-2013","Peterman, William/0000-0001-5229-9268; Ousterhout, Brittany/0000-0001-5303-515X",NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Life Sciences Fellowship; Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [SERDP RC-2155],"We thank J.

We constructed individual-based spatially explicit simulation models of two mixed conifer-angiosperm forests, growing on soils of contrasting phosphorus (P) availability, to investigate how browsing by invasive red deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) and granivory by invasive rodents (primarily house mouse Mus musculus) might alter forest dynamics. Models were parameterized with field data. Seedling growth and survival rates were estimated inside and outside deer exclosures. Seed predation rates were estimated at high and low rodent densities in mast and non-mast seeding years. For the alluvial terrace forest, which grew on P-rich soil, our model contained 15 tree species dominated by angiosperms; our model of the P-poor marine terrace forest contained seven species dominated by conifers. The two forest models were used to explore four 500-year scenarios: deer and rodents present, deer present and rodents absent, deer absent and rodents present, and deer and rodents absent. Our field studies revealed that the highest probabilities of seed predation by rodents occurred for two canopy species in mast years and in neighborhoods of high species-specific basal area, and that deer browsing had the greatest negative effects on the growth and survival rates of angiosperm seedlings. Our simulation models predicted that the presence of deer and rodents would reduce the abundances of canopy codominants, and hence total basal area, in the alluvial terrace forest. The presence of deer increased the dominance of conifers in both forests, but effects of deer and rodents were much stronger in the alluvial terrace forest. Our study revealed two emergent properties. First, rodent- and deer-induced reductions in seedling abundances did not always translate into reduced sapling and adult tree abundances. Second, when deer changed the abundance of a canopy dominant, other species were affected by altered interspecific competition. We conclude that the effects of invasive deer and rodents will be greatest in forests growing on P-rich soils. Exclusion of deer is predicted to have greater long-term effects on forest dynamics than exclusion of rodents.","[Forsyth, David M.; Gormley, Andrew M.] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm & Primary Ind, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; [Wilson, Deborah J.] Landcare Res, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Easdale, Tomas A.; Ruscoe, Wendy A.; Gormley, Andrew M.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Kunstler, Georges] Irstea, UR Ecosyst Montagnards, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Canham, Charles D.; Murphy, Lora] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Ruscoe, Wendy A.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Wright, Elaine F.] Dept Conservat, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Gaxiola, Aurora; Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Gaxiola, Aurora] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago, Chile","Forsyth, DM (corresponding author), Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm & Primary Ind, 123 Brown St, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia.",dave.forsyth@depi.vic.gov.au,"Ruscoe, Wendy A./A-5273-2018; Canham, Charles D/F-6161-2011; Wilson, Deborah J/B-8651-2008; Kunstler, Georges/F-9179-2012","Ruscoe, Wendy A./0000-0002-7763-0356; Canham, Charles D/0000-0001-8361-9148; Kunstler, Georges/0000-0002-2544-1940; Wilson, Deborah/0000-0002-6401-3092; Gormley, Andrew/0000-0001-9833-7012; Easdale, Tomas/0000-0001-5086-8527; Coomes, David/0000-0002-8261-2582",New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation via Ecosystem Resilience Outcome-Based Investment [C09X0502]; New Zealand Department of Conservation; Natural Environmental Research Council (UK)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; University of CambridgeUniversity of Cambridge,"This research was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation via Ecosystem Resilience Outcome-Based Investment (Contract C09X0502), investment of Landcare Research's retained earnings, the New Zealand Department of Conservation, the Natural Environmental Research Council (UK), the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, and University of Cambridge.

Many effective stabilizing mechanisms address one issue or the other, and many turn upon additional features. Using an explicitly demographic approach, I show that indirect, demography-mediated interactions between mutualists and exploiters can enable mutualist-exploiter coexistence, which in turn can stabilize the abundances of mutualists, exploiters, and their shared resources. This occurs because of the distinct resource demographic responses that are inherent to interaction with mutualistic and exploitative partners and can occur in long-lasting, exclusive interactions, such as protection mutualisms, as well as in apparently very different, short-lived mutualistic interactions, such as pollination. The key necessary factor-demographic response to interspecific interaction-is common in nature. Some demographic structure is also necessary and is generated through interspecific interaction in long-lasting associations; it is also very common in natural populations. Thus, the explicitly demographic and multispecies approach taken here constitutes a potentially promising single explanation for the apparent stability ofmutualismin a wide range of natural systems.","Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Lee, CT (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",charlotte.t.lee@duke.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1257882]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1257882] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,I am grateful to A.

It has been shown that the reproductive success of birds of prey is closely related to food availability. However, relatively little is known about intraspecific differences in reproductive success of birds in relation to varying ecological conditions across environmental gradients. We investigated the reproductive performance of Tengmalm's Owls Aegolius funereus in a temperate (Czech Republic, 50 degrees N) and a boreal (Finland, 63 degrees N) population in relation to long-term variations in the abundance of their main prey (small rodents). Prey densities at the northern site were much higher, but there were also large inter-annual fluctuations and years with steep summer declines of vole densities. Northern owls laid larger clutches but offspring production per nest was similar at both study sites. This resulted from higher nestling mortality in the northern population, especially in nests established later in the season. Despite much greater nesting losses due to predation by Pine Martens Martes martes, productivity at the population level was about four times greater at the temperate site, mainly due to the much higher breeding densities compared with Finland. Tengmalm's Owls at the temperate study site may benefit from relatively stable prey abundance, a more diverse prey community that offers alternative prey during vole scarcity, longer nights in summer that allow more time for foraging, and a lower level of interspecific competition with other vole-specialized predators.","[Zarybnicka, Marketa; Stastny, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, CZ-16521 Prague, Czech Republic; [Sedlacek, Ondrej] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Salo, Palvi; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Sedlacek, O (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Vinicna 7, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic.",zbrd@email.cz,"ZArybnickA, MarkA©ta/AAM-3181-2020; Sedlacek, Ondrej/A-1667-2009","Zarybnicka, Marketa/0000-0001-5883-0988","Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [CIGA 20144203]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [FRVS 41110-1161-1625]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [138638, 123379, 136717, 250709]","We are grateful to V.

Previous studies have suggested that the reason for the fragmented distribution pattern of E. depressa is competitive displacement by the sympatric C. stellatus, following random settlement. This hypothesis is in agreement with the common model of zonation suggested by Connell that lower distribution limits are determined by biotic factors (competition and predation), while upper limits are set by physical factors. It is hard to test the validity of this model for this barnacle pair since the early ontogenetic stages of the species are morphologically indistinguishable, hindering our ability to understand distribution processes. Using 16S mtDNA as a genetic marker in a multiplex PCR system, cyprids and spats were individually identified. Settlement and recruitment rates were assessed using settlement plates, and the effect of post-settlement processes was tested with transplantation of settlers between zones. Results showed different strategies in each species: settlement of E. depressa was habitat-specific, while settlement of C. stellatus was random. Shifting individuals of C stellatus to the high and cryptic zones resulted in high mortality; however, exposing juveniles of E. depressa that settled in artificially cryptic low shore habitat to C stellatus presence had no effect on their survival. These finding do not agree with the formerly suggested hypothesis that zonation is mainly determined by post-settlement factors, and that the interspecies boundary is determined by interspecific competition, implying that competition model cannot be adapted to Mediterranean intertidal zonation and that other models, dominated by physical enforcement and pre-settlement recruitment-limiting factors, may prevail in this ecosystem.

Some evidence indicates that invasive plant species might benefit from climate change via these features. However, apart from theory-based predictions, knowledge of the tolerance of invasive species to short-term climatic stress is very limited. We investigated whether three naturalized alien plant species in central Europe, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Hieracium aurantiacum and Lysimachia punctata perform better under stressful conditions than comparable native species. A greenhouse experiment with a fixed stress sequence of frost, drought and water logging was setup. We applied this stress treatment to two life history stages (seedling and adult plants), plants grown in monoculture (mild intraspecific competition) and in a highly competitive setting with intra- and interspecific competition. Whilst small differences in plant responses were detected the alien species overall were not more tolerant to stress. The responses of alien and native congeners/confamilials to stress in all treatments (monoculture, competition, adult, seedling) were similar, which indicates that stress thresholds are phylogenetically conserved. All species were more vulnerable to stress at the seedling stage and when subject to competition. Our data indicates that results obtained from experiments using only monocultures and one development stage are not appropriate for drawing generalizations about lethal thresholds. Moreover, rather abrupt species-specific thresholds exist, which indicates that a prediction of species responses based on just two stress levels, as is the case in most studies, is not sufficient.","[Laube, Julia; Ziegler, Kathrin; Sparks, Tim H.; Estrella, Nicole; Menzel, Annette] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Ecoclimatol, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Laube, Julia; Sparks, Tim H.; Estrella, Nicole; Menzel, Annette] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Sparks, Tim H.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Sparks, Tim H.] Coventry Univ, Sigma, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England","Laube, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Ecoclimatol, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",julia.laube@wzw.tum.de; kathrin.ziegler.msc@gmx.de; thsparks@btopenworld.com; estrella@wzw.tum.de; amenzel@wzw.tum.de,"; Menzel, Annette/B-1105-2013","Estrella, Nicole/0000-0002-1028-0048; Sparks, Tim/0000-0003-4382-7051; Menzel, Annette/0000-0002-7175-2512","Technische Universitat Munchen - Institute for Advanced Study - German Excellence Initiative; European Research Council, under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [282250]","We thank Petra Scheuerer, Udo Ehlers, Ivonne Juttner, F.

By relying on deception, these adaptations increase the chances of avoiding physical contact that may otherwise have very high fitness costs. One such deceptive behaviour is the popularly-known neck flattening, or hooding, observed in some snakes. Hooding consists in the lateral expansion and dorso-ventral flattening of the neck, which creates the impression of a bigger opponent during confrontations. This trait is highly characteristic of cobras (Elapidae family). However, neck flattening is not exclusive to elapids, and has in fact been observed in a few other snake lineages, including some species of the families Lamprophiidae and Colubridae. Here, we present the first report of hooding behaviour in the South American colubrid genus Philodryas, based on field observations conducted on the Chilean species P. chamissonis (the long-tailed snake). Our report adds to the few cases in which this deceptive behaviour has been observed in snakes outside the cobra family.","[Jara, Manuel; Pincheira-Donoso, Daniel] Lincoln Univ, Joseph Banks Labs, Sch Life Sci, Lab Evolutionary Ecol Adaptat, Lincoln LN6 7DL, Lincs, England","Pincheira-Donoso, D (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Joseph Banks Labs, Sch Life Sci, Lab Evolutionary Ecol Adaptat, Brayford Campus, Lincoln LN6 7DL, Lincs, England.",DPincheiraDonoso@lincoln.ac.uk,,,University of Lincoln,"We thank Harvey Lillywhite, Coleman Sheehy and Bruce Young for their advice.

Some earlier studies have shown or suggested that it may restrictively affect subordinate species (including direct predation toward them) even stronger than wood ants do. In the present study we compared species compositions and nest densities of subordinate ant species within and outside territories of L. filiginosus. The results obtained confirmed that this species visibly impoverishes both qualitatively (reduced species richness, altered dominance structures) and quantitatively (decreased nest densities) ant assemblages within its territories. Furthermore, contrary to what is known in wood ants, there was not detected any noticeable protective effect of L. filliginosus for Formica fusca living within the L. fuliginosus territory against raids of the slave-maker Formica sanguinca.

Thus, similar-sized carnivores are likely to compete for food. We compared the summer diets of snow leopards Panthera uncia and wolves Canis lupus in Sarychat-Ertash Reserve in the Tien-Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan, based on analysis of genetically confirmed scats. Abundances of the principal prey species, argali Ovis ammon and Siberian ibex Capra sibirica, were estimated from field surveys. The diets consisted of few species, with high interspecific overlap (Pianka's index = 0.91). Argali was the predominant prey, with > 50% frequency of occurrence in both snow leopard and wolf scats. This was followed by Siberian ibex and marmots Marmota baibacina. Being largely unavailable, remains of livestock were not detected in any of the scats. In the snow leopard diet, proportions of argali and ibex were in line with the relative availabilities of these animals in the Reserve. This was in contrast to the diet of wolf, where argali occurred according to availability and ibex was significantly underrepresented. The high diet overlap indicates that the two predators might compete for food when the diversity of profitable, large prey is low. Competition may be more intense in winter, when marmots are not available. Hunting of argali and ibex outside the Reserve may be unsustainable and therefore reduce their abundances over time. This will affect both predators negatively and intensify competition for food. Reduction in ibex populations will directly affect the snow leopard, and the wolf is likely to be indirectly affected as a result of increased snow leopard predation of argali.","[Jumabay-Uulu, Kubanychbek] Snow Leopard Fdn Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Wegge, Per] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Mishra, Charudutt; Sharma, Koustubh] Snow Leopard Trust, Mysore, Karnataka, India; [Mishra, Charudutt; Sharma, Koustubh] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore, Karnataka, India","Wegge, P (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway.",per.wegge@umb.no,,,Panthera; Snow Leopard Trust,"The study was funded by Panthera and the Snow Leopard Trust.

Different ecological mechanisms occur individually in an overlapping manner, so the structure of each local community is influenced by an independent mixture of these factors. To identify which of these factors prevails in organizing the species-rich tree community from 100 plots of 10 x 10 m in a primary forest patch (the Forest of Seu Nico - FSN, from the Atlantic Forest domain), we analyzed species-environment correlations via canonical correspondence analysis and identified two different pedo-environments. We analyzed the community's phylogenetic structure using Phylocom 4.2 software to calculate the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI). Furthermore, we partitioned the total phylogenetic diversity into independent alpha and beta components (I (ST)). To reveal the overlap of ecological mechanisms such as neutrality, environmental filtering and density-dependent factors, we analyzed the phylogenetic structure in both pedo-environments. The species-environment correlations observed in the FSN are weak in comparison with those found in other studies, although the permanent plot presents a short environmental gradient, dividing the plot into an upper, more acidic hillside and a lower, more fertile bottom. The overall phylogenetic structure of the FSN community shows strong and significant phylogenetic overdispersion. This overdispersion indicates that density-dependent factors, such as interspecific competition, play an important role in maintaining the species richness and community structure in megadiverse ecosystems such as the FSN when we assume traits to be conserved within evolutionary lineages. The NRI and NTI are correlated positively with the soil pH and negatively with the soil's aluminum concentration, so the bottom plots show higher phylogenetic overdispersion and lower I (ST) values than the hillside plots. This pattern can be explained by the greater importance of environmental filters in more acidic soils that form less favorable habitats, while the influence of competition and therefore also the rate of competitive exclusion are higher in the more favorable, less acidic plots.","[Gastauer, Markus; Alves Meira-Neto, Joao Augusto] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Plant Biol, Plant Ecol Lab, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Gastauer, Markus; Alves Meira-Neto, Joao Augusto] Ctr Environm Sci Floresta Escola, BR-38200000 Frutal, MG, Brazil","Meira-Neto, JA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Plant Biol, Plant Ecol Lab, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",j.meira@ufv.br,"Neto, Joao Augusto Alves Meira/H-8197-2012","Neto, Joao Augusto Alves Meira/0000-0001-5953-3942",Suzano Pulp and Paper; FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Floresta Escola Project; MCTI; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"We are grateful to Suzano Pulp and Paper for a Ph.D. scholarship for one of the authors (MG) to carry out the presented research.

If niche overlap between the species is substantial, the intrinsic faster population growth of the unisexual over sexual species can cause competitive exclusion of the host from resources, causing the demise of the unisexual species. However, theoretical models predict that coexistence is possible, even without niche differentiation, if the unisexual species is a poorer competitor than the sexual host and if the effect of the unisexual species on the exploitative abilities of the sexual species is smaller than the effect that the sexually reproducing individuals have among themselves. We tested these predictions in the unisexual-bisexual mating complex of Poecilia formosa, and one of its sexual hosts, P. latipinna. Fishes were housed from parturition for 76 days with both conspecific and heterospecific individuals under both limited and ad libitum food regimes. Only one of the predictions of the models was met: the effects of intraspecific competition for P. latipinna were stronger than the effects of interspecific competition. Poecilia latipinna raised with conspecifics with limited food stored fewer fats than both heterospecific P. formosa, and conspecifics raised in any other treatment.","[da Barbiano, Laura Alberici; Robinson, Reginald J.; Aspbury, Andrea S.; Gabor, Caitlin R.] Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Tobler, Michael] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","da Barbiano, LA (corresponding author), Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",la1122@txstate.edu,"Gabor, Caitlin/AAK-8369-2020",,"IACUC [01-050-135, NSF-IOS-1021873]","We thank the state of Texas for collection permit # SPR-0604-389, and Chris Nice, Mariana Mateos and Darrin Hulsey for comments.

One of these processes is interspecific killing, the most extreme form of interference competition among carnivores. Subdominant species can avoid falling victim to other carnivores through spatial and/or temporal separation. The smallest carnivore species, including members of the Mustelidae, are typically the most threatened by other predators but are also exceedingly challenging to study in the wild. As a consequence, we have only limited knowledge of how the most at-risk members of carnivore communities deal with being both hunters and hunted. We explored whether activity and space use of a little-known small carnivore, the Altai mountain weasel Mustela altaica, reflect the activity and distribution of its main prey, pika Ochotona sp., and two sympatric predators, the stone marten Martes foina and the red fox Vulpes vulpes. Spatial and temporal patterns of photographic captures in Pakistan's northern mountains suggest that weasels may cope with being both predator and prey by frequenting areas used by pikas while exhibiting diurnal activity that contrasts with that of the mostly nocturnal/crepuscular stone marten and red fox. Camera trap studies are now common and are staged in many different ecosystems. The data yielded offer an opportunity not only to fill knowledge gaps concerning less-studied species but also to non-invasively test ecological hypotheses linked with rarity and elusiveness.","[Bischof, R.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway; [Ali, H.; Kabir, M.; Hameed, S.; Nawaz, M.

The main factors that are thought to influence population size are either resources (bottom-up), or predation (top-down), or interspecific competition (parallel). However, there are highly variable and often contradictory results regarding their relative strengths and influence. These varied results are often interpreted as indicating shifting control among the three main factors, or a complex, nonlinear relationship among environmental variables, resource availability, predation, and competition. We argue here that there is a missing link in our understanding of predator-prey dynamics. We explore whether the landscape-of-fear model can help us clarify the inconsistencies and increase our understanding of the roles, extent, and possible interactions of top-down, bottom-up, and parallel factors on prey population abundance. We propose two main predictions derived from the landscape-of-fear model: (1) for a single species, we suggest that as the makeup of the landscape of fear changes from relatively safe to relatively risky, bottom-up impacts switch from strong to weak as top-down impacts go from weak to strong; (2) for two or more species, interspecific competitive interactions produce various combinations of bottom-up, top-down, and parallel impacts depending on the dominant competing species and whether the landscapes of fear are shared or distinctive among competing species. We contend that these predictions could successfully explain many of the complex and contradictory results of current research. We test some of these predictions based on long-term data for small mammals from the Chihuahuan Desert in the United States. and Mexico. We conclude that the landscape-of-fear model does provide reasonable explanations for many of the reported studies and should be tested further to better understand the effects of bottom-up, top-down, and parallel factors on population dynamics.","[Laundre, John W.; Hernandez, Lucina; Lopez-Portillo, Jorge; Gonzalez-Romero, Alberto; Grajales-Tam, Karina M.] Inst Ecol, AC, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Laundre, John W.; Hernandez, Lucina; Gronemeyer, Peg] New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Laundre, John W.; Hernandez, Lucina] SUNY Coll Oswego, Oswego, NY 13126 USA; [Lopez Medina, Perla] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Queretaro 76010, Qro, Mexico; [Campanella, Andrea] New Mexico State Univ, Jornada Basin LTER USDA ARS, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Browning, Dawn M.] USDA ARS Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Laundre, JW (corresponding author), Inst Ecol, AC, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",launjohn@hotmail.com,"Portillo, Jorge Lopez/L-2492-2014; Gonzalez-Romero, Alberto/Q-6701-2018; Grajales-Tam, Karina Magdalena/Q-6828-2018","Portillo, Jorge Lopez/0000-0002-6827-3297; Gonzalez-Romero, Alberto/0000-0001-5800-1223; Grajales-Tam, Karina Magdalena/0000-0002-8880-3275; Browning, Dawn M./0000-0002-1252-6013",CONACyT of MexicoConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [1843P-N9507]; Earthwatch Institute; INECOL [902-16]; SEMAR-NAT of Mexico; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0004526]; New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Center; TE Inc.; American Society of Mammalogists; Ecological Society of America; ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service [ARS-0423561] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER,"This work was conducted in conjunction with the Mapimi Long-Term Exclusion Experiment (MLTER) coordinated by L.

This paper reviews the literature documenting interactions between introduced and native bird species. Surprisingly, we found only ten cases of an introduced bird being involved in a process that threatened a population of a native bird with extinction and conclude there is little evidence that introduced birds are a major threat to avian diversity globally. The conservation priorities for managing interactions between introduced and native birds are: (1) strong, precautionary biosecurity policies and practices to discourage future introductions; (2) gaining knowledge about interspecific interactions; (3) managing threats where they affect the persistence or recovery of threatened and endemic island bird species; (4) managing the threat of hybridisation and (5) best practice, cost-effective management that defines threatening processes to avian diversity and uses adaptive management for threat abatement. Our review highlights the lack of evidence for detrimental effects of introduced birds on native avifauna and highlights the need for future work in this area.","[Baker, Jack; Harvey, Kerinne J.; French, Kris] Univ Wollongong, Inst Conservat Biol & Environm Management, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia","Baker, J (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Inst Conservat Biol & Environm Management, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",jbaker@uow.edu.au,"French, Kris/I-8202-2012","French, Kris/0000-0001-6938-2017",,,,114,35,40,3,128,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AUSTRALIA,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 2, 11 QUEENS RD, MELBOURNE, VIC 3004, AUSTRALIA",0158-4197,1448-5540,,EMU,Emu,,2014,114,1,,,,,1,12,,10.1071/MU12122,,,12,Ornithology,Zoology,AI0FK,WOS:000336521400001,,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

It is hypothesized that increased competition should reduce niche breadth. However, there are scarce field tests on this hypothesis. Here, we test this central hypothesis in ecology by using the Atlas day gecko Quedenfeldtia trachyblepharus. This alpine gecko faces fewer competitors as altitude increases, and thereby, we predict that this species should increase niche breadth and relevant fitness parameters with altitude. We tested this prediction by analysing the isotopic signature of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15). Our results reveal that specimens from higher altitudes showed higher values for both carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes, had better body condition and a greater isotopic breadth when compared to specimens from lower altitudes. Altitudinal variation in carbon values was not explained by variation in isotopic concentration in the baseline of the trophic chain. Therefore, our findings support the prediction that relaxed interspecific competition favours increased trophic niche breadth. These results also suggest that global warming may represent an important threat for this species, as it may provoke the ascent in altitude of competitors, with negative consequences for the conservation of this endemism.","[Comas, Mar] Univ Barcelona, Fac Pharm, Lab Parasitol, Barcelona 08028, Catalonia, Spain; [Comas, Mar; Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Zool, Granada 18071, Spain; [Escoriza, Daniel] Univ Girona, Fac Sci, Inst Aquat Ecol, Girona 17071, Spain; [Escoriza, Daniel] Univ Girona, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Girona 17071, Spain","Comas, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Pharm, Lab Parasitol, Avda Diagonal S-N, Barcelona 08028, Catalonia, Spain.",marcomas@correo.ugr.es,"Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio/K-7068-2014; Comas, Mar/Q-7829-2019; Escoriza, Daniel/AAP-9813-2021; Comas, Mar/H-6350-2018","Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio/0000-0002-6726-7215; Escoriza, Daniel/0000-0002-6853-0134; Comas, Mar/0000-0002-2760-9321",,,,58,14,15,1,35,"ELSEVIER GMBH, URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG",JENA,"OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, 07705 JENA, GERMANY",1439-1791,1618-0089,,BASIC APPL ECOL,Basic Appl.

To explore the potential for trophic competition between the widespread Eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki and its co-occurring native toothcarp Valencia letourneuxi we compared resource use, feeding strategies, trophic selectivities and diet niche overlap. For this purpose, we studied two populations of the two species from a freshwater and a brackish habitat respectively, characterized by different food resource availabilities. In both habitats, the mosquitofish consumed a greater diversity of invertebrates and preyed on terrestrial invertebrates more frequently than the native toothcarp. Furthermore, in the less diverse and less rich brackish habitat, the non native relied heavily on plant material to balance a decrease in animal prey consumption and modified its individual feeding strategy, whereas these adaptive changes were not apparent in the native species. Their diet overlapped, indicating trophic competition, but this overlap was affected by resource availability variation; in the freshwater habitat, there was limited overlap in their diet, whereas in the brackish habitat, their diets and prey selectivities converged and there was high overlap in resource use, which is indicative of intense interspecific trophic competition. Overall, it appears that the underlying mechanism of the putative negative impacts of the mosquitofish on the declining Corfu toothcarp is mainly trophic competition, regulated by resource variability, though there is also evidence of larvae predation by the mosquitofish.","[Kalogianni, E.; Giakoumi, S.; Andriopoulou, A.; Chatzinikolaou, Y.] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Anavissos, Greece","Kalogianni, E (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, POB 712, Anavissos, Greece.",ekalog@hcmr.gr,"Chatzinikolaou, Yorgos/K-2593-2015",,,,,69,9,9,0,24,NATL CENTRE MARINE RESEARCH,HELLINIKON,"AGHIOS KOSMAS, HELLINIKON, GR-16-604, GREECE",1108-393X,,,MEDITERR MAR SCI,Mediterr.

Competition is often conceptualized as being exploitative (indirect) or involving direct interference. However, most empirical studies are phenomenological, focusing on quantifying effects of density manipulations, and most competition theory has characterized exploitation competition systems. The effects on resource use of traits associated with direct, interference competition has received far less attention. Here we examine the relationships of dietary ecology and phylogeny to heterospecific aggression in a guild of corallivorous reef fishes. We find that, among chaetodontids (butterflyfishes), heterospecific aggression depends on a synergistic interaction of dietary overlap and specialization: aggression increases with dietary overlap for interactions between specialists but not for interactions involving generalists. Moreover, behavioral dominance is a monotonically increasing function of dietary specialization. The strong, positive relationship of dominance to specialization suggests that heterospecific aggression may contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity where it promotes resource partitioning. Additionally, we find strong phylogenetic signals in dietary overlap and specialization but not behavioral dominance. Our results support the use of phylogeny as a proxy for ecological similarity among butterflyfishes, but we find that direct measures of dietary overlap and specialization predict heterospecific agression much better than phylogeny.","[Blowes, Shane A.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Blowes, Shane A.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Blowes, SA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",shane.blowes@my.jcu.edu.au,"Connolly, Sean R./E-7773-2011; Pratchett, Morgan S/A-9256-2010; Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020","Connolly, Sean R./0000-0003-1537-0859; Pratchett, Morgan S/0000-0002-1862-8459; Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Blowes, Shane/0000-0001-6310-3670",James Cook University (JCU); Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Queensland Government Smart State PhD fellowship,"We thank James Cook University (JCU) and the Australian Research Council for financially supporting this work; S.A.B. was also supported by a Queensland Government Smart State PhD fellowship.

These factors may differ depending on the spatial scale at which they act. Bonelli's Eagle distribution in Spain has been studied previously using local and large (nation-wide) study area sizes, and human activities seemed not to affect negatively the occupancy of breeding territories. To study the factors affecting the species at an intermediate spatial scale we modelled Bonelli's Eagle distribution in Malaga province (S Spain), where the breeding density is the highest known in Europe. We applied a favourability function based on generalized linear models using the presence/absence of breeding territories of the species, and the values of a set of variables related to climate, topography, interspecific competition with Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos and human activity. We obtained a parsimonious model that included cliff availability and distance to highways as predictors of Bonelli's Eagle distribution. As highways may be seen as surrogates of intensive human activity, we conclude that, contrary to what was previously found at local or at nation-wide scales, human actions negatively affect the distribution of breeding territories at an intermediate scale. The construction of new roads and highways in the Mediterranean area of mainland Spain, which is the most climatically favourable region for the species, could have negative consequences for the Spanish metapopulation of Bonelli's Eagle, particularly in peripheral populations or distant areas that depend on the arrival of immigrants to persist.","[Munoz, Antonio-Roman; Real, Raimundo] Univ Malaga, Fac Sci, Dept Anim Biol, Biogeog Div & Conservat Res Team, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Munoz, Antonio-Roman] Fdn Migres, E-11390 Pelayo, Algeciras, Spain; [Munoz, Antonio-Roman] Univ Malaga, Fac Educ Sci, E-29071 Malaga, Spain","Munoz, AR (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Sci, Dept Anim Biol, Biogeog Div & Conservat Res Team, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",roman@uma.es,"Real, Raimundo/E-6559-2010","Real, Raimundo/0000-0002-6642-1284; Munoz, Antonio Roman/0000-0002-0253-7632","FEDER of European Union; Agencia de Obra Publica-Consejeria de Obras Publicas y Vivienda, Junta de Andalucia [G-GI3000/IDIG]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of SpainSpanish Government; FEDEREuropean Commission [CGL2009-11316/BOS]","We are grateful to Michal Skierczynski for constructive comments on the manuscript.

Biomass, diet overlap, prey selectivity, predation impact and stable isotope composition (C, N) of both species were assessed from June to September 2010. High biomass of C. harengus was found in June and July (wet weight 3.0 +/- A 1.8 g m(-3)) followed by a steep decline from August to September (wet weight 0.01 +/- A 0.01 g m(-3)), coinciding with a dramatic increase in M. leidyi biomass (wet weight 18.3 +/- A 16.1 g m(-3) during August). These two species showed a high overlap in their respective diets (copepods, meroplankton) during the study period. Predation impact of C. harengus on calanoid copepods was highest in June and July where 84 and 41 % of the standing stock were eaten per day in June and July, respectively. Predation impact of M. leidyi on calanoid copepods was highest in September (16 %). Based on stable isotope analysis C. harengus and M. leidyi were assigned to a trophic level of 3.08 and 2.47, respectively. Furthermore, we assessed the potential of competition between M. leidyi and C. harengus in a mesocosm experiment. Results indicated that at present zooplankton densities intraspecific competition in C. harengus seemed to be greater than interspecies competition with M. leidyi. Due to the low predation impact of M. leidyi and the reduced temporal overlap, competition between M. leidyi and C. harengus during the study period was estimated as low. Nevertheless, considering the high dietary overlap and the inter-annual variation in biomass and occurrence of both species and their zooplankton prey, competition in the Wadden Sea area cannot be excluded.","[Kellnreitner, Florian; Pockberger, Moritz; Asmus, Ragnhild; Asmus, Harald] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany","Kellnreitner, F (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, Hafenstr 43, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany.",florian.kellnreitner@web.de,"Asmus, Harald/O-2417-2017; Asmus, Ragnhild/O-2397-2017","Asmus, Harald/0000-0002-7772-1303; Asmus, Ragnhild/0000-0003-3300-6065",,,,76,6,6,1,78,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Additionally, video observations with infrared cameras were conducted at feeding sites to verify RFID data and analyze interspecific behavior. Composition of the rodent community changed during observation periods from a midday gerbil (Meriones meridianus)-dominated community to a desert hamster (P. roborovskii)-dominated community in 2009 and from a northern three-toed jerboa (Dipus sagitta)-dominated community to a hamster-dominated community in 2010. Activity pattern of hamsters was clearly affected by species composition. In the hamster-dominated community, activity started 1.7 h +/- 1.0 SD after sundown and ended 7.2 +/- 1.4 h after sundown. A similar activity pattern was found for the jerboa-dominated community. In contrast, hamsters shortened their activity tremendously in the gerbil-dominated community, to 2.2 +/- 1.3 h (activity began at 0.8 +/- 0.3 h after sundown and ended at 3.0 +/- 1.5 h after sundown). An analysis of interspecific behavior at feeding sites showed clearly that gerbil behavior was characterized by aggressive attacks (60.4% attacks versus 6.1% being attacked), whereas jerboa behavior was dominated by avoidance of direct contact (67.5% avoidance versus 22.9% attack). Hamster intraspecific behavior included all 4 elements in a similar ratio (27.3% attacks, 21.8% being attacked, 22.7% fleeing without direct contact, and 22.7% causing fleeing without direct contact).","[Scheibler, Elke; Wollnik, Franziska; Brodbeck, David; Hummel, Elisabeth] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Biol, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Yuan, Shuai; Zhang, Fu-Shun; Zhang, Xiao-Dong; Fu, He-Ping; Wu, Xiao-Dong] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm Sci, Hohhot 010019, Peoples R China","Schbbler, E (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Biol, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",elke.scheibler@bio.uni-stuttgart.de,,,Federal State of Baden-Wurttemberg under the Margarete-von-Wrangell program; European Social Fund under the Margarete-von-Wrangell program,"We thank H.

While these studies clearly support the role of biotic interactions in shaping species distributions, most examine only the influence of a single species and/or a single interaction, failing to account for species being subject to multiple concurrent interactions. By fitting species distribution models (SDMs), we examine the influence of multiple vertical (i.e., grazing, trampling, and manuring by mammalian herbivores) and horizontal (i.e., competition and facilitation; estimated from the cover of dominant plant species) interspecific interactions on the occurrence and cover of 41 alpine tundra plant species. Adding plant-plant interactions to baseline SDMs (using five field-quantified abiotic variables) significantly improved models' predictive power for independent data, while herbivore-related variables had only a weak influence. Overall, abiotic variables had the strongest individual contributions to the distribution of alpine tundra plants, with the importance of horizontal interaction variables exceeding that of vertical interaction variables. These results were consistent across three modeling techniques, for both species occurrence and cover, demonstrating the pattern to be robust. Thus, the explicit consideration of multiple biotic interactions reveals that plant-plant interactions exert control over the fine-scale distribution of vascular species that is comparable to abiotic drivers and considerably stronger than herbivores in this low-energy system.","[le Roux, Peter C.; Luoto, Miska] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Lenoir, Jonathan] Jules Verne Univ Picardie, UR Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises EA 4698, Plant Biodivers Lab, F-80037 Amiens 1, France; [Pellissier, Loic] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wisz, Mary S.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Arctic Res Ctr, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Wisz, Mary S.] Greenland Climate Res Ctr, Greenland Inst Nat Resources, Nuuk, Greenland","le Roux, PC (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",peter.leroux@helsinki.fi,"Pellissier, Loic/AAG-1013-2020; Wisz, Mary/J-7826-2013; Pellissier, Loic/J-2563-2015; Luoto, Miska/E-6693-2014; Lenoir, Jonathan/AAE-8441-2019; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011","Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Lenoir, Jonathan/0000-0003-0638-9582; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143; Wisz, Mary S./0000-0002-5357-6367",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [1140873],"We acknowledge funding from the Academy of Finland (Project Number 1140873), and we thank A.

The abundance of mammal tracks was negatively related to level of background radiation, independent of the statistical model, with effects of radiation accounting for a third of the variance. The effect of radiation differed significantly among species. There was a positive relationship between abundance of predators and abundance of prey, modified by the level of background radiation because the number of predators increased disproportionately with the number of prey at high levels of radiation. These findings suggest that predatory mammals aggregate in areas with abundant prey, especially when prey are exposed to high levels of radiation.

In low-productivity and highly seasonal environments such as the alpine tundra, most interactions occur during a short, snow-free period. The strength and direction of these interactions are likely to be determined by the availability of resources, particularly among species of the same ecological guild. Understanding how species interact in such environments can provide insights into the conditions that facilitate their coexistence. We determined the potential for interspecific interactions among 3 resident medium-sized mammalian herbivores inhabiting the alpine tundra and investigated how they share available space and resources. Overlap in their respective activity areas indicated that these species were aggregated at a landscape scale, but other mechanisms allowed their coexistence at a finer scale. Their distributions were primarily associated with shorter distances to heterospecifics and, secondly, with habitat features related to shelter and escape from predation. Our results suggest that these species can (and do) coexist by partitioning their ecological niches. Competition is likely not a major factor in structuring these communities; in turn, facilitative mechanisms may allow co-occurrence of these sympatric herbivores in seasonal, low productivity environments.","[Barrio, Isabel C.; Hik, David S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Barrio, Isabel C.] Inst Pirenaico Ecol CSIC, Jaca 22700, Spain","Barrio, IC (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",icbarrio@gmail.com,"Barrio, Isabel C/F-8566-2010; Hik, David S/B-3462-2009","Barrio, Isabel C/0000-0002-8120-5248; Hik, David S/0000-0002-8994-9305","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Consejeria de Educacion, Ciencia y Cultura (JCCM, Spain); European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF)","Special thanks are due to F.

In Germany the invasive raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and the native red fox (Vulpes vulpes) occupy a similar ecological niche. Therefore, the aim of our study was to discover the extent of exploitative diet competition between these two generalist carnivores. Carcasses of red foxes (n=256) and raccoon dogs (n=253) were collected throughout Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania (north-east Germany) and stomachs contains were analysed. Frequency of occurrence and biomass share indicate that both canids are omnivorous and pursue opportunistic feeding strategies. Small mammals and edible plant material were the most important food resources for red foxes and raccoon dogs. Nonetheless, interspecies differences were recorded for edible plant material, small mammals and insects. While red foxes mostly feed on voles, raccoon dogs consumed mice and shrews as often as voles. Only raccoon dogs preyed on amphibians. There were no differences in carrion consumption, both species scavenged on wild boar and we found clear competition for carrion year-round. Moreover, there was evidence that two red foxes foraged on raccoon dogs and vice versa. The mean annual interspecies diet overlap index was relatively high. The diets determined for raccoon dogs and red foxes were quite similar and a similar food niche breadth was recorded. However, only minor competition is assumed to take place since differences in feeding habits do exist.","[Drygala, Frank] Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Werner, Ulrike; Zoller, Hinrich] Univ Rostock, Dept Zool, D-18055 Rostock, Germany","Drygala, F (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 2a, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",drygala@gmx.net,,,Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania,"We would like to thank the forestry department of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania for funding our research.

Ecologists have argued about the commonness and strength of interspecific competition between insect herbivores, but facilitation between herbivores has received much less consideration. We previously found that when two species of folivorous caterpillars co-occurred on a shared host plant, feeding by early season tiger moth caterpillars reduced the growth and reproduction of later season tussock caterpillars. However, densities of tussock caterpillars in summer were positively correlated with densities of tiger moth caterpillars the following spring. 2. In this study, we experimentally manipulated numbers of feeding tussock caterpillars and found that they facilitated tiger moth caterpillars. 3. The depth of the litter layer beneath host lupine bushes was positively correlated with the number of tussock caterpillars feeding on each bush. Experimental additions of litter beneath lupine canopies during summer resulted in increased numbers of tiger moth caterpillars in the following spring, indicating a causal role of litter. Litter potentially provides food, habitat and protection from desiccation and predation. We failed to find evidence that tussock caterpillars facilitated tiger moth caterpillars by mechanisms independent of litter. 4. Our study demonstrates that facilitation may operate between insect herbivores, across life-stages through indirect interactions that are non-trophic. Facilitation operated by a novel mechanism, the accumulation of litter which was a by-product of feeding by one species was valuable to a second species. Facilitation persisted in time and space far beyond the creation of litter by tussock caterpillars which should be considered important ecosystem engineers from the point of view of tiger moths. Facilitations that involve habitat modification may generally connect species that do not interact directly or trophically, and have not previously been considered to affect one another.","[Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Grof-Tisza, Patrick] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Karban, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rkarban@ucdavis.edu,"Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009; Grof-Tisza, Patrick/AAY-7318-2020","Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627; Grof-Tisza, Patrick/0000-0002-0217-4253",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [LTREB-0639885]; Division Of Graduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [0841297] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank Claire Karban and Tawny Mata for help with field work and Susan Harrison, Bitty Roy and two anonymous reviewers for improving the manuscript.

Vector competence can be affected by rearing temperature and inter- and intraspecific competition experienced by the individual mosquito during its larval development. This research investigates whether a new morphological indicator of larval rearing conditions, wing shape, can be used to distinguish reliably temperature and competitive conditions experienced during larval stages. Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae were reared in low intraspecific, high intraspecific, or high interspecific competition treatments at either 22 or 32 degrees C. The right wing of each dried female was removed and photographed. Nineteen landmarks and 20 semilandmarks were digitized on each wing. Shape variables were calculated using geometric morphometric software. Canonical variate analysis, randomization multivariate analysis of variance, and visualization of landmark movement using deformation grids provided evidence that although semilandmark position was significantly affected by larval competition and temperature for both species, the differences in position did not translate into differences in wing shape, as shown in deformation grids. Two classification procedures yielded success rates of 26-49%. Accounting for wing size produced no increase in classification success. There seemed to be a significant relationship between shape and size. These results, particularly the low success rate of classification based on wing shape, show that shape is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of larval rearing competition and temperature conditions for Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti.","[Stephens, C.

In the absence of compensatory mechanisms, two powerful forces, drift and competition, are expected to erode diversity quickly, especially in communities containing scores or hundreds of rare species. Here, I review evidence bearing on four compensatory mechanisms that have been subsumed under the terms density dependence or negative density dependence: (1) intra-and (2) interspecific competition and the action of (3) density-responsive and (4) distance-responsive biotic agents, as postulated by Janzen and Connell. To achieve ontological integration, I examine evidence based on studies employing seeds, seedlings, and saplings. Available evidence points overwhelmingly to the action of both host-generalist and host-restricted biotic agents as causing most seed and seedling mortality, implying that species diversity is maintained via top-down forcing. The overall effect of most host-generalist seed predators and herbivores is to even out the distribution of surviving propagules. Spatially restricted recruitment appears to result mainly, if not exclusively, from the actions of host-restricted agents, principally microarthropods and fungi, that attack hosts in a distance-dependent fashion as Janzen and Connell proposed. Near total failure of propagules close to reproductive conspecifics ensures that successful reproduction occurs through a scant rain of dispersed seeds. Densities of dispersed seeds and seedlings arising from them are so low as to generally preclude the operation of density dependence, at least during early ontogenetic stages. I conclude that Janzen and Connell were essentially correct and that diversity maintenance results from top-down forcing acting in a spatially nonuniform fashion.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Ctr Trop Conservat, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Terborgh, J (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Ctr Trop Conservat, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",manu@duke.edu,,,Andrew Mellon Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0742830]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0742830] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"I thank the Instituto Nacional de Recursos Naturales/Servicio Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas (INRENA/SERNANP; Peruvian park service) administrators in Cusco and Lima for the many permits that allowed our research to continue uninterrupted for more than 20 years.

Despite compelling empirical evidence, there is no general framework for elucidating how and when selection will allow coexistence in natural communities. Here we develop such a framework for a mechanism that we term neighbor-dependent selection. We show that this mechanism can both augment coexistence when ecological conditions allow for niche partitioning and enable coexistence when ecological conditions lead to competitive exclusion. The novel insight is that when ecological conditions lead to exclusion, neighbor-dependent selection can allow coexistence via cycles driven by an intransitive loop; selection causes one species to be a superior interspecific competitor when it is rare and an inferior interspecific competitor when it is abundant. Our framework predicts the conditions under which selection can enable coexistence, as opposed to merely augmenting it, and elucidates the effects of heritability on the eco-evolutionary feedbacks that drive coexistence. Given increasing evidence that evolution operates on ecological timescales, our approach provides one means for evaluating the role of selection and trait evolution in species coexistence.","[Vasseur, David A.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Rudolf, Volker H.

Although these constraints have direct relevance to coexistence, most investigations utilize a seed addition approach that offers limited insight into these dynamics. Here we report the results of an assembly experiment with annual plant species from California grasslands to examine how propagule pool characteristics (dominant species abundance, functional diversity) influence establishment and seed limitation (density independence and density dependence across a gradient of seed supply) for each species, as well as how these constraints affect community diversity. Species were predominantly colimited by seed and establishment constraints, exhibiting saturating recruitment functions with increased seed supply. Consistent with competition-colonization trade-off predictions, recruitment constraints often depended on the degree of seed limitation of the competitive dominant, Brassica nigra; diversity was greatest in communities where Brassica was seed limited. Functional similarity within the propagule pool did not affect recruitment across a range of seed supply; likewise, functional diversity of the propagule pool was not related to community diversity. We conclude that seed limitation of the dominant species rather than niche similarity influences interspecific competition for safe sites and scales up to affect community-level diversity.","[Larios, Loralee; Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Aicher, Rebecca J.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Suding, KN (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",suding@berkeley.edu,"Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176; Aicher, Rebecca/0000-0001-7912-4169","University of California, Irvine, Newkirk Center for Science and SocietyUniversity of California System; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Dept. of Education","This work was funded by grants from the University of California, Irvine, Newkirk Center for Science and Society and the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Parasitism may be an important factor determining the coexistence of closely related species. Although host-parasite interactions can affect the ecology and distribution of the host species, virtually nothing is known about how other interspecific interactions affecting the host, such as competition or predation, relate to the parasite burden of the host. 2. We studied parasite-mediated competition between two closely related Calopteryx damselflies, C. virgo L. and C. splendens Harris. We investigated a total of 31 populations, including 18 allopatric and 13 sympatric populations. We measured the occurrence of gut parasites, eugregarines. 3. We found that the prevalence of gregarines was higher in C. virgo than in C. splendens. On average, more than half of the C. virgo individuals were infected by eugregarines both in allopatric and sympatric populations. However, hardly any allopatric C. splendens populations had gregarines, but most of sympatric populations had infected individuals. 4. According to our results, co-existence of the host species affects the likelihood of the subordinate species showing higher levels of parasitism. Interspecific aggression, lower species genetic heterozygosity, and the difference in host species immunity are proposed as possible explanations for greater parasite burdens in the inferior species at sympatric sites.","[Ilvonen, Sini; Ilvonen, Jaakko J.; Kaunisto, Kari M.; Suhonen, Jukka] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; [Krams, Indrikis] Daugavpils Univ, Inst Systemat Biol, Daugavpils, Latvia","Suhonen, J (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",juksuh@utu.fi,"Ilvonen, Jaakko J./AAG-4842-2019; Krams, Indrikis/B-5788-2017","Ilvonen, Jaakko J./0000-0002-2311-7039; Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108",Suomen Biologian Seura Vanamo ry; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank Oskari Harma, Linda Laakso, Kalle Laitila, Pipsa Lappalainen, Juhana Suhonen and Talvikki Suhonen for their help during the field and laboratory work.

Correlated with an estimated decline of similar to 89% in the red colobus population was an increase in encounter rates with chimpanzee parties. Our data, along with the unusually high rates of predation by chimpanzees on red colobus at Ngogo and the fact that the chimpanzee community at Ngogo is the largest ever recorded, support the conclusion that the red colobus decline was caused primarily by chimpanzee predation. This seems to be the first documented case of predation by one nonhuman primate causing the population decline in another. We evaluated disease and interspecific competition as other possible causes of the red colobus decline, but judged them to be relatively insignificant compared with predation by chimpanzees. Notable changes in encounter rates with other primate species may have resulted from forest expansion. Those for mangabeys, redtails, and black and white colobus increased significantly. Encounter rates increased for l'Hoest's monkeys too, but the increased sightings may have been an artifact of increased habituation. Sightings of blue monkey and baboon groups declined. There was no significant change in encounter rates for all species combined. The Ngogo primate community seemed to be in a nonequilibrium state, changing from one dominated by two species, a folivore (red colobus) and a frugivorous omnivore (redtails), to one dominated by three species of frugivorous omnivores (redtails, mangabeys, and chimpanzees). This study demonstrates the importance of long-term monitoring in understanding population dynamics and the role of intrinsic variables in shaping the species composition of a community. Am. J.

Specifically, we examined the effects of inter and intra-specific competition and three disturbance treatments (drained, drought, and flood) on the growth performance of three island-ubiquitous herbaceous plant species (Amaranthus palmeri, Cyperus strigosus, and Xanthium strumarium). We predicted a decrease in interspecific competitive effects in disturbance treatments. Specifically, we expected A. palmeri to be most affected by flooding treatment based on its facultative upland status suggesting that it should be a poor tolerator of flooded conditions. X. strumarium and C. strigosus both facultative wetland species in their status, should tolerate flooding, but we predict that C. strigosus should have greater stress tolerance due to its perennial life history. Because we find these species coexisting at the same elevation zones on riverine islands, we also predicted stronger intraspecific competition effects. Our results indicate that disturbance indeed affected competitive interactions, but the effects were species-specific. X. strumarium showed stronger competitive effects when grown with conspecifics while C. strigosus experienced greater competition with heterospecifics under drought treatments. Based on its wetland indicator status and life history characteristics, we expected A. palmeri to exhibit a facilitative effect, as it is typically an upland species, but instead it was impacted most by interspecific competition. Our study indicates that factors other than competition, facilitation, and flood tolerance (e.g., priority effects) may be controlling island plant community dynamics, further studies are required.","[Moore, J.

Such interspecific associations of birds are a characteristic of most avian communities, observed in diverse habitats from forests to grasslands and from estuaries to the open ocean, both at high latitudes and in the tropics. We explore the consequences of mixed-species flocks in shaping the selection environment and discuss whether the participants in flocks should be identified as niche constructors. As a result of the decision to associate with other species, a bird alters its relationship with competitors, potentially gains access to resources, becomes safer from predators and may change microhabitat use. The recurrent patterns in the behaviour of disparate unrelated species active in mixed-species flocks have led investigators to conclude that similar selection pressures have shaped their behaviour. However mixed-species flocks are variable in their characteristics, the birds active in them are diverse in form and behaviour, and the selection pressures that have shaped their propensity to join mixed-species flocks must be various. In forming mixed-species flocks, species with specialized roles at the centre of flocks are creating a complex social environment that represents an important biotic selection force shaping their own ecology and behaviour, and that of other species within the avian community. In this review, we consider how the spectrum of interspecific relationships in mixed-species flocks makes them an interesting focus for further studies of niche construction by relocation.

Within lacustrine environments, cover habitat provides refuge from potential predators and is a resource that is competed for if limiting. Competitive interactions between bull trout and other species could result in bull trout being displaced from cover habitat, and bull trout may lack evolutionary adaptations to compete with introduced species, such as lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush. A laboratory experiment was performed to examine habitat use and interactions for cover by juvenile (i.e., < 80 mm total length) bull trout and lake trout. Differences were observed between bull trout and lake trout in the proportion of time using cover (F (1,22.6) = 20.08, P < 0.001) and bottom (F (1,23.7) = 37.01, P < 0.001) habitat, with bull trout using cover and bottom habitats more than lake trout. Habitat selection ratios indicated that bull trout avoided water column habitat in the presence of lake trout and that lake trout avoided bottom habitat. Intraspecific and interspecific agonistic interactions were infrequent, but approximately 10 times greater for intraspecific interactions between lake trout. Results from this study provide little evidence that juvenile bull trout and lake trout compete for cover, and that species-specific differences in habitat use and selection likely result in habitat partitioning between these species.","[Meeuwig, Michael H.; Guy, Christopher S.] Montana State Univ, Montana Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Fredenberg, Wade A.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Creston Fish & Wildlife Ctr, Kalispell, MT 59901 USA","Meeuwig, MH (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Mail Stop 315, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",meeuwig@gmail.com,,,U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service,"Funding for this research was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Niche theory has mainly focused on niche-deteriorating processes, such as resource consumption, predation and competition, which have negative effects on population growth. Here, we integrate niche construction explicitly into modern niche theory. We use a graphical approach to analyse how a species' niche-improving impacts interplay with niche-deteriorating impacts to modify its response to the environment. In a model of two consumers that compete for one limiting resource and one predator, we show how niche construction modifies the traditional niche-deteriorating impacts of its agent or of competing species, and hence the potential for species coexistence. By altering the balance between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects, niche construction can either generate net interspecific facilitation or strengthen interspecific competition. The adaptive benefit derived from niche construction also strongly affects the realized niche of a niche-constructing species.","[Kylafis, Grigoris; Loreau, Michel] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Kylafis, G (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Ave Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",grigoris.kylafis@mail.mcgill.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Canada Research Chair programCanada Research Chairs,"We thank Kevin Laland, Clive Jones and Frederick Guichard for stimulating comments and discussions on our manuscript.

Such post-disturbance changes in abiotic and biotic environments may also promote a naturalized exotic species (or invading species) to become invasive through rapid colonization of the habitat sites by reducing the extent and size of resident plant species. By combining species life history traits with that of the disturbance-induced changes in habitat characteristics, we aimed to determine those interacting factors and associated mechanism allowing an exotic invasion to start off. Methods We used a modified version of the classic competition-colonization (CC) model which was formulated first by Hastings (1980) and studied later by Tilman (1994) to explain spatial coexistence of multiple species. Within this model framework, recruitment-limited spatial competition has explicitly been linked with interspecific resource competition without altering the basic assumptions and structure of the original CC model. Important findings The model results showed that at a constant rate of resource supply, invading species can stably coexist with native species via trade-offs between species competitive ability and colonizing ability. On the other hand, the model predicted that with a fluctuating resource condition, invading species can successfully invade a habitat following continuous reductions in the size and extent of native species. Whether or not invading species holds competitive superiority over the native species for limiting resource, we showed that there exists a range of variation in available resource that allows an exotic invasion to start off in post-disturbance habitat. The associated disturbance-induced mechanism promoting invading species to become invasive has been identified. It states that occurrences of disturbances such as fire or clear-cutting influence variation in resource availability, and in addition open up many vacant microsites; given these disturbance-induced changes, invading species with a higher rate of propagule production and with a higher survival rate of adults particularly in low-resource condition recruits microsites at faster rate relative to native competitor species, and with a given range of variation in resource availabilities, it maintains continued expansions following reductions in size and extent of native species. Moreover, we identified those interacting factors and their specific roles that drive this mechanism. These factors include propagule supply, variable resource level and vacant microsite availability. Increased availability of vacant microsites following disturbances creates an opportunity for rapid colonization. Given this opportunity, higher number of propagules supplied by the invading species enhances the rate of colonization success, whereas the resource variation within a range of given thresholds maintains enhanced colonization rate of the invading species while it depresses native competitor species. Owing to the each factor's invasion regulatory ability, controlling one or all of them may have strong negative impact on the occurrence of exotic invasion.","[Chakraborty, Amit; Li, Bai-Lian] Univ Calif Riverside, Ecol Complex & Modeling Lab, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Chakraborty, Amit; Li, Bai-Lian] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Li, Bai-Lian] Univ Calif Riverside, CAU UCR Int Ctr Ecol & Sustainabil, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Li, BL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Ecol Complex & Modeling Lab, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, 4133 Batchelor Hall,Keen Hall, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",bai-lian.li@ucr.edu,,,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0421530]; Long Term Ecological Research Program (Sevilleta) [DEB-0620482]; University of California Agricultural Experiment StationUniversity of California System,"US National Science Foundation's Biocomplexity Program (DEB-0421530), Long Term Ecological Research Program (Sevilleta) (DEB-0620482) and the University of California Agricultural Experiment Station.",,82,3,3,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Previous experiments with dominant understory Piper shrubs in a Costa Rican rain forest revealed that increases in herbivore densities on these shrubs caused widespread seedling mortality as a result of herbivores moving from Piper to seedlings of many different plant genera. We tested components of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis by conducting focused studies on the effects of specialist and generalist Piper herbivores on local seedling diversity. Whereas specialist herbivores are predicted to increase mortality to neighboring seedlings that are closely related to the source plant, true generalists moving from source plants may cause density-dependent mortality of many species, and possibly increase richness if new species replace abundant species that have been thinned by herbivores. Therefore, we hypothesized that seedling richness would be greater in understory control plots created in patches of Piper that had normal densities of generalist herbivores compared to plots from which we removed generalist herbivores manually from all Piper shrubs. After 15 months, generalist-herbivore-removal plots had >40% fewer seedlings,>40% fewer species, and 40% greater seedling evenness, on average, than control plots with generalist herbivores intact. Using a complementary approach in unmanipulated plots in four forests, we used path analysis to test for a positive association between seedling diversity and herbivore damage on Piper species. In unmanipulated plots, for both generalist and specialist herbivores, our data were significant fits to the causal model that Piper herbivores decrease evenness and increase plant species richness, corroborating the experimental results. Because herbivores changed how individuals were apportioned among the species and families present (lower evenness), one interpretation of these associations between herbivores on Piper shrubs and local seedling richness is that high seedling mortality in dominant families allowed the colonization or survival of less common species. If interspecific or apparent competition allowed for a relative increase in species richness, then the Janzen-Connell hypothesis may extend its predictions to generalist seedling predators. We speculate that apparent competition may explain some of the deviations from neutral model predictions, especially at small scales.","[Dyer, Lee A.; Chavarria, Gerardo Vega] Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Letourneau, Deborah K.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Amoretti, Diego Salazar] Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA","Dyer, LA (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",nolaclimber@gmail.com,"Letourneau, Deborah/G-3694-2011","Salazar, Diego/0000-0001-9810-5828","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0344250, CHE-0718732]; Earthwatch Institute; National GeographicNational Geographic Society; Tulane University","This study was funded by NSF grant DEB-0344250 and CHE-0718732, as well as grants from Earthwatch Institute, National Geographic, and Tulane University.

Adult TF emerged on average 2 wk before TC both in the field and under controlled laboratory conditions. This observation, combined with the early reproduction of emergent females, implies that the smaller (younger) larvae of native TC may be at increased risk of intra-guild predation by TF. The high spatial association between male and female TF in dense, aggregated populations suggests that the rate of mate encounter is depressed in sparse populations toward the edge of the invasive range. The higher level of spatial aggregation for TF than TC, particularly at high population density, suggests a higher propensity of adult TF to congregate at landmarks. Considering the broader range of host conditions, earlier seasonal emergence, and presumably more effective mate encounter for TF than TC, the exotic TF may be a superior competitor with the potential to displace or reduce the abundance of TC.","[Rhainds, Marc; Heard, Stephen B.; Sweeney, Jon D.; Silk, Peter; Flaherty, Leah] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada","Rhainds, M (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, POB 4000, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada.",mrhainds@nrcan.gc.ca,"Sweeney, Jonathan/Q-5281-2019; Heard, Stephen/C-2737-2012",,Natural Resources CanadaNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Canadian Forest ServiceNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Canadian Food Inspection Agency; Forest Protection Limited New Brunswick; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Nova Scotia Ministry of Natural Resources; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank G.

For example, the segregation hypothesis predicts that intraspecific aggregation should increase the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition, thereby enhancing local coexistence in plant communities. We applied recent methods of point pattern analysis to analyze a unique long-term data set on fully mapped seedling emergence and subsequent survival in a Mediterranean gorse shrubland after experimental. res and simulated torrential rainfall events. Our overall aim was to test if the observed spatial patterns were consistent with the segregation hypothesis during the entire community dynamics from early seedling emergence to the establishment of a mature community, i.e., we explored if the observed initial segregation did indeed prevent interspecific competition from becoming dominant. We used random labeling as the null model and specific test statistics to evaluate different biological effects of the spatial interactions that determine mortality. We found that mortality was clearly not random. Comparison of the probability of mortality in dependence on the distance to conspecific and to heterospecific plants showed that mortality was controlled almost entirely by intraspecific interactions, which is consistent with the segregation hypothesis. Dead plants were aggregated and segregated from surviving plants, indicating two-sided scramble competition. Spatial interactions were density dependent and changed their sign over the course of time from positive to negative when plants grew to maturity. The simulated torrential rainfall events and subsequent erosion caused nonspecific mortality of seedlings but did not reduce the prevalence of intraspecific competition. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of plants may profoundly affect competition and can be an important determinant in the coexistence of species and biodiversity.","[Raventos, Jose] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Wiegand, Thorsten] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modeling, D-04301 Leipzig, Germany; [De Luis, Martin] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Geografia & OT, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain","Raventos, J (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, Carretera S Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",jraventos@ua.es,"de Luis, Martin/F-2559-2010; Wiegand, Thorsten/AAP-9709-2021; Wiegand, Thorsten/H-5877-2016","de Luis, Martin/0000-0002-7585-3636; Wiegand, Thorsten/0000-0002-3721-2248; Wiegand, Thorsten/0000-0002-3721-2248; Raventos, Jose/0000-0002-5693-510X","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2008-05112-C02-01, CGL2007-65315, CGL2005-04270, REM 2003-07453]; UFZ-Centre for Environmental Research","We thank the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (CGL2008-05112-C02-01, CGL2007-65315, CGL2005-04270, and REM 2003-07453) for their financial assistance.

Furthermore, it was investigated whether the release of first instar juveniles instead of megalopae would reduce the mortality related to interspecific predation. A preliminary estimate of the crab community structure in the target area of a restocking program was undertaken and indicated a great dominance of fiddler crabs (Uca spp). Based on this information, experiments were conducted to assess the ecological relationship between Ucides cordatus megalopae and first instar juveniles and fiddler crabs of different size classes in the presence of mangrove sediment, simulating natural conditions, as well as in the absence of any kind of refuge. It was observed that fiddler crabs not only compete with, and prey on U. cordatus youngsters, both as megalopae and juveniles. Furthermore, it was observed that the predation behavior of fiddler crabs is exercised only by individuals with carapaces wider than 0.5 cm. The results of the assay simulating natural conditions showed that, even when sediment was provided as a refuge, the same pattern was observed, with survivorship rates significantly lower in the presence of Uca crabs.","[Ventura, Robson; da Silva, Ubirata A.

We examined factors influencing the distribution of the generalist leafminers Liriomyza sativae Blanchard and Liriomyza huidobrensis Blanchard (Diptera: Agromyzidae), two pests of agricultural crops, in the tropical Dieng mountainous area of Central Java, Indonesia. Liriomyza huidobrensis predominated at altitudes above 700 m a.s.l. and was the only species collected above 1 400 m a.s.l. In contrast, L. sativae predominated below 600 m a.s.l. and was not found above 1 200 m where the average temperature was 20.7 degrees C. Parasitoid diversity decreased with altitude, but parasitism did not change. The distribution of neither species was affected by parasitoids; L. huidobrensis predominant at high altitudes was preferred by Opius parasitoids common at these altitudes. Intra- and interspecific competition was detected in laboratory experiments where larval density was high, but led to coexistence rather than species displacement. No competition was detected in a field experiment when larval density was low. However, L. sativae failed to reproduce at the highest altitude, whereas L. huidobrensis established at all altitudes. Host composition varied with altitude and one host (faba beans) preferred by L. huidobrensis was common at high altitudes. By relating published data on the performance of the leafminer species to altitudinal temperature changes, we were partly successful in predicting the altitude at which the dominant species switched. Temperature plays an overriding influence on the altitudinal distribution of leafminers.","[Tantowijoyo, Warsito; Hoffmann, Ary A.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Ctr Environm Stress & Adaptat Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Hoffmann, AA (corresponding author), CESAR, Inst Bio21, 30 Flemington Rd, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",ary@unimelb.edu.au,"Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019; Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011","Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; ",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res; AUSAIDAustralian Aid (AusAID); Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,The project was funded by Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and AUSAID.

We examined the effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition, stressful soils, and local adaptation on estimates of N(e) in an annual plant species. While ecological influences on plant growth rate variance have been predicted to influence estimates of N(e)/N, we found a significant effect on the estimate of N(e)/N. but no significant ecological effects on growth rate variance. Lower survivorship on stressful soil was the most important effect reducing estimates of N(e)/N. If stochastic mortality is greater in environments that are abiotically stressful, then populations in these stressful environments may be slower to adapt because of lower census sizes and reduction of N(e)/N. In populations of conservation concern, increasing survivorship may be of greater benefit for maximizing N(e) than the reduction of variability in reproductive output among surviving adults.

Ecological interactions that involve aggressive confrontations between animals are important in shaping the evolution of morphology, behaviour and life history. However, as such confrontations are rarely witnessed, direct quantification of the intensity of these processes in natural populations is notoriously difficult. While the utilization of the frequency of non-lethal injuries is fraught with difficulties, it may provide information concerning different types of interaction, such as predation, intraspecific aggression and interspecific interference competition. 2. In this paper, we report on an exceptionally large difference in toe loss incidence between two populations of Podarcis sicula lizards living on small, neighbouring islands in the Adriatic Sea. We caught 900 lizards and recorded the number and location of missing toes. Subsequently, we investigated five non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning differences in bite force capacity, bone strength, predation intensity, average age and intraspecific aggression that may provide proximate explanations for the observed differences in injury frequencies. 3. Bite force differences differed considerably between the populations, but bone strength was found to be stronger in the populations with a higher frequency of natural scars. Predation pressure clearly differed between the populations, but we found higher injury rates under predation relaxation. 4. Our results indicate that density and consequently an increased intraspecific competition is the most likely explanation for the observed high frequencies of injuries. We suggest that the intensity of toe amputation between lizard populations may be a useable indirect indication for the intensity of intraspecific competition. 5. This study shows how a combination of morphological, physiological, behavioural and ecological measurements can be used to test assumptions implicit to alternative explanations of an observed phenomenon. Such tests can reveal how likely each of these explanations is, even if the processes leading to the phenomenon are difficult to observe directly.","[Vervust, Bart; Van Damme, Raoul] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Lab Funct Morphol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Dongen, Stefan] Dept Biol, Evolutionary Biol Grp, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Grbac, Irena] Nat Hist Museum Croatia, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia","Vervust, B (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Lab Funct Morphol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",bart.vervust@ua.ac.be,,"Van Damme, Raoul/0000-0002-4585-6940",FWO - FlandersFWO [G.0111.06],"This study is part of larger projects supported by the FWO - Flanders (project no.

Specifically, it is predicted that ( 1) males will respond to an increased risk of sperm competition from rivals by increasing sperm allocation, and ( 2) the increase in allocation will be lower when rivals are related. In species that use odour for communication, scent-based cues provide information on the presence and identity of conspecifics, and could thus serve as a basis for adjusting sperm allocation. We tested these predictions in the house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, a species for which scent is critical to many aspects of social and reproductive communication. Sperm allocation was measured for subject males mating immediately following exposure to odour stimuli deriving from ( 1) themselves ( control treatment), ( 2) a brother or ( 3) an unrelated male. The behavioural responses of subjects to conspecific odours indicated that males detected the presence of these stimuli in their environment, but contrary to theoretical predictions we found no evidence that they increase the number of sperm ejaculated in response to either of the odour cues indicating an elevated risk of sperm competition. Similarly, we found no significant differences between treatment groups in other traits linked to ejaculate investment, including copulatory plug size and copulatory behaviour. These findings contrast with previously studied rodent species, suggesting that responses to cues of sperm competition risk may display considerable interspecific variability.

The North American signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus has been widely introduced throughout Europe where it is expanding its range and in many areas replacing the native white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes. There is concern with regards to the impact of this species replacement on benthic fish. Interspecific behavioural interactions and competition for shelter between the benthic fish, bullhead Cottus gobio and A. pallipes and P. leniusculus were measured to assess the comparative impact of native and non-native crayfish. 2. Both white-clawed crayfish and signal crayfish Were dominant over bullhead. Bullheads moved away from approaches of crayfish, left shelters on entry of crayfish and rarely entered an occupied shelter. Signal crayfish made significantly more aggressive approaches towards bullheads than white-clawed crayfish. 3. Alone, bullheads spent most of their time by day under shelter (median 96%), reflecting a highly entrained behavioural response, which was relaxed by night (median 60%). Both crayfish species reduced shelter use by bullheads although the extent of shelter sharing by bullheads was higher in trials with white-clawed crayfish than with signal crayfish. 4. Sampling in the River Wharfe, northern England, where signal and white-clawed crayfish and bullhead currently exist, demonstrated a negative relationship between the densities of signal crayfish and bullhead, with high bullhead abundance where crayfish were absent or where white-clawed crayfish were present at low density. 5. Assuming that shelter is sometimes limited under natural conditions, crayfish are likely to displace bullheads from shelters, which may increase predation risk for bullheads. Although the effects of signal crayfish on bullhead shelter use were more intense, the pattern was highly evident for the native white-clawed crayfish. The higher fecundity and densities attained by signal crayfish may be more significant than differences in the behaviour of the two crayfish species in determining the impact of crayfish on bullheads.

The model predicts that, when a generalist herbivore feeds in the absence of plant toxins, adaptive foraging generally increases the probability of coexistence of plant species populations, because the herbivore switches more of its effort to whichever plant species is more common and accessible. In contrast, toxin-determined selective herbivory can drive plant succession toward dominance by the more toxic species, as previously documented in boreal forests and prairies. When the toxin concentrations in different plant species are similar, but species have different toxins with nonadditive effects, herbivores tend to diversify foraging efforts to avoid high intakes of any one toxin. This diversification leads the herbivore to focus more feeding on the less common plant species. Thus, uncommon plants may experience depensatory mortality from herbivory, reducing local species diversity. The depensatory effect of herbivory may inhibit the invasion of other plant species that are more palatable or have different toxins.

We investigated the potential role of two introduced predatory gastropods, the Japanese drill (Ocinebrina inornata) and the eastern drill (Urosalpinx cinerea), in limiting Olympia oyster recovery. We quantified the bay-wide distribution, local abundance, and per capita effects of drills, and asked how each of these three components of total invasion impact might be influenced by another dominant introduced species, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea g gas). Bay-wide sampling revealed differences in spatial distribution of the two drill species, with U. cinerea more abundant toward the head of the estuary and O. inornata more abundant toward the Mouth. Individual feeding trials indicated that both drill species preferred Pacific oysters to Olympia oysters of similar size, and preferentially attacked smaller oysters. We used field enclosures to quantify the direct effects of Japanese drill predation on Olympia and Pacific oysters, intra and interspecific competition, and indirect effects mediated by the shared predator. Predation reduced the survival of both oyster species, but the per capita impact of Japanese drills declined with increasing density of either Olympia or Pacific oysters, consistent with a type I I functional response. This positive indirect effect of Pacific oysters oil Olympia oysters was offset by asymmetric competition, in which Pacific oysters reduced Olympia oyster growth and survival but not vice versa. Despite the large drill impacts seen in these experiments, Olympia oysters transplanted to intertidal sites throughout the bay experienced low and variable rates of drill predation compared with other mortality sources. Introduced drills may be only one of a suite of factors that prevent rebuilding of Olympia oysters in the intertidal zone in Willapa Bay.","[Buhle, Eric R.; Ruesink, Jennifer L.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Buhle, ER (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",eric.buhle@noaa.gov,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to Washington Sea Grant Program, University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington [9NA16RG1044]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research fellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Achievement Rewards for College Scientists fellowship","The authors thank the organizers of the 2006 West Coast Native Oyster Restoration Workshop for coordinating this Special Issue.

During competitive interactions between ejaculates, longer and faster spermatozoa are expected to have an edge; however, to date, there has been mixed support for this key prediction from sperm competition theory. Here, we use the spectacular radiation of cichlid fishes from Lake Tanganyika to examine sperm characteristics in 29 closely related species. We provide phylogenetically robust evidence that species experiencing greater levels of sperm competition have faster-swimming sperm. We also show that sperm competition selects for increases in the number, size, and longevity of spermatozoa in the ejaculate of a male, and, contrary to expectations from theory, we find no evidence of trade-offs among sperm traits in an interspecific analysis. Also, sperm swimming speed is positively correlated with sperm length among, but not within, species. These different responses to sperm competition at intra-and interspecific levels provide a simple, powerful explanation for equivocal results from previous studies. Using phylogenetic analyses, we also reconstructed the probable evolutionary route of trait evolution in this taxon, and show that, in response to increases in the magnitude of sperm competition, the evolution of sperm traits in this clade began with the evolution of faster (thus, more competitive) sperm.","[Fitzpatrick, John L.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Fitzpatrick, John L.; Desjardins, Julie K.; Stiver, Kelly A.; Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Anim Behav Grp, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Desjardins, Julie K.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Montgomerie, Robert] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Stiver, Kelly A.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kolm, Niclas] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Fitzpatrick, JL (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",jfitzpat@cyllene.uwa.edu.au,"Montgomerie, Robert D/C-6516-2008; Fitzpatrick, John/E-8766-2011","Montgomerie, Robert D/0000-0003-4701-4525; Kolm, Niclas/0000-0001-5791-336X; Fitzpatrick, John/0000-0002-2834-4409; Stiver, Kelly/0000-0002-0650-8281",Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; Ontario Innovation Trust; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery and Equipment grantsNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank the staff of the Lake Tanganyika Research Unit for assistance and cooperation, particularly D.

Results indicated that mixed assemblages of seven distinct genotypes (representing clonal lineages of D. pulex, D. pulicaria and interspecific hybrids) showed rapid loss of genetic diversity in all treatments (2 x 2 factorial design, high vs. low quantity, and high vs. low quality). However, the erosion of diversity (measured as the effective number of clones) was slowest under the poorest food conditions (i.e., low quantity, low quality) and by the conclusion of the experiment (90 days) had resulted in the (low, low) treatment having significantly greater genetic diversity than the other three treatments. In addition, significant genotype (clone) x (food) environment interactions were observed, with a different predominant species/clone found under low food quality versus high food quality (no significant differences were detected for the two food quantities). A clone of D. pulex displaced the other clones under low food quality conditions, while a clone of D. pulicaria displaced the other clones in the high food quality treatments. Subsequent life-history experiments were not sufficient to predict the outcome of competitive interactions among members of this clonal assemblage. Our results suggest that genetic diversity among herbivore species such as Daphnia may be impacted not only by differences in food quantity but also by those in food quality and could be important in the overall maintenance of genetic diversity in natural populations.","[Weider, Lawrence J.; Jeyasingh, Punidan D.; Looper, Karen G.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Grad Program EEB, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Weider, Lawrence J.; Jeyasingh, Punidan D.; Looper, Karen G.] Univ Oklahoma, Biol Stn, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Weider, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Grad Program EEB, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",ljweider@ou.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [9977047],This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (U.S. Grant no. 9977047).

Interspecific relationships can thus have direct effects on the carrying capacity of the landscape and have important implications for conservation. We investigated the spatial relationships and activity patterns of 2 similarly sized mustelids: the invasive American mink (Neovison vison) and the native European polecat (Mustela putorius) in lowlands in the United Kingdom. By radiotracking mink (n = 11) and polecats (n = 7) in autumn when individuals of both species hold stable home ranges, we found that individuals tended to have overlapping home ranges, both within and between species; and the size of overlap areas was similar, but generally small, within and between species (mean approximately 20%, although overlaps were higher among mink of opposite sexes). Mink shared their home ranges with 0.3-1.17 other mink (of both sexes) and 0.83-1.3 polecats; polecats shared their home ranges with 0.6-1.0 polecats were nocturnal and mink were predominantly diurnal. Our results are consistent with interspecific territoriality although we cannot distinguish between interspecific territoriality and niche differentiation. We suggest that there is habitat partioning between the 2 species, but that this is incomplete and that temporal partioning enables avoidance of interspecific neighbors within overlap areas. Niche partioning by distance from water and time of day when active probably facilitates coexistence in the short term, but it is unclear whether coexistence is stable year-round or in the long term.","[Harrington, Lauren A.; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney OX13 5QL, Oxon, England","Harrington, LA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Tubney OX13 5QL, Oxon, England.",lauren.harrington@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,,Esmee Fairbaim Foundation; Mammals Trust United Kingdom,"This work was funded by the Esmee Fairbaim Foundation and the Mammals Trust United Kingdom.

The red imported. re ant (Solenopsis invicta) is invasive in the United States, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, and China. Solenopsis invicta appears to be a superior competitor in its introduced range, where it can cause the local extirpation of native species, but little is known about its competitive ability in its native range in South America. Here we examine the competitive ability of S. invicta for food resources in three widely separated Brazilian ant communities. Each of these communities contains 20-40 ant species, 8-10 of which were common and frequently interacted with S. invicta. S. invicta at all three sites was attacked by several species-specific phorid parasitoids, and at one site, two other species were attacked by their own specialized parasitoids. We examined interactions in these local communities for evidence that trade-offs among ant species between resource dominance and resource discovery, and between resource dominance and parasitoid vulnerability facilitate local coexistence. The trade-off between resource dominance and resource discovery was strong and significant only at Santa Genebra, where parasitoids had no effect on the outcome of confrontations at resources. At Bonito, parasitoids significantly reduced the ability of S. invicta, which was the top-ranked behavioral dominant, from defending and usurping food resources from subordinate species. In the Pantanal, S. invicta ranked behind three other ant species in a linear hierarchy of behavioral dominance, and lost the majority of its interactions with a fourth more subordinate species, Paratrechina fulva, another invasive species. Parasitoids of S. invicta were uncommon in the Pantanal, and did not affect its low position in the hierarchy relative to the other two sites. Parasitoids, however, did affect the ability of Linepithema angulatum, the top-ranked behavioral dominant in this community, from defending and usurping resources from behavioral subordinates. These results indicate that both interspecific competition and trait-mediated indirect effects of phorid parasitoids affect the ecological success of the red imported fire ant in its native range, but that the relative importance of these factors varies geographically.","[Feener, Donald H., Jr.; Wackford, Kirt M.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Orr, Matthew R.] Univ Oregon, Bend, OR 97701 USA; [Longo, Jose M.; Benson, Woodruff W.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Zool, LIIP, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Gilbert, Lawrence E.] Univ Texas Austin, Brackenridge Field Lab, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gilbert, Lawrence E.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Feener, DH (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",donald.feener@utah.edu,,"Orr, Matthew/0000-0002-2546-8625",,,,61,44,45,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2008,89,7,,,,,1824,1836,,10.1890/07-0659.1,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,331JC,WOS:000258007500006,18705370,Green Published,,,2021-09-21,

Selection of the best empirical model for a specific crop-weed system is not straightforward, however. We used information-theoretic criteria to identify the model that best describes barley yield based on data from barley-wild oat competition experiments conducted at three locations in Montana over 2 yr. Each experiment consisted of a complete addition series arranged as a randomized complete block design with three replications. Barley was planted at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 times the locally recommended seeding rate. Wild oat was planted at target infestation densities of 0, 10, 40, 160, and 400 plants m(-2). Twenty-five candidate yield models were used to describe the data from each location and year using maximum likelihood estimation. Based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), a second-order small-sample version of AIC (AIC(c)), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), most data sets supported yield models with crop density (D-c), weed density (D-w), and the relative time of emergence of the two species (T) as variables, indicating that all variables affected barley yield in most locations. AIC AIC(c), and BIC selected identical best models for all but one data set. In contrast, the Information Complexity criterion, ICOMP, generally selected simpler best models with fewer parameters. For data pooled over years and locations, AIC, AIC(c), and BIC strongly supported a single best model with variables D-c, D-w, T, and a functional form specifying both intraspecific and interspecific competition. ICOMP selected a simpler model with D-c and D-w only, and a functional form specifying interspecific, but no intraspecific, competition. The information-theoretic approach offers a rigorous, objective method for choosing crop yield and yield loss equations for bioeconomic models.","[Jasieniuk, Marie] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Taper, Mark L.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Wagner, Nicole C.] ARS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Stougaard, Robert N.] Montana State Univ, Northwestern Agr Res Ctr, Kalispell, MT 59901 USA; [Brelsford, Monica; Maxwell, Bruce D.] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Jasieniuk, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Mail Stop 4, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mjasien@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,28,5,5,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0043-1745,1550-2759,,WEED SCI,Weed Sci.,JUL-AUG,2008,56,4,,,,,628,636,,10.1614/WS-07-177.1,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,323NK,WOS:000257452600022,,,,,2021-09-21,

To this end we measured crown positions and stratification, and quantified the effect of total foliage mass and foliage mass density of neighboring trees on the relative crown depth (RCD) of target trees. Field measurements were done on naturally established saplings in two large forest gaps of different age (5- and 15-year-old) in The Netherlands, and consisting of four species differing in shade tolerance. Results indicated a vertical stratification between species which was related to inherent species morphologies, and not growth rates. Foliage densities did not diverge much, but total foliage mass and crown size were bigger for more shade-tolerant species. The neighbor species had an effect on the RCD of a target tree, but the identity of the target tree species itself explained far more of the observed variation in RCD. On this basis we conclude that (1) the studied species do not stratify according to light demand, nor is foliage density related to light demand. And (2) a stronger competitive effect is not related to having a higher foliage density per unit crown volume, and competitive effects are more strongly related to the target species' identity while competitors are equivalent.

We developed a spatially explicit simulation model that allows patch or population growth rate to change with population size through the incorporation of field data. We used the model to evaluate the invasion of a west coast estuary by the non-indigenous Japanese eelgrass, Zostera japonica (Zosteraceae). Specifically, we tested the relative importance of stochastic, abiotic disturbance, interspecific competition, and vegetative and seedling survival. Our model predicted that vegetative shoot and seedling survival limited by competition are the most important limiting factors for Z. japonica growth, although stochastic disturbance was also a limiting factor. Population cycles and patchy distribution were also predicted, with the eelgrass apparently coexisting with the competitor. The model should be applicable to a variety of invasive species, with various types of disturbance and limiting factors.","[Almasi, Kama N.; Eldridge, Peter M.] US EPA, Coastal Ecol Branch, Newport, OR 97365 USA","Almasi, KN (corresponding author), US EPA, Coastal Ecol Branch, 2111 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA.",knalmasi@yahoo.com; Eldridge.Pete@epa.gov,,,,,,48,7,7,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-2723,1559-2731,,ESTUAR COAST,Estuaries Coasts,FEB,2008,31,1,,,,,163,176,,10.1007/s12237-007-9024-5,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,259GF,WOS:000252927100014,,,,,2021-09-21,

Recent work has shown that the ecological effects of multispecies interactions are often not predictable from studies of the component pairwise interactions. Little is known about how multispecies interactions affect the evolution of ecologically important traits. We tested the direct and interactive effects of inter- and intraspecific competition, as well as of two abundant herbivore species (a generalist folivore and a specialist aphid), on the selective value of a defensive chemical compound in Brassica nigra. We found that investment in chemical defense was favored in interspecific competition but disfavored in intraspecific competition and that this pattern of selection was dependent on the presence of both herbivores, suggesting that selection will depend on the rarity or commonness of these species. These results show that the selective value of ecologically important traits depends on the complicated web of interactions present in diverse natural communities and that fluctuations in community composition may maintain genetic variation in such traits.","[Lankau, Richard A.; Strauss, Sharon Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Lankau, RA (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, 1816 S Oak St, Champaign, IL 61802 USA.",ralankau@ucdavis.edu; systrauss@ucdavis.edu,"Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012; Lankau, Richard A/B-9760-2008","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085; Lankau, Richard A/0000-0001-9995-328X",,,,66,77,80,2,77,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Fruits were the main trophic resource for all species. The diet of martens differed from those of the red fox and badger by means of a higher consumption of garbage and non-Rosaceae fruits. The red fox preyed on more lagomorphs and roe deer and relied almost exclusively on two fruit species, rose-hips and whitebeam berries. Badgers ate few invertebrates, with cultivated fruits and pine seeds forming the bulk of their diet. On the whole, trophic niche overlap was kept low by the exploitation of different species of berries and mammals and, secondly, by seasonal differences in the use of same items by the three carnivores. Badger trophic niche overlapped to a wider extent than those of the other two predators in summer, when fruit availability is higher. Foxes used all habitats according to their availability, except for villages, which were avoided. Badgers used mainly open habitats, particularly Alpine meadows, avoiding villages and mixed woods. Martens selected the habitats avoided by the other two predators and avoided all the others. The narrow range of habitat used by martens and diet evidence suggest that, within the context of interspecific competition, they could play the role of sub-ordinate species, segregating in fox-free urban environments.","[Prigioni, C.; Balestrieri, A.; Remonti, L.; Cavada, L.] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Prigioni, C (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, Piazza Botta 9, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",prigioni@unipv.it,,,,,,110,39,41,2,56,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1125-0003,1748-5851,,ITAL J ZOOL,Ital.

Although the selective pressures explaining this rapid evolution are yet to be resolved, recent evidence implicates sexual selection as a potentially important explanatory factor. To investigate this hypothesis, we sought evidence of a high rate of adaptive gene evolution linked to postcopulatory sexual selection in muroid rodents, a model vertebrate group displaying a broad range of mating systems. Specifically, we sequenced 7 genes from diverse rodents that are expressed in the testes, prostate, or seminal vesicles, products of which have the potential to act in sperm competition. We inferred positive Darwinian selection in these genes by estimation of the ratio of nonsynonymous (d(N), amino acid changing) to synonymous (d(S), amino acid retaining) substitution rates (omega = d(N)/d(S)). Next, we tested whether variation in this ratio among lineages could be attributed to interspecific variation in mating systems, as inferred from the variation in these rodents' relative testis sizes (RTS). Four of the 7 genes examined (Prm1, Sva, Acrv1, and Svs2, but not Svp2, Msmb, or Spink3) exhibit unambiguous evidence of positive selection. One of these, the seminal vesicle-derived protein Svs2, also shows some evidence for a concentration of positive selection in those lineages in which sperm competition is common. However, this was not a general trend among all the rodent genes we examined. Using the same methods, we then reanalyzed previously published data on 2 primate genes, SEMG1 and SEMG2. Although SEMG2 also shows evidence of positive selection concentrated in lineages subject to high levels of sperm competition, no such trend was found for SEMG1. Overall, despite a high rate of positive selection being a feature of many ejaculate proteins, these results indicate that the action of sexual selection potentially responsible for elevated evolutionary rates may be difficult to detect on a gene-by-gene basis. Although the extreme diversity of reproductive phenotypes exhibited in nature attests to the power of sexual selection, the extent to which this force predominates in driving the rapid molecular evolution of reproductive genes therefore remains to be determined.","[Ramm, Steven A.; Stockley, Paula] Univ Liverpool, Fac Vet Sci, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Oliver, Peter L.; Ponting, Chris P.] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, MRC, Funct Genet Unit, Oxford, England; [Emes, Richard D.] UCL, Dept Biol, London, England","Emes, RD (corresponding author), Keele Univ, Sch Med, Inst Sci & Technol Med, Keele, Staffs, England.",r.d.emes@hfac.keele.ac.uk,"Ponting, Chris/AAV-2621-2021; Oliver, Peter/F-1453-2010; Emes, Richard D/C-5341-2008; Ramm, Steven/C-4907-2008; Oliver, Peter/AAS-4022-2020","Emes, Richard D/0000-0001-6855-5481; Ramm, Steven/0000-0001-7786-7364; Oliver, Peter/0000-0003-3347-2461; Ponting, Chris/0000-0003-0202-7816","Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [MC_U137761446, G90/112] Funding Source: Medline",,,72,96,97,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0737-4038,1537-1719,,MOL BIOL EVOL,Mol.

We examined the potential for heterospecific pollen transfer (HPT) in a community of four Acacia species in a highly seasonal tropical habitat in Mexico. Partitioning of pollen flow among sympatric species appears to be achieved, in part, through segregation of flowering in seasonal time, and interspecific differences in pollinator guilds. However, two coflowering species (Acacia macracantha and Acacia angustissima) shared multiple flower visitors, raising the possibility of HPT. Each of these coflowering species showed high intraspecific daily synchrony in pollen release, but dehisce at different times of day. Pollinators rapidly harvested available pollen from one species before abandoning it to visit the flowers of the second later in the day. The activity of shared pollinators, predominantly bees, is thus structured throughout the day, and potential for HPT reduced. Suggestive evidence in favour of a resource partitioning explanation for this pattern is provided by the fact that A. macracantha showed significantly greater intraspecific synchrony when coflowering with a potential competitor (A. angustissima) than when flowering alone. We discuss our results in light of previous work on coflowering acacia assemblages in Tanzania and Australia.","[Raine, Nigel E.; Pierson, Alice Sharp; Stone, Graham N.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Raine, NE (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",n.e.raine@qmul.ac.uk,"Raine, Nigel/AAK-6425-2020","Raine, Nigel/0000-0001-6343-2829","William Edward's Educational Charity; Department of Zoology, University of Oxford; Magdalen College, Oxford; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [GR9/03553]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission; E.

We tested these hypotheses by the application of permanent and fluctuating water levels to experimental wet dune plant communities with four species that frequently occur in wet dune slacks (Carex flacca, Molinia caerulea, Samolus valerandi and Schoenus nigricans) and one competitive species of drier conditions (Calamagrostis epigejos). After 3 years, fluctuating water levels had led to lower total biomass production than permanent water levels, indicating that switching from aerated to anoxic soil conditions involved physiological costs. The collective biomass of wetland species was highest at permanently waterlogged conditions with interspecific variation in the biomass optima. At the nutrient-poor growth conditions of this long-term experiment, biomass of Calamagrostis was independent of water level treatment, thus the hypothesized competitive superiority of this species at drier conditions could not explain the biomass responses of the wetland species in this study. Instead, this is evidence for an ecological preference of adult wet dune plants for waterlogged to moist conditions. Recruitment of most wet dune slack species occurred in a narrower range of water levels than adult growth, indicating that recruitment requirements also pose a limitation to the distribution of these wet dune species. Incorporation of recruitment into nature management support models may improve their predictions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To address whether the field distributions of AM fungal species represented their fundamental or realized niches, we grew representative species of the two dominant genera, Glomus and Gigaspora, alone or together on Sorghum bicolor plants in sand, clay or a sand/clay mixture in the glasshouse. 3 In the field, soil characteristics and spatial structure accounted for significant proportions of the variation in community composition among sites, suggesting that both environmental variables and dispersal were important factors shaping AM fungal communities. 4 AM fungi in the family Glomeraceae occurred predominately in clay soils, whereas AM fungi in the family Gigasporaceae dominated in sand soils. Niche space of Glomeraceae was further partitioned by levels of soil organic carbon and nitrogen. 5 In the glasshouse, root colonization by Glomus was high in all three soils when grown in the absence of Gigaspora, indicating a broad fundamental niche. Root colonization by Gigaspora was negatively correlated with percentage clay when grown in the absence of Glomus, consistent with the low abundance of this family in clay soils in the field. When grown together, spore production of both Glomus and Gigaspora was significantly reduced only in the sand soil, indicating that competition could limit niches of both families in certain soil environments. 6 Our results suggest that AM fungal distributions are the product of environment, interspecific competition and regional spatial dynamics, emphasizing the importance of using a metacommunity perspective in community ecology.","Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Inst Environm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; W Virginia Univ, Div Plant & Soil Sci, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Lekberg, Y (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",ylva@montana.edu,"Koide, Roger/AAE-7763-2020; Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021; Koide, Roger T/I-4033-2012","Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422; Koide, Roger T/0000-0002-5209-5422",,,,62,256,275,4,140,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

As the occurrence and intensity of flooding are predicted to change dramatically as a result of climate change, predicting the consequences of such changes has become a major task for community ecology. Here we present abundance data of five species that comprise a species-poor community of high conservation value at lakeshores of Lake Constance over 17 years, during which one of the longest flood periods and the lowest water levels since 1890 occurred. We used simple regression models and increasingly sophisticated Markov chain models plus non-linear parameter estimation to put down abundance changes to direct effects of flooding on population-dynamic parameters and to indirect effects of flooding through modification of interspecific competition. We found a negative effect of flood duration on abundance changes for the non-specialist species Agrostis stolonifera and Phalaris arundinacea, but no effect on Carex acuta. The specialist species, Ranunculus reptans but not Littorella uniflora showed a positive effect of flooding. Data analysis revealed an unambiguous competitive hierarchy with the two graminoid species (C acuta, P. arundinacea) being superior, and the habitat specialists being most sensitive to interspecific competition. We used estimated parameters to project the community dynamics under different flooding regimes. Long-term projection showed that the original community is threatened by two non-specialist species (C acuta and P. arundinacea). Even if this forecast was influenced by various model limitations, it may indicate irreversible changes in soil fertility during the phase of high eutrophication between 1950 and 1980. Our study demonstrated that long-term abundance releves combined with Markov modelling and predictive simulations are an important counterpart to detailed short-term studies. The combination of empirical and theoretical methods elucidates the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors in community change. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

We studied the occurrence and abundance patterns of two congeneric flea species on black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) hosts to test for interactions among parasite species. We live-trapped prairie dogs on ten sites in Boulder County, CO and collected their fleas. We found a non-random, positive association between the two flea species, Oropsylla hirsuta and O. tuberculata cynomuris; hosts with high loads of one flea species had high loads of the second species. This result suggests that there is no interspecific competition among fleas on prairie dog hosts. Host weight had a weak negative relationship to flea load and host sex did not influence flea load, though there were slight differences in flea prevalence and abundance between male and female C. ludovicianus. While genetic and behavioral variation among hosts may predispose certain individuals to infection, our results indicate apparent facilitation among flea species that may result from immune suppression or other flea-mediated factors.","Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Bacterial Zoonoses Branch, Div Vector Borne Infect Dis, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Brinkerhoff, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,"Brinkerhoff, Jory/I-9364-2012",,,,,60,25,26,0,14,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,CORONA,"1966 COMPTON AVE, CORONA, CA 92881 USA",1081-1710,1948-7134,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

Using meta-analysis and comparative phylogenetic analysis, we provide a global-scale test of whether reproduction becomes more limited by pollen receipt (pollen limitation) as the number of coexisting plant species increases. As predicted, we find a significant positive relationship between pollen limitation and species richness. in addition, this pattern is particularly strong for species that are obligately outcrossing and for trees relative to herbs or shrubs. We suggest that plants occurring in species-rich communities may be more prone to pollen limitation because of interspecific competition for pollinators. As a consequence, plants in biodiversity hotspots may have a higher risk of extinction and/or experience increased selection pressure to specialize on certain pollinators or diversify into different phenological niches. The combination of higher pollen limitation and habitat destruction represents a dual risk to tropical plant species that has not been previously identified.","Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia","Vamosi, JC (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",jvamosi@ucalgary.ca,,"Burd, Martin/0000-0002-1175-2596",,,,29,180,183,0,74,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

We argue that copulation calls have two immediate functions: to encourage mating attempts by other males and to increase mate guarding by the consort male. We hypothesize that female copulation calls have evolved under the selective pressures of risk of infanticide and sperm competition. When male mate guarding is effective, copulation calls allow females to concentrate paternity in dominant males and benefit from their protection against the risk of infanticide. When mate guarding is ineffective, copulation calls may bring genetic benefits to females through facilitation of sperm competition. We present a quantitative model in which interspecific variation in females' promiscuity predicts their tendency to use copulation calls in conjunction with mating. The model predicts that in species with little female promiscuity, copulation calls should be rare and exhibited only in association with mating with dominant males. In species in which females are highly promiscuous, copulation calls should be frequent and unrelated to male dominance rank. The limited data available to test the model support its main predictions as well as the predicted relation between copulation calls and male dominance rank.","Univ Chicago, Anim Behav Res Grp, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; German Primate Ctr, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Zurich, Anthropol Inst & Museum, CH-2057 Zurich, Switzerland","Maestripieri, D (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Anim Behav Res Grp, 5730 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",dario@uchicago.edu,"Engelhardt, Antje/A-2660-2013","Engelhardt, Antje/0000-0003-2704-7493",,,,47,44,45,2,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Community structure is often thought to be determined by interspecific competition. Critics of this idea state that we must first demonstrate structure with null models to test whether structure indeed exists. Here, we use 179 predatory and saprophagic species of flies in the family Muscidae (Diptera) that were captured in Malaise traps in six locations in Parand State during one year of study. To test community structure, we generated five presence-absence (1-0) matrices: two by trophic guilds, two by habitat, and one general matrix (taxonomic). Two indices of co-occurrence (C) and covariance (V) of species were calculated in the matrices developed through 5,000 Monte Carlo randomizations. Randomizations followed two different assumptions: 1) fixed number of species per location, and 2) constant proportions of species at all locations. Comparisons with null-model communities showed that taxonomic species assemblage had a false structure, while ecological species assemblages had true structure. Although the ecological assemblages are consistent with the theory of interspecific competition as a cause of community structure, it remains possible that other causes of structure may also be important.","Univ Fed Parana, Dept Zool, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; Ctr Ciencias Agrarias & Ambientais, BR-85010990 Guarapuava, PR, Brazil","Rodriguez-Fernandez, JI (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Dept Zool, Caixa Postal 19020, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",formycusub@yahoo.com.br; cjbcarva@ufpr.br; moura@unicentro.br,"de Carvalho, Claudio J B/B-6386-2013; moura, mauricio o./J-8128-2019; Moura, Mauricio O/B-1063-2013","de Carvalho, Claudio J B/0000-0002-3533-6853; moura, mauricio o./0000-0001-7948-2986; Moura, Mauricio O/0000-0001-7948-2986",,,,43,11,13,0,5,SOC BRASILEIRA ENTOMOLOGIA,CURITIBA,"CAIXA POSTAL 19030, CURITIBA, PR 81531-980, BRAZIL",0085-5626,1806-9665,,REV BRAS ENTOMOL,Rev.

Population density of both species was relatively high. Selection indices from both population surveys and animal movement data showed that T. billardierii and M. rufogriseus had similar patterns of habitat selection at two spatio-temporal scales; home range within the study area and habitats selected while foraging at night. Both species selected for young Eucalyptus nitens plantation with high weed-cover within their home range. At night, T. billardierii and M. rufogriseus selected for open habitats (young plantation and grassland) and avoided closed habitats (native forest and 5-7 years old E. nitens plantation). There was no evidence for resource partitioning between species at these scales. In contrast, the two species differed in their selection for daytime sheltering habitat; T. billardierii selected native forest while M. rufogriseus selected older plantation. This may reflect differences in their predator avoidance strategies; that is, crypsis versus flight, rather than resource partitioning as a result of interspecific competition. The environment appears to be of high quality for both species, with patches of feeding and shelter habitats within close proximity of one another.","Univ Tasmania, Cooperat Res Ctr Sustainable Prod Forestry, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Mcarthur, C (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Cooperat Res Ctr Sustainable Prod Forestry, Private Bag 5, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",claremc@usyd.edu.au,"McArthur, Clare/A-3637-2011; McArthur, Clare/AAI-2493-2020","McArthur, Clare/0000-0002-7867-414X; McArthur, Clare/0000-0002-7867-414X",,,,55,35,37,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,SEP,2005,30,6,,,,,674,683,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01510.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,959GG,WOS:000231505500006,,,,,2021-09-21,

They are prime candidates for neutral dynamics because they contain ecologically similar species whose low adult density is likely to cause widespread recruitment limitation, which slows competitive dynamics. However, many pioneer guilds appear to be differentiated according to seed size. In this paper, we compare predictions from a neutral model of community structure with three niche-based models in which trade-offs involving seed size form the basis of niche differentiation. We test these predictions using sowing experiments with a guild of seven pioneer species from chalk grassland. We find strong evidence for niche structure based on seed size: specifically large-seeded species produce fewer seeds but have a greater chance of establishing on a per-seed basis. Their advantage in establishment arises because there are more microsites suitable for their germination and early establishment and not directly through competition with other seedlings. In fact, seedling densities of all species were equally suppressed by the addition of competitors' seeds. By the adult stage, despite using very high sowing densities, there were no detectable effects of interspecific competition on any species. The lack of interspecific effects indicates that niche differentiation, rather than neutrality, prevails.","Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Turnbull, LA (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, Winterhurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",lindsayt@uwinst.unizh.ch,"Turnbull, Lindsay A./A-2680-2012",,,,,47,49,53,1,30,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Positive interaction among plants has been investigated thoroughly in saline marshes, which display a definite, predictable pattern of species zonation, with facilitation playing an important role during colonization of bare or disturbed patches of marsh. The few studies that have investigated facilitation in freshwater marshes have implicated the processes of sediment oxygenation and sediment stabilization. Whereas both processes are known to be influenced by many freshwater hydrophyte species, they have not been considered widely as mechanisms of interspecific facilitation. In the tussock-forming rush Juncus effusus L., late-Spring collapse of culms away from the tussock center results in a morphology that increases light availability atop tussocks and appears to establish a unique spatio-temporal component to the effect of Juncus on neighbors. In previous work, shading around the tussock periphery, influenced largely by this collapse of culms, was shown to suppress production and species richness of neighbors; however, various plant species have been observed to grow directly upon the Juncus tussocks in the void left by collapsed culms. To quantify this latter phenomenon, vascular plant abundance was evaluated on tussocks of Juncus effusus in four Mississippi (USA) beaver wetlands to determine the likelihood and nature of positive interactions between Juncus and neighbors. Tussocks in three of these wetlands were examined for tussock microtopography and diameter, relative water depth atop the tussock, and colonization by other plant species. Species richness of colonizing plants correlated positively with tussock diameter in two of these wetlands, and no colonizers were present in the third. Tussock microtopography and elevation differed significantly among wetlands, but species richness was unrelated to relative water depth atop the tussocks. In the fourth beaver marsh, two sets of surveys were conducted to determine whether the species assemblages upon Juncus tussocks differed from those across the entire wetland. Plant assemblages on Juncus tussocks, and on elevated substrata in general, were significantly different from assemblages not associated with elevated surfaces. Thirteen species were associated exclusively with elevated rooting substrata, ten of which were exclusive to Juncus effusus tussocks. The present results suggest that small-scale spatial and temporal shifts occur in the effects of Juncus on neighboring plants. Effects shift from primarily competitive shading interactions resulting from a dense shoot canopy to facilitative interactions atop tussock mounds after mature culms collapse. Facilitation likely is mediated through characteristics of the tussock mound, such as provision of a stable rooting substratum or oxygenation of sediments by the Juncus effusus root system.","Mississippi State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA","Ervin, GN (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",gervin@biology.msstate.edu,,,,,,26,16,18,2,21,SOC WETLAND SCIENTISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E TENTH ST, P O BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0277-5212,,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,JUN,2005,25,2,,,,,317,325,,10.1672/8,,,9,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,940OD,WOS:000230152900008,,,,,2021-09-21,

We studied such relationships in 18 plant communities spread throughout nine Northern Hemisphere high-mountain subalpine and alpine meadow systems and found linear and curvilinear correlative links among temperature, precipitation, productivity, plant interactions, spatial pattern, and richness. We found that sites with comparatively mild climates have greater plant biomass, and at these sites strong competition corresponds with overdispersed distribution of plants, reducing intraspecific patchiness and in turn increasing local richness. Sites with cold climates have little biomass, and at these sites a high proportion of species benefit from strong facilitative effects of neighbors, leading to an aggregated distribution of plants. Sites with intermediate, or relatively moderate climates are intermediate in biomass, and at these sites interactions are weak (or competition may be counterbalanced by facilitation), corresponding with a nearly random distribution of plants. At these sites species richness is lower than average. We propose that the relationship between interspecific spatial pattern and community richness reflects niche differentiation and/or construction, which allows for the coexistence of more species than would be possible with random, unstructured spatial distributions. Discovering the mechanisms that drive the relationships described here would further link functional and structural components of plant communities and enhance the predictive capability of community ecology.","Consejo Super Invest Cientif, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria 04001, Spain; Georgian Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Tbilisi 380007, Georgia; Banchory Res Stn, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BY, Aberdeen, Scotland; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Stn Alpine Lautaret, F-38041 Grenoble, France; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble, France; Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89512 USA; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59818 USA; Univ Bordeaux 1, Equipe Ecol Communautes, BIOGECO, INRA,UMR 1202, F-33405 Talence, France","Kikvidze, Z (corresponding author), Consejo Super Invest Cientif, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria 04001, Spain.",zaal@eeza.csic.es,"Choler, Philippe/A-7270-2008; Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008; Brooker, Rob W/F-9569-2012; lortie, christopher j/F-6241-2014","Choler, Philippe/0000-0002-9062-2721; Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827; Brooker, Rob W/0000-0002-7014-0071; lortie, christopher j/0000-0002-4291-7023",,,,33,171,177,6,152,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2005,86,6,,,,,1395,1400,,10.1890/04-1926,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,934QQ,WOS:000229723700003,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Although sperm-dependent parthenogenesis has some of the disadvantages of sex (requiring a mate) without the counterbalancing advantages (mixing of parental genotypes), it appears amongst a wide variety of species. We develop initial models for the density-dependent dynamics of animal populations with sperm-dependent parthenogenesis (pseudogamy or gynogenesis), based on the known biology of the common Enchytraeid worm Lumbricillus lineatus. Its sperm-dependent parthenogenetic populations are reproductive parasites of the hermaphrodite sexual form. Our logistic models reveal two alternative requirements for coexistence at density-dependent equilibria: (i) If the two forms differ in competitive ability, the form with the lower intrinsic birth rate must be compensated by a more than proportionately lower competitive impact from the other, relative to intraspecific competition, (ii) If the two forms differ in their intrinsic capacity to exploit resources, the sperm-dependent parthenogen must be superior in this respect and must have a lower intrinsic birth rate. In general for crowded environments we expect a sperm-dependent parthenogen to compete strongly for limiting resources with the sexual sibling species. Its competitive impact is likely to be weakened by its genetic uniformity, however, and this may suffice to cancel any advantage of higher intrinsic growth rate obtained from reproductive investment only in egg production. We discuss likely thresholds of coexistence for other sperm-dependent parthenogens. The fish Poeciliopsis monachalucida likewise obtains an intrinsic growth advantage from reduced investment in male gametes, and so its persistence is likely to depend on it being a poor competitor. The planarian Schmidtea polychroa obtains no such intrinsic benefit because it produces fertile sperm, and its persistence may depend on superior resource exploitation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Among Passeriformes, whether the species' plumage is sexually monochromatic or dichromatic, along with other factors such as introduction effort and interspecific competition, has been identified as a factor that limits introduction success. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sexually dichromatic plumage reduces the probability of success for 51 species from 26 genera of game birds that were introduced onto 12 oceanic islands. Analyses revealed no significant differences in probability of introduction success between monochromatic and dichromatic species at either the generic or specific levels. We also found no significant difference between these two groups in size of native geographic range, wing length or human-introduction effort. Our results do not support the hypothesis that sexually dichromatic plumage (probably a response to sexual selection) predicts introduction outcomes of game birds as has been reported for passerine birds. These findings suggest that passerine and non-passerine birds differ fundamentally in terms of factors that could influence introduction outcome, and should therefore be evaluated separately as opposed to lumping these two groups as 'land birds'.","Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Moulton, MP (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Box 110430, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",moultonm@wec.ufl.edu,"Jetz, Walter/ABF-1517-2020","Jetz, Walter/0000-0002-1971-7277",,,,32,7,7,1,4,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

In the 1990s it became clearer that although trees would yield crucial products and facilitate simultaneous growing of crops, they would also exert strong competitive effects on crops. In the meanwhile, a number of instruments for measuring the use of growth resources, exploratory and predictive models, and production assessment tools were developed to aid in understanding the opportunities and biophysical limits of SAFS. Following a review of the basic concepts of interspecific competition and facilitation between plants in general, this chapter synthesizes positive and negative effects of trees on crops, and discusses how these effects interact under different environmental resource conditions and how this imposes tradeoffs, biophysical limitations and management requirements in SAFS. The scope and limits of some of the research methods and tools, such as analytical and simulation models, that are available for assessing and predicting to a certain extent the productive outcome of SAFS are also discussed. The review brings out clearly the need for looking beyond yield performance in order to secure long-term management of farms and landscapes, by considering the environmental impacts and functions of SAFS.","Colegio Frontera Sur, Chiapas 29290, Mexico; World Agroforestry Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya","Garcia-Barrios, L (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur, Carretera Panamer & Perisur S-N, Chiapas 29290, Mexico.",lgarcia@sclc.ecosur.mx,"Garcia Barrios, Luis/B-6470-2013","Garcia Barrios, Luis/0000-0001-8227-7748",,,,59,55,56,0,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Throughout the most recent glacial period (Weichsel), the mountain hare Lepus timidus had a continuous distribution in the tundra habitat south of the ice-rim. When the ice retreated, mountain hares colonized deglaciated land, and spread over northern Europe. 2. Since the Weichsel, the mountain hare's distribution in Europe has been gradually reduced and at present comprises Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, high altitudes in the Alps, isolated forests in eastern Poland, most of Fennoscandia and from the Baltic countries eastwards through Russia. Declines during the last century have been observed in Sweden and Russia. 3. This review defines and evaluates causes for this gradual reduction and fragmentation of the mountain hare's distribution, with special focus on interactions with brown hares Lepus europaeus . The relative importance of diseases, predation, cultivation and interactions with other herbivores than brown hares are discussed. 4. A plausible cause of the possible permanent disappearance of mountain hares in Europe appears to be exclusion by interspecific competition and hybridization with, and/or epidemic diseases mediated by, the congeneric brown hare.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Conservat Biol & Genet, EBC, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Thulin, CG (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Conservat Biol & Genet, EBC, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",carl-gustaf.thulin@ebc.uu.se,,,,,,78,66,71,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,MAR,2003,33,1,,,,,29,42,,10.1046/j.1365-2907.2003.00008.x,,,14,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,658VE,WOS:000181740500003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Because harsh edaphic conditions in marshes can be ameliorated by neighboring plants, plant neighbors can have net competitive or facilitative interactions, depending on ambient physical stresses. In particular, high soil salinities, which are largely controlled by solar radiation and the evaporation of marsh porewater. can be ameliorated by plant neighbors under stressful conditions leading to facilitative interactions. Under less stressful edaphic conditions, these same neighbors may be competitors. In this paper, we use this mechanistic understanding of marsh plant interactions to examine the hypothesis that latitudinal and inter-annual variation in climate can influence the nature and strength of marsh plant species interactions. We quantified the relationship between climate and species interactions by transplanting marsh plants into ambient vegetation and unvegetated bare patches at sites north and south of Cape Cod, a major biogeographic barrier on the east coast of North America. We hypothesized that the cooler climate north of Cape Cod would lead to fewer positive interactions among marsh plants. We found both latitudinal and inter-annual variation in the neighbor relations of marsh plants that paralleled latitudinal differences in temperature and salinity. South of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions tended to be more facilitative, whereas north of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions were more competitive. At all sites, soil salinity increased and plant neighbor interactions were more facilitative in warmer versus cooler years. Our results show that interspecific interactions can be strikingly linked to climate. but also reveal that because the sensitivity of specific species interactions to climatic variation is highly variable, predicting how entire communities will respond to climate change will be difficult, even in relatively simple, well-studied systems.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Bertness, MD (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,35,163,170,2,86,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2002,132,3,,,,,392,401,,10.1007/s00442-002-0972-y,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,589HJ,WOS:000177752500009,28547417,,,,2021-09-21,

Congeneric monogenean (platyhelminth) ectoparasites parasitizing the gills of one host species were used as an ecological model. Morphometric distances of the attachment organ and morphometric distances of the copulatory organ between species pairs were calculated, Levin's niche size and Renkonen niche overlap indices were applied. Our results support the prediction that the function of niche segregation is to achieve reproductive isolation of related species in order to prevent hybridization (reinforcement of reproductive barriers). Parasite species living in the same niche differ greatly in the size of copulatory organ. Moreover, species coexistence is facilitated by an increase in morphometric distances of copulatory organ and niche centre distances. Our results also show that species living in overlapping niches have similar attachment organs, which supports the prediction that morphologically similar species have the same ecological requirements within one host and suggests small effects of interspecific competition for the evolution of morphological diversity of attachment organs. Specialist adaptations also seem to facilitate species coexistence and affect the niche distribution within host species. Parasite species that can colonize more than one host species, i.e. generalists, occupy more distant niches within host species than strictly host-specific parasites.

Yet the theory of coevolution of mutualists is virtually nonexistent, by contrast with well-developed coevolutionary theories of competition, predator-prey and host-parasite interactions. This has prevented resolution of a basic puzzle posed by mutualisms: their persistence in spite of apparent evolutionary instability. The selective advantage of 'cheating', that is, reaping mutualistic benefits while providing fewer commodities to the partner species, is commonly believed to erode a mutualistic interaction, leading to its dissolution or reciprocal extinction. However, recent empirical findings indicate that stable associations of mutualists and cheaters have existed over long evolutionary periods. Here, we show that asymmetrical competition within species for the commodities offered by mutualistic partners provides a simple and testable ecological mechanism that can account for the long-term persistence of mutualisms. Cheating, in effect, establishes a background against which better mutualists can display any competitive superiority. This can lead to the coexistence and divergence of mutualist and cheater phenotypes, as well as to the coexistence of ecologically similar, but unrelated mutualists and cheaters.","Ecole Normale Super, Ecol Lab, Unit Math Ecoevolut Biol, F-75230 Paris 05, France; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Adapt Dynam Network, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettr & Informat, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Ferriere, R (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, Ecol Lab, Unit Math Ecoevolut Biol, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75230 Paris 05, France.",regis.ferriere@snv.jussieu.fr,"Ferriere, Regis/S-8050-2017","Ferriere, Regis/0000-0002-5806-5566",,,,55,193,197,0,111,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The expanding range of T piniperda, its ability to develop and shoot-feed in most North American pine species, and its relatively early spring activity have generated questions about its potential interactions with native competitors and natural enemies. Our objectives were to compare phenology of T piniperda with native phloem-feeding insects and to evaluate phenological synchrony between T. piniperda and native predators in red pine forest stands. We monitored adult beetle activity using baited funnel traps and observations of insect activity on freshly cut red pine logs in four to eight stands in southwestern and northern lower Michigan during two field seasons. Logs were periodically returned to the laboratory and individually caged. Phloem-feeders, predators and parasitoids emerging from logs were identified. Tomicus piniperda was collected only in southwestern stands and was consistently the first scolytid collected in funnel traps. Ten native phloem-feeding species were collected in funnel traps or reared from logs; at least two native species were actively colonizing logs concommitently with T piniperda in early spring. We observed adults of the predatory clerid Thanasimus dubius (F.) actively moving on logs and preying on T piniperda adults and other scolytids early in spring, roughly 3-4 A before this species was first collected in funnel traps. Other native scolytid predators including Cucujus clavipes F. and three staphylinids were also active early in spring. Results suggests that T piniperda is likely to encounter interspecific competitors and natural enemies in North America, but further research will be needed to demonstrate how these interactions affect T piniperda population dynamics.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Kennedy, AA (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,56,15,16,0,11,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Acomys cahirinus is nocturnal and A. russatus is diurnal. although it becomes nocturnal if its congener is experimentally removed, suggesting that the temporal partitioning is driven by interspecific competition. Such extreme temporal partitioning within the diel cycle has not previously been recorded elsewhere among mammals. Using artificial food patches. we studied microhabitat use and foraging efficiencies under seasonally variable predator regimes and physiological pressures to assess the roles that habitat structure and foraging behavior might play in coexistence. The two species showed trade-offs in foraging efficiency leading to different strategies of microhabitat use that may help promote coexistence. A. cahirinus is a cream skimmer, a relatively inefficient forager that gives up at relatively high giving-up densities, and a habitat generalist: whereas A. russatus is a habitat specialist, perhaps compensating for this restricted niche by foraging very efficiently to low giving-up densities. Seasonal shifts in foraging microhabitat suggest that the response to predation risk from snakes in summer overrides and opposes the effects of physiological costs and risk from owls and diurnal raptors, leading to increased predatory risk and foraging microhabitat overlap in summer. Temporal partitioning of the food resource may compensate for decreased partitioning of the habitat resource in summer. Provision of cover was more important than escape distance in determining habitat and microhabitat use. Boulder fields in rocky deserts provide a physical structure that is more complex and provides more continuous cover than is available in open deserts, where most research on community structure of desert rodents has been carried out. We propose that this physical structure of rocky deserts, in conjunction with the desert adaptations of A. russatus, may enable the extreme temporal partitioning to opposite parts of the diel cycle and, therefore, contributes to coexistence in this community.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Jones, M (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Div Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Jones, Menna E/J-7975-2012","Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022",,,,70,84,88,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2001,82,8,,,,,2164,2176,,10.2307/2680223,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,462ZP,WOS:000170452600006,,,,,2021-09-21,

We experimentally tested these predictions in three aquatic food web configurations subjected to either high or low nutrient additions. The results were structured by viewing the systems as either food chains or webs and showed that trophic level biomass increased with enrichment, which contradicts food chain theory. However, within each trophic level, food web configuration affected the extent to which different functional groups responded to enrichment. By dividing trophic levels into functional groups, based on vulnerability to consumption, we were able to identify significant effects that were obscured when systems were viewed as food chains. The results support the prediction that invulnerable prey may stabilize trophic-level dynamics by replacing other, more vulnerable prey. Furthermore, the vulnerable prey, such as Daphnia and edible algae, responded as predicted by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis; that is, variability in population density increased with enrichment. Hence, by describing ecosystems as a matrix of food web interactions, and by recognizing the interplay between interspecific competition and predation, a more complete description of the ecosystem function was obtained compared to when species were placed into distinct trophic levels.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.persson@limnol.lu.se; lars-anders.hansson@limnol.lu.se; christer.bronmark@limnol.lu.se; per.lundberg@teorekol.lu.se; lars.pettersson@zooekol.lu.se; larry.greenberg@kau.se; anders.nilsson@zooekol.lu.se; per.nystrom@limnol.lu.se; pia.romare@limnol.lu.se; lars.tranvik@limno.uu.se,"Lundberg, Per/A-2479-2010; Pettersson, Lars/AAX-3948-2020; Tranvik, Lars J/H-2222-2011; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014","Pettersson, Lars/0000-0001-5745-508X; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835; Persson, Anders/0000-0001-5961-3651; Lundberg, Per/0000-0002-9609-726X; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266",,,,76,68,72,1,55,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

A binary mixed culture of Pseudomonas putida F1 and Burkholderia sp. JS150 degraded toluene, phenol, and their mixture. Both toluene and phenol can serve as sole sources of carbon and energy for both P. putida Fl and strain JS150. To investigate the population dynamics of this system, a fluorescent in-situ hybridization method was chosen because of its ability to produce quantitative data, its low standard error, and the ease of use of this method. When the binary mixed culture was grown on toluene or phenol alone, significant interactions between the species were observed. These interactions could not be explained by a pure-and-simple competition model and were substrate dependent. Strain JS150 growth was slightly inhibited when grown with P. putida Fl on phenol, and P. putida F1 grew more rapidly than expected. Conversely, when the two species were grown together on toluene alone, P. putida Fl was inhibited while strain JS150 was unaffected. During growth of the mixed culture on a combination of toluene and phenol, the interactions were similar to that observed during growth on phenol alone; P. putida Fl growth was enhanced while strain JS150 was unaffected. Because of the observed interspecies interactions, monoculture kinetic parameters were not sufficient to describe the mixed culture kinetics in any experiment. This is one of the first reports of microbial population dynamics in which molecular microbial ecology and mathematical modeling have been combined.

Summer diet overlap between a sheep and a goat population and a sheep and a reindeer population calculated with data on main types of forage plants was 77.0% and 55.1%, respectively. However, overlap calculated with main plant groups was sometimes considerably higher than when calculated for individual forage species.

Correctly used, the approach can lead to some valid interpretations. In order to avoid criticisms, however, researchers should appreciate the assumptions and limitations of this methodology. 2 A replacement series contains confounded species density treatments. Replacement series experiments therefore provide collective results and cannot distinguish separate contributions to interference by the constituents of a mixture. 3 In a replacement diagram, trends in observed yields per species can be due to a multitude of possible levels of intra- and interspecific interference. Similarly, trends in expected yields per species do not represent specific levels of intra- and interspecific interference. A replacement series is therefore unsuitable for the quantitative evaluation of interference or niche differentiation. 4 A standard replacement series, but not a proportional replacement series, may be used to detect an imbalance between intra- and interspecific interference for a component of a mixture. If competition for resources is assumed or known to be the sole cause of interference, then such experiments yield a qualitative evaluation of complementary resource utilization by the mixture components. 5 The possibility of total density dependence impedes generalization from a replacement series result. Other biases, due to initial size and time of observation, may occur with replacement series and related experimental structures. 6 Results from a replacement series are of questionable value in predicting the long-term outcome of an association between species. 7 Replacement series are a valid setting, but not the only possible setting, for some kinds of yield comparisons. These include comparing productivity of monocultures with that of simple species mixtures. 8 In some cases, interpretations obtained from replacement series have not been confirmed using other methods but, on the whole, conclusions from replacement series do not seem to be characteristically different from those obtained using other approaches.","Univ British Columbia, Fac Agr Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Jolliffe, PA (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Agr Sci, 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",pjoll@unixg.ubc.ca,,,,,,105,221,235,3,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Considerable year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation occurred during the 10-yr study (1983-1992), with most extreme hut-dry conditions in 1988 during a 3-yr drought. Decreased stream temperature and reduced variation in temperature: occurred downstream from the lake outlet because of increased groundwater inputs. Age-0 bass were captured in the stream in each of the eight years sampled, but bass abundance peaked in downstream reaches in 1988, concurrent with a large increase in the downstream density of age-0 chubs. Median length ratio of bass to chubs increased greatly in the 1988 drought year. The shift in relative length of bass and chubs during the drought was because chub length decreased in downstream areas, and bass shifted from feeding an invertebrates to feeding on chubs in downstream but not in upstream reaches. Comparison of bass and chub growth in the presence and absence of interspecific competition for invertebrate resources in an experimental stream revealed higher growth rates for chubs than for bass and little interspecific competition. Experiments in the artificial stream indicated that the presence or absence of chubs susceptible to bass predation had only marginal effects on bass survival, but growth rates of bass were substantially higher if chubs susceptible to predation were present. Only when chubs were present was the growth of individual bass dependent strongly on size, and this led to rapid divergence in the size distribution of bass in chubs vs. no-chubs treatments. Our results indicate that hot-dry climatic conditions associated with drought have potentially strong effects on size-structured trophic interactions between age-0 fish along lake-stream gradients. Hot-dry climatic conditions alter the spatial distribution of lake fish along temperature gradients in the stream, the reproductive success and synchrony of lake and stream fish development, and the eventual growth of predatory lake species. The response of fish to climatic variation appears to be strongly influenced by their position in the hydrologic landscape. The most dramatic fish response occurred in stream reaches influenced by groundwater.","Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, Univ Stn, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA; Univ Lodz, Dept Appl Ecol, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland","Schlosser, IJ (corresponding author), Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, Univ Stn, Box 9019, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",,,"Lapinska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-4421-8330",,,,58,41,42,0,42,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,1046,1057,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1046:CVASSI]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500015,,,,,2021-09-21,

The common spiny mouse (A. cahirinus) is nocturnally active whereas the golden spiny mouse (A. russatus) is diurnally active. An early removal study suggested that competition accounts for this pattern of temporal partitioning: the golden spiny mouse is forced into diurnal activity by its congener. Theoretically, temporal segregation should facilitate coexistence if the shared limiting resources differ at different times (primarily among predators whose prey populations have activity rhythms), or if they are renewed within the period of the temporal segregation. We studied food preferences of the two Acomys species in a controlled cafeteria experiment in order to assess resource overlap and the potential for competition for food between the two species. We found no significant difference in food preferences between species. The dietary items preferred by both were arthropods. We also carried out a seasonal study of the percentage and identity of arthropods taken in the field by individuals of the two species. Individuals of both species took on annual; average a high percentage of arthropods in their diets. Seasonal diet shifts reflect seasonal abundance of arthropods at Fin Gedi during day and night. Diurnal activity may also reduce interspecific interference competition between A. russatus and A. cahirinus. However, the strong interspecific dietary overlap in food preference, the heavy reliance on arthropods in spiny mouse diets, and the seasonal and circadian differences in arthropod consumption suggest that prey partitioning may be a viable mechanism of coexistence in this system.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Kronfeld-Schor, N (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",Kronfeld@bu.edu,"Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/AAU-3792-2020","Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/0000-0002-5224-3341",,,,52,81,85,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1999,121,1,,,,,123,128,,10.1007/s004420050913,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245WT,WOS:000083131600014,28307881,,,,2021-09-21,

Our objective was to compare these with respect to three characteristics: (1) species richness and representation of trophic groups; (2) the degree to which these assemblages exhibit nested community structure; and (3) the extent to which competitive interactions appear to influence local community assembly. Location We studied small mammal communities from the deserts of North America (N = 201 sites) and two regions in Central Asia (the Gobi Desert (N = 97 sites) and the Turan Desert Region (N = 36 sites), including the Kara-Kum, Kyzyl-Kum, NE Daghestan, and extreme western Kazakhstan Deserts). Method To provide baseline data we characterized each desert region in terms of alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, and in terms of the distribution of taxa across trophic and locomotory groups. We evaluated nestedness of these communities using the Nestedness Temperature Calculator developed by Atmar & Patterson (1993, 1995), and we evaluated the role of competitive interactions in community assembly and applied a null model of local assembly under varying degrees of competitive interaction (Kelt et al., 1995, 1996). Results All three desert regions have low alpha diversity and high beta diversity. The total number of species in each region varied, being highest in North America, and lowest in the Turan Desert Region. The deserts studied all present evidence of significant nestedness, but the mechanism underlying this structure appears different in North American and Asia. In North America, simulations strongly implicate interspecific competition as a dominant mechanism influencing community and assemblage structure. In contrast, data from Asian desert rodent communities suggest that these are not strongly influenced by competition; in fact, they have greater numbers of ecologically and morphologically similar species than expected. These results appear to reflect strong habitat selection, with positive associations among species that share similar habitat requirements in these communities. Our analyses support earlier reports suggesting that predation and abiotic forces may have greater influences on the assembly and organization of Asian desert rodent communities, whereas interspecific competition dominates assembly processes in North America. Additionally, we suggest that structuring mechanisms may be very different among the two Asian deserts studied. Gobi assemblages appear structured by trophic and locomotory strategies. In contrast, Turan Desert Region assemblages appear to be randomly structured with respect to locomotory strategies. When trophic and locomotory categories are combined, however, Turan species are positively and nonrandomly associated. Main conclusions Very different ecological dynamics evidently exist not only between these continents, but within them as well. These small mammal faunas differ greatly in terms of community structure, but also appear to differ in the underlying mechanisms by which communities are assembled. The underlying role of history and geography are strongly implicated as central features in understanding the evolution of mammalian faunas in different deserts of the world.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Anim Evolut Morphol & Ecol, Moscow 117071, Russia; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ramon Sci Ctr, IL-80600 Mizpe Ramon, Israel; Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Kelt, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,"Rogovin, Konstantin/ABH-2370-2020","Rogovin, Konstantin/0000-0002-8854-4445",,,,92,28,31,0,28,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

One way is by reducing the overall intensity of competition via aggregated utilisation of fragmented resources. Known as the 'aggregation model of coexistence', this system assumes saturation and an equilibrium number of species per community. In this study we tested the effects of interspecific aggregation on the level of intraspecific aggregation among ectoparasites of marine fishes (36 communities of gill and head ectoparasite species). If parasite species are distributed in a way that interspecific aggregation is reduced relative to intraspecific aggregation then species coexistence is facilitated, We found a positive relationship between parasite species richness and fish body size, controlling for host phylogeny, A positive relationship between infracommunity species richness and total parasite species richness was also found, providing no evidence for saturation, This result supports the view that infracommunities of parasites are not saturated by local parasite residents. The observed lack of saturation implies that we are far from a full exploitation of the fish resource by parasites. Ectoparasites were aggregated at both population and species levels. However, only half of the ectoparasite communities were dominated by negative interspecific aggregation. We found that infracommunity parasite species richness was positively correlated with the level of intraspecific aggregation versus interspecific aggregation. This means that intraspecific aggregation increases compared with interspecific aggregation when total parasite species richness increases, controlling fish size and phylogeny. This supports one assumption of the 'aggregation model of coexistence', which predicts that interspecific interactions are reduced relative to intraspecific interactions, facilitating species coexistence.

However, little is known about the sources of intraspecific variation in testis size, although such variation may have functional significance. Variation in testis size and asymmetry was studied within and between eight geographically separated (and genetically differentiated) populations of greenfinches Carduelis chloris. The relationships between testis size and plumage brightness (degree of yellowness) and the prevalence of haematozoan infections were also investigated in three of these populations, as they related to the predictions of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis, and Moller's hypothesis relating directional testis asymmetry to phenotypic quality. There were large differences between populations in testis size, with males from northern populations having larger testes than those from southern populations. Within populations, large testes were associated with larger body size and greater age. When the influence of these factors was removed statistically, males with large testes were more likely to be infected with haematozoan parasites, and had brighter yellow plumage. No evidence was found that directional asymmetry in testis size was related to either of these measures of phenotypic quality. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that males with large testes, while signalling higher phenotypic quality as revealed by increased plumage brightness, also pay a cost in terms of reduced immunocompetence, revealed by the increased probability of infection in these males. That these patterns were similar in three different populations adds further strength to these conclusions. Our results suggest that studying the sources of variation in testis size among individuals can reveal interesting processes in sexual selection.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Uppsala Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Populat Biol, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Merila, J (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Populat Biol, Villavagen 9, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",juha.merila@zoologi.uu.se,"Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008; Sheldon, Ben C/A-8056-2010","Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072; Sheldon, Ben C/0000-0002-5240-7828",,,,51,54,56,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

We took an experimental approach to investigate whether absence of A. carolinensis and A. sagrei from these islands results from the inability of populations to become established and whether the presence of the other species has a negative effect on population density and probability of successful colonization. We introduced propagules of five lizards of each species, either in allopatry or sympatry, on five blocks of three islands each. Populations were censused yearly using mark-recapture methods. Anolis sagrei populations thrived on almost all islands, whereas within three years, many A. carolinensis populations had gone extinct, and most others were very small. We conclude that an inability to successfully establish populations on small islands might explain the absence of A. carolinensis from these islands, but not the absence of A. sagrei. Anolis carolinensis was not more likely to become extinct on islands containing A. sagrei, but population densities of A. carolinensis were lower on islands with both species (sympatric islands) compared to allopatric islands. In addition, A. carolinensis tended to perch higher, relative to available vegetation, on sympatric islands than they did on allopatric islands. conversely, the presence of A. carolinensis had little impact on A. sagrei populations. However, inspection of population changes through time suggest that A. carolinensis may have initially had an effect on A. sagrei, but this effect decreased as A. carolinensis populations declined. The observed absence of A. sagrei from these islands may indicate that its dispersal abilities are limited relative to the frequency of devastating hurricanes.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Losos, JB (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",Losos@biodec.wustl.edu,,,,,,27,43,50,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1999,80,1,,,,,252,258,,10.2307/176994,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,157DV,WOS:000078045600019,,,,,2021-09-21,

We examined mechanisms reducing interspecific pollen flow in a community of 10 Acacia species in a highly seasonal savannah habitat in Tanzania. Partitioning is achieved, in part, through separation of flowering in space and seasonal time, and through interspecific differences in pollinator guilds. Nevertheless, coflowering Acacia species shared several pollinators; this means that interspecific pollen transfer Is possible. We analyzed daily patterns of pollinator activity and pollen release in 10 Acacia assemblages containing a total of 10 Acacia species. Pollinator activity was scored using counts at flowers over constant time intervals throughout the day. Fallen availability was assessed using a simple method which allows quantification of pollen exposed on the surface of the Acacia inflorescence. Sympatric co-flowering Acacia species each show high intraspecific synchrony but release their pollen at different rimes of day. Pollinators rapidly harvest available pollen and move from one Acacia species to the next, following the daily sequence of pollen release. The activity of shared pollinators is structured throughout the day as a result of temporal patterns of pollen release across Acacia species. The observed temporal structuring of pollen release is compatible with patterns predicted to result from competitive displacement. Additional support or a competition-based explanation for this patterning comes from the observation that an Acacia species flowering without competitors shows no synchronized peak of pollen availability at any time of day.","Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Sch Biol & Med Sci, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland; John Radcliffe Hosp, Inst Mol Med, Oxford OX3 9DS, England","Stone, GN (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Cell Anim & Populat Biol, Ashworth Labs, W Mains Rd,Kings Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,"Stone, Graham/0000-0002-2737-696X",,,,112,119,128,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1998,79,8,,,,,2808,2827,,10.2307/176518,,,20,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,148JF,WOS:000077501000017,,,,,2021-09-21,

We altered soil resource availability during the early stages of stand development after clearcutting of northern hardwood forests to examine the mechanism of competition. Specifically, we sought empirical evidence about the role of various physiological, morphological, allocational, and architectural responses in regulating plant competition. We expected the competitive ability of the extreme pioneer species, Prunus pensylvanica (pin cherry), to be enhanced by increased nutrient supply, with consequent effects at the community and ecosystem levels of organization. Nutrient availability was increased by about three-fold by monthly fertilization for 6 yr in nine even-aged northern hardwood stands dominated by pin cherry, three each of three ages (6, 12, and 18 yr at initiation of the experiment). Measurements in the control plots indicated that the interval of stand development from age 6 to 23 yr was marked by a peak in basal area and leaf area of pin cherry at about age 17 yr, followed by a steady decline in P. pensylvanica dominance thereafter. Fertilization increased and prolonged the dominance of P. pensylvanica, indicating that nutrient limitation accelerates the demise of this species during the second and third decades of stand development. All species in the plots responded to fertilization with increased foliar nutrient (N, P, and K) concentrations and often higher specific leaf area (area:mass ratio), and these responses were most pronounced for P. pensylvanica. Although the light response curve for photosynthesis of P. pensylvanica was altered by fertilization, with higher rates at low light levels, photosynthesis of its principal competitor, Betula papyrifera, was not affected. The marked growth response of P. pensylvanica was accompanied by changes in its canopy architecture, as the trees had more leaf area per unit stem basal area, and proportionally more of this leaf area was in the upper canopy. In contrast, height and leaf area of B. papyrifera were similar in the control and fertilized plots. Seed deposition of P. pensylvanica also increased in the fertilized plots during one year of high seed production. Thus, the performance in competition of P. pensylvanica was improved by the removal of apparent nutrient limitations on its physiological performance, canopy growth, and ability to compete for light. Leaf area index of the fertilized plots was only slightly higher than the control plots, and the same was true for stand basal area. The removal of nutrient limitation increased the intensity of one-sided competition for light by concentrating the dominance among the largest trees; consequently, very high mortality of suppressed stems of all species occurred. The increased dominance of the fast-growing P. pensylvanica contributed to increases in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in the fertilized plots. Some of this ANPP response was probably associated with reduced C allocation to roots in some of the fertilized plots, but this pattern was not consistent across all the stands. The results indicate that the outcome of interspecific competition in mesic forests, where co-limitation by light and soil resources prevails, depends upon the effect of site quality upon the relative intensity of one-sided competition (for light).","Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Maine, Dept Forest Ecosyst Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Fahey, TJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Battles, John J/G-8233-2012","Battles, John J/0000-0001-7124-7893",,,,66,92,100,2,77,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

There is an inherent conflict in agroforestry between expected favourable effects of tree root systems, e.g. on soil fertility and nutrient cycling, and competition between tree and crop roots. Root management attempts to optimise root functions and to stimulate facilitative and complementary interactions. It makes use of the plasticity of root systems to respond to environmental factors, including other root systems, with altered growth and physiology. Root management tools include species selection, spacing, nutrient distribution, and shoot pruning, among others. Root distribution determines potential zones of root interactions in the soil, but are also a result of such interactions. Plants tend to avoid excessive root competition both at the root system level and at the single-root level by spatial segregation. As a consequence, associated plant species develop vertically stratified root systems under certain conditions, leading to complementarity in the use of soil resources. Parameters of root competitiveness, such as root length density, mycorrhization and flexibility in response to water and nutrient patches in the soil, have to be considered for predicting the outcome of interspecific root interactions. The patterns of root activity around individual plants differ between species; knowing these may help to avoid excessive competition and unproductive nutrient losses in agroforestry systems through suitable spacing and fertiliser placement. The possibility of alleviating root competition by supplying limiting growth factors is critically assessed. A wide range of physical, chemical and biological interactions occurs not only in spatial agroforestry, but also in rotational systems. In a final part, the reviewed information is applied to different types of agroforestry systems: associations of trees with annual crops; associations of trees with grasses or perennial fodder and cover crops; associations of different tree and shrub species; and improved fallows.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Appl Bot, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany","Schroth, G (corresponding author), EMBRAPA Amaz Ocidental, CP 319, BR-69011970 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",schroth@internext.com.br,,,,,,102,138,154,1,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

This variation exists alongside variation in female philopatry and dispersal. Socioecological theories have tried to explain variation in female-female social relationships from an evolutionary perspective focused on ecological factors, notably predation and food distribution. According to the current ''ecological model'', predation risk forces females of most diurnal primate species to live in groups; the strength of the contest component of competition for resources within and between groups then largely determines social relationships between females. Social relationships among gregarious females are here characterized as Dispersal-Egalitarian, Resident-Nepotistic, Resident-Nepotistic-Tolerant, or Resident-Egalitarian. This ecological model has successfully explained differences in the occurrence of formal submission signals, decided dominance relationships, coalitions and female philopatry. Group size and female rank generally affect female reproduction success as the model predicts, and studies of closely related species in different ecological circumstances underscore the importance of the model. Some cases, however, can only be explained when we extend the model to incorporate the effects of infanticide risk and habitat saturation. We review evidence in support of the ecological model and test the power of alternative models that invoke between-group competition, forced female philopatry, demographic female recruitment, male interventions into female aggression, and male harassment. Not one of these models can replace the ecological model, which already encompasses the between-group competition. Currently the best model, which explains several phenomena that the ecological model does not, is a ''socioecological model'' based on the combined importance of ecological factors, habitat saturation and infanticide avoidance. We note some points of similarity and divergence with other mammalian taxa; these remain to be explored in detail.","YALE UNIV,DEPT ANTHROPOL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06250; DUKE UNIV,DEPT BIOL ANTHROPOL & ANAT,DURHAM,NC 27708","Sterck, EHM (corresponding author), UNIV UTRECHT,POB 80086,NL-3508 TB UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS.",,"Sterck, Elisabeth/C-1063-2011","Sterck, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1101-6027",,,,190,788,808,3,323,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Revegetation attempts typically fail because of weed competition during the initial stages of establishment. We hypothesized that competitive interactions can be shifted from spotted knapweed to intermediate wheatgrass by increasing wheatgrass seedling density over 1,000 plants m(-2). Spotted knapweed and intermediate wheatgrass were grown in addition series mixtures to assess their interference at low (0 to 1,000 plants m(-2)) versus high (1,000 to 10,000 plants m(-2)) densities. In the spring of 1995, 7 densities (0, 100, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 6,000, and 10,000 plants m(-2)) of each species were seeded in a factorial arrangement (49 density combinations) in a randomized-complete-block design and replicated 3 times at 2 sites in Montana Plants were grown in pots (2,250 mm(2) X 380 mm deep) for 60 days before harvesting. Regressions predicting shoot weight, root weight, total weight, leaf area, and root length were calculated using 1) low knapweed:low wheatgrass, 2) low knapweed:high wheatgrass, 3) high knapweed:low wheatgrass, and 4) high knap weed:high wheatgrass densities. Regression coefficients indicated intraspecific interference was most important in predicting intermediate wheatgrass weight at both sites. At the wet site (457 mm, annually), interspecific interference only occurred at high spotted knapweed densities. At the dry site (305 mm, annually), interspecific interference occurred at low densities. Increasing intermediate wheatgrass from low to high densities removed the effect of spotted knapweed on intermediate wheatgrass where interspecific interference occurred.",,"Velagala, RP (corresponding author), MONTANA STATE UNIV,DEPT PLANT SOIL & ENVIRONM SCI,BOZEMAN,MT 59717, USA.",,,,,,,31,24,24,0,15,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,DENVER,"1839 YORK ST, DENVER, CO 80206",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

First, the unique evolutionary history of lemurs provides an opportunity for an independent test of the predictions of sperm competition theory regarding the relationship between mating system and relative testis size. Second, I examined the evolutionary relationship between the morphological correlates of pre- and postcopulatory competition (i.e., between sexual dimorphism and testis size) because polygamous lemurs, in contrast to other polygamous primates, lack sexual dimorphism. Based on measurements from 174 captive strepsirhines from 24 species, I found that multi-mate species had significantly larger testes than pair-living ones, but that they did not differ significantly from solitary species. This result deviates from theoretical expectations, but may be the result of yet-unknown heterogeneity in mechanisms of male-male competition in both multi-male and solitary species. There was no difference in relative testis size between nonmonogamous lemurs and lorises, indicating that presumably lower levels of precopulatory competition are not necessarily compensated by more intense sperm competition. Body size and phylogenetic effects were also found to considerably affect interspecific variability in testis size. Analyses of independent contrasts revealed that evolutionary changes in mating system, testis size, sexual size, and canine dimorphism were not, or only weakly: associated in this monophyletic group of primates. Additional comprehensive comparative studies of sexual dimorphism, testis size, mating system, and copulatory behavior in these and other taxa are indicated to illuminate general patterns and causes of covariation among these traits.","DUKE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, DURHAM, NC 27706 USA",,,"Kappeler, Peter/B-6825-2012",,,,,123,87,88,0,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year-to-year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11-yr period and for the nine non-drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year-to-year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non-drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity-stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long-standing dispute.",,"Tilman, D (corresponding author), UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, 1987 UPPER BUFORD CIRCLE, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA.",,,,,,,46,957,1088,21,624,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1996,77,2,,,,,350,363,,10.2307/2265614,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TY198,WOS:A1996TY19800002,,,,,2021-09-21,

The purpose of the model is to extrapolate from measurable fine-scale and short-term interactions among individual trees to large-scale and long-term dynamics of forest communities. Field methods, statistical estimators, and model structure were designed simultaneously to ensure that parameters could be estimated from data collected in the field. This paper documents eight aspects of a three-year study to calibrate, test, and analyze the model for the nine dominant and subdominant tree species in transition oak-northern hardwoods forests: 1) Design and structure of the model. The model makes population dynamic forecasts by predicting the fate of every individual tree throughout its life. Species-specific functions predict each tree's dispersal, establishment, growth, mortality, and fecundity. Trees occupy unique spatial positions, and individual performance is affected by the local availability of resources. Competition is mechanistic; resources available to each tree are reduced by neighbors. Although the model was developed to include light, water, and nitrogen, the version described here includes only competition for light (shading and light-dependent performance) because the field data provide little evidence of competition for nitrogen and water over the range of sites examined. 2) Estimates of the model's parameters for each species. The estimates reveal a variety of ''strategic trade-offs'' among the species. For example, species that grow quickly under high light tend to cast relatively little shade, have low survivorship under low light, and have high dispersal. In contrast, species that grow slowly under high light tend to cast relatively dark shade, and to have high survivorship under low light and low dispersal. These trade-offs define one of two dominant ''axes'' of strategic variation. 3) Community level predictions of the model. The model predicts succession from early dominance by species such as Quercus rubra and Prunus serotina, to late dominance by Fagus grandifolia and Tsuga canndensis, with Betula alleganiensis present as a gap phase species in old-growth stands. The model also predicts that old-growth communities will have intraspecifically clumped and interspecifically segregated spatial distributions. 4) An error analysis that identifies community level predictions that are robust given the level of sampling uncertainty in the study. This analysis translates the statistical uncertainty associated with each parameter estimate into statistical uncertainty in the model's predictions. The robust predictions include those mentioned in aspect (3) above. 5) Sensitivity of the model to changes in initial conditions and to changes in the three parameters not included in the error analysis. For example, the model predicts that initial abundances continue to affect community composition well into succession (>300 yr for some species). 6) Tests of the system- and community-level predictions of the model against independent data gleaned from other studies. These tests support the predictions found to be robust in the error analysis, including those predictions mentioned in aspect (3) above. 7) Modeling experiments that determine which aspects of individual performance and inter-neighbor competition are responsible for each of the: robust predictions identified in aspect (4) above and tested in aspect (6) above. This analysis reveals a wide variety of causal relationships, with most parameters contributing to at least one community level phenomenon. 8) An explanation of the diversity of individual level causes identified in aspect (7).

Our goal was to determine the degree to which plasticity in allocation between roots and shoots exists and to search for patterns in such plasticity among species. Our survey included 77 studies representing 206 cases and 129 species. As expected, we found that root weight ratio decreased with increased nitrogen availability in the majority of cases examined, and this response was most consistent when plants were grown individually or in intraspecific competition (versus interspecific competition). Surprisingly, however, we found no evidence to support existing hypotheses that fast-growing species adapted to high soil fertilities exhibit the highest levels of morphological plasticity, or that plasticity is positively associated with competitive ability. Rather, we found that average amounts of plasticity in root weight ratio in response to nitrogen availability were similar among species grouped by maximum relative growth rate and habitat fertility. Similar results were obtained for species categorized by life form, life history or root weight ratio itself, and plasticity in root weight ratio also had no consistent relationship with competitive ability. Numerous difficulties are associated with the attempt to search for pattern using independent studies, however our results lead to the conclusion that strong patterns in plasticity of root weight ratio in response to nitrogen availability among species do not exist. We discuss two reasons for this: (1) the costs of plasticity relative to its benefits are lower than previously predicted and (2) plasticity in traits other than root weight ratio is more important to plant foraging ability.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA","Reynolds, HL (corresponding author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, WK KELLOGG BIOL STN, 3700 E GULL LAKE DR, HICKORY CORNERS, MI 49060 USA.",,,,,,,129,186,192,1,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1996,185,1,,,,,75,97,,10.1007/BF02257566,,,23,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WD377,WOS:A1996WD37700008,,,,,2021-09-21,

We tested this prediction at the intraspecific and the interspecific level by studying the effects of two levels of nitrogen supply on canopy structure and vertical leaf nitrogen distribution in experimental populations of three Carer species that dominate in low-productivity fens (Carer diandra and Carer rostrata) and in high-productivity fens (Carer acutiformis), respectively. The high-productivity species had a significantly higher amount of leaf area per unit ground area, a higher absolute amount of nitrogen in the canopy, proportionally more leaf area in upper canopy regions, and steeper gradients of leaf nitrogen in the canopy than the low-productivity species. Similarly, increased nitrogen supply resulted for each species in a higher amount of leaf area pet unit ground area and a higher absolute amount of nitrogen in the canopy. However, only in C. acutiformis did an enhanced N supply lead to proportionally more leaf area in upper canopy regions and to steeper gradients of leaf nitrogen in the canopy. It is suggested that the observed patterns in Carer acutiformis (a very high canopy with a large amount of leaf area) are not only directed towards maximization of photosynthetic carbon gain, but are also directed towards suppression of other species in the competition for light. The interspecific differences in canopy structure and leaf nitrogen distribution are in agreement with the optimization theory. However, at the phenotypic level the low-productivity species did not show proportionally more leaf area in upper canopy regions and steeper gradients of leaf nitrogen in the canopy upon enhanced N supply, despite a strong increase in the total amount of leaf area. This suggests that low-productivity species have a lower phenotypic plasticity with regards to their vertical leaf distribution pattern and their vertical leaf nitrogen distribution than high-productivity species.",,"AERTS, R (corresponding author), UNIV UTRECHT, DEPT PLANT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, POB 80084, 3508 TB UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,42,41,51,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1994,75,5,,,,,1482,1490,,10.2307/1937471,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NV662,WOS:A1994NV66200026,,,,,2021-09-21,

The number of niche dimensions is very great, but as a working hypothesis it is assumed that a few are sufficient to characterize the niche of a parasite species to a high degree of accuracy. They are host species, microhabitat(s), macrohabitat(s), geographical range, sex and age of host, season, food and hyperparasites. Methods to measure niche width, in particular specificity indices, are discussed, and some examples of niche restriction are described. Proximate and ultimate causes of niche restriction are discussed, mainly using marine parasites as examples. Among proximate causes of one niche dimension, host specificity, are ecological factors restricting exposure to infection to certain host species; host-specific chemical factors that induce hatching, direct infective stages to a host and bring about settlement of a parasite; factors that lead to mortality in or on the wrong host; morphological adaptations that guarantee survival in or on the 'correct' host; and availability of suitable hosts. Many factors are likely to be responsible for microhabitat specificity, but have been little studied, except for some physiological and morphological adaptations to particular microhabitats. Macrohabitats and geographical range may be determined by the distribution of intermediate hosts and certain food items, and by a variety of chemical and physical factors. Hosts of different sexes may differ in feeding habits and the composition of the skin, and thus acquire parasites differentially. Hosts of different age may be differentially infected due to accumulation of parasites with age, loss of parasites due to developing resistance (or immunity), and different size and feeding habits. Among ultimate causes of niche restriction and segregation are avoidance of competition, predation and hyperparasites; facilitation of mating; reinforcement of reproductive barriers; and adaptations to environmental complexity. Few studies permit a decision on which factor or factors are responsible in particular cases. Interspecific competition may play a greater role in helminth communities of some host groups than of others, but it seems that, overall, its role has been exaggerated at least for marine parasites. Some 'classical' examples of microhabitat segregation explained by interspecific competition can also be explained by reinforcement of reproductive barriers. There is evidence for the importance of facilitation of mating in microhabitat restriction, and the availability of many vacant niches indicates that competition, overall, is not of great importance.",,"ROHDE, K (corresponding author), UNIV NEW ENGLAND, DEPT ZOOL, ARMIDALE, NSW 2351, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,93,113,119,0,36,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,,1994,109,,,S,,,S69,S84,,10.1017/S0031182000085097,,,16,Parasitology,Parasitology,PW296,WOS:A1994PW29600007,7854853,,,,2021-09-21,

We censused the fish community at 86 sites, measuring each fish collected and recording physical variables for each site (pool size, substrate composition, cover, etc.). One member of the fauna, a killifish, Rivulus hartii, was widely distributed in the drainage, occurring alone in each headwater but also encountering other fish species below barrier waterfalls. This pattern allowed us to use Rivulus to test four predictions derived from the species interaction hypothesis: (1) Rivulus density (in grams per square metre) would be depressed at sites with other fish species present, when compared to the density expected from physical characteristics of each site as if Rivulus were alone; (2) Rivulus density would decline at points of contact with the piscivorous fish Hoplias malabaricus; (3) local populations of Rivulus found in pools occupied by the predator would show a smaller maximal size than in pools without the predator; and (4) the growth rate of Rivulus would be lowered in the event of a local invasion by the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, another abundant and sometimes co-occurring species in the watershed. The first three predictions were tested with data from the survey, while the fourth prediction was tested by experiments in a nearby stream. We used a factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the physical variables to four factors. A regression analysis of Rivulus density on the four factors, using 43 Rivulus-only pools, was used to predict Rivulus density in nine pools, each in a different tributary, in which Rivulus first encountered a second species after being the only species present upstream of this pool. The expected density was based solely on the physical characteristics of the pool and represented the expected Rivulus density purely from physical attributes, as if Rivulus were the only species present. Comparison of these expected densities with the actual Rivulus densities revealed a consistent negative impact of the presence of other species on Rivulus density, in support of Prediction 1. Overall, actual Rivulus densities at points of contact with other species were about one-third of the density expected if the other species were absent. The distribution of Rivulus was essentially complementary to that of the piscivorous fish, although only one site provided an unambiguous test of Prediction 2, since Hoplias did not ascend the tributaries in this watershed. The size distribution of Rivulus in populations occurring in pools with predators was dominated by small individuals, with none larger than the median size of Rivulus in predator-free populations, supporting Prediction 3. Finally, the competition experiments revealed that adult Poecilia depressed the growth rate of young Rivulus. We conclude that interspecific interactions are important in structuring the geographical distribution and abundance of Rivulus throughout this tropical watershed, and suggest that interspecific interactions can fragment Rivulus into local populations.","SIENA COLL, DEPT BIOL, LOUDONVILLE, NY 12211 USA; UNIV W INDIES, DEPT ZOOL, ST AUGUSTINE, TRINIDAD TOBAGO","GILLIAM, JF (corresponding author), N CAROLINA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, RALEIGH, NC 27695 USA.",,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Gilliam, James F/D-5605-2013",,,,,47,152,161,3,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1993,74,6,,,,,1856,1870,,10.2307/1939943,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LV242,WOS:A1993LV24200025,,,,,2021-09-21,

Although Least Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis) often nest solitarily, in a South Carolina impoundment they frequently associated with colonies of Boat-tailed grackles (Quiscalus major). Bittern nests inside and outside colonies occupied the same microhabitats. However, more bitterns nested in grackle colonies than in equal-sized areas of equivalent habitat in the same marsh. In one of two years, colonial bitterns had higher reproductive success than bitterns nesting outside colonies. We conclude that Least Bitterns actively associate with grackles. Possible reasons for the association of bitterns with grackles are as follows (1) Critical density effect: at high population densities, the advantages of dispersed (cryptic) nesting are lost. Bitterns switching to nest in groups may experience little reduction in reproductive success, relative to those nesting solitarily. (2) Vigilance and mobbing: grackles provide early warning, and actively exclude predatory birds from colonies.

Adult sex ratio was 1:1 for Harris' Sparrows, and approximated 1:1 for the smaller number of White-crowned Sparrows captured. Nesting cycles of Harris' Sparrows and White-crowned Sparrows were similar, and appeared to be affected by patterns of snow melt and arthropod abundance. Adults began arriving during the last week in May; most initiated nesting during the second or third week in June, after breeding habitat was at least 60% snow-free. During all years of the study, the peak in fledging occurred just prior to maximum arthropod,abundance. Clutch size and egg mass as a percentage of adult mass did not differ between the species. Only female Harris' Sparrows and White-crowned Sparrows incubated eggs and brooded nestlings, but males and females of both species fed young. Mean length of the incubation period for Harris' Sparrows (12.8 days) was shorter than previously reported. Length of the nestling period and patterns of nestling growth and development were very similar in the two species. Breeding densities of White-crowned Sparrows averaged about 30% that of Harris' Sparrows, but egg success (young fledged/eggs laid) and productivity (young fledged/pair) was higher for White-crowned Sparrows. Lower productivity for Harris' Sparrows was caused by predation on eggs and nestlings by arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) and short-tailed weasels (Mustela erminea). Lower breeding density of White-crowned Sparrows probably was due to a lack of suitable breeding habitat, perhaps combined with a lower return rate for adult White-crowned Sparrows during some breeding seasons.

The model uses a submodel of resource renewal and depletion, and the principle that individuals attempt to maximize individual fitness, to construct habitat isolines. The habitat isoline for a population of nectarivores is a line in an abundance phase-plane along which all individuals of the population, regardless of the habitat they are currently exploiting, have equal expected fitness. At equilibrium the habitat isoline determines the distribution of a population between two habitats given a fixed abundance of competitors. The habitat isolines for populations of two species exploiting two habitats can be used to predict the equilibrium distribution of both species. I illustrate the model using data about bumble bees foraging for nectar in flowers (Inouye 1978). An asset of the model is its ability to make a priori predictions about flower exploitation patterns using information about resource dynamics and the foraging abilities of the nectarivores. Two warnings regarding the empirical detection of exploitation competition between species emerge from the model analysis. Depending on the range over which density manipulations are carried out in exploitation competition systems, competition may or may not be detected, while interspecific competition may or may not appear to be more intense than intraspecific competition. Although the model is directed at nectarivores competing for nectar in flowers, the results have wider implications for all systems where species compete exploitatively for resources.","AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV, JOHN CURTIN SCH MED RES, ECOSYST DYNAM GRP, CANBERRA, ACT 2601, AUSTRALIA",,,"Possingham, Hugh/B-1337-2008; POSSINGHAM, HUGH/R-8310-2019","Possingham, Hugh/0000-0001-7755-996X; POSSINGHAM, HUGH/0000-0001-7755-996X",,,,31,41,41,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1992,73,5,,,,,1903,1912,,10.2307/1940041,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP740,WOS:A1992JP74000038,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

The experimental design allowed reductions in vegetative and reproductive vigor resulting from interspecific competition to be distinguished from those arising from direct effects of nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. It was also possible to determine the extent to which competitive suppression of each species was affected by stress and disturbance. In isolation, all species showed maximum vegetative and reproductive vigor at high soil fertility and low disturbance. In the mixture, absolute reductions in biomass and flowering due to competition were greatest at high soil fertility and low disturbance, and the species of most extreme strategy became restricted to areas of the matrix broadly consistent with those predicted by strategy classification. When standardized for differences in biomass in pure stands, the effect of competition remained relatively constant across the stress-disturbance matrix for all species except Poa annua, which was less restricted by competition at high intensities of stress. There were marked and consistent differences between species in their susceptibility to competition. At both high and low soil fertility, two species of natural occurrence on infertile soils (Festuca ovina, Bromus erectus) were poor competitors relative to Arrhenatherum elatius, a widespread dominant of productive grasslands. The effect of competition was least severe on flowering of annuals in low-stress portions of the matrix. If competition is assessed simply as the percentage of reduction in biomass between pure and mixed stands it appears that competition intensity is constant across different intensities of stress and disturbance. However, observations that maximum reductions in biomass coincided with low stress and low disturbance, that competition decreased in importance as a factor reducing yield and flowering (relative to stress and disturbance) as stress and disturbance intensities increased, and that there was a consistently inferior competitive ability of plants from infertile soils at all positions on the matrix all support the hypothesis that competition declines in importance as a vegetation determinant in the vegetation of infertile soils.","UNIV SHEFFIELD, NERC,COMPARAT PLANT ECOL UNIT, SHEFFIELD S10 2TN, S YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",,,"Campbell, Bruce/G-2962-2014",,,,,62,192,202,1,134,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,1992,73,1,,,,,15,29,,10.2307/1938717,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC842,WOS:A1992HC84200002,,,,,2021-09-21,

These findings support previous hypotheses concerning the importance and likelihood of interspecific competition in old, moderately-harsh, predator-free environments.

We controlled floral composition in the neighborhoods surrounding 12 focal plants of self-compatible Besleria triflora (Gesneriaceae) and of self-incompatible Palicourea lasiorrachis (Rubiaceae), producing prescribed mixtures of flowers of the focal plants' conspecifics and of Cephaelis elata (Rubiaceae).

Focal plants themselves always had 10 open flowers. We assigned the sequence of treatments to each focal plant in a Latin square crossover design using three balanced blocks of four plants each. Dependent variables were: frequency of hummingbird probes per flower; pollen tubes in styles; and seed output per flower. From standard models of competition for pollination, we predicted that pollination levels and seed production would be ranked among treatments: B(90:10) > D(50:50) > A(10:10) > C(10:90). These overall predictions were supported for both Palicourea and Besleria, based on tests for directionality showing that the rank order among adjusted treatment means did not differ from the order predicted. Separate a priori treatment contrasts indicated that in both species increasing flower density above base levels (Treatment A, 10:10) by adding conspecific flowers alone (B, 90:10) or along with Cephaelis (D, 50:50) increased the rate at which hummingbirds visited focal plants' flowers. In Palicourea, both the number of pollen tubes in styles and seed output per flower increased in the same fashion. In Besleria, the only effect was increased pollination (but not seed output) from A (10:10) to B (90:10). In contrast, enriching the basic neighborhood (A, 10:10) with Cephaelis flowers (C, 10:90) did not alter frequencies of hummingbird probes to either species of focal plant. Heterospecific enrichment did, however, decrease both pollination levels and seed output in Palicourea, and seed output in Besleria. In general, altering the floral neighborhood affected Palicourea more strongly than Besleria. Apparently the intensity of density dependence, at least in terms of female reproductive success, varies among plant species sharing pollinators. Seed outputs in self-incompatible plants such as Palicourea may closely reflect flower densities of neighbors, but interspecific effects on fertilization in self-compatible plants such as Besleria may be density vague.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,SEATTLE,WA 98195","FEINSINGER, P (corresponding author), UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT ZOOL,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611, USA.",,,,,,,49,141,148,1,52,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1991,72,6,,,,,1953,1963,,10.2307/1941550,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV769,WOS:A1991GV76900006,,,,,2021-09-21,

The paper is divided into an experimental part and a theoretical part. In the experiment part, I present field experiments that show the aggregative pattern of carrion flies ovipositing among carcasses, as well as associated experiments that explore the behavior leading to these patterns. I also use experiments to quantify the strength of larval competition between Phaenicia coeruleiviridis (Calliphoridae) and Sarcophaga bullata (Sarcophagidae). In the theoretical part, I develop two methods that use these data to assess the effect of aggregation on competition in the field. From the first method, I predict that intraspecific aggregation of P. coeruleiviridis females causes a 26% decrease in the expected recruitment of P. coeruleiviridis and a 74% increase in the expected recruitment of S. bullata. As a result, within a single generation, intraspecific aggregation increases intraspecific competition and reduces interspecific competition. The second method for assessing aggregation involves a new mathematical formula that gives conditions under which species may coexist indefinitely. This formula requires estimates of only the degrees of intra- and interspecific aggregation among species; there is no need to estimate adult survival and larval competition. I use this second method to show that the minimum effect of aggregation on coexistence for five carrion fly species is equivalent to reducing the amount of larval competition between pairs of species by an average of 57%. Aggregation may therefore play a major role in explaining the coexistence of carrion fly competitors.","PRINCETON UNIV,DEPT BIOL,PRINCETON,NJ 08544",,,"Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008","Ives, Anthony/0000-0001-9375-9523",,,,43,202,210,2,42,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9615,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

It specializes in mealybugs prey (Pseudococcidae), but relatively little is known about its ecology. In contrast, the ladybird beetle Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant (Coccinellidae) is indigenous to Australia and has been introduced to many countries worldwide including Brazil for biological control of mealybugs. The potential impacts of these introductions to native coccinellids have rarely been considered. The software CLIMEX estimated the climate suitability for both species as reflected in the Ecoclimatic Index (EI). Much of South America, Africa, and Australia can be considered climatically suitable for both species, but in most cases, the climate is considerably more favorable for C. montrouzieri than T. notata, especially in South America. The CLIMEX model also suggests seasonal differences in growth conditions (e.g. rainfall and temperature) that could affect the phenology of both species. These models suggest that few locations in South America would be expected to provide T. notata climatic refugia from C. montrouzieri. Although other ecological factors will also be important, such as prey availability, this analysis suggests a strong potential for displacement of a native coccinellid throughout most of its range as a consequence of the invasion by an alien competitor.","[Ferreira, Larissa F.; Silva-Torres, Christian S.

However, experimental tests of this stress gradient hypothesis in natural microbial communities are lacking. We test this hypothesis by measuring interactions between 10 different members of a bacterial community inhabiting potting compost in the presence or absence of toxic copper stress. We found that copper stress caused significant net changes in species interaction signs, shifting the net balance towards more positive interactions. This pattern was at least in part driven by copper-sensitive isolates - that produced relatively small amounts of metal-detoxifying siderophores - benefitting from the presence of other species that produce extracellular detoxifying agents. As well as providing support for the stress gradient hypothesis, our results highlight the importance of community-wide public goods in shaping microbial community composition.","[Hesse, Elze; O'Brien, Siobhan; Lujan, Adela M.; Sanders, Dirk; Bayer, Florian; Hodgson, Dave J.; Buckling, Angus] Univ Exeter, CEC, Biosci, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Hesse, Elze; O'Brien, Siobhan; Lujan, Adela M.; Sanders, Dirk; Bayer, Florian; Buckling, Angus] Univ Exeter, ESI, Biosci, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [O'Brien, Siobhan] Univ Liverpool, Inst Integrat Biol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Lujan, Adela M.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Fac Ciencias Quim, Dept Quim Biol,CIQUIBIC, Cordoba, Argentina; [Veen, Eleanor M.] Univ Exeter, Camborne Sch Mines, CEMPS, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, England","Hesse, E (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, CEC, Biosci, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, England.; Hesse, E (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, ESI, Biosci, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, England.",elzehesse@gmail.com,,,University of Exeter; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/S000771/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/T002522/1]; AXA Research Fund; FP7 People: Marie-Curie ActionsEuropean Commission,"University of Exeter; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/S000771/1; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Grant/Award Number: BB/T002522/1; AXA Research Fund; FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions",,56,1,1,13,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

In soybean, the velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hubner), and the soybean looper, Chrysodeixis includens (Walker), are described as key pests, sharing the same feeding guild. We assessed the intraguild interactions of these species under laboratory conditions. Fitness cost study was conducted to examine the influence of competition on insect development. A video tracking system was used to evaluate behavioral parameters during larval interactions in scenarios with and without food availability. RESULTS In the fitness cost assay, pupal weight was not significantly affected, regardless of sex. However, larval and pupal survival were influenced by the competition, especially in third versus fifth instar scenarios. We detected 40.00% cannibalism and 46.67% predation when A. gemmatalis and C. includens third instars competed with A. gemmatalis fifth instar, respectively. Distance moved, distance between larvae, body contact (food available) and frequency in food of C. includens larvae were negatively affected by interactions. Anticarsia gemmatalis larvae showed highly active behavior, moving twice or more the distance compared to C. includens larvae, and A. gemmatalis spent more time in body contact with food. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that A. gemmatalis has a competitive advantage over C. includens. This study provides important information regarding lepidopteran behavior in soybean. We recommended that additional studies are necessary to understand the effects of interactions, especially in field conditions.","[Ongaratto, Sabrina; Baldin, Edson L.

In this study, we assessed the utilization of space, time and prey resources by tigers Panthera tigris, leopards P. pardus and dholes Cuon alpinus in Manas National Park (MNP), India - a site where prey densities are not limiting, yet anthropogenic influences alter the spatial and temporal behaviour of prey. We use photographic capture data and predator scats collected over three sampling years (2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17) to assess patterns of (a) spatial use using a multispecies species occupancy framework, (b) time-activity patterns and overlap between predators and prey using non-parametric circular kernel-density functions, (c) fine-scale spatio-temporal behaviour by comparing time-to-encounters of subsequent events and (d) predator diets by analysing prey remains in predator scats. Our results highlight that the predators segregate through fine-scale spatio-temporal avoidance rather than displaying population-level changes in space-use, activity patterns or food habits. Overlap in space-use between tigers and leopards was high and time-activity patterns of the predators closely matched those of prey, suggesting that predators likely maximize resource acquisition in this prey-rich environment. Ungulate prey dominated the diet of predators, resulting in the high dietary overlap. From our results, we infer patterns of sympatry among large carnivores in the face of anthropogenic influences and highlight the need to understand interspecific interactions within a community before initiating conservation actions aimed at recovering these endangered species.","[Lahkar, D.; Ahmed, M.

To survive, morphologically simple and sessile cnidarians have developed mechanisms to catch prey, deter predators and compete with adjacent corals for space, yet the mechanisms underlying these functions are largely unknown. Here, we characterize the histology, toxic activity and gene expression patterns in two different types of tentacles from the scleractinian coralGalaxea fascilcularis- catch tentacles (CTs), used to catch prey and deter predators, and sweeper tentacles (STs), specialized tentacles used for territorial aggression. Results STs exhibit more mucocytes and higher expression of mucin genes than CTs, and lack the ectodermal cilia used to deliver food to the mouth and remove debris. STs and CTs also express different sensory rhodopsin-like g-protein coupled receptors, suggesting they may employ different sensory pathways. Each tentacle type has a different complement of stinging cells (nematocytes), and the expression in the two tentacles of genes encoding structural nematocyte proteins suggests the stinging cells develop within the tentacles. CTs have higher neurotoxicity to blowfly larvae and hemolytic activity compared to the STs, consistent with a role in prey capture. In contrast, STs have higher phospholipase A2 activity, which we speculate may have a role in inducing tissue damage during territorial aggression. The expression of genes encoding cytolytic toxins (actinoporins) and phospholipases also differs between the tentacle types. Conclusions These results show that the same organism utilizes two distinct tentacle types, each equipped with a different venom apparatus and toxin composition, for prey capture and defense and for territorial aggression.","[Yosef, Oshra; Popovits, Yotam; Malik, Assaf; Mass, Tali; Sher, Daniel] Univ Haifa, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, Dept Marine Biol, Haifa, Israel; [Malik, Assaf; Ofek-Lalzer, Maya] Univ Haifa, Bioinformat Support Unit, Haifa, Israel","Mass, T; Sher, D (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, Dept Marine Biol, Haifa, Israel.",tmass@univ.haifa.ac.il; dsher@univ.haifa.ac.il,"Mass, Tali/AAA-9046-2020",,"Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1239/13, 312/15]; Israeli National Center for Personalized Medicine [2236/16]; ISF grant [2155/15]","This study was supported by grants 1239/13 and 312/15 from the Israel Science Foundation (to DS and TM, respectively) and by the associated grant number 2236/16 from the Israeli National Center for Personalized Medicine (to DS).

These small suspension feeders collect particles in the range of 10 to 100 mu m. Specific details of their feeding depend on the morphology of the feeding apparatus, which may be reflected in skeletal characters. While several studies have described the link between the skeletal and soft-body traits of gymnolaemate bryozoans, stenolaemates have received less attention. To fill this gap, we conducted a detailed analysis of morphometry within and across species and attempted to develop robust predictive models that can be used to infer the soft-body morphology from skeletal data. This, in turn, will help with extracting data on ecology of Paleozoic communities of suspension feeders from the extensive bryozoan fossil record. Characters of polypide morphology among New Zealand cyclostomates (single Recent order in Stenolaemata) displayed staggering variability and almost without exception were not connected to skeletal characters at the species level. When this variability is reduced to its central tendency, interspecific trends are more apparent.

Larval anurans are models to examine activity level-predation risk tradeoffs, as they occupy a variety of lentic habitats that impose constraints on the distribution and abundance of species. Ephemeral ponds have a low abundance and diversity of predators and as a result tadpole species tend to have high foraging rates for rapid development. Permanent ponds generally possess a greater diversity and abundance of predators and tadpoles inhabiting these locations tend to have low activity rates or chemical defenses to minimize predation risk. The objective of this research was to examine how interspecific variation in activity level and response to predation risk, corresponds to the distributions of tadpole species along the hydroperiod gradient. Furthermore, we examined the intraspecific variation in activity level among the species. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments in which we quantified baseline activity patterns and the change in activity after the addition of a predator or exposure to alarm cues, for 12 species of larval anurans native to East Texas. Species that maintained a high activity level generally occupied ephemeral ponds and species that maintained low activity levels generally occupied permanent ponds. Only one species (Gastrophryne carolinensis) decreased their activity level in the presence of predator cues or conspecific alarm cues. These results highlight this tradeoff can have consequences on the life histories of multiple species, providing insight into how it affects the organization of ecological communities.","[Schiwitz, Nicholas C.; Schalk, Christopher M.] Stephen F Austin State Univ, Arthur Temple Coll Forestry & Agr, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA; [Saenz, Daniel] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, Nacogdoches, TX 75965 USA","Schiwitz, NC (corresponding author), Stephen F Austin State Univ, Arthur Temple Coll Forestry & Agr, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA.",nschiwitz@gmail.com,,,McIntire-Stennis from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,We thank Cory K.

Species interactions following wildfire in these areas are not well understood. In Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests, large patches of stand-replacing fire were once rare but are becoming increasingly prevalent and are quickly revegetated by native shrubs. There is uncertainty as to which tree species are best adapted to recover in the resulting post-fire environments. We introduce a conceptual framework for understanding how the altered fire regime in the Sierra Nevada may affect species composition. We investigate an understudied link in this framework: how juvenile ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and white fir (Abies lowiana) growth and mortality rates are affected by shrub competition following stand-replacing fire. We measured juvenile conifer growth in relation to shrub competition in five fire footprints ranging from 8 to 35 yr old and >400 ha in size. To test whether reductions in conifer growth may lead to increased mortality, we also evaluated how recent tree growth predicts mortality of similarly aged juvenile trees in nearby managed stands. We found that juvenile ponderosa pine growth was negatively associated with nearby shrub competition, but white fir growth was not. Both species grew slower preceding mortality, with a steeper relationship found in ponderosa pine. Across the range of shrub competition in this study, expected pine annual relative growth rate varied from 0.27 to 0.10, which corresponded to an eleven-fold difference in annual probability of mortality (0.1-1.1%, respectively). These results show that ponderosa pine is sensitive to shrub competition following wildfire in terms of both growth and survival while white fir is less sensitive, presumably due to its high shade tolerance. Though pines are generally considered fire-adapted, this study argues that post-fire species interactions in a novel fire regime may exacerbate the already shifting species composition toward shade-tolerant species, which are less well adapted to survive through future fires and to persist in future drier, warmer climates.","[Tubbesing, Carmen L.; York, Robert A.; Stephens, Scott L.; Battles, John J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Environm Sci Policy & Management Dept, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Tubbesing, CL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Environm Sci Policy & Management Dept, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ctubbesing@berkeley.edu,"Battles, John J/G-8233-2012; Tubbesing, Carmen/AAR-4328-2021","Battles, John J/0000-0001-7124-7893; Tubbesing, Carmen/0000-0002-0210-1003",Joint Fire Science Program; Garden Club of America; W.S.

Although many studies have reported a substantial fitness cost associated with reproductive interference, suggesting its ecological significance, others have not observed reproductive interference in study species. Reproductive interference that incurs a large fitness cost is more likely to occur during secondary contacts than between long-coexisting species. I first explain the rationale underlying this prediction using existing literature. Next, I present a conceptual framework to classify pairs of interacting species into one of four states, defined by the ecological and evolutionary stabilities of the species pairs. I discuss how the stability states of species pairs are likely to change over time, along with changes in the demographic and evolutionary role of reproductive interference. I then perform literature survey to test the prediction that reproductive interference should be more prevalent in secondary contact. Finally, I discuss the implications of the proposed conceptual framework and literature survey result.","[Kyogoku, Daisuke] Ryukoku Univ, Res Inst Food & Agr, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan","Kyogoku, D (corresponding author), Ryukoku Univ, Res Inst Food & Agr, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan.",d.kyogoku@gmail.com,"Kyogoku, Daisuke/O-8410-2018","Kyogoku, Daisuke/0000-0002-6214-8241","JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19K16222]","This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists, JSPS (19K16222).",,93,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

However, more information is needed to understand their potential spill-over of pollinators on nearby insect-pollinated crops. Over the course of two consecutive years, the suitability of a flower mixture of 10 herbaceous plants for pollinators was evaluated on a weekly basis, in a randomized block design of two melon plots (10 x 10 m(2)) with or without 1 m-wide flower strips. Floral coverage and pollinator visits to the plant species, as well as pollinator visits and the yield and quality of the crop, were assessed. Additionally, the selected mixture was tested for 1 year in a commercial field in order to ascertain how far the flower strip could influence visitors in the crop. The most suitable species for a flower strip in central Spain based on their attractiveness, floral coverage and staggered blossom were Coriandrum sativum L., Diplotaxis virgata L., Borago officinalis L. and Calendula officinalis L. The flower strip can act as either pollinator competitor or facilitator to the crop, depending on their floral coverage and/or the predominant species during the crop bloom period. The concurrence of blooming of the rewarding plant C. officinalis with the melon crop should be avoided in our area. In the commercial field, the bee visitation rate in the melon flowers decreased with the distance to the flower strip. No influence of the specific flower strip evaluated on crop productivity or quality was found.","[Azpiazu, Celeste; Medina, Pilar; Adan, Angeles; del Estal, Pedro; Vinuela, Elisa] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSIAAB, Ave Puerta de Hierro 2-4, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Medina, Pilar; Adan, Angeles; del Estal, Pedro; Fereres, Alberto; Vinuela, Elisa] UPM, CSIC, Unidad Asociada IVAS, Control Insectos Vectores Bajo Sistemas Agr Soste, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Sanchez-Ramos, Ismael] Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria, MP, OA, INIA, Carretera Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Fereres, Alberto] CSIC, ICA, Serrano 115 Dpdo, Madrid 28006, Spain","Azpiazu, C (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSIAAB, Ave Puerta de Hierro 2-4, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",celeste.azpiazu@upm.es; pilar.medina@upm.es; angeles.adan@upm.es; ismael@inia.es; pedro.delestal@upm.es; a.fereres@csic.es; elisa.vinuela@upm.es,"DEL RIO, ANGELES ADAN/K-3563-2017; SEGOVIA, CELESTE AZPIAZU/ABC-5911-2020; Medina, Pilar/K-5295-2017; VINUELA, ELISA/K-5540-2017; Fereres, Alberto/G-6542-2012","Medina, Pilar/0000-0003-4642-3554; VINUELA, ELISA/0000-0002-6283-5236; ADAN DEL RIO, ANGELES/0000-0002-4681-1816; Azpiazu, Celeste/0000-0001-8217-9347; Fereres, Alberto/0000-0001-6012-3270; Sanchez-Ramos, Ismael/0000-0003-0070-2953","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [AGL2013-47603-C2-1-R, BES-2014-068732]; project Operation Pollinator (Syngenta)Syngenta",This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (proyect AGL2013-47603-C2-1-R to EV and PM; and PhD fellowship BES-2014-068732 to CA) and partially by the project Operation Pollinator (Syngenta).,,83,2,2,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,JAN,2020,11,1,,,,,,,66,10.3390/insects11010066,,,21,Entomology,Entomology,KL0NT,WOS:000513130200052,31968621,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

In the present study, I propose that heritable intraspecific variation in prey, which facilitates natural selection, is a key to solve this issue. A mathematical model reveals that diverse genotypes in a prey promote the coexistence of multiple predator species. When two predators share a prey with multiple genotypes, evolution nearly selects the two prey genotypes. Through analysis, I establish a condition of coexistence of such multiple predator-one prey interaction with two genotypes. If each prey type has high defensive capacity against different predator species, stable coexistence is likely to occur. Particularly, interspecific variations of life-history parameters allow the coexistence equilibrium to be stable. In addition, rapid evolution in a prey allows more than two predator species to coexist. Furthermore, mutation tends to stabilize otherwise unstable systems. These results suggest that intraspecific variation in a prey plays a key role in the maintenance of diverse predator species by driving adaptive evolution.","[Mougi, Akihiko] Shimane Univ, Acad Assembly, Inst Agr & Life Sci, Nishikawatsu Cho, Matsue, Shimane, Japan","Mougi, A (corresponding author), Shimane Univ, Acad Assembly, Inst Agr & Life Sci, Nishikawatsu Cho, Matsue, Shimane, Japan.",amougi@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K18621]; Faculty of Life and Environmental Science at Shimane University",This work was supported by a Grant-inAid for Young Scientists (B) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (num. #16K18621) and the Faculty of Life and Environmental Science at Shimane University to AM.,,48,0,0,2,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,DEC 31,2019,14,12,,,,,,,e0227111,10.1371/journal.pone.0227111,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,KN8LM,WOS:000515096600061,31891629,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

In these conditions, our results unveil an eco-evolutionary feedback between species spatial mixing and predators perceptual range: different levels of mixing select for different perceptual ranges, which in turn reshape the spatial distribution of prey and its interaction with predators. This emergent pattern of interspecific interactions feeds back to the efficiency of the various perceptual ranges, thus selecting for new ones. Finally, since prey-predator mixing is the key factor that regulates the intensity of predation, we explore the community-level implications of such feedback and show that it controls both coexistence times and species extinction probabilities.","[Colombo, Eduardo H.; Lopez, Cristobal; Hernandez-Garcia, Emilio] UIB, CSIC, IFISC, Campus Univ Illes Balears, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Martinez-Garcia, Ricardo] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Martinez-Garcia, Ricardo] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Fis Teor, South Amer Inst Fundamental Res, ICTP, Rua Dr Bento Teobaldo Ferraz 271, BR-01140070 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Colombo, EH (corresponding author), UIB, CSIC, IFISC, Campus Univ Illes Balears, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",ecolombo@ifisc-uib-csic.es,"Colombo, Eduardo Henrique/U-1651-2019; Hernandez-Garcia, Emilio/B-1271-2008; Lopez, Cristobal/R-5410-2018; Martinez-Garcia, Ricardo/J-4836-2013","Colombo, Eduardo Henrique/0000-0002-9014-3333; Hernandez-Garcia, Emilio/0000-0002-9568-8287; Lopez, Cristobal/0000-0002-3445-4284; Martinez-Garcia, Ricardo/0000-0003-2765-8147",Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF2550.06]; Simons Foundation; FAPESP through ICTP-SAIFRFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2016/01343-7]; Programa Jovens Pesquisadores em Centros Emergentes [2019/24433-0]; Spanish Research Agency [ESOTECOS FIS2015-63628-C2-1-R]; Maria de Maeztu Program for units of Excellence in RD [MDM-2017-0711],"YThis work is partially funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through Grant GBMF2550.06, the Simons Foundation, and FAPESP through ICTP-SAIFR grant 2016/01343-7 and Programa Jovens Pesquisadores em Centros Emergentes grant 2019/24433-0 (RMG); and by the Spanish Research Agency, through grant ESOTECOS FIS2015-63628-C2-1-R (AEI/FEDER, EU) and grant MDM-2017-0711 from the Maria de Maeztu Program for units of Excellence in R&D (EHC, CL and EH-G).",,55,4,4,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,DEC 3,2019,9,,,,,,,,18161,10.1038/s41598-019-54510-6,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,JT8MR,WOS:000501238200001,31796799,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

These interactions in aquatic ectothermic assemblages may be disrupted as ecosystems get warmer and organisms adapt to their warming environment by becoming smaller. Species will respond differently to rising temperature, so outcomes of inter-species interactions may change unpredictably. Stream salamander assemblages in the eastern United States are spatially partitioned by individual size, such that all species would prefer to occupy streams but larger species exclude smaller species to stream margins. Aggression by the larger species is probably one mechanism that contributes to this pattern, but we do not understand how temperature mediates these interspecific interactions. At multiple temperatures, we observed short-term interspecific interactions among 3 stream salamander congeners that exist along a body size gradient. We predicted that temperature would change the frequency and type of interspecific interactions. At current temperatures, we predicted that the largest species would frequently exhibit aggression but rarely exhibit escape behavior, and that the smallest species would rarely exhibit aggression and frequently exhibit escape behavior. Overall, we observed 3.8x more aggression at the warmest temperature. We also found that the largest species exhibited aggression most often, particularly towards the smallest species. However, the moderately-sized species fled most often. These fine-scale behaviors are consistent with observations of spatial habitat-partitioning in this assemblage. Our result that temperature increases aggression may indicate that warmer future thermal regimes may disrupt the interspecific interactions that currently shape ecological communities.","[Bissell, Kailey E.; Cecala, Kristen K.] Univ South, Dept Biol, 735 Univ Ave, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA","Bissell, KE (corresponding author), Univ South, Dept Biol, 735 Univ Ave, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA.",bisseke0@sewanee.edu; kkcecala@sewanee.edu,,,Herpetologists' League Raymond D.

Mutualisms are relationships of mutual exploitation, in which interacting species receive a net benefit from their association. In obligate pollination mutualisms (OPMs), female pollinators move pollen between the flowers of a single plant species and oviposit eggs within the female flowers that they visit. 2. Competition between co-occurring pollinator species is predicted to increase pollinator virulence, i.e. laying more eggs or consuming more seeds per fruit. Plants involved in OPMs frequently host various non-pollinating seed parasites and parasitoids that may influence the outcome of the mutualism. Quantifying the prevalence of parasites and parasitoids and competition between pollinators is important for understanding the factors that influence OPM evolutionary stability. 3. This study investigated the pollination mutualism occurring between the leaf flower plant, Breynia oblongifolia, and its co-pollinating Epicephala moths. A third moth, Herpystis, also occurs in B. oblongifolia fruits as a non-pollinating seed parasite. 4. Breynia oblongifolia fruits were collected to quantify seed predation and compare seed predation costs between the three moth species. Results showed that the larvae of the two pollinator species consume similar numbers of seeds, and that adults deposit similar numbers of eggs per flower. As such, no evidence of increases in virulent behaviours was detected as a result of competition between co-pollinators. 5.

However, many questions still puzzle researchers; for example, why are some unstable sediments atmospheric methane sinks? In this study, a biofilm model originally developed for wastewater treatment was modified to simulate the microbial kinetics and substance conversions in aqueous surface sediments. The model was validated by the experimental data and could predict chemical profiles and microbial distributions in sediments. The model revealed complicated interactions between different microbial communities and environmental factors, including competition between aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The results of model simulations showed that the effects of environmental factors, especially dissolved oxygen and ammonia in overlying water, on methane fluxes are very complicated. Rapid environmental changes (which can be caused by tide, day-night alternation, or zoobenthic and human activity) and intensive competition between microbes greatly affected methane fluxes and resulted in alternation between atmospheric methane source and sink in unstable sediments. This study extends the application of a wastewater treatment model to ecological studies of microbial interactions in natural sediments and explains some problems that might be difficult to resolve by using experimental methods.

Both species are described as ecologically and morphologically very similar. However, the niche theory predicts that coexisting species will tend to minimize competition through niche partitioning. We, therefore, investigated the degree of their ecological similarity through their morphology, trophic ecology, and spatial distribution, as well as, the effects of environmental variables on their abundance. We showed that S. rectifraenum is highly abundant in the entire Gulf of California while S. flavilatus is only found in the central and southern part. The abundance of S. rectifraenum was higher in shallow water and decreased when the cover of macroalgae and sand increased. No environmental variable was related to the abundance of S. flavilatus. Both species had distinct isotopic niches: S. flavilatus fed almost exclusively on plankton and zoobenthos, while S. rectifraenum had an omnivorous diet mixing turf, zoobenthos and plankton. The diet divergence was reflected in the morphology of the two species. Stegastes flavilatus had a more rounded body shape, with a higher supraoccipital crest and more gill rakers than S. rectifraenum, which may increase its ability to feed on vagile invertebrates and zooplankton. Our results support the hypothesis that a niche partition has occurred between the two species. Furthermore, the importance of planktonic food sources to both species, considered as benthic territorial feeders, challenges the traditional ecological description of the Stegastes species.

Much less is known about how interspecific plant-soil feedbacks affect coexistence and plant communities, due in part to experimental and analytical challenges. Here, we propose a framework for evaluating plant-soil feedbacks among multiple interacting species that incorporates 1) the average effect each species has on conspecific and heterospecific neighbors via how they modify soil biota, 2) the average response of each species to the soil modifications made by neighboring species, and 3) intraspecific feedback. We refer to this as the 'effect-response-intraspecific' (ERI) model. We used individual-based models to evaluate the relative importance of intraspecific and interspecific soil feedback in determining species abundance ranks in simulated plant communities. To compare the heuristic value of the ERI model to that of an established model in which effects and responses to soil feedback are not explicitly recognized, we evaluated a 'full-factorial' model in which soil feedbacks among five plant species were measured and then explicitly modeled. The ERI model indicated that the response to interspecific plant-soil feedbacks was the key factor for species' abundance rank without spatial structure. In contrast, interspecific plant-soil feedback had no impact on species abundance with spatial structure, and intraspecific feedback became dominant. Thus, our models predict that the relative importance of intraspecific and interspecific feedbacks changes as a function of the degree of spatial structure in a system. Overall, the ERI model provides a novel and tractable framework for evaluating complex multi-species plant-soil feedbacks.","[Xiao, Sa] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, CN-730000 Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Atwater, Daniel Z.] Virginia Tech, Plant Pathol Physiol & Weed Sci, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Xiao, S (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, CN-730000 Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",xiaos@lzu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41830321, 31870412, 31670435, 31470492]; National Science Foundation EPSCoRNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OIA-1757351]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41830321, 31870412, 31670435, 31470492).

The endangered Pacific pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris pacificus) is being reintroduced to parts of its former range where multiple species of native rodents have overlapping diets. The granivorous species in this foraging guild compete for seeds exploitatively and through direct interference interactions, and pocket mice are the smallest and least dominant species in the guild. Repeated aggressive interactions from resident heterospecifics could lower the chances of reintroduced pocket mice establishing burrows during the post-release settlement period. As such, temporarily reducing the density of competing species through exclusionary fencing might be an advisable reintroduction strategy, in combination with other interventions, such as predator exclusion. The presence of other members of the seed-foraging guild, however, could have a net benefit for pocket mice, if the pocket mice pilfer from the other species' seed caches more than the other species pilfer from their caches. To test the frequency of cache pilfering between species, we conducted a field experiment with fluorescent dyed seeds. Two of 10 pocket mice pilfered from heterospecifics, but only 1 of 33 heterospecifics pilfered from pocket mice. In a field-enclosure experiment, we could not conclude that any of the 4 species tested used heterospecific scent to find (or avoid) seed caches, and pocket mice were less efficient in pilfering from artificial caches, recovering fewer seeds than the larger species. We did not find strong evidence that Pacific pocket mice benefit from living in sympatry with larger, dominant species. Although further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between heterospecific density and the prevalence of cache pilfering, a conservative reintroduction approach would be to select receiver sites with low densities of known competitors to benefit pocket mice during the critical post-release establishment phase.","[Chock, Rachel Y.; Grether, Gregory F.; Shier, Debra M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 612 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Chock, Rachel Y.; Shier, Debra M.] San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, Recovery Ecol, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA","Chock, RY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 612 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Chock, RY (corresponding author), San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, Recovery Ecol, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA.",rchock@sandiegozoo.org,"Grether, Gregory F./F-6286-2011",,"United States Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and California Department of Fish and Wildlife; United States Department of Education Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need Fellowship; Los Angeles (UCLA), a UCLA Pauley Fellowship, a UCLA Chancellor's Prize; Animal Behavior Society; Center for California Conservation Science, Sea and Sage Audubon, Santa Monica Bay Audubon; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology","We thank J.

Marine turtles comprise an ecological radiation in which interspecific differences in trophic morphology have similarly been implicated as a pathway to ecopartition the marine realm, in both extant and extinct species. Because marine turtles are charismatic flagship species of conservation concern, their trophic ecology has been studied intensively using stable isotope analyses to gain insights into habitat use and diet, principally to inform conservation management. This legion of studies provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine ecological partitioning across numerous hierarchical levels that heretofore has not been applied to any other ecological radiation. Our contribution aims to provide a quantitative analysis of interspecific variation and a comprehensive review of intraspecific variation in trophic ecology across different hierarchical levels marshalling insights about realised trophic ecology derived from stable isotopes. We reviewed 113 stable isotope studies, mostly involving single species, and conducted a meta-analysis of data from adults to elucidate differences in trophic ecology among species. Our study reveals a more intricate hierarchy of ecopartitioning by marine turtles than previously recognised based on trophic morphology and dietary analyses. We found strong statistical support for interspecific partitioning, as well as a continuum of intraspecific trophic sub-specialisation in most species across several hierarchical levels. This ubiquity of trophic specialisation across many hierarchical levels exposes a far more complex view of trophic ecology and resource-axis exploitation than suggested by species diversity alone. Not only do species segregate along many widely understood axes such as body size, macrohabitat, and trophic morphology but the general pattern revealed by isotopic studies is one of microhabitat segregation and variation in foraging behaviour within species, within populations, and among individuals. These findings are highly relevant to conservation management because they imply ecological non-exchangeability, which introduces a new dimension beyond that of genetic stocks which drives current conservation planning. Perhaps the most remarkable finding from our data synthesis is that four of six marine turtle species forage across several trophic levels. This pattern is unlike that seen in other large marine predators, which forage at a single trophic level according to stable isotopes. This finding affirms suggestions that marine turtles are robust sentinels of ocean health and likely stabilise marine food webs. This insight has broader significance for studies of marine food webs and trophic ecology of large marine predators. Beyond insights concerning marine turtle ecology and conservation, our findings also have broader implications for the study of ecological radiations. Particularly, the unrecognised complexity of ecopartitioning beyond that predicted by trophic morphology suggests that this dominant approach in adaptive radiation research likely underestimates the degree of resource overlap and that interspecific disparities in trophic morphology may often over-predict the degree of realised ecopartitioning. Hence, our findings suggest that stable isotopes can profitably be applied to study other ecological radiations and may reveal trophic variation beyond that reflected by trophic morphology.","[Figgener, Christine; Bernardo, Joseph; Plotkin, Pamela T.] Texas A&M Univ, Marine Biol Interdisciplinary Program, 3258 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Figgener, Christine; Bernardo, Joseph] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol, 3258 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Figgener, Christine; Plotkin, Pamela T.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceang, 3146 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Bernardo, Joseph] Texas A&M Univ, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2475 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Plotkin, Pamela T.] Texas A&M Univ, Texas Sea Grant, 4115 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Figgener, C (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Marine Biol Interdisciplinary Program, 3258 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.; Figgener, C (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol, 3258 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.; Figgener, C (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceang, 3146 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",christine.figgener@tamu.edu,"FIGGENER, CHRISTINE/S-2608-2019; Bernardo, Joseph/C-2403-2008","FIGGENER, CHRISTINE/0000-0002-8321-229X; Bernardo, Joseph/0000-0002-5516-4710",,,,279,9,9,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

We present BioGEEM (BioGeographical Eco-Evolutionary Model), a spatially explicit model that integrates theories and processes understood to drive biodiversity dynamics. We investigated the necessary degree of mechanistic complexity by exploring simulation experiments to evaluate the relative roles of the underlying processes across spatio-temporal scales and ecological levels (e.g. populations, species, communities). Location Hypothetical oceanic islands. Methods BioGEEM is stochastic and grid-based, and it integrates ecological (metabolic constraints, demography, dispersal and competition), evolutionary (mutation and speciation) and environmental (geo-climatic dynamics) processes. Plants on oceanic islands served as a model system. We ran the simulations both with all processes on and with selected processes switched off to assess the role of each process from the emergent patterns. Results The full model was able to generate patterns matching empirical evidence and theoretical expectations. Population sizes were largest on young islands, and species, particularly endemics, better filled their potential range on young and old islands due to limited area and reduced competition. Richness peaked at mid-elevations. The proportion of endemics was highest in old, large and isolated environments within the islands. Species and trait richness showed unimodal temporal trends. Switching off selected processes led to several unrealistic patterns, including the evolution of super-dominant species, extremely high richness and weakened spatial diversity gradients. Main conclusions The main predictions derived from BioGEEM are: Competition has cross-scale effects on diversity. Hump-shaped temporal dynamics can be obtained without speciation. Endemic species seem less susceptible to extinction than native non-endemic species. Endemism reflects stronger geographical and environmental isolation. Finally, only the integration of all implemented processes generates realistic spatio-temporal dynamics at population, species, community and assemblage levels.","[Cabral, Juliano Sarmento] Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Computat & Theoret Biol, Ecosyst Modeling, Hubland Nord 32, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Cabral, Juliano Sarmento; Kreft, Holger] Univ Gottingen, Biodivers Macroecol Biogeog, Gottingen, Germany; [Cabral, Juliano Sarmento] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res Div, Synth Ctr, Leipzig, Germany; [Wiegand, Kerstin] Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, Ecosyst Modelling, Gottingen, Germany","Cabral, JS (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Computat & Theoret Biol, Ecosyst Modeling, Hubland Nord 32, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",juliano.sarmento_cabral@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Kreft, Holger/A-4736-2008; Kreft, Holger/AAY-7573-2020; Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/K-3973-2012","Kreft, Holger/0000-0003-4471-8236; Kreft, Holger/0000-0003-4471-8236; Wiegand, Kerstin/0000-0003-4854-0607; Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/0000-0002-0116-220X","Ministry of Science and Culture of the State of Lower Saxony; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FZT 118, SA 2133/1-1]","Ministry of Science and Culture of the State of Lower Saxony, Grant/Award Number: Cluster of Excellence Functional Biodiversity Research; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: FZT 118 and SA 2133/1-1",,78,15,15,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Additionally, potential colonists may be competitively excluded by these incumbent (resident) species, unless they are biologically distinct (biotic filtering). The extant phenotypic diversity of secondary colonists may thus be impacted by lower rates of phenotypic evolution, exclusion from certain phenotypes, and transitions to new morphotypes to escape competition from incumbent lineages. We used geometric morphometric methods to test whether the rates and patterns of mandibular evolution of the Luzon old endemic rodent clades, Phloeomyini and Chrotomyini, are consistent with these predictions. Each clade occupied nearly completely separate shape space and partially separate size space. We detected limited support for decelerating and clade-specific evolutionary rates for both shape and size, with strong evidence for a shift in evolutionary mode within Chrotomyini. Our results suggest that decelerating phenotypic evolutionary rates are not a necessary result of incumbency interactions; rather, incumbency effects may be more likely to determine which clades can become established in the system. Nonincumbent clades that pass a biotic filter can potentially exhibit relatively unfettered evolution.","[Rowsey, Dakota M.; Jansa, Sharon A.] Univ Minnesota, Bell Museum Nat Hist, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Rowsey, Dakota M.; Jansa, Sharon A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Heaney, Lawrence R.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Rowsey, DM (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Bell Museum Nat Hist, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.; Rowsey, DM (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",rowse006@umn.edu,,"Rowsey, Dakota/0000-0002-5925-0579",American Society of Mammalogists; Wallace and Mary Dayton Fellowship; Simons Fellowship - Bell Museum of Natural History; Bell Museum of Natural History Dayton Wilkie Research Award; Barbara Brown Fund for Mammal Research of the Field Museum; Negaunee Foundation,"We would like to thank the staff of the collections housing the specimens used in this study: N.

Climate change can potentially affect parapatry by changing species' potential geographic distribution, and thereby widening or shrinking contact zones. Here, we study the effects of climate change on all six species in the genus Callithrix, a group of small-sized Neotropical primates that is distributed parapatrically in eastern Brazil, allegedly due to biotic interactions. Location Atlantic Forest, savanna and xeric shrublands from Brazil. Methods We explore a method to investigate potential effects of climate change on the distribution of parapatric species by (a) determining whether the parapatric pattern is explained by abiotic (climate) or biotic (species' interactions) factors using niche equivalency and niche similarity tests; (b) estimating each species' potential distribution under current and future climatic conditions, using ecological niche models; and (c) performing a pixel-by-pixel analysis in order to constrain distribution overlap between species pairs in which parapatry is maintained by biotic factors. Results We found that parapatry in Callithrix is maintained mostly by abiotic factors, except for two species pairs (Callithrix aurita vs. C. flaviceps and C. geoffroyi vs. C. penicillata) in which biotic factors are more likely to be acting. Our proposed method is able to produce better models than conventional ecological niche modelling, predicting net reductions in distribution area for some species and increases for others; however, reductions generally exceeded expansions. The reduction in potential distribution areas would maintain Callithrix flaviceps as Endangered under IUCN criteria. Main conclusions Despite range contractions and the loss of area of sympatry, climate change is unlikely to affect the parapatric distribution patterns in Callithrix, nor intensify interspecific interactions.","[Braz, Alan Gerhardt; Moncassim Vale, Mariana] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Lorini, Maria Lucia] Fed Univ State Rio de Janeiro, Dept Nat Sci, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Moncassim Vale, Mariana] Brazilian Res Network Global Climate Change Rede, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Moncassim Vale, Mariana] CSIC, Lab Int Cambio Global LINC Global, Madrid, Spain","Braz, AG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",brazagm@gmail.com,"Vale, Mariana M./I-9408-2012","Vale, Mariana M./0000-0003-0734-4925; Lorini, MariaLucia/0000-0002-7783-093X; Gerhardt Braz Magalhaes, Alan/0000-0003-4160-7039","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [132767/2014-7, 444704/2014-0, 477524/2012-2]; Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de JaneiroFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ) [E-26/111.577/2014, E_01/209966/2015]; MCTI/CNPq/FAPs PELD [34/2012]","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 132767/2014-7, 444704/2014-0 and 477524/2012-2; Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Grant/Award Number: E-26/111.577/2014 and E_01/209966/2015; MCTI/CNPq/FAPs PELD, Grant/Award Number: 34/2012",,117,7,7,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

In this study, we simplified the community assemblage to reduce interspecific competition and gain a better understanding of the role biotic conditions play in creating Yellow Perch fisheries. Yellow Perch were introduced into three recently renovated lakes in an attempt to increase growth rates through reduced interspecific competition and hypothetically allow fish to reach an acceptable size for angler harvest in a shorter period of time compared with four mixed-species lakes. Yellow Perch-only populations exhibited faster growth, potentially resulting from reduced interspecific competition, increased piscivory, and lower levels of activity. Yellow Perch-only populations also had more consistent recruitment, onset of maturation at age 1, and an earlier onset of sexual size dimorphism compared with mixed-species lakes and published literature. While limitations of density dependence were noted, natural resource managers are encouraged to investigate methods that would capitalize on the improved population dynamics of Yellow Perch-only lakes and the release from biotic controls.","[Munter, R.

Amur tigers and leopards are recovering across the China-Russia border. However, knowledge is limited about competitive interactions between two large cats in Northeast Asia.ObjectivesTo assess the spatial, temporal and combined spatiotemporal behavioral mechanisms potentially allow co-occurrence between tigers and leopards in a human-dominated forest landscape.MethodsBased on a large-scale camera-trapping data set in Northeast China, we used three different approaches for quantifying spatiotemporal associations: one spatial method (two-species occupancy model), one strictly temporal method (activity pattern overlap), and one spatiotemporal method based on multi-response permutation procedures at shared camera trap sites.ResultsSpatially, leopards showed no avoidance of the areas highly used by dominant tigers, but their diurnal activity pattern was significantly different from that of tigers. Spatiotemporal overlap analysis showed fine-scale behavioral avoidance when both co-occurred at camera locations, which further facilitates sympatry. Tigers spatially overlapped with humans, but they were less active during the day when human activities were more frequent. In areas with high cattle density, low occurrence of tigers and leopards may reflect the absence of sika deer, an important prey item for both species.ConclusionsThis study provides the first empirical evidence that tigers do not limit leopard distributions, at least in our study area in Northeast Asia. Our results highlighted temporal segregation, not large-scaled spatial avoidance, as a key mechanism promoting coexistence of two large carnivores. Understanding these fine- spatial scale (i.e., camera locations) interactions between sympatric carnivores can help devise management strategies for predator guilds in human-dominated landscapes, currently a major global challenge.","[Li, Zhilin; Wang, Tianming; Feng, Rongna; Feng, Limin; Mou, Pu; Ge, Jianping] Beijing Normal Univ, Monitoring & Res Ctr Amur Tiger & Amur Leopard, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Minist Educ,Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhilin; Wang, Tianming; Feng, Rongna; Feng, Limin; Mou, Pu; Ge, Jianping] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Smith, James L.

The goal of the work presented here was to quantify the composition of synthetic yeast communities in order to determine the competitiveness of different species and identify promising candidates for plant protection. For this purpose, colony counting of distinct species and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-offlight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; MALDI biotyping) were used to distinguish different yeast species and to quantify the composition of a synthetic community of six yeasts (Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida subhashii, Cyberlindnera sargentensis, Hanseniaspora sp., Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Pichia kluyveri) over time, on apples and in soil, and in different growth media. These studies revealed important characteristics that predispose the different species for particular applications. For example, the competitiveness and antagonistic activity of C. subhashii was strongly increased in the presence of N-acetylglucosamin as the sole carbon source, M. pulcherrima and A. pullulans were the strongest competitors on apple, and C. sargentensis competed the best in soil microcosms. Based on these laboratory studies, M. pulcherrima and A pullulans are promising candidates for biocontrol applications against fungal phyllosphere diseases, while C. sargentensis may hold potential for use against soilborne fungal pathogens. These results document the potential of MALDI-TOF MS for the quantitative analysis of synthetic yeast communities and highlight the value of studying microorganisms with relevant functions in moderately complex, synthetic communities and natural substrates rather than as individual isolates.","[Gross, Simon; Kunz, Liesa; Mueller, Denise C.; Kron, Amanda Santos; Freimoser, Florian M.] Agroscope, Res Div Plant Protect, Schloss 1, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland","Freimoser, FM (corresponding author), Agroscope, Res Div Plant Protect, Schloss 1, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland.",florian.freimoser@agroscope.admin.ch,"Freimoser, Florian/A-6152-2014","Freimoser, Florian/0000-0001-7607-3108",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [31003A_175665 / 1],"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 31003A_175665 / 1",,43,10,10,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0749-503X,1097-0061,,YEAST,Yeast,OCT,2018,35,10,,,,,559,566,,10.1002/yea.3321,,,8,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology; Mycology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology; Mycology,GV9GV,WOS:000446464700001,29752875,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2021-09-21,

Previous studies of dominance have predominently focussed on within-species interactions, while the drivers of between-species competitive hierarchies are poorly understood. The increasing prevalence of predictable anthropogenic food subsidies, such as that provided by garden bird feeders, is likely to intensify between-species competition. However, the consequences for resource acquisition await detailed study, and in particular, whether competitive interactions are influenced by food quality is not known. Here, we examine competitive interactions amongst ten passerine species of birds utilising supplementary food sources of differing quality. We show that dominance rank is strongly predicted by body mass across species. Socially dominant, heavier species monopolised access to a food that had a relatively short handling time (sunflower hearts), spent longer on supplementary feeders, and pecked at lower rates. In contrast subordinate, lighter species were constrained to feed on a food that had a relatively long handling time (sunflower seeds with the hull intact). Our findings suggest that differences in body mass may result in between-species dominance hierarchies that place the heaviest species in the greatest control of supplementary feeding sites, gaining superior access to higher value foods. This may have important implications for the use of supplementary feeding as a conservation tool.","[Francis, Megan L.; Plummer, Kate E.; Lythgoe, Bethany A.; Macallan, Catriona; Currie, Thomas E.; Blount, Jonathan D.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Plummer, Kate E.] The Nunnery, British Trust Ornithol, Thetford, Norfolk, England","Plummer, KE; Blount, JD (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, England.; Plummer, KE (corresponding author), The Nunnery, British Trust Ornithol, Thetford, Norfolk, England.",kate.plummer@bto.org; j.d.blount@exeter.ac.uk,,,Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/F007922/1],This work was funded by a studentship from the Natural Environment Research Council (grant number: NE/F007922/1).,,50,13,13,3,25,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,SEP 5,2018,13,9,,,,,,,e0202152,10.1371/journal.pone.0202152,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,GS6HC,WOS:000443789900017,30183709,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,2021-09-21,

One context in which interspecific mating commonly occurs is when closely related species come into secondary contact. Here, we tested whether reproductive isolation is greater in an area of recent secondary contact than in allopatry for two closely related insect species, and we examined whether mating between individuals of these two species constitutes reproductive interference. In Florida, two species of squash bugs (Hemiptera: Coreidae: Anasa tristis DeGeer and Anasa andresii Guerin-Meneville) have been secondarily sympatric for >= 80 generations, and male A. andresii copulate with female A. tristis. Because hybridization is often costly for females, we predicted that secondarily sympatric females would be less likely to mate with heterospecifics than would allopatric females. We found no evidence of recent selection on reproductive isolation: females from both populations were equally likely to mate with heterospecifics, and heterospecific males did not make more mating attempts than conspecifics to achieve copulations. However, female A. tristis paired with heterospecifics produced many fewer eggs and offspring than females paired with conspecifics, and this did not differ according to whether females were from allopatric or sympatric populations. Our findings show that reproductive barriers between these species existed before secondary contact. We suggest that habitat use may limit encounter frequency, and that female choice, multiple mating, and postcopulatory processes may reduce costs for females. Consequently, we suggest that mating systems and ecological factors mediate the effects of reproductive interference.","[Hamel, Jennifer A.; Eskeland, Emma E.; Stover, Paige L.] Elon Univ, McMichael Sci Ctr, Dept Biol, Elon, NC 27244 USA; [Hamel, Jennifer A.; Lehmann, Tyler K.] Elon Univ, McMichael Sci Ctr, Dept Environm Studies, Elon, NC 27244 USA","Hamel, JA (corresponding author), Elon Univ, McMichael Sci Ctr, Dept Biol, Elon, NC 27244 USA.; Hamel, JA (corresponding author), Elon Univ, McMichael Sci Ctr, Dept Environm Studies, Elon, NC 27244 USA.",jhamel2@elon.edu,"Hamel, Jen/H-9201-2019","Hamel, Jen/0000-0001-8505-3520",Elon University,"We thank Wes Henderson, Dawson Nance, and David Terrill for assistance with insect rearing and data collection.

The rate of elongation and thickening of individual branches (shoots) varies across plant species. This variation is important for the outcome of competition and other plant-plant interactions. Here, we compared rates of shoot growth across 44 species from tropical, warm temperate and cool temperate forests of eastern Australia. 2. Shoot growth rate was found to correlate with a suite of traits including the potential height of the species, xylem-specific conductivity, leaf size, leaf area per xylem cross-section (LA/XA), twig diameter (at 40 cm length), wood density and modulus of elasticity. 3. Within this suite of traits, maximum plant height was the clearest correlate of growth rates, explaining 50%-67% of the variation in growth overall (p < .0001), and 23%-32% of the variation (p < .05) in growth when holding the influence of the other traits constant. Structural equation models suggest that traits associated with hydraulics, biomechanics and the  leaf economics spectrum represent three clearly separated axes of variation, with the hydraulic axis exhibiting the strongest alignment with height and largest independent contribution to growth (in the case of branch thickening). However, most of the capacity of these axes to predict growth was also associated with maximum height, presumably reflecting coordinated selection on multiple traits that together influence life histories. 4. Growth rates were not strongly correlated with leaf nitrogen or leaf mass per unit leaf area. 5. Correlations between growth and maximum height arose both across latitude (47%, p < .0001) and from within-site differences between species (30%, p < .0001). Covariation between growth and maximum height was driven in part by variation in irradiance across sites as well as among canopy positions within sites (23%, p < .0001). A significant fraction of this shared variation was independent of irradiance (45%, p < .0001), reflecting intrinsic differences across species and sites.","[Gleason, Sean M.; Stephens, Andrea E.

However, since 2014, the presence of an allochthonous Cyanobacteria, Tychonema bourrellyi, able to produce consistent biomasses and harmful toxins, was detected. The causes of this expansion are poorly understood. Many studies have linked the development of allochthonous Cyanobacteria populations with climate change. This study shows the spatio-temporal dynamics, the ecological requirements, and the interspecific relationship of P. rubescens and T. bourrellyi. Samples were collected monthly in 2016 at six different depths in the water column; 20 chemico-physical characteristics were measured; and Cyanobacteria density, morphology, and biovolume were evaluated. The results allowed a comparison of the spatial pattern of the two species, which showed a greater distribution at a depth of 10-20 m, and their seasonal dynamics. Both Cyanobacteria were present throughout the year, with the greatest abundance during the period from March to May. A temporal shift was observed in their development, linked to different capacities for overcoming winter and mixing periods. Principal Component Analysis, performed on 20 observations (4 months <mml:semantics> x </mml:semantics> 5 depths), highlighted the important role of the stability of the water column in determining T. bourrellyi settlement in Lake Iseo and the role of solar radiation in spring population development.","[Nava, Veronica; Patelli, Martina; Soler, Valentina; Leoni, Barbara] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Piazza Sci 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Leoni, B (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Piazza Sci 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",v.nava15@campus.unimib.it; m.patelli3@campus.unimib.it; valentina.soler@unimib.it; barbara.leoni@unimib.it,"Nava, Veronica/E-6989-2018","Nava, Veronica/0000-0002-2770-1937; LEONI, BARBARA/0000-0001-9448-9457",Fondazione CariploFondazione Cariplo [2014-1282]; University of Milano-Bicocca (FA),"We would like to dedicate our work to the dear colleague Giuseppe Morabito, whose presence and competences we miss.

Differences in foraging behavior are hypothesized to contribute to species coexistence by facilitating resource partitioning, but little is known on the multiple mechanisms for partitioning that may occur simultaneously. Studies are further limited in the marine environment, where the spatial and temporal distribution of resources is highly dynamic and subsequently difficult to quantify. We investigated potential pathways by which foraging behavior may facilitate resource partitioning in two of the largest co-occurring and closely related species on Earth, blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales. We integrated multiple long-term datasets (line-transect surveys, whale-watching records, net sampling, stable isotope analysis, and remote-sensing of oceanographic parameters) to compare the diet, phenology, and distribution of the two species during their foraging periods in the highly productive waters of Monterey Bay, California, USA within the California Current Ecosystem. Our long-term study reveals that blue and humpback whales likely facilitate sympatry by partitioning their foraging along three axes: trophic, temporal, and spatial. Blue whales were specialists foraging on krill, predictably targeting a seasonal peak in krill abundance, were present in the bay for an average of 4.7months, and were spatially restricted at the continental shelf break. In contrast, humpback whales were generalists apparently feeding on a mixed diet of krill and fishes depending on relative abundances, were present in the bay for a more extended period (average of 6.6months), and had a broader spatial distribution at the shelf break and inshore. Ultimately, competition for common resources can lead to behavioral, morphological, and physiological character displacement between sympatric species. Understanding the mechanisms for species coexistence is both fundamental to maintaining biodiverse ecosystems, and provides insight into the evolutionary drivers of morphological differences in closely related species.","[Fossette, Sabrina; Abrahms, Briana; Hazen, Elliott L.; Bograd, Steven J.] NOAA, Environm Res Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Monterey, CA 93943 USA; [Abrahms, Briana; Hazen, Elliott L.; Zilliacus, Kelly M.; Marinovic, Baldo; Tershy, Bernie; Croll, Donald A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Calambokidis, John] Cascadia Res Collect, Olympia, WA USA; [Burrows, Julia A.] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Div Marine Sci & Conservat, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Burrows, Julia A.; Harvey, James T.] Moss Landing Marine Labs, Pob 450, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Goldbogen, Jeremy A.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Dept Biol, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Fossette, Sabrina] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, 17 Dick Perry Av, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia","Fossette, S (corresponding author), NOAA, Environm Res Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.; Fossette, S (corresponding author), Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, 17 Dick Perry Av, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia.",Sabrina.fossette@googlemail.com,"Hazen, Elliott L/G-4149-2014; Bograd, Steven/AAA-4824-2021","Hazen, Elliott L/0000-0002-0412-7178; Fossette, Sabrina/0000-0001-8580-9084",National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; NOAA/Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary; Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; ONROffice of Naval Research,National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; NOAA/Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary; Packard Foundation; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; ONR Young Investigator Program,,103,15,15,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We determined spatial and temporal partitioning patterns of a guild of small African carnivores: the African wildcat Felis silvestris lybica, grey mongoose Galerella pulverulenta, small-spotted genet Genetta genetta, striped polecat Ictonyx striatus, and the yellow mongoose Cynictis penicillata. We quantified the degree of spatial and temporal co-occurrence of the small carnivores using camera trap data over a year-long period. Carnivores separated into two temporal groups: nocturnal species (wildcat, polecat and genet) and diurnal species (mongooses). In addition, carnivores within the same temporal group had strong patterns of reduced spatial co-occurrence. The smaller bodied carnivores showed lower co-occurrence with the larger bodied African wildcat than expected by chance, supporting the idea of dominant competitor avoidance. Thus, small carnivores likely minimise competitive interactions through spatio-temporal habitat partitioning.","[de Satge, Jacques] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Antwerp, Belgium; [Teichman, Kristine] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Teichman, Kristine; Cristescu, Bogdan] Cape Leopard Trust, Cape Town, South Africa; [Cristescu, Bogdan] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Cape Town, South Africa","de Satge, J (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Antwerp, Belgium.",jdesatge@gmail.com; kristine.teichman@ubc.ca; cristescu.bog@gmail.com,,"Cristescu, Bogdan/0000-0003-2964-5040; de Satge, Jacques/0000-0003-1094-9642",Cape Leopard Trust; Conservation South Africa; South African National Parks; Woolworths Holdings Limited; ABAX Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Canada Graduate Scholarship-Doctoral at the University of British Columbia; Claude Leon Foundation postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cape Town,"We thank The Cape Leopard Trust, Conservation South Africa and South African National Parks for logistical and/or funding support throughout the project.

While the Late Pleistocene is better recorded, the Middle Pleistocene record remains more fragmentary. The Punta Lucero site (Biscay) has yielded the most important fossil assemblage of the middle Middle Pleistocene for the northern Iberian Peninsula in both, number of identified specimens and taxonomic diversity. Punta Lucero constitutes a unique opportunity to evaluate Middle Pleistocene mammalian resource and habitat use, and trophic dynamics employing a combined approach: biogeochemical analysis and mathematical modeling. Stable isotope analysis points to resource partitioning between Punta Lucero cervids and bovids. Stable isotope analysis and trophic modeling evidence resource overlap and interspecific competition among predators, especially between the scimitar-toothed cat Homotherium latidens and the European jaguar Panthera gombaszoegensis. The trophic resource availability modeling assumes that Canis mosbachensis consumed a 20% of preys of more than 10 kg, mainly as carrion. Thus, while there would be a taxonomic overlap with those preys consumed by the large felids, the different strategy would have facilitated the coexistence of these canids with larger carnivores. Trophic modeling indicates a high competition among the predator guild. The potential presence of hominins in the area would have reached to an unsustainable situation. However, the potential presence of other prey species, such as Equus sp., would have made the ecosystem more sustainable. The methodology followed in this study highlights the potential of multidisciplinary approaches in the assessment of Pleistocene faunal dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the extent to which one co-flowering species can relieve pollination limitation of another while simultaneously competing for abiotic resource has rarely been examined. Using a deterministic model we explored the demographic outcome for one (focal) species of its co-occurrence with a species that shares pollinators and competes for both pollinator visitation and abiotic resources. In this paper we showed how the overall impact can be positive or negative, depending on the balance between enhanced fertilization versus increased competition. Our model could predict the density of co-flowering species that will maximize the pollination rate of the focal species by attracting pollinators. Because that density will also give rise to competitive effects, a lower density of co-flowering species is required for optimizing the trade-off between enhanced fertilization and competition so as to give the maximum possible facilitation of reproduction in the focal species. Results were qualitatively different when we considered attractiveness of the co-flowering species, as opposed to its density, because attractiveness, unlike density, had no effect on competition for abiotic resources. Whereas unattractive neighbours would not bring in pollinators, very attractive neighbours would captivate pollinators, not sharing them with the focal species. Thus optimal benefit to the focal species came at intermediate levels of attractiveness in the co-flowering species. This intermediate level of attractiveness in co-flowering species simultaneously maximized pollination and overall facilitation of reproduction for the focal species. The likelihood of facilitation was predicted to decline with the selfing rate of the focal species, revealing an indirect cost for an inbreeding mating system. Whether a co-flowering species can be facilitative depends on the way pollinators respond to the plant density: only a Type III functional response for visitation rate can result in facilitation. Our model provided both a conceptual framework and precise quantitative measures for determining the impacts of a neighbouring co-flowering species on reproduction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, direct calorimetry was used to analyze the energy density of seven pelagic species collected over four seasons from the western Mediterranean Sea: anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardina pilchardus, round sardinella Sardinella aurita, horse mackerels Trachurus trachurus and T. mediterraneus, and mackerels Scomber scombrus and S. colias. Inter-specific differences in energy density were linked to spawning period, energy allocation strategies for reproduction and growth, and feeding ecologies. Energy density of each species varied over time, with the exception of S. colitis, likely due to its high energetic requirements related to migration throughout the year. In general, higher energy density was observed in spring for all species, regardless of their breeding strategy, probably as a consequence of the late-winter phytoplankton bloom. These results provide new insights into the temporal availability of energy in the pelagic ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea, which are pivotal for understanding how the population dynamics of small and medium pelagic fishes and their predators may respond to environmental changes and fishing impacts. In addition, the differences found in energy density between species highlighted the importance of using species specific energy values in ecosystem assessment tools such as bioenergetic and food web models.","[Albo-Puigserver, M.; Munoz, A.; Navarro, J.; Coll, M.; Palomera, I.] CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Navarro, J.] CSIC, EBD, Dept Conservat Biol, Avda Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Navarro, J.] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut,EPHE,UMR 5175, Montpellier, France; [Coll, M.] Univ Cape Town, Inst Rech Dev, UMR MARBEC, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Coll, M.] Univ Cape Town, LMI ICEMASA, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Pethybridge, H.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Sanchez, S.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Albo-Puigserver, M (corresponding author), CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",albo@icm.csic.es,"Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009; Puigserver, Marta Albo/AAP-5800-2020; Puigserver, Marta Albo/F-5693-2016; Coll, Marta/A-9488-2012","Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543; Puigserver, Marta Albo/0000-0002-0477-5984; Puigserver, Marta Albo/0000-0002-0477-5984; Coll, Marta/0000-0001-6235-5868","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2012-054267]; Andalucia Talent Hub Program (Andalusian Knowledge Agency, European Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions) [267226]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [PCIG10-GA-2011-303534]; MINECO, Spain [CTM2011-26333]","We would like to thank all of the participants of the ECOTRANS Project, fishermen and crew on board the R.V.

The fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been detected in almost 700 different amphibian species and is implicated in numerous global amphibian population declines. Identifying key hosts in the amphibian-Bd system those who are at greatest risk or who pose the greatest risk for others is challenging due in part to many extrinsic environmental factors driving spatiotemporal Bd distribution and context-dependent host responses to Bd in the wild. One way to improve predictive risk models and generate testable mechanistic hypotheses about vulnerability is to complement what we know about the spatial epidemiology of Bd with data collected through comparative experimental studies. We used standardized pathogen challenges to quantify amphibian survival and infection trajectories across 20 post-metamorphic North American species raised from eggs. We then incorporated trait-based models to investigate the predictive power of phylogenetic history, habitat use, and ecological and life history traits in explaining responses to Bd. True frogs (Ranidae) displayed the lowest infection intensities, whereas toads (Bufonidae) generally displayed the greatest levels of mortality after Bd exposure. Affiliation with ephemeral aquatic habitat and breadth of habitat use were strong predictors of vulnerability to and intensity of infection and several other traits including body size, lifespan, age at sexual maturity, and geographic range also appeared in top models explaining host responses to Bd. Several of the species examined are highly understudied with respect to Bd such that this study represents the first experimental susceptibility data. Combining insights gained from experimental studies with observations of landscape level disease prevalence may help explain current and predict future pathogen dynamics in the Bd system.","[Gervasi, Stephanie S.] Monell Chem Senses Ctr, 3500 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Stephens, Patrick R.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Hua, Jessica] Binghamton Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY USA; [Searle, Catherine L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Xie, Gisselle Yang; Weis, Virginia; Blaustein, Andrew R.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Urbina, Jenny] Oregon State Univ, Environm Sci Grad Program, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Olson, Deanna H.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Corvallis, OR USA; [Bancroft, Betsy A.] Gonzaga Univ, Dept Biol, Spokane, WA 99258 USA; [Hammond, John I.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Relyea, Rick A.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Troy, NY USA","Gervasi, SS (corresponding author), Monell Chem Senses Ctr, 3500 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",steph.gervasi@gmail.com,"Weis, Virginia/T-5095-2019; Bancroft, Betsy/AAP-2999-2020","Searle, Catherine/0000-0002-6607-2299; Bancroft, Betsy/0000-0001-5581-2653; Urbina, Jenny/0000-0003-2461-9572; Weis, Virginia/0000-0002-1826-2848",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 07-16149]; US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [K12GM088021]; Sigma Delta Epsilon-Graduate Women in Science Hartley Corporation Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [K12GM088021] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by NSF grant # DEB 07-16149 (Funding to RAR and ARB), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station (Funding to DHO), National Institute of General Medical Sciences # K12GM088021 (Funding to JIH during habitat survey collection), Sigma Delta Epsilon-Graduate Women in Science Hartley Corporation Foundation (Funding to SSG).

When unequal competitors are involved, the dominant species tends to displace the subordinate one to its less preferred habitat. Here, we use habitat isodars, an approach which reflects evolutionary stable strategies of habitat selection, to evaluate whether interspecific competition between two competing species with distinct habitat preferences, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax and the great bustard Otis tarda, modulates their habitat use. Field data on these endangered species demonstrate that unequal competitors can coexist without completely segregating on their preferred habitats. The negatively sloped isodar of the subordinate little bustard unveils its competition with the dominant great bustard. Interference from great bustards in secondary cereal habitats reinforces use of preferred natural habitat by little bustards. Studies of density-dependent habitat selection by a single-species can thus aid in identifying the effects of competition on community composition, and guide the conservation of at-risk species. Isodars, in particular, represent a promising method to gain clear knowledge on interspecific competition for species in which experimental manipulations are not feasible.","[Tarjuelo, Rocio; Traba, Juan; Morales, Manuel B.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, C Darwin 2, ES-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Tarjuelo, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, C Darwin 2, ES-28049 Madrid, Spain.",rocio.tarjuelo@gmail.com,"Tarjuelo, Rocio/ABG-9983-2020; Traba, Juan/D-9191-2012; Morales, Manuel B./B-1448-2014","Traba, Juan/0000-0001-6326-8942; Tarjuelo Mostajo, Rocio/0000-0002-0638-1911",Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2009-13029/BOS]; network of the Madrid region REMEDINAL2 [S-2009/AMB/1783]; network of the Madrid region REMEDINAL 3CM [S2013/MAE-2719]; Aeropuerto de Ciudad Real S.A.; FPU-grantSpanish Government [AP2009-0762],Funding was provided by the Spanish Ministry of Science (CGL2009-13029/BOS); and the networks of the Madrid region REMEDINAL2 (S-2009/AMB/1783) and REMEDINAL 3CM (S2013/MAE-2719).

This logic is based on strong competition and niche similarity among closely related species-a less common phenomenon than previously expected. Dragonflies and damselflies are good models for testing predictions based on this logic because they behave aggressively towards related species due to mistaken identification of conspecifics. This behavior may drive communities toward phylogenetic overdispersion if closely related species frequently exclude each other. However, phylogenetically clustered communities could also be observed if habitat filtering and/or competitive asymmetry among distantly related species are major drivers of community assembling. We investigated the phylogenetic structure of odonate assemblages in central Brazil in a watershed characterized by variations in stream width, vegetation cover, aquatic vegetation, and luminosity. We observed general clustering in communities according to two indices of phylogenetic structure. Phylogenetic beta diversity coupled with Mantel tests and RLQ analysis evidenced a correlation between the riverine gradient and phylogenetic structure. Larger rivers with aquatic vegetation were characterized by anisopterans, while most zygopterans stayed in small and shaded streams. These results indicate niche conservatism in Odonata habitat occupancy, and that the environment is a major influence on the phylogenetic structure of these communities. We suggest that this is due to clade-specific ecophysiological requirements, and because closely related species may also have competitive advantages and dominate certain preferred habitats.","[Saito, Victor S.] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Recursos Nat, Rod Washington Luiz Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Valente-Neto, Francisco; Rodrigues, Marciel Elio] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Roque, Fabio de Oliveira] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Ctr Ciencias Biol & Saude, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Roque, Fabio de Oliveira] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Siqueira, Tadeu] Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Dept Ecol, Inst Biociencias, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil","Saito, VS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Recursos Nat, Rod Washington Luiz Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",victor.saito@gmail.com,"Neto, Francisco Valente/M-3991-2014; Rodrigues, Marciel E/D-6826-2013; Siqueira, Tadeu/A-6978-2009; Saito, Victor/K-1498-2013","Neto, Francisco Valente/0000-0002-5298-3753; Siqueira, Tadeu/0000-0001-5069-2904; Rodrigues, Marciel/0000-0001-8161-6234; Saito, Victor/0000-0001-6112-7249","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/20540-0, 2013/50424-1]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [1171579]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [480933/2012-0]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [09908/2013-2]; FundectFundacao de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT MS);  [99999.009654/2014-03];  [1073627]","The authors thank Dr. Scott Peacor and two anonymous reviewers for comments and suggestions on this manuscript.

Intraspecific competitive interactions between fungal isolates are likely to affect both fungal and plant performance and be influenced by abiotic factors. Here, we assessed the impact of intraspecific competition between three Pisolithus microcarpus isolates on the establishment of, and benefit derived from, symbioses with Eucalyptus grandis seedlings. We investigated the outcomes of competition under ambient and elevated temperature and CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in a factorial design. We observed a reduction in mycelium growth, mycorrhiza formation and seedling mass when two P. microcarpus isolates were co-inoculated on a single E. grandis seedling. Isolates invested more in mycelium than in mycorrhizas in the presence of a competitor. All isolates responded negatively to elevated [CO2] and positively to elevated temperature, which led to no changes on the outcomes of the interactions with changing conditions. However, the presence of a competitor hindered the positive response of P. microcarpus isolates to warming, which resulted in larger negative effects of competition under elevated temperature than under ambient conditions. Our study highlights the need to consider how competition affects individual fungal responses as well as plant performance when trying to predict the impacts of climate change.Warming increases the detrimental effects that competitive interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi have on both the host plant and the competing fungal isolates.Warming increases the detrimental effects that competitive interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi have on both the host plant and the competing fungal isolates.","[Hortal, S.; Powell, J.

Aggression in hermit crabs has been well studied in shell acquisition circumstances, yet less is known about hermit crabs' competitive behavior in other contexts, especially as they relate to feeding. As active foragers, competition for food resources may be a major determinant of hermit crab aggression and fighting behavior, particularly in intertidal marine environments, where protein-rich carrion may be limiting. Here, we measured aggressive, competitive interactions between hermit crabs [Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857)] that were presented with carrion in the laboratory, immediately after they were collected from the field. Aggregations of three crabs were provided with either mussel or gastropod flesh. Both forms of carrion naturally indicate food availability, though only the latter may correlate with potential shell availability. We found that levels of aggression rose significantly in response to both carrion conditions, but not in response to a control condition involving the introduction of a non-eatable object. Larger individuals displayed the highest levels of aggressive behavior, but levels of aggression did not differ between crabs provided with the gastropod and the mussel flesh. These results reveal that food-independent of a shell resource-can be a powerful motivator for competitive behavior in hermit crabs. Further studies of food-related aggression between different hermit crab species could shed light on how interspecific competition might lead to potential specializations on different carrion or prey resources.","[Greggor, Alison L.; Laidre, Mark E.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Greggor, Alison L.; Laidre, Mark E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Greggor, Alison L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England","Laidre, ME (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.; Laidre, ME (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mark.laidre@dartmouth.edu,"Greggor, Alison/H-6956-2019","Greggor, Alison/0000-0003-0998-618X",Miller Institute at Berkeley,"We thank the Bodega Marine Laboratory and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for permission to conduct this research.

We use a mixture of mathematical models and known allometric relationships to examine whether host and parasite life histories constrain the diversity of parasite species that can coexist in the population of any host species. The model consists of one differential equation for each parasite species and a single density-dependent nonlinear equation for the affected host under the assumption of exploitation competition. We derive threshold conditions for the coexistence and competitive exclusion of parasite species using invasion criteria and stability analysis of the resulting equilibria. These results are then used to evaluate the range of parasites species that can invade and establish in a target host and identify the optimal' size of a parasite species for a host of a given body size; optimal' is defined as the body size of a parasite species that cannot be outcompeted by any other parasite species. The expected distributions of parasites body sizes in hosts of different sizes are then compared with those observed in empirical studies.

Nonetheless, most research has focused on the role of shared parasites as mediators of interspecific competition. Here, we explore the relative effects of Gyrodactylus specialist ectoparasites of Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata on competition between their host and juveniles of the killifish Rivulus hartii. In mesocosms that replicate natural streams, we exposed guppies to only competitors, to only parasites, to both parasites and competitors, or the absence of both. Consistent with previous studies, we found that female guppies grew significantly less where only Gyrodactylus were present, and this was regardless of infection status or parasite load. Surprisingly, this effect of Gyrodactylus on the growth of female guppies was greatly reduced when both parasites and competitors were present in the mesocosms. We conclude that guppies can mediate the effects of Gyrodactylus on competition with Rivulus, by adaptively fine-tuning their phenotype when simultaneously facing multiple enemies.","[Perez-Jvostov, Felipe; Scott, Marilyn E.] McGill Univ, Inst Parasitol, 21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Perez-Jvostov, Felipe; Scott, Marilyn E.] McGill Univ, Ctr Host Parasite Interact, 21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Hendry, Andrew P.] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Fussmann, Gregor F.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Perez-Jvostov, F (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Inst Parasitol, 21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.; Perez-Jvostov, F (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Ctr Host Parasite Interact, 21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",felipe.perezjvostov@mail.mcgill.ca,,"Fussmann, Gregor/0000-0001-9576-0122",,,,58,5,5,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2016,125,6,,,,,790,796,,10.1111/oik.02499,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DN6UM,WOS:000377212000005,,,,,2021-09-21,

We applied a Bayesian hierarchical approach to a 29-yr time series of territory density of seven landbird species at a site in coastal California where secondary plant succession has occurred. We found that interspecific interactions were the least important driver in our system, explaining between 0% and 5% of variation. The combined effects of vegetation and rainfall variation explained 6% to 30% of variation in species trends. Intraspecific processes explained between 0% and 39% of variation. Between 27% and 90% of variation was attributed to unexplained variation. Our results demonstrate that in the system studied, interspecific interactions among landbirds are relatively unimportant. These results suggest that in some cases it may be valid to model projections of individual populations to predict community responses to future conditions; however, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution because interspecific interactions in our community did not include novel interactions that could result from distributional shifts in species ranges.","[Porzig, Elizabeth L.; Seavy, Nathaniel E.; Humple, Diana L.; Geupel, Geoffrey R.; Gardali, Thomas] Point Blue Conservat Sci, 3820 Cypress Dr 11, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA; [Porzig, Elizabeth L.; Eadie, John M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Porzig, EL (corresponding author), Point Blue Conservat Sci, 3820 Cypress Dr 11, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA.; Porzig, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",eporzig@pointblue.org,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-0533918]; Point Reyes National Seashore [2063],"We are grateful to L.

For this reason, they have been often used to examine the consequences of competitive interactions. Hosts represent limited resources for larval parasitoid development and thus one competitor usually excludes all others. Although parasitoid competition has been debated and studied over the past several decades, understanding the factors that allow for coexistence among species sharing the same host in the field remains elusive. Parasitoids may be able to coexist on the same host species if they partition host resources according to size, age, or stage, or if their dynamics vary at spatial and temporal scales. One area that has thus far received little experimental attention is if competition can alter host usage strategies in parasitoids that in the absence of competitors attack hosts of the same size in the field. Here, we test this hypothesis with two parasitoid species in the genus Aphytis, both of which are specialized on the citrus pest California red scale Aonidiella aurantii. These parasitoids prefer large scales as hosts and yet coexist in sympatry in eastern parts of Spain. Parasitoids and hosts were sampled in 12 replicated orange groves. When host exploitation by the stronger competitor, A. melinus, was high the poorer competitor, A. chrysomphali, changed its foraging strategy to prefer alternative plant substrates where it parasitized hosts of smaller size. Consequently, the inferior parasitoid species shifted both its habitat and host size as a result of competition. Our results suggest that density-dependent size-mediated asymmetric competition is the likely mechanism allowing for the coexistence of these two species, and that the use of suboptimal (small) hosts can be advantageous under conditions imposed by competition where survival in higher quality larger hosts may be greatly reduced.","[Pekas, Apostolos; Garcia-Mari, Ferran] Univ Politecn Valencia, IAM, Cami de Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Tena, Alejandro] UJI, IVIA, Unidad Asociada Entomol, Valencia 46113, Spain; [Harvey, Jeffrey A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Frago, Enric] Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, Droevendaalsesteeg 1,Bldg 107,POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Frago, E (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, Droevendaalsesteeg 1,Bldg 107,POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",enric.frago@gmail.com,"Harvey, Jeffrey A/B-7439-2008; Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Pekas, Apostolos/J-8823-2017; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Harvey, Jeffrey A/0000-0002-4227-7935; Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Pekas, Apostolos/0000-0002-8209-3882; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia of SpainSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [AGL2005-07155-C03-03]; European CommunityEuropean Commission [329648],"We would like to thank Amparo Aguilar for her valuable help in the field and in the laboratory, and Camille Ponzio for her comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Color variation among populations of variably toxic organisms has been shown to associate with alternative anti-predator behaviors. However, the effects of these alternative behavioral tendencies on the outcomes of interspecific interactions other than predator-prey remain largely unexplored. We investigated how coloration and body size variation in Oophaga pumilio, one of the most phenotypically diverse amphibians known, associated with territorial aggressiveness and how this association influenced the outcome of agonistic male-male interactions with conspecifics and heterospecifics of two sympatric species (Andinobates claudiae and Phyllobates lugubris). Irrespective of body size, resident frogs from more conspicuous, red-colored O. pumilio populations responded to same-morph conspecifics and P. lugubris more quickly and exhibited more aggressive behaviors and more energetically expensive behaviors than resident frogs from green populations under these same treatments. Furthermore, red-colored resident frogs dominated most of the interactions in which they were involved, whereas green residents dominated only a few of the interactions, despite their status as residents. Because conspecific and heterospecific intruders did not behave more aggressively toward red resident frogs, aggressiveness of red residents does not appear to be a response to higher aggression being directed toward them. These results suggest that coloration in O. pumilio is a good indicator of aggressiveness that associates with the outcome of intraspecific and some interspecific behavioral male-male interactions, providing support for a positive association among anti-predator traits, agonistic behavior, and dominance in both intraspecific and interspecific, intraguild interactions.","[Galeano, Sandra P.; Harms, Kyle E.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Galeano, SP (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",sgalea1@tigers.lsu.edu,,,Sigma Xi Chapter of Louisiana State University; Louisiana Environmental from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries; Education Commission from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries,"We are grateful to M.

However, severe declines in diadromous fish populations in the nearshore Gulf of Maine (GOM) have impacted trophic dynamics and increased pressure on other estuarine-dependent forage resources. The objective of this study was to compare the trophic positions and interspecific interactions of diadromous fishes as predators and prey in relation to current GOM forage fishes. Empirical biomass data along with diet compositions and vital rates were used to construct a static model of a representative GOM coastal food web: the Saco River estuary (SRE) in Maine. A series of sensitivity analyses based on model outputs was performed to determine the trophic role of diadromous fishes in this estuarine food web. Model results suggested that juvenile marine transients played a greater role as forage species for SRE predators than did the anadromous Blueback Herring Alosa aestivalis and Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. Due to the abundant forage fish base, Atlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus and Shortnose Sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum were estimated to have a greater trophic position than reported in past literature. Lower-trophic-level fishes functioned as keystone prey species for sturgeon. The use of holistic approaches to update the ecological data on predator-prey interactions among diadromous fishes and forage resources within coastal ecosystems is necessary for the future management of these ecologically significant and threatened species.","[Smith, Kayla M.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Sci, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Byron, Carrie J.; Sulikowski, James A.] Univ New England, Dept Marine Sci, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA","Smith, KM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Sci, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",kmsmi100@syr.edu,"Byron, Carrie J/B-6606-2014","Byron, Carrie J/0000-0003-3820-7392","NOAA Species of Concern Research Program; NOAA Section 6 Research Program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EPS-0904155, DGE-0841361]","We thank the graduate and undergraduate students of the Sulikowski and Byron laboratories at the Marine Science Center (MSC), University of New England (UNE).

Since natural and engineered microbial ecosystems are too complex to study, six types of synthetic microbial ecosystems SMEs) were constructed under chemostat conditions with phenol as the sole carbon and energy source. Two to four phenol-degrading, phylogenetically and physiologically different bacterial strains were used in each SME. Phylogeny was based on the nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA genes, while physiologic traits were based on kinetic and growth parameters on phenol. Two indices, J parameter and interspecies interaction, were compared to predict which strain would become dominant in an SME. The J parameter was calculated from kinetic and growth parameters. On the other hand, interspecies interaction, a new index proposed in this study, was evaluated by measuring the specific growth activity, which was determined on the basis of relative growth of a strain with or without the supernatant prepared from other bacterial cultures. Population densities of strains used in SMEs were enumerated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the gene encoding the large subunit of phenol hydroxylase and were compared to predictions made from J parameter and interspecies interaction calculations. In 4 of 6 SEMs tested the final dominant strain shown by real-time qPOR analyses coincided with the strain predicted by both the J parameter and the interspecies interaction. However, in SMEII-2 and SMEII-3 the final dominant Variovorax strains coincided with prediction of the interspecies interaction but not the J parameter. These results demonstrate that the effects of interspecies interactions within microbial communities contribute to determining the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem.","[Aziz, Fatma A.

The effect of interspecific competition was dependent on the species identity but not on the CO (2) level. The interest in adaptive forest strategies to overcome predicted scenarios of climate change is increasing worldwide. An example of these strategies is the introduction of native species into mono-specific plantations. However, to fully consider this option/strategy, a higher understanding of the responses of forest tree species to concurrent biotic and abiotic factors is needed. The aim of the present study was to assess nutritional and morphological adjustments of individuals of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst] growing at enhanced levels of CO2 and with different proportions of con-specific individuals in its vicinity. Individuals that grew at elevated CO2 levels showed higher values of relative growth rate (RGR), total twig dry biomass and root biomass, and lower values of leaf area ratio, leaf N and Mg concentrations and soil nutrient concentrations. Individuals of Norway spruce growing in the vicinity of high proportions of European beech showed a reduction in the allocation of biomass to foliar tissue, and lower values of RGR and root biomass. European beech, by contrast, showed a limited response to Norway spruce presence and higher capacity in the exploitation of space both above- and below-ground. In conclusion, the lower response of European beech to both environmental factors suggests that the introduction of European beech into Norway spruce stands could be a feasible option in current forest transition strategies.","[Rolo, V.; Andivia, E.; Pokorny, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Silviculture, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Pokorny, R.] Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Brno 60300, Czech Republic","Rolo, V (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Conservat Ecol Res Unit, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Lynnwood Rd, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",victorroloromero@gmail.com,"Pokorny, Radek/D-8208-2014; Andivia, Enrique/B-3088-2017; Rolo, Victor/H-1713-2016","Andivia, Enrique/0000-0002-9096-3294; Rolo, Victor/0000-0001-5854-9512; Pokorny, Radek/0000-0002-7545-7051","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I) [LO1415]; OP Education for Competitiveness (European Social Fund); OP Education for Competitiveness (Czech Republic Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport) [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0017]; government of South Africa (NRF Freestanding Post-doctoral Fellowship); FSR Incoming Post-doctoral Fellowship of the Academie Universitaire Louvain; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre","We thank Pavel Formanek for help and support with the laboratory analysis and to Czech Globe staff for allowing us to use their installations and scientific facilities.

Generally, dispersal decisions are condition-dependent and rely on information in the broad sense, like the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard condition-dependence. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is condition-dependent and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement depend on and are adjusted by the strength of interspecific interactions. We found that the predicting movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and interspecific interaction strengths. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking interspecific interactions into account are likely flawed. Our work identifies the significance of condition-dependence for understanding metacommunity dynamics, stability and the coexistence and distribution of species.","[Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Altermatt, Florian] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Altermatt, Florian] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Klecka, Jan; Melian, Carlos J.] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Fish Ecol & Evolut, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Klecka, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Entomol, Ctr Biol, Lab Theoret Ecol, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Fronhofer, EA (corresponding author), Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",emanuel.fronhofer@eawag.ch,"Fronhofer, Emanuel A./J-9784-2013; Fronhofer, Emanuel A./AAY-3186-2021; Melian, Carlos/C-2146-2008; Melian, Carlos/AAZ-2026-2020; Klecka, Jan/H-7874-2014","Fronhofer, Emanuel A./0000-0002-2219-784X; Fronhofer, Emanuel A./0000-0002-2219-784X; Melian, Carlos/0000-0003-3974-6515; Melian, Carlos/0000-0003-3974-6515; Altermatt, Florian/0000-0002-4831-6958; Klecka, Jan/0000-0003-0633-3896","Eawag; Sciex Fellowship [12.327]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PP00P3_150698, 31003A_144162]","The authors are grateful to Julien Cote and two anonymous referees for their constructive and valuable comments that helped us improve the manuscript.

Amphibians play a critical role both as consumers and prey in aquatic communities and yet there is still little information on the trophic status of most amphibians. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which they can alter their trophic ecology in response to changing conditions. We experimentally investigated the effects of increased amphibian density, presence of intraguild competitors, and presence of native and invasive predators (either free or caged) on the trophic status of a Mediterranean amphibian guild, using stable isotopes. We observed variations in delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic values among amphibian species and treatments and differences in their food sources. Macrophytes were the most important food resource for spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes) and relatively important for all anurans within the guild. High density and presence of P. cultripes tadpoles markedly reduced macrophyte biomass, forcing tadpoles to increase their feeding on detritus, algae and zooplankton, resulting in lower delta C-13 values. Native dytiscid predators only changed the isotopic signature of newts whereas invasive red swamp crayfish had an enormous impact on environmental conditions and greatly affected the isotopic values of amphibians. Crayfish forced tadpoles to increase detritus ingestion or other resources depleted in delta C-13. We found that the opportunistic amphibian feeding was greatly conditioned by intra-and interspecific competition whereas non-consumptive predator effects were negligible. Determining the trophic plasticity of amphibians can help us understand natural and anthropogenic changes in aquatic ecosystems and assess amphibians' ability to adjust to different environmental conditions.","[Arribas, Rosa; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Caut, Stephane] CSIC, Dept Ethol & Conservat Biodivers, Donana Biol Stn, E-41080 Seville, Spain","Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/F-8226-2014","Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/0000-0003-0094-8195","Plan Nacional I+D from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [CGL2009-11123, CGL2012-4044]; Spanish Severo Ochoa Program [SEV-2012-0262]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity [BES2010-042243]","Funding for this study was provided by grants CGL2009-11123 and CGL2012-4044 from Plan Nacional I+D from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, from the Spanish Severo Ochoa Program (SEV-2012-0262), and dissertation grant BES2010-042243 awarded to RA by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity.",,61,26,26,1,47,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 19,2015,10,6,,,,,,,e0130897,10.1371/journal.pone.0130897,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CL3FE,WOS:000356835000157,26091281,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

Our aim was to compare fine root distributions and orientations in trees grown in an alley cropping agroforestry stand with those in a tree monoculture. Methods Fieldwork was conducted in two adjacent 17 year old hybrid walnut (Juglans regia x nigra L.) stands in southern France: the agroforestry stand was intercropped with durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum) whereas the tree monoculture had a natural understorey. Root intercepts were mapped to a depth of 150 cm on trench walls in both stands, and to a depth of 400 cm in the agroforestry stand in order to characterise tree root distribution below the crop's maximum rooting depth. Soil cubes were then extracted to assess three dimensional root orientation and to establish a predictive model of root length densities (RLD) derived from root intersection densities (RID). Results In the tree monoculture, root mapping demonstrated a very high tree RID in the top 50 cm and a slight decrease in RID with increasing soil depth. However, in the agroforestry stand, RID was significantly lower at 50 cm, tree roots colonized deeper soil layers and were more vertically oriented. In the agroforestry stand, RID and RLD were greater within the tree row than in the inter-row. Conclusions Fine roots of intercropped walnut trees grew significantly deeper, indicating a strong plasticity in root distribution. This plasticity reduced direct root competition from the crop, enabling trees to access deeper water tables not available to crop roots.","[Cardinael, Remi; Dupraz, Christian] INRA, UMR Syst, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Mao, Zhun] Ctr Grenoble, Unite Ecosyst Montagnards, IRSTEA, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Prieto, Ivan] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS,CEFE UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Stokes, Alexia; Kim, John H.] INRA, UMR AMAP, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Jourdan, Christophe] CIRAD, UMR Eco & Sols, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Cardinael, Remi] IRD, UMR Eco & Sols, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Mao, Zhun] Univ Grenoble Alpes, F-38402 Grenoble, France; [Kim, John H.] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Jourdan, C (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR Eco & Sols, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",christophe.jourdan@cirad.fr,"Prieto, Ivan/S-7822-2016; JOURDAN, Christophe/Z-5836-2019; Cardinael, Remi/I-1157-2019","Prieto, Ivan/0000-0001-5549-1132; JOURDAN, Christophe/0000-0001-9857-3269; Cardinael, Remi/0000-0002-9924-3269; /0000-0001-8042-6316; Kim, John/0000-0002-7845-5692",French ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-2010-STRA-003-01]; ADEME,"This study was financed by the French ANR funded project ECOSFIX (Ecosystem Services of Roots Hydraulic Redistribution, Carbon Sequestration and Soil Fixation, ANR-2010-STRA-003-01), and by the ADEME funded project AGRIPSOL.

However, knowledge of the interaction networks involved in transmission of tick-borne pathogens are limited because empirical studies are commonly incomplete or performed at small spatial scales. Here, we applied the methodology of ecological networks to quantify >14,000 interactions among ticks, vertebrates, and pathogens in the western Palearctic. These natural networks are highly structured, modular, coherent, and nested to some degree. We found that the large number of vertebrates in the network contributes to its robustness and persistence. Its structure reduces interspecific competition and allows ample but modular circulation of transmitted pathogens among vertebrates. Accounting for domesticated hosts collapses the network's modular structure, linking groups of hosts that were previously unconnected and increasing the circulation of pathogens. This framework indicates that ticks and vertebrates interact along the shared environmental gradient, while pathogens are linked to groups of phylogenetically close reservoirs.","[Estrada-Pena, Agustin] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Vet Med, Dept Anim Pathol, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [de la Fuente, Jose] UCLM, CSIC, JCCM, SaBio,Inst Invest Recursos Cineget,IREC, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; [de la Fuente, Jose] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Vet Pathobiol, Ctr Vet Hlth Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Ostfeld, Richard S.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro] Univ Lille Nord France, Inst Pasteur Lille, INSERM, CNRS,CIIL,U1019,UMR 8204, Lille, France","Estrada-Pena, A (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Fac Vet Med, Dept Anim Pathol, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",aestrada@unizar.es,"Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro/P-2755-2017","Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro/0000-0002-8660-730X; Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301; Estrada Pena, Agustin/0000-0001-7483-046X",EU FP7 ANTIGONE project [278976],Parts of this research were supported by the EU FP7 ANTIGONE project number 278976 and was conducted under the frame of the EurNegVec COST Action TD1303.,,49,47,48,0,27,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,MAY 20,2015,5,,,,,,,,10361,10.1038/srep10361,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CJ3OQ,WOS:000355394100001,25993662,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

Increased competition may reduce the ability of already stressed species to acquire resources (breeding sites and food), reducing recruitment and the long-term viability of species. We assessed how measures of recruitment of native birds were influenced by the area of native vegetation, vegetation characteristics, vegetation change as an indication of degradation, and the occurrence of an increasingly prevalent native competitor (the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala). We recorded avian breeding behavior on 120 forest transects in the box-ironbark forests of south-eastern Australia, in 2010-2011. On the same transects, we measured vegetation characteristics that had previously been measured in 1995-1997 to assess vegetation change during a 13-yr drought. Vegetation area and the abundance of the noisy miner had a greater effect on species' breeding behavior than did local vegetation characteristics and vegetation degradation. Greater abundances of the noisy miner reduced breeding activities of species with a body mass smaller than the noisy miner (< 63 g), while breeding increased in some larger (> 63 g) species. Recruitment measures for the noisy miner were positively associated with smaller fragments and greater vegetation change indicating that fragmentation and vegetation degradation have facilitated the colonization or recruitment by the noisy miner. The interaction between climate change, fragmentation and vegetation degradation appears to have led to increased effects of interspecific competition in fragments of native vegetation, with potential adverse effects on the viability of many bird species. The spread and increasing abundance of a hyperaggressive native species suggests that species assemblages will be increasingly disrupted by the interacting effects of climate change, fragmentation, degradation and interspecific interactions.","[Bennett, Joanne M.; Clarke, Rohan H.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Thomson, James R.; Mac Nally, Ralph] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Bennett, JM (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",joanne.bennett@monash.edu,"Thomson, Jim/W-2950-2019","Mac Nally, Ralph/0000-0002-4473-1636; Bennett, Joanne.

Without ANT, H. akashiwo out-competed P. helgolandica at low initial biomass ratios (P. helgolandica (P): H. akashiwo (H) = 1:4 and 1:1), but not at the highest (P:H = 4:1). This observation was consistent with the description in Lotka-Volterra two species competition model. It was found that P. helgolandica was excluded at low initial biomass ratios, while the unstable equilibrium between two species was predicted at the highest. For both species, carrying capacity and maximal specific growth rate decreased in bi-algal cultures compared to those in monocultures. H. akashiwo exhibited a higher sensitivity to ANT than P. helgolandica. This resulted markedly in a reduced cell density of H. akashiwo but an increased cell density of P. helgolandica. Carrying capacity of P. helgolandica was consistently higher in bi-algal cultures with ANT than those without ANT, suggesting that ANT, through the elimination of H. akashiwo, generated the dominance of P. helgolandica independently of initial biomass ratios. This study showed a density-dependent effect of harmful alga (H. akashiwo) on dietary alga (P. helgolandica), and indicated that ocean pollutant ANT could induce the succession of marine phytoplankton.","[Bi Rong; Wang You; Wang Renjun; Li Wei; Tang Xuexi] Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Life Sci, Ecol Lab, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China","Tang, XX (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Life Sci, Ecol Lab, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.",tangxx@ouc.edu.cn,,,"Ocean Public Welfare Scientific Research Projects, State Oceanic Administration People's Republic of China [200905020, 2010225007, 201305009]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31070458]","We thank Drs.

Do (1) dominant and subordinate species respond in the same way to changes in environmental variables; (2) plant species assemblages show higher interspecific than intraspecific trait responses; and (3) co-existing dominant species differ in their responses to the same environmental variables? LocationIslands in Lakes Uddjaure and Hornavan, northern Sweden. MethodsWe explored the responses of forest understorey vegetation assemblages to variation in environmental resources across a chronosequence of 30 lake islands that differ in fire history, above-ground and below-ground resource availability and species diversity. For one plot on each island, we measured specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and foliar N and P of all dominant and subordinate understorey plant species to assess species-specific and weighted and non-weighted community-level trait responses to variation across islands in all major local environmental drivers. ResultsConsistent with our expectations, we found that species responses to environmental conditions were not homogenous within assemblages, and that responses of dominant and subordinate species differed. Further, intraspecific variation was often an important component of local-scale plant community-level responses. Responses were often relatively consistent across species, but dominant species sometimes showed contrasting responses of the same trait to the same environmental factor. Finally, environmental factors that influenced community average trait values also affected functional diversity. ConclusionsThis study has shown that several common assumptions that underpin community assembly theory do not necessarily hold, and this can cause inaccuracies in predicting plant functional composition responses to changes in environmental variables. Because these assumptions are central to current models that predict vegetation responses to environmental change, it is crucial to further test in which particular environmental context and to what extent these assumptions are critical for model accuracy.","[Kumordzi, Bright B.; Wardle, David A.; Freschet, Gregoire T.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Kumordzi, BB (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",bright.kumordzi@slu.se; david.wardle@svek.slu.se; gregoire.freschet@slu.se,"Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011","Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335",VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council; Wallenberg Scholars Award,"We thank Morgan Karlsson, Abdul Mahomoud, Aaron Sandling, Kim Lindgren and Olusegun A.

Specifically, a method for quantifying the degree of niche overlap is needed, as niches in paleocommunities can be reconstructed only using ecomorphological characters. In this study, I suggest the use of nonparametric multivariate pairwise comparisons for testing the presence or absence of niche overlap, wherein niches are defined as Hutchinsonian multidimensional hypervolumes. I applied this method to an extant mammalian guild, comprising primates and their dietary competitors, to determine the significance of dimensionality in niche construction and to examine the ability of molar morphology to capture dietary niche overlap. I conducted principal component analyses of eight molar measurements across all members of this guild, and dietary niches were defined by principal component scores. Niche overlap was assessed through the comparison of distances among individuals both within and between niches. To demonstrate the application of the proposed method, I compared dietary niches of 1) seven predefined dietary groups and 2) genera within and across dietary groups using multivariate pairwise comparisons. Results indicated that the typically unexplored higher principal components, or niche axes, may be integral to niche separation.

These resources may be limited due to poor habitat quality or by intra- and interspecific competitions, which in extreme cases may cause the ant colony to perish. We tested the effect of intraspecific competition and habitat degradation (forest clear-cutting) on colony survival by transplanting 26 nests of the red wood ant (Formica aquilonia Yarrow, 1955) in 26 different forest areas that contained 0-11 conspecific alien nests per hectare. E aquilonia is highly dependent on canopy-dwelling aphids, thus the removal of trees should cause food limitation. During the course of the 4-year experiment, 9 of the forests were partially clear-cut. We found that while forest clear-cutting significantly decreased the colonies' survival, intraspecific competition did not. As a highly polygynous and polydomous species, E aquilonia seems to tolerate the presence of alien conspecific colonies to a certain extent.","[Sorvari, Jouni; Hakkarainen, Harri] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Sorvari, Jouni] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm Sci, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Huhta, Esa] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Rovaniemi Res Unit, FI-96301 Rovaniemi, Finland","Sorvari, J (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm Sci, POB 1627, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",jouni.sorvari@uef.fi,"Sorvari, Jouni/I-5375-2014","Sorvari, Jouni/0000-0003-2668-7771",Emil Aaltonen Foundation; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,Four anonymous referees gave constructive comments on the manuscript.

Classic associations are detected in interspecies flocks of sandpipers between the following species: the Pacific golden plover and the curlew sandpiper, the pectoral sandpiper and the long-billed dowitcher, the pectoral sandpiper and the dunlin, the grey plover and the dunlin. However, total amount of birds that form associations is not large. In species of group A (the grey plover, the Pacific golden plover, the pectoral sandpiper), no difference has been observed in migratory birds behavior within inter- or conspecific flocks. Species of group B (the dunlin, the curlew sandpiper, the long-billed dowitcher), on the contrary, change their behavior sharply depending on whether they belong to an association or not. Species of group A do not get any advantages when forming an association. Unlike them, species of group B profit from associating: a part of time spent in foraging substantially increases; more time is spent on rest and less time is spent on reconnaissance and vigilance (readiness for actions); safety of birds is enhanced. On the other hand, in species of group B there are also disadvantages related with associating: i.e., interspecies competition for food; foraging in suboptimal habitats which, in turn, may lead to notable increase of time spent by birds in foraging. An assumption is put forward that in species of group B advantages and limitations of associating cancel each other to a certain extent, and this explains rather small number of birds forming associations.","Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, SN Skadovsky Zvenigorod Biol Stn, Moscow 119899, Leninskie Gory, Russia","Gavrilov, VV (corresponding author), Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, SN Skadovsky Zvenigorod Biol Stn, Moscow 119899, Leninskie Gory, Russia.",vadimgavrilov@yandex.ru,,,,,,40,1,1,0,16,MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA,MOSCOW,"39 DIMITROVA UL., MOSCOW, 113095, RUSSIA",0044-4596,,,ZH OBSHCH BIOL,Zhurnal Obshchei Biol.,MAY-JUN,2014,75,3,,,,,204,213,,,,,10,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,AL2SU,WOS:000338976400003,25771678,,,,2021-09-21,

Differences between males and females in foraging behavior have been hypothesized to be a byproduct of sexual size dimorphism or a result of niche partitioning to reduce intersexual competition for food or different reproductive roles. From 2010 to 2013, I used foraging data and mist-net capture rates from multiple study sites to examine possible sex differences in the foraging behavior of two New Guinean Pachycephala whistlers. I found that male Regent (Pachycephala schlegelii) and Sclater's (Pachycephala soror) whistlers consistently foraged in higher strata than females. It is unlikely that these differences are due to sexual dimorphism because these species exhibit little sexual dimorphism. Sex differences in foraging behavior were consistent across years and study sites and did not appear linked to breeding behavior, supporting the food-competition hypothesis, but not the reproductive-roles hypothesis. Male territorial defense often occurs in relatively high strata in Pachycephala whistlers, possibly influencing male foraging strata. However, male territorial behavior cannot explain why females predominately forage in lower strata. Instead, intersexual competition for food resources is likely the primary driver of differences in the foraging behavior of male and female Regent and Sclater's whistlers.","[Freeman, Ben] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Freeman, Ben] Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Freeman, B (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, W257 Corson Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",bgf27@cornell.edu,,,NSF GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [2011083591]; Athena Fund of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology; Atkinson Center Sustainable Biodiversity Fund,"I thank B.

Thus, theory predicts the selection of traits that lessen reproductive interactions between closely related sympatric species. Males of the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis differ from all other Nasonia species by an additional sex pheromone component, but the ecological selective forces underlying this pheromone diversification are unknown. Here we present data from lab experiments suggesting that costly interspecific sexual interactions with the sympatric species N. giraulti might have been responsible for the pheromone evolution and some courtship-related behavioural adaptations in N. vitripennis. Most N. giraulti females are inseminated already within the host, but N. giraulti males still invest in costly sex pheromones after emergence. Furthermore, they do not discriminate between N. vitripennis females and conspecifics during courtship. Therefore, N. vitripennis females, most of which emerge as virgins, face the risk of mating with N. giraulti resulting in costly all-male broods due to Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility. As a counter adaptation, young N. vitripennis females discriminate against N. giraulti males using the more complex conspecific sex pheromone and reject most of them during courtship. With increasing age, however, N. vitripennis females become less choosy, but often compensate mating errors by re-mating with a conspecific. By doing so, they can principally avoid suboptimal offspring sex ratios, but a microcosm experiment suggests that under more natural conditions N. vitripennis females cannot completely avoid fitness costs due to heterospecific mating. Our study provides support for the hypothesis that communication interference of closely related sympatric species using similar sexual signals can generate selective pressures that lead to their divergence.","[Ruther, Joachim; McCaw, Jennifer; Boecher, Lisa; Pothmann, Daniela; Putz, Irina] Univ Regensburg, Inst Zool, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany","Ruther, J (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Inst Zool, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",joachim.ruther@biologie.uni-regensburg.de,"Ruther, Joachim/AAE-3568-2019","Ruther, Joachim/0000-0002-1295-347X",Deutsch Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG);  [RU 717/10-2],"This research was funded by the Deutsch Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (http://www.dfg.de/); grant RU 717/10-2 to JR.

A system of differential equations is proposed and analysed qualitatively using stability theory. A local study of the models is performed around axial, planar, and interior equilibrium points to successively estimate the effect of (i) one species interacting with a resource, (ii) two competing species for a single resource, and (iii) three competing species for a single resource. The local stability analysis of the equilibrium is discussed using Routh-Hurwitz criteria. Numerical simulation of the models is performed to investigate the sensitivity of certain key parameters. The models are used to predict population dynamics in the selected cases studied. The results show that when a single species interacts with a resource, the species will be able to establish and sustain a stable population. However, in competing situation, it is observed that the combinations of three parameters (half-saturation, growth rate, and mortality rate) determine which species wins for any given resource. Moreover, our results indicate that each species is the superior competitor for the resource for the range of temperature for which it has the lowest equilibrium resource.","[Mwalusepo, Sizah; Tonnang, Henri E.

Although studies of interspecific interactions typically focus on males, interactions between females may also play an important role in shaping habitat use within multi-species communities. The green anole (Anolis carolinensis) exhibits a wide range of habitat use in south-eastern Louisiana, but its observed habitat use is restricted and altered in areas where it occurs with the introduced Anolis sagrei. We staged interactions between these two species in the laboratory to test the hypothesis that A.sagrei dominate A.carolinensis in contests over shared habitat. We examined whether species identity, bite force, dewlap size, and body size affected the outcome of interspecific interactions between both males and females, and tested the prediction that bite force and size would be the most important determinants of interaction outcomes in both sexes. In male interspecific interactions, we found that individuals with relatively larger dewlaps tended to score higher on aggressive behaviours regardless of species identity, and that interactions consisted of signalling and rarely escalated to physical combat. However, we found that A.sagrei females achieved higher aggressive scores than A.carolinensis females in almost all cases, lending support to the notion that female interspecific behaviour is probably more important than male behaviour in driving changes in habitat use.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London.","[Edwards, Jessica R.; Lailvaux, Simon P.] Univ New Orleans, Dept Biol Sci, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA","Edwards, JR (corresponding author), Univ New Orleans, Dept Biol Sci, 2000 Lakeshore Dr, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA.",edjessicaedwards@gmail.com,"Lailvaux, Simon/C-3121-2008",,Louisiana Board of Regents; University of New Orleans Office of Research and Sponsored Projects,"We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments that greatly helped to improve the manuscript, as well as Stephen Gipson, Wayne del Corral Jr, Gwendolyn Webster, and Alicia Walker for their assistance during this project.

Global declines in pollinator diversity and abundance have been recognized, raising concerns about a pollination crisis of crops and wild plants. However, experimental evidence for effects of pollinator species diversity on plant reproduction is extremely scarce. We established communities with 1-5 bee species to test how seed production of a plant community is determined by bee diversity. Higher bee diversity resulted in higher seed production, but the strongest difference was observed for one compared to more than one bee species. Functional complementarity among bee species had a far higher explanatory power than bee diversity, suggesting that additional bee species only benefit pollination when they increase coverage of functional niches. In our experiment, complementarity was driven by differences in flower and temperature preferences. Interspecific interactions among bee species contributed to realized functional complementarity, as bees reduced interspecific overlap by shifting to alternative flowers in the presence of other species. This increased the number of plant species visited by a bee community and demonstrates a new mechanism for a biodiversity-function relationship (interactive complementarity). In conclusion, our results highlight both the importance of bee functional diversity for the reproduction of plant communities and the need to identify complementarity traits for accurately predicting pollination services by different bee communities.","[Fruend, Jochen; Holzschuh, Andrea; Tscharntke, Teja] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Dormann, Carsten F.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Dormann, Carsten F.] Univ Freiburg, Fac Forest & Environm Sci, Freiburg, Germany; [Holzschuh, Andrea] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany","Frund, J (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jfruend@uni-goettingen.de,"Holzschuh, Andrea/X-8989-2018; Frund, Jochen/AAV-3105-2020; Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014","Holzschuh, Andrea/0000-0002-5235-4746; Frund, Jochen/0000-0002-7079-3478; Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794",DBU (German Federal Environmental Foundation); Helmholtz AssociationHelmholtz Association [VH-NG 247]; DFG (German Science Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG),"J.

Squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus, and C. apella form ubiquitous interspecific associations, but the reason remains debatable. With a large biogeographic field study, we tested the degree to which the distribution and abundance of Cebus and S. sciureus is determined by habitat type, fruit availability, and geography (i.e., determinants of the fundamental niche) relative to interspecific interactions, such as competition and facilitation (i.e., the realized niche). We used the competition between the two capuchin monkeys as a natural experiment that subjected S. sciureus to C. apella and C. olivaceus treatments'. Using spatial regression models and principal components analysis, we found that S. sciureus was associated with seasonally flooded forests, and was correlated with fruit abundance and diversity (fundamental niche), but was also correlated with C. apella density even when accounting for habitat and fruit availability (realized niche). Saimiri sciureus density was unrelated to C. olivaceus density. Cebus apella was associated with a variety of forest types, but particularly included disturbed and edge habitats such as logged forests, seasonally flooded forests, and upland savanna, in addition to mature forest. Cebus apella was also positively correlated with S. sciureus density and negatively correlated with the density of C. olivaceus. In contrast, C. olivaceus avoided riparian areas and was associated with mixed-height forests on sloped mountainous terrain. In sum, interspecific interactions such as competition between species of Cebus and facilitation between C. apella and S. sciureus were as important as habitat and fruit availability in determining the distribution and abundance of these primates.","[Levi, Taal] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Levi, Taal] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Silvius, Kirsten M.] Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Oliveira, Luiz F.

Most research using network approaches to address this challenge has focused on predator-prey interactions and static networks. We describe a stochastic ecological network simulation model that combines predator-prey interactions with mutualism, parasitism and basal species competition. Network topology is based on a generalized niche model, while temporal dynamics are specified using bioenergetic models with noise terms. We use the model to explore the effects of non-predator-prey interactions, color of environmental noise, and the degree of synchronization of environmental noise across species on the coefficients of variation of total ecosystem energy content and Shannon entropy over time. In regression trees derived by binary recursive partitioning, the presence or absence of synchrony gave the greatest difference in the means of data points for both system energy and Shannon entropy, followed in turn by white versus colored noise and pink versus red and black noise. The effects are present despite the large variation in the Monte Carlo simulations reflecting the variability of real ecosystems. Non-predator-prey interactions explained relatively small proportions of the total deviance, and each had different effect signs depending on the presence of the other interaction types and on whether energy or entropy was measured. These results underscore the importance of modeling more realistic colors of environmental noise in understanding and predicting the dynamics of food webs and ecological communities.

We investigated the input matching abilities of yellowfin shiner, a recent invader, and rosyside dace, a common native minnow, found in Coweeta Creek, North Carolina, USA. To test the species' relative input matching abilities, we varied food abundance within the range found in the natural habitat in a two-patch laboratory stream to document the distribution of foragers when food densities differed in the ratio of 2:1. We then applied simple IFD model predictions to determine whether the observed distribution of foragers was best described by (i) the IFD, (ii) differing competitive abilities or (iii) the ideal despotic distribution and/or other unequal competitor models, and to ascertain whether the invader demonstrated a superior ability to track resource distributions. Yellowfin shiner was more likely to move between patches, which resulted in increased ability to match the distribution of food when prey abundance increased. The distribution of rosyside dace between patches did not change in response to increased food abundance. Despite a considerable range of competitive abilities within intraspecific groups, the equal competitors IFD was as good at predicting fish distributions as unequal competitor models. The ability to track local resource availability in highly variable environments facilitates maximising energy intake and likely promoted the establishment of yellowfin shiner in a southern Appalachian stream.","[Wagner, C.

We find a strikingly different pattern in a multicontinent data set (55 presence-absence matrices from 24 locations) on the composition of mixed-species bird flocks, which are important sub-units of local bird communities the world over. By using null models and randomization tests followed by meta-analysis, we find the association strengths of species in flocks to be strongly related to similarity in body size and foraging behavior and higher for congeneric compared with noncongeneric species pairs. Given the local spatial scales of our individual analyses, differences in the habitat preferences of species are unlikely to have caused these association patterns; the patterns observed are most likely the outcome of species interactions. Extending group-living and social-information-use theory to a heterospecific context, we discuss potential behavioral mechanisms that lead to positive interactions among similar species in flocks, as well as ways in which competition costs are reduced. Our findings highlight the need to consider positive interactions along with competition when seeking to explain community assembly.","[Sridhar, Hari; Shanker, Kartik] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Srinivasan, Umesh; Robin, V.

In some contexts, the aggressive behaviours shown in these interspecific interactions are very similar to those shown in intraspecific interactions. It is still an open question whether intra- and interspecific aggression share common causality. We studied a year-round territorial species the jewel damselfish, (Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus), which cultivate algae they feed on. Territory holders aggressively defend these algae that are an attractive resource for many other species. In this study, we recorded territorial aggression in free-living individuals and recorded aggressive responses to a standardized territorial intrusion test in captive individuals. Field observations indicated that territorial aggression was selectively targeted towards food competitors. Independent of the size of the species, aggression was more frequent towards common species around their territories. This relationship was confirmed experimentally by confronting the jewel damselfish with novel objects to which the subjects were exposed either frequently or rarely. We suggest that jewel damselfish have to learn which species are competitors and therefore should be chased. In a standardized intrusion test with captive individuals, no significant differences were found in territorial responses towards intra- or interspecific intruders. Neither territorial aggression nor the intrusion showed any relationship with plasma androgen levels. Together, these data suggest that experience might be more important in non-seasonal territorial aggression than circulating hormonal factors.","[Di Paola, Valentina; Vullioud, Philippe; Demarta, Lanila; Ros, Albert F.

Furthermore, the factors that influence the acquisition and assimilation of food can have significant consequences for the condition, growth, survival and recruitment of fishes. The majority of marine and freshwater fish species are planktivorous at the onset of exogenous nutrition and have a limited ability to detect, capture, ingest and digest prey. Improvements in vision, development of fins and associated improvements in swimming performance, increases in gape size and development of the alimentary tract during ontogeny often lead to shifts in diet composition. Prey size, morphology, behaviour and abundance can all influence the prey selection of larval and juvenile fishes. Differences in feeding behaviour between fish species, individuals or during ontogeny can also be important, as can inter- and intraspecific interactions (competition, predation risk). Temporal (diel, seasonal, annual) and spatial (microhabitat, mesohabitat, macrohabitat, regional) variations in prey availability can have important implications for the prey selection, diet composition, growth, survival, condition and, ultimately, recruitment success of fishes. For fish populations to persist, habitat must be available in sufficient quality and quantity for the range of activities undertaken during all periods of development. Habitats that enhance the diversity, size ranges and abundance of zooplankton should ensure that sufficient food resources are available to larval and juvenile fishes.","[Nunn, A. D.; Tewson, L.

Ants interact with a diversity of organisms. These interactions, coupled with their abundance, cause ants to have ecologically important effects across multiple trophic levels. 2. Empirical study of ant nutritional ecology has led to the prediction that a macronutrient imbalance will affect ant behaviour and interspecific interactions that underlie these broad-scale effects. Excess carbohydrate relative to protein is predicted to increase ant aggressiveness, predatory tendency and foraging activity, and to decrease collection of hemipteran honeydew and plant nectar. 3. In field experiments conducted in 2009 and 2010, captive colony fragments of a native ant, Formica podzolica (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), were provided with either simulated prey or carbohydrate solution ad libitum. Foraging behaviours and interactions with flowers, myrmecophilous aphids and aphid natural enemies on wild-grown plants were documented. 4. Strong effects of macronutrient imbalance on foraging manifested quickly and consistently across colonies; in accordance with predictions, prey-fed foragers collected both honeydew and floral nectar, whereas carbohydrate-fed ants ceased collecting these resources. Counter to predictions, carbohydrate-fed ants dramatically lowered their activity levels and did not prey upon aphids. 5. Ants had no effect on aphid enemies in 2009, when the latter were relatively rare, but decreased their abundance in 2010. Despite this protection, the net effect of ants on aphids was negative (measured only in 2009). Prey-fed ants demonstrated a strong preference for honeydew over floral nectar, thus demonstrating that a macronutrient imbalance may lead to different interactions with similar resources. 6. This study links ant nutrition and community ecology by demonstrating the rapid, asymmetric and multitrophic consequences of nutritionally mediated behaviour.","[Petry, William K.; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92617 USA; [Petry, William K.] Truman State Univ, Dept Biol, Kirksville, MO USA; [Perry, Kayla I.] Baldwin Wallace Coll, Dept Biol & Geol, Berea, OH USA; [Perry, Kayla I.] Ohio State Univ, Ohio Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Entomol, Wooster, OH 44691 USA","Petry, WK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92617 USA.",wpetry@uci.edu,,"Petry, William/0000-0002-5230-5987",National Science Foundation through Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) [DBI-0753774]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919178]; RMBL; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0919178] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by National Science Foundation grants DBI-0753774 to WKP and KIP through the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) and DEB-0919178 to KAM and a RMBL Ehrlich Fellowship to KAM.

Although less studied than predatory or competitive interactions, facilitative interactions can be important in communities associated with ephemeral microhabitats. Successful recruitment from these habitats requires species to rapidly colonize, develop, and disperse during brief periods of habitat suitability. Interactions between organisms, including processing chain interactions whereby initial consumers alter resources in ways that improve their quality for subsequent consumers, could aid these processes. The terrestrial egg masses of red-eyed treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) are a resource for predatory wasps (Agelaia spp., Polybia rejecta) and a microhabitat and resource for saprovoric and pathogenic fungi and saprovoric flies (Megaselia spp., Psychoda savaiiensis). We investigate how interactions with wasps might facilitate fly and fungal colonization of and survival on frog egg masses. Our results indicate that wasps facilitate fungal colonization, whereas flies appear not to, and that both wasps and fungi generate frog egg carrion that attracts saprovoric flies to oviposit and increases the survival of fly larvae. While studies of colonization order often focus on inhibition by early colonizers of subsequent arrivals, this study demonstrates how early colonizers can facilitate the establishment of later ones, by modifying resources in ways that promote the location of and survival in habitat patches. This research draws attention to the diversity of interactions that can occur within ephemeral communities and emphasizes the role that positive interactions may play. Processing chain interactions may be a generally important mechanism increasing the diversity of local communities, including very ephemeral ones.","[Hughey, Myra C.; Nicolas, Angie; Warkentin, Karen M.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Vonesh, James R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Warkentin, Karen M.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City 084303092, Panama","Hughey, MC (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City 084303092, Panama.",myrahughey@gmail.com,"; Vonesh, James/I-1573-2013","Warkentin, Karen/0000-0002-7804-800X; Vonesh, James/0000-0003-2481-9988","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOB-0234439, DEB-0716923, DEB-0717220, DEB-0910270]; Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration Award; American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists; Boston University; Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute","We thank the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for laboratory space and logistical support, and W.

Relative to solar and lunar events, analysis of diel activity in two parapatric Zimbabwean populations revealed behavioural plasticity in response to human activity. In Hwange, human presence was low; in Nyamandlovu, human presence and persecution were high. In both populations, Lycaon frequently hunted by moonlight, with 34 lux of light restricting nocturnal hunting to 13 days/lunar month. With diurnal hunts commencing at civil twilight begin and ending at astronomical twilight end, light intensity was confirmed as a limiting factor. Nyamandlovu dogs exhibited behavioural plasticity, demonstrated by scattered rather than clumped organization when at rest, and masked the zeitgeber by utilizing evenings and moonlight for more days under suboptimal light conditions than did Hwange dogs. Significantly, different allocation of morning, evening and moonlight hunts between Hwange (47%, 36%, 15%) and Nyamandlovu (28%, 31%, 41%), reduced the temporal potential for human encounter by 64%, but increased this potential for hyaena and lion encounters by 70% and 37%, thus highlighting the trade- off of this switch. Finally, we tentatively conclude that the cue masking the 'zeitgeber' is risk, rather than gain related, and could be seen as an evolutionary 'emergency exit', the understanding of which is important to conservation in landscapes that are increasingly dominated by people.","[Rasmussen, G.

A long-term data series (1993-2008) of European eel and European catfish (Silurus glanis) abundance in a freshwater canal of the Camargue water system (southern France), along with parallel data on water salinity and glass eel abundance in the adjacent VaccarSs lagoon, was analysed to identify the possible causes of decline in eel abundance observed in the canal during the last two decades. A model including glass eel recruitment and catfish abundance as covariates explained 78% of the observed variation in eel settlement success. Results suggest that (1) salinity does not play a significant role in determining the fraction of eels moving from the brackish lagoon to the canal; (2) density dependence affects settlement success, possibly through a reduction of juvenile survival in the adjacent lagoon; and (3) catfish abundance is negatively correlated with eel settlement. We discuss this latter point in terms of possible predation of catfish upon eels and/or inter-specific competition between the two species.","[Bevacqua, Daniele; Vincenzi, S.; De Leo, G.

Characterization of bacterial species, however, is normally done by laboratory testing of pure isolates. Any interactions that might appear during growth in mixed-culture are obviously missed by this approach. Existing experimental studies mainly focus on two-species mixed cultures with species specifically chosen for their known growth characteristics, and their anticipated interactions. Various theoretical mathematical studies dealing with mixed cultures and possible interspecies effects exist, but often models cannot be validated due to a lack of experimental data. Here, we present a concept for the identification of interspecies effects in mixed cultures with arbitrary and unknown single-species properties. Model structure and parameters were inferred from single-species experiments for the reproduction of mixed-culture experiments by simulation. A mixed culture consisting of the three-species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, and Staphylococcus aureus served as a model system. For species-specific enumeration a quantitative terminal restriction length polymorphism (qT-RFLP) assay was used. Based on models fitted to single-species cultivations, the outcome of mixed-culture experiments was predicted. Deviations of simulation results and experimental findings were then used to design additional single-cell experiments, to modify the corresponding growth kinetics, and to update model parameters. Eventually, the resulting mixed-culture dynamics was predicted and compared again to experimental results. During this iterative cycle, it became evident that the observed coexistence of P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia in mixed-culture chemostat experiments cannot be explained on the basis of glucose as the only substrate. After extension of growth kinetics, that is, for use of amino acids as secondary substrates, mixed-culture simulations represented the experimental findings very well. According to the model structure, as motivated by single-species experiments, the growth of P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia on glucose and amino acids could be assumed to be independent of each other. In contrast, both substrates are taken up simultaneously by S. aureus. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2011;108: 1900-1911.

Theoretical models predict that genetic or phenotypic variance within species can alter interspecific interactions, and experiments have shown that genotypic diversity in clonal species can impact a wide range of ecological processes. To extend these studies to quantitative trait variation within populations, we experimentally manipulated the variance in body size of threespine stickleback in enclosures in a natural lake environment. We found that body size of stickleback in the lake is correlated with prey size and (to a lesser extent) composition, and that stickleback can exert top-down control on their benthic prey in enclosures. However, a six-fold contrast in body size variance had no effect on the degree of diet variation among individuals, or on the abundance or composition of benthic or pelagic prey. Interestingly, post-hoc analyses revealed suggestive correlations between the degree of diet variation and the strength of top-down control by stickleback. Our negative results indicate that, unless the correlation between morphology and diet is very strong, ecological variation among individuals may be largely decoupled from morphological variance. Consequently we should be cautious in our interpretation both of theoretical models that assume perfect correlations between morphology and diet, and of empirical studies that use morphological variation as a proxy for resource use diversity.","[Ingram, Travis] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Ingram, Travis] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Ingram, T (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",ingram@zoology.ubc.ca,"Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015","Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296",David and Lucille Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1300426] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by a David and Lucille Packard Foundation grant to DIB, and TI was funded by a National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) PGS-D3 award.

We found that 86% of the overwintering invertebrates in traps were predators, which were dominated by spiders (72%) of different guilds and different body sizes. Spiders had spatially segregated in the traps so that smaller specimens hid in an interstitial space that was inaccessible to larger specimens. Spiders of the bark-dwelling guild, Anyphaena and Philodromus, are winter-active and can prey on other smaller spiders. Analysis of their abundance in traps indicated a negative relationship between Anyphaena and Philodromus or other spiders. Inspection of traps during winter revealed an influx of spider specimens confirming their winter-activity. In a semi-field experiment, where overwintering in cardboard bands was studied under controlled conditions, we observed mortality of both winter-active Philodromus and Anyphaena spiders due to their interspecific predation. The mortality was affected by their size ratio - larger specimens consumed smaller ones. Presence of alternative prey, theridiid spiders, did not affect their mortalities, but the presence of shelters (interstitial spaces) did. In boards with interstitial spaces smaller spiders suffered lower mortality than in boards without the interstitial spaces. Obtained results suggest that intraguild predation between overwintering spiders can decrease their population density during winter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We analyze the ecology and evolution of resource-related heterospecific aggression (HA) by reviewing and meta-analyzing 126 studies, contrasting HA with conspecific aggression (CA), and discussing terminological confusions and conceptual models. HA occurred in 78% of tests (n = 459), suggesting a high prevalence and potential effect on niche use and community structure. The benefits of both CA and HA are linked to resource defensibility and abundance, yet HA can change independently of CA. Ecological inferences about HA are often weak because they assume that interference always results from resource competition, and evolutionary inferences made by comparing HA to CA are also weak because they usually ignore history. We believe that comparisons between situations where a focal species is allopatric from and sympatric with a heterospecific competitor provide better opportunities to test hypotheses about HA. In general, according to our data set, aggression was higher with increased resource overlap as expected, both because CA was greater than HA, and HA was greater within compared to between genera. Progress in understanding HA requires distinguishing traits (aggressive behavior) from interactions (agonism, interference), as well as from the ecological and evolutionary causes (competition, ancestry) and consequences (dominance, territoriality, exclusion) of those interactions.","[Peiman, Kathryn S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Robinson, Beren W.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Peiman, KS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",KPEIMAN@UCLA.EDU; BERENROB@UOGUELPH.CA,,"Robinson, Beren/0000-0003-2868-5411",,,,167,126,134,4,106,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0033-5770,1539-7718,,Q REV BIOL,Q.

We use data from two urban centers (Phoenix and Baltimore) and two taxa (birds and spiders) to link diversity loss with reduced community evenness among species in urban communities. This reduction in evenmess may be caused by a minority of invasive species dominating the majority of the resources, consequently excluding nonsynanthropic species that could otherwise adapt to urban conditions.

Territories are the outcome of interactions determining where and how long individuals settle. To odonate species, aggressive disputes are not so common since the outcome can be predetermined by advantages such as residency, age, and body size. However, it is possible to predict that at heterospecific disputes, larger body-sized or more aggressive species have some profits overcoming these individual advantages, generating patterns of species hierarchy. Here, I studied the aggressiveness of five Erythrodiplax species (Odonata. Libellulidae) during territorial disputes and verified if larger body-sized species are more aggressive than smaller ones or if the residence advantage prevails on the heterospecific disputes. Larger species were not more aggressive than smaller ones and winners of intra- and interspecific territorial disputes were defined mainly by the residence. So, the residence advantage between heterospecific opponents appears to prevail over any other asymmetry among these species. This pattern may occur because, despite the territorial behaviour in dragonfly males, heterospecific disputes may not increment male reproductive success because it may not increase their access to females.","Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Geral, Lab Bioinformat & Evolucao, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Resende, DC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Geral, Lab Bioinformat & Evolucao, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",dcresende@ig.com.br,,,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands,"I thank to Fernando Silveira, Paulo De Marco Jr. and Anderson Latini for numerous discussions and to Daniel Resende for the field assistance.

In ants, several theoretical models have been proposed to predict some aspects of territory formation such as the size-shape or the position of boundaries along the foraging areas of neighbouring colonies. In the present study we investigated the space partitioning during the foraging activity of two sympatric species of harvester ants (Messor wasmanni and M. minor). Colonies of the two species showed a strong territoriality with different levels of spatial overlapping in different seasons. Colonies may have reduced the cost of territorial dispute by not insisting on the same areas. Encounters between foragers belonging to interspecific colonies did not increase the probability of workers coming back to previously visited areas during the different seasons. Moreover, the evaluation of microhabitat features of foraging areas visited by the two species showed clear differences.

While plant-mediated competition likely influences many herbivores, progress linking studies of plant-mediated competition in terrestrial phytophagous insects to longer-term consequences for herbivore communities has been elusive, and there is little relevant theory to guide this effort. We present simple models describing plant-mediated interactions between two herbivorous insects or other functionally equivalent organisms. These models consider general features of plant-mediated competition including specificity of elicitation by and effects on herbivores, positive and negative interactions among herbivores, competition independent of changes in plant biomass, and the existence of multiple relevant plant traits. Our analyses generate four important conclusions. First, herbivores competing strongly via only one plant quality phenotype exhibit a limited range of outcomes. These include coexistence and competitive exclusion of either herbivore, but do not include initial condition dependence. Second, when the outcome of competition is competitive exclusion, the herbivore that persists is the one that can do so under the highest inducible reductions in plant quality. Third, competition via more than one inducible phenotype can exhibit a wider range of outcomes including multiple equilibria and initial condition dependence. Finally, transient dynamics may not predict the eventual outcome of competition when changes in plant quality are slow relative to herbivore population growth, especially when herbivores compete through multiple phenotypes. We interpret our results in terms of competition outcomes reported in the literature, and suggest directions for the future empirical study of herbivore competition mediated by inducible changes in plant quality.","[Anderson, Kurt E.; Inouye, Brian D.; Underwood, Nora] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Anderson, Kurt E.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Anderson, KE (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",kurt.anderson@ucr.edu,"Anderson, Kurt E/A-1339-2013",,"USDA CSREES Post-doctoral FellowshipUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-35302-1699, 2005-35302-16311]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0452720]","The authors thank Peter Abrams and the ecology reading group at Florida State University - especially T.

In inland Queensland, however, Noisy Miners dominate avian assemblages throughout extensive forest areas as well as fragmented landscapes, and our understanding of the factors influencing their behaviour and habitat selection in such relatively intact landscapes is limited. I investigated how road edges influenced Noisy Miners by comparing the species' aggressive and foraging behaviour, and location of nests, between road-edge and interior transects in a southern Queensland forest. I also investigated Noisy Miner foraging microhabitat preferences and targets of aggression. Noisy Miner nests were more likely to be located near to road edges, but foraging and aggressive interactions occurred with similar frequency near and far from road edges. Such interactions selectively targeted close competitors and a nest predator. Most foraging activity was in the canopy, and selectively within ironbarks (Eucalyptus spp.), suggesting that higher densities of Noisy Miners in more open areas of the forest are unlikely to be related to facilitation of ground-foraging activity. Despite some evidence of a preference for nesting near road openings, road edges do not appear to influence Noisy Miners as strongly as edges between forest and agricultural land do elsewhere in eastern Australia.","[Maron, Martine] Univ So Queensland, Australian Ctr Sustainable Catchments, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Maron, Martine] Univ So Queensland, Dept Biol & Phys Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia","Maron, M (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",m.maron@uq.edu.au,"Maron, Martine/D-9699-2011","Maron, Martine/0000-0002-5563-5789",University of Southern Queensland Early Career Researcher Grant,"I would like to thank Gloria Glass, Simon Kennedy and Andrea Kennedy for assistance in the field.

One important mode of coupling between ecosystems occurs via organisms with complex life histories, which often switch between distinct ecosystems during their life cycle, and so can be channels of material exchanges between these ecosystems. Some organisms with complex life histories (e.g. frogs, dragonflies) can be abundant and effective predators during one or more life stages, and so provide conduits for strong direct and indirect interactions across ecosystem boundaries, linking the dynamics of discrete and often quite dissimilar community types. We present simple models and a case study (tailored to pond ecosystems), to explore how interactions within larval habitats can indirectly impact ecological interactions in adult habitats. Using our case study as a springboard, we propose that cohorts of predators emerging from natal habitats (e.g. ponds) cast 'predation shadows' on the surrounding adult (e.g. terrestrial) landscape. Trophic interactions within ponds, and the distribution of ponds on the landscape, can thus affect the spatial pattern in the strength of these predation shadows, creating strong spatial patterning in terrestrial trophic cascades. Our findings emphasize the importance of organisms with complex life histories as generators of strong links across ecosystem boundaries, and as potential sources of spatial variation in the strength and indirect impacts of interspecific interactions.","[McCoy, Michael W.; Barfield, Michael; Holt, Robert D.] Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","McCoy, MW (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",mwmccoy@bu.edu,,"McCoy, Michael/0000-0002-7993-6236",,,,48,61,62,0,43,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2009,118,1,,,,,87,100,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2008.16878.x,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,387WT,WOS:000261983000009,,,,,2021-09-21,

Firstly, we investigate the ecological and evolutionary conditions that allow for continuously stable strategy under symmetric competition. Secondly, we find that evolutionary suicide is impossible when the two species undergo symmetric competition, however, evolutionary suicide can occur in an asymmetric competition model with strong Allee effects. Thirdly, it is found that evolutionary bistability is a likely outcome of the process under both symmetric and asymmetric competitions, which depends on the properties of symmetric and asymmetric competitions. Fourthly, under asymmetric competition, we find that evolutionary cycle is a likely outcome of the process, which depends on the properties of both intraspecific and interspecific competition. When interspecific and intraspecific asymmetries vary continuously, we also find that the evolutionary dynamics may admit a stable equilibrium and two limit cycles or two stable equilibria separated by an unstable limit cycle or a stable equilibrium and a stable limit cycle.

This hypothesis, however, is unrealistic because it ignores the forces that contribute to synchronization of population dynamics. Here we present a mechanistic neutral model that describes the dynamics of a community of equivalent species under the joint influence of density dependence, environmental forcing, and demographic stochasticity. We also introduce a new standardized measure of species synchrony in multispecies communities. We show that the per capita population growth rates of equivalent species are strongly synchronized, especially when endogenous population dynamics are cyclic or chaotic, while their long-term fluctuations in population sizes are desynchronized by ecological drift. We then generalize our model to non-neutral dynamics by incorporating temporal and nontemporal forms of niche differentiation. Niche differentiation consistently decreases the synchrony of species per capita population growth rates, while its effects on the synchrony of population sizes are more complex. Comparing the observed synchrony of species per capita population growth rates with that predicted by the neutral model potentially provides a simple test of deterministic asynchrony in a community.","[Loreau, Michel] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [de Mazancourt, Claire] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Loreau, M (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",michel.loreau@mcgill.ca,,,,,,26,291,296,12,202,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

The study should analyse the competition capacity of different crops towards oilseed rape volunteers. A field with a large soil seed bank of oilseed rape was planted with three winter crops (winter turnip rape (replacing oilseed rape, similar performance of turnip and oilseed rape presumed), winter barley, winter wheat) and three spring crops (faba beans, spring barley, maize). The crops were managed according best management practice and compared with fallow plots where all operations were similar to the crop plots, except sowing. The fallows should allow assessing the competition of crops and volunteers. The crop with the lowest competition capacity and highest risk for gene dispersal by oilseed rape volunteers was turnip rape (30 volunteers m(-2)), most of which flowered and set seeds (475 seeds plant(-1)), and thus exceeded the labelling threshold for transgenic admixture. Half as much volunteers established in faba beans (14 plants m(-2)), flowered and set seed (13 plants m(-2)) Though flowering volunteers were observed in spring barley, no seeds were produced. Volunteers emerged in all other crops as well, but reached neither flowering nor seed maturity. The comparison of crop and fallow showed that turnip rape, winter wheat and spring barley had the highest competition capacity towards oilseed rape volunteers. If the management practise (use of herbicides) is additionally taken into account, the crops with the lowest risk of gene dispersal by volunteer oilseed rape were maize, winter wheat and winter barley. The fallow plots were useful to assess the potential of emerging volunteers from the soil seed bank, and of gene dispersal. Plots like these (10-20 m(2)) could be routinely established in commercial fields as control measurement for model calculations and predictions in terms of risk assessment.","[Gruber, S.; Claupein, W.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Plant Prod & Grassland Res, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany","Gruber, S (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Plant Prod & Grassland Res, Fruwirthstr 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",grubersf@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,17,7,8,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1861-3829,1861-3837,,J PLANT DIS PROTECT,J.

Although numerous studies have investigated the role of natural selection, relatively few have focussed on the role of sexual selection. Two important factors influencing the intensity of sexual selection are sperm competition and pair bonding and three different hypotheses have been proposed to explain how they could influence relative brain size. ( 1) The 'extra-pair mating' hypothesis predicts that sexual dimorphism in brain size will increase with sperm competition intensity. ( 2) The 'Machiavellian intelligence' hypothesis predicts that brain size will be larger in species with intense sperm competition. ( 3) The 'relationship intelligence' hypothesis predicts that species forming long-term pair bonds will have larger brains. We investigated sexual dimorphism in brain size and tested these three hypotheses in waterfowl by studying correlations between relative brain volume and three measures of sperm competition ( testicular mass, phallus length and mating strategy) and pair-bond duration using the modern phylogenetic comparative approach. We found no evidence of sexual dimorphism in brain size in waterfowl after controlling for body mass and found no support for any of the three hypotheses. This suggests that brain size may not be sexually selected in waterfowl, despite evidence of sexual selection pressures on other morphological characters.","[Guay, P. -J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Iwaniuk, A.

Previous studies have shown that interspecific hybridisation is common among taxa from the Daphnia galeata/hyalina/cucullata species complex. We investigated the influence of predator kairomones on the morphology and life histories of nine clones belonging to three taxa (pure D. galeata, F-1 hybrids between D. galeata and D. hyalina, and backcrossed D. hyalina) of this species complex. Predators exerting positive (fish) and negative (Chaoborus larvae) size-selective predation were tested. 2. The most responsive traits were size at maturity and size of neonates. Despite large between-clone variation, discriminant analysis revealed that the three taxa were distinct from each other in key life-history traits. F-1 hybrids did not react in an intermediate way compared to the other taxa: the multivariate distances between F-1 hybrids and either taxon were larger than between pure D. galeata and backcrossed D. hyalina. 3. The average plasticity (calculated across all traits) was similar for all three taxa. With regard to the size at maturity and neonate body size, the strength of the response was a function of the intrinsic values of these traits expressed in the control. For example, for size at maturity, smaller individuals showed a significantly stronger reaction to Chaoborus kairomones than larger ones. 4. Finally, we monitored seasonal changes in body size, egg number and population density of pure D. galeata and F-1 hybrids in Greifensee (Switzerland). The two taxa experienced similar seasonal changes in body size but, on some sampling dates, they differed in mean egg number. The observed seasonal changes in Daphnia body size were consistent with what would be expected if the predator assemblage shifted from fish to Chaoborus over the course of the summer. The fluctuations in the frequencies of Daphnia taxa, however, were not related to seasonal variation in Daphnia body size. 5. Experimental data suggest that temporally heterogeneous predation regimes might be an important condition stabilising the co-occurrence of Daphnia hybrids with parental taxa. Predation regimes, however, cannot solely explain dynamic changes in taxon frequency in Greifensee.","Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, D-7750 Constance, Germany","Spaak, P (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jwolinsk@indiana.edu,"Wolinska, Justyna/N-6455-2014; Wolinska, Jaroszynska-Wolinska/A-5268-2013","Wolinska, Justyna/0000-0003-2913-2923",,,,56,19,20,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Here I use the comparative method to quantify sexual and natural selection pressures behind interspecific variation in horn length. I show that male horn length depends on factors proposed to affect the mean mate number per mating male, correlating positively with group size and negatively with male territoriality. This suggests that whereas group size increases the opportunity for sexual selection, territoriality reduces it because territorial males are unable to follow and monopolize female groups as effectively as males in nonterritorial species. Sexual body size dimorphism also correlates positively with group size and negatively with territoriality, corroborating these factors as predictors of the intensity of sexual selection on males. Female horn length was unaffected by the factors related to mating system, suggesting that this trait is mainly under natural selection. Using female horn length as a proxy for forces of natural selection revealed a negative effect on male horn length. Thus where natural selection favors female horns, possibly as effective weapons against predators, a similar selection pressure on males might prevent them from evolving too elaborate horns through sexual selection. There was no correlation found between horn length and latitude, thus providing no support for the hypothesis that horns have a thermoregulatory function.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England","Bro-Jorgensen, J (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",jakob.bro@ioz.ac.uk,,,,,,115,94,94,2,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JUN,2007,61,6,,,,,1316,1326,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00111.x,,,11,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,177AD,WOS:000247125100006,17542842,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

To minimize the degree of competition, we hypothesized that the two largest members of this guild and its fiercest competitors, the lion and the spotted hyaena, would partition their activity patterns to avoid interacting. We used 96-h continuous follows of focal animal(s) to determine when the six radio-collared lions and eight radio-collared spotted hyaenas, reintroduced into Addo Elephant National Park in 2003/2004, were active using a binomial measure of activity which was defined as movements > 100 m during each hourly period. Contrary to our predictions, lions and hyaenas did not partition their activity times, probably because of their current low population densities. Both species exhibited a crepuscular activity pattern although hyaenas were far less active during daylight. A sub-adult lioness minimized competitive interactions by becoming diurnal. This is likely to be a common strategy for lions that have been expelled from their natal pride to become nomadic, as it allows them to minimize kleptoparasitic and agonistic interactions from competitively dominant conspecifics and competitors. The increase in testosterone that occurs in males upon reaching sexual maturity, darkens their pelage and causes them to be more directly impacted by the heat, and thereby affords females an opportunity to escape from males during hot temperatures. Similarly, the longer pelage of young hyaenas restricts their activity to the cooler night-time.","Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Zool, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, ZA-6031 Eastern Cape, South Africa","Hayward, MW (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Zool, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, POB 77000, ZA-6031 Eastern Cape, South Africa.",hayers111@aol.com,"Hayward, Matt W./F-3569-2010","Hayward, Matt W./0000-0002-5574-1653",,,,28,48,48,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-6707,1365-2028,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

One hypothesis that can explain sympatric differences is ecological character displacement: the sympatric origin of morphologically divergent phenotypes in response to selection caused by interspecific competition. Alternatively, populations may adapt to different conditions in allopatry, with sympatric distributions evolving through selective colonization and proliferation of ecologically compatible phenotypes. In this study, I characterize geographic variation within two sibling species of rocky-shore gastropods that have partially overlapping distributions in central California. In sympatry, both Nucella emarginata and N. ostrina show significant differences in shell shape and shell ornamentation that together suggest that where the two species co-exist, divergent phenotypes arose as an evolutionary consequence of competition. To examine the evolutionary origins of divergent characters in. sympatry, I used a comparative method based on spatial autocorrelation to remove the portion of the phenotypic variance among populations that is explained by genetic distance (using mitochondrial DNA sequences and allozyme frequency data). Because the remaining portion of the phenotypic variance represents the independent divergence of individual populations, a significant sympatric difference in the corrected dataset provides evidence of true character displacement: significant sympatric character evolution that is independent of population history. After removal of genetic distance effects in Nucella, shell shape differences remain statistically significant in N. emarginata, providing evidence of significant sympatric character divergence. However, for external shell ornamentation in both species and shell shape in N. ostrina, the significance of sympatric differences is lost in the corrected dataset, indicating that colonization events and gene flow have played important roles in the evolutionary history of character divergence in sympatry. Although the absence of a widely dispersing planktonic larva in the life cycle of Nucella will promote local adaptation, the results here indicate that once advantageous traits arise, demographic processes, such as recurrent gene flow between established populations and extinction and recolonization, are important factors contributing to the geographic pattern of sympatric character divergence.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Marko, PB (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",pmarko@unc.edu,,,,,,115,26,26,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,MAR,2005,59,3,,,,,554,564,,,,,11,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,910PG,WOS:000227943400008,15856698,,,,2021-09-21,

We extend this model of nonequilibrium coexistence, as proposed by Armstrong and McGehee, by putting the interaction into a spatial context using two frameworks: a spatially explicit individual-based model and a spatially implicit metapopulation model. We find that Armstrong and McGehee's mechanism of coexistence can operate in a spatial context. However, individual-based simulations suggest that decreased dispersal restricts coexistence in most cases, whereas differential equation models of metapopulations suggest that a low rate of dispersal between subpopulations often increases the coexistence region. This difference arises in part because of two potentially opposing effects on coexistence due to the asynchrony in the temporal dynamics at different locations. Asynchrony implies that the less efficient species is more likely to be favored in some spatial locations at any given time, which broadens the conditions for coexistence. On the other hand, asynchrony and dispersal can also reduce the amplitude of local population cycles, which restricts coexistence. The relative influence of these two effects depends on details of the population dynamics and the representation of space. Our results also demonstrate that coexistence via the Armstrong-McGehee mechanism can occur even when there is little variation in the global densities of either the consumers or the resource, suggesting that empirical studies of the mechanisms should measure densities on several spatial scales.","Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada","Wilson, WG (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",wgw@duke.edu; abrams@zoo.utoronto.ca,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,44,31,31,0,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

However, such models rarely include estimates of interspecific interactions among explanatory variables. We tested the importance of such variables by using the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, a medium-sized raptor frequently reported to be affected by heterospecifics, as a model species. In an Alpine population, compared to random locations, peregrines selected breeding sites farther from conspecifics, on taller cliffs', with higher availability of farmland and closer to raven Corvus corax nests. Within suitable habitat, peregrines selected sites near ravens and far from elevations associated with golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos nests. Productivity increased with cliff size, farmland availability (rich in the local main prey) and with proximity to ravens, suggesting that the observed choices were adaptive. Finally, at the regional level, peregrine density peaked at low elevation and was positively associated with raven density. The results suggested an active breeding association of peregrines with ravens, which may provide early-warning cues against predators and safe alternative nest-sites. They also confirmed the importance of including estimates of interspecific interactions among explanatory variables, which may: 1) make models more realistic; 2) increase their predictive power by lowering unexplained variance due to unmeasured factors; 3) provide unexpected results such as the cryptic, large-scale breeding association of our study; and 4) stimulate further hypothesis formulation and testing, ultimately leading to deeper ecological knowledge of the study system.","Museo Tridentino Sci Nat, Raptor Conservat Res Unit, I-38100 Trento, Italy","Sergio, F (corresponding author), Museo Tridentino Sci Nat, Raptor Conservat Res Unit, Via Calepina 14, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",fabrizio.sergio8@tin.it,"Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015","Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773",,,,52,46,47,1,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,DEC,2004,27,6,,,,,818,826,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.04030.x,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,882XY,WOS:000225974900013,,,,,2021-09-21,

One potential explanation is that these are statistical expectations over the range of potential species characteristics. We systematically examine the indirect interactions between two hosts with a shared parasitoid across all potential parameter values, using a family of simple models. By including a detection limit for nonzero interspecific effects, we demonstrate that (-,0) indirect interactions between hosts are the most common type for many variants of the model.

Larvae of C. coeruleus, although defended on their dorsal surface with long spines, had the smallest mandibles, were the slowest-moving, and the least successful in interspecific larval combat. The long spines of third instar C. coeruleus appeared to reduce their palatability as food to H. axyridis and O. v-nigrum larvae in choice tests with dead larvae, but were not an effective defence against these species in Petri dish arenas. Larvae of O. v-nigrum had a smooth dorsal surface, were intermediate in terms of mandible size, but were the fastest moving, a trait that benefited their survival in intraguild combat. Larvae of H. axyridis were intermediate with respect to dorsal spines and speed of movement, but had the largest mandibles. This species was the most effective intraguild combatant among the coccinellids and the only one to successfully compete against C. rufilabris larvae of similar age. The speed, manoeuverability and long mandibles of C. rufilabris enabled them to impale coccinellid larvae at a relatively safe distance. The spines of C. coeruleus larvae impeded laterally oriented attacks by C. rufilabris, but did not provide sustained protection from repeated attacks. Success in these interactions appeared largely a function of offensive weaponry (mandible size and morphology) and speed of movement, although the role of dorsal spines as defensive structures was not ruled out. Rates of larval cannibalism were highest for C. rufilabris and largely mirrored the level of aggression observed in interspecific combat for each species.","Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA","Michaud, JP (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Agr Res Ctr Hays, 1232 240th Ave, Hays, KS 67601 USA.",jpmi@ksu.edu,,,,,,13,30,33,0,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0007-4853,1475-2670,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

However, interactions between established residents and incoming juveniles may affect juvenile persistence in species-specific ways and could therefore impose a degree of determinism on future Community structure. Using 16 spatially isolated communities of, coral reef fishes, I conducted two experiments to determine how prior residency by two guilds of fishes affected juvenile recruitment. Each experiment factorially manipulated the presence and absence of two guilds: resident piscivores (groupers and moray eels) and interference competitors (territorial damselfishes). In the first experiment, guilds were manipulated via selective removals, and subsequent recruitment (larval settlement minus mortality) was monitored for 44 days. In the second experiment, guilds Were placed within large cages to prevent direct resident-juvenile interactions, while allowing for any cues produced by enclosed fishes, thereby testing whether incoming larvae used resident-derived cues to select or reject settlement sites. Colonizing juveniles were collected from each reef over 42 days to prevent confounding resident- and recruit-derived cues. In the first experiment, piscivores inhibited recruitment of a damselfish (Pomacentridae) and a surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), and enhanced recruitment of a wrasse (Labridae). In contrast, territorial damselfishes inhibited recruitment of the damselfish and the wrasse, and enhanced recruitment of the surgeonfish. Observations of early recruitment patterns suggested that recruitment differences were established rapidly during the night or dawn periods shortly after settlement and before each daily census. In the second experiment, there was no evidence that larvae used resident-derived cues to select settlement sites, suggesting that recruitment differences in the first experiment resulted from differential mortality caused by direct resident-recruit interactions rather than differential larval settlement. These results demonstrate that interactions between established residents and newly arrived juveniles can have a strong influence on juvenile persistence, and that such interactions appear to be strongest within hours of larval, settlement. Furthermore, because resident effects were species specific, the present composition of these communities may impose a previously undocumented degree of determinism on their future structure.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Almany, GR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Glenn.Almany@jcu.edu.au,,,,,,76,111,111,1,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2003,84,7,,,,,1920,1935,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1920:PEICRF]2.0.CO;2,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,713DN,WOS:000184840900025,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

We measured the instantaneous growth of each species in the presence and absence of the other in 1-m(2) enclosures. We tested single-species (three slimy sculpins/m(2) or three brown trout/m(2)) and combined-species (three sculpins/m(2) and three trout/m(2)) combinations in each of six riffles. We placed a clay tile in each enclosure to evaluate the effects of fish combinations on benthic macroinvertebrates. Growth of brown trout was unaffected by the presence of slimy sculpins (P = 0.647, power [to detect 50% increase in growth] = 0.92), whereas slimy sculpin growth was less in the presence of brown trout (P = 0.038). Densities of total benthic macroinvertebrates, Chironomidae, Trichoptera, and Physa did not differ among fish combinations (P > 0.3). However, densities of Gammarus pseudolimnaeus were significantly less in the presence of brown trout irrespective of the presence of slimy sculpins (P = 0.024), which could be a causal factor underlying the interaction between brown trout and slimy sculpins. We found asymmetrical competition between brown trout and slimy sculpins in stream enclosures, with brown trout being the superior competitor. Nevertheless, the size of enclosures may have biased our results, making it more likely to detect an effect of brown trout on slimy sculpins than vice versa.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Fairfield Univ, Dept Biol, Fairfield, CT 06430 USA; Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Ruetz, CR (corresponding author), Lake Michigan Ctr, Annis Water Resources Inst, 740 W Shoreline Dr, Muskegon, MI 49441 USA.",,,,,,,45,22,23,1,14,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

The exposed sandy beach is an example of a physically rigorous environment where biological interactions have long been considered insignificant. We examined the interaction between the infaunal clam, Donax variabilis, and the hydroid, Lovenella gracilis, on exposed sandy beaches in North Carolina. Epibiotic occupation of Donax by hydroids has been repeatedly observed on ocean beaches but rarely investigated. By providing a stable substrate for attachment, the clam facilitates the persistence of the hydroid in the intertidal beach; however, benefits or costs experienced by the host as a result of this association are unknown. By exposing clams with and without hydroid colonies to multiple types of clam predators, we tested the effectiveness of the hydroid, which possesses stinging nematocysts, in defending its host. The hydroid defended the clam against one common predator, the Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus). Against speckled crabs (Arenaeus cribrarius) and ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata), however, the hydroid offered no protection for its host and instead facilitated predation. The epibiotic hydroid, which projects above the surface of the sand, allowed the crabs to more readily detect clams below the surface. In the field, we evaluated the effect of the hydroid on the tidally synchronized migrations and bur-rowing speed of the clam. The hydroid, which can form large colonies on the posterior end of the clam, had no effect on Donax burrowing speed, but did reduce the speed of transport of clams by wave swash. Depending on relative predation pressure, the occupation of D. variabilis by L. gracilis can alternately be characterized as beneficial or detrimental to the host.","Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Manning, LM (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, 3431 Arendell St, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA.",,,,,,,61,19,22,1,12,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2003,134,3,,,,,415,422,,10.1007/s00442-002-1134-y,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,657BG,WOS:000181645100016,12647150,,,,2021-09-21,

We then focus on Turing instability to examine if and when this cross-emigration response has crucial effects. We find that the type of interaction matters greatly. In the case of competition a cross-emigration response promotes pattern formation by exercising a destabilizing influence; in particular, it may lead to diffusive instability provided that the response is sufficiently strong, which contrasts sharply with the well-known fact that the standard competition system does not exhibit Turing instability. In the case of prey-predator or activator-inhibitor interaction it acts against pattern formation by exerting a stabilizing effect; in particular, the diffusive instability, even though it may happen in a standard system, never occurs when the response is sufficiently strong. We conclude that the cross-emigration response is an important factor that should not be ignored when pattern formation is the issue. (C) 2002 Society for Mathematical Biology.

Using phylogenetic relationships among the Cestoda species, we can show that asexual multiplication appears to have been lost and recovered several times throughout Taeniidae evolution; this allows a comparison of the adult life-history traits of species with and without asexual multiplication at the larval stage. The adult trait considered is the size of the parasite, since numerous life-history traits, such as fecundity and longevity, are correlated with size. If adult traits are independent of whether the larval stage reproduced asexually or not, we expect no difference in the adult size of the proliferative (i.e. with asexual multiplication) and non-proliferative species. The results are inconsistent with this hypothesis. In contrast, species with asexual multiplication in the intermediate host seem to have smaller adult size, reflecting a trade-off. We propose that ecological factors involving intraspecific and interspecific competition in the final host might be responsible for this trade-off. The role of these parameters in the evolution of life-history traits and more precisely in the acquisition of asexual multiplication is investigated with comparative analysis and discussed in the context of host-parasite interactions.","Univ Perpignan, Ctr Biol & Ecol Trop & Mediterraneenne, CNRS, UMR 5555, F-66860 Perpignan, France; Univ Bourgogne, Lab Ecol Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5561, F-21000 Dijon, France; Univ Paris 06, Lab Ecol Evolut Parasitaire, CNRS, UMR 7103, F-75252 Paris, France","Morand, S (corresponding author), Univ Perpignan, Ctr Biol & Ecol Trop & Mediterraneenne, CNRS, UMR 5555, Av de Villeneuve, F-66860 Perpignan, France.",morand@univ-perp.fr,"Morand, Serge/M-5433-2018","Morand, Serge/0000-0003-3986-7659",,,,64,14,15,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0932-0113,1432-1955,,PARASITOL RES,Parasitol.

This experiment investigated effects of accumulated invertebrate carcasses as a resource for two competing mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes aegypti (L.) whether either species differentially benefited from accumulated carcasses, and if such a benefit affected interspecific competition. First, we measured accumulation of invertebrate carcasses in standard containers at a field site. We then used a replacement series with five different species ratios at the same total density: and varied the input of invertebrate carcasses [dead Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) ] in three levels: none, the average input from our field site, or the maximum input recorded at our field site. Survivorship, development time, and mass were measured for each mosquito species as correlates of population growth, and were used to calculate a population performance index, lambda'. There were strong positive effects of invertebrate carcass additions on all growth correlates and lambda'. Differences in performance between species were pronounced in small or no carcass additions and absent in large inputs of invertebrate carcasses, but there was little evidence that inputs of invertebrate carcasses altered the competitive advantage in this system. These results suggest that terrestrial invertebrate carcasses may be an important resource for many types of container communities, and large accumulations of dead invertebrates may: reduce resource competition between these mosquitoes. thus favoring coexistence. We propose that the total amount of resource, including accumulated invertebrate carcasses, may explain observed patterns of replacement involving these mosquitoes.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Div Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Daugherty, MP (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Div Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI044793, R01 AI044793-01, R15 AI039700-01, R01 AI44793-01, R15 AI39700-01] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI039700, R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,37,111,115,0,18,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0022-2585,,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

The abundance of prey in the intertidal zone was modelled in relation to abiotic environmental characteristics. Four factors were found to be important predictors of prey abundance: the position within the tidal zone, the abundance and size of rockpools, the nature of the substratum and the presence of fresh water streams. The model was used to predict prey abundance in different areas of the shore. We then investigated whether mink were choosing areas with higher prey abundance at different tidal levels and within, as opposed to between, core areas (areas with a relatively high density of fixes, encompassing usually one or more dens). Only when foraging at low or mid-tide and within core areas were mink found to behave selectively. They showed no significant preference for areas rich in prey when foraging at high tide and between core areas. Mink were also found to avoid areas with fresh water streams and to prefer foraging in the mid-tide zone.

Competitive ability of clover families was defined as the ratio between mixed stand and pure stand for clover DM yield. Narrow-sense heritability from parent-offspring regression of pure stand data was high to moderate (h(2) > 0.50) for DM yield, seed yield and most of their components. Persistence as predicted by stolen density showed negative genetic correlations with seed yield (r(g) = -0.70) and DM yield (r(g) = -0.60), whereas seed yield and DM yield tended towards a negative correlation (r(g) = -0.45). Sizes of different vegetative or reproductive organs were generally correlated positively. Evidence was provided that the set of parent genotypes represents well the genetic variation available within the Ladino gene pool. The results highlighted the difficulty of combining relatively short-term DM yield, persistence and seed yield into a unique plant type.

Both barnacle species showed tide level dependent distribution patterns in the boundary zone. Semibalanus cariosus was dominant at lower levels. this pattern was determined by post-recruitment mortality. This mortality pattern seemed to be set by physical stress because recruitment density and survival rate were not correlated with the cover of other species, and mortality was higher in higher zones where physical stress is more severe. Chthamalus challengeri was dominant at higher levels; this pattern was determined by recruitment. The recruitment density and survival rate of this species were not affected by the covers of other species, thus, neither interference nor pre-emption significantly affected the distribution pattern.

Each stream consisted of three habitats, a riffle, a run and a pool, the latter two being further divided into shallow margins and deeper mid-regions. The experimental design differentiated between intraspecific and interspecific effects by having two densities of allopatry for each salmonid and one density of sympatry, for a total of five treatments. These five treatments were then run in the presence and absence of the piscivorous northern pike (Esox lucius) at high and low discharge. Decreasing discharge reduced the area of the run and pool margins covered by water, thereby reducing use of these areas by trout and grayling. In the absence of a predator, brown trout caused grayling to markedly reduce its use of pool mid-regions and increase its use of the shallow margins, but only at high flow. Grayling had a more modest effect on brown trout, causing brown trout to increase its use of pool mid-regions, but only at high flow. There were no effects of intraspecific effects on habitat use by either species. In the presence of pike, which occupied the Fool, grayling had no effect on habitat use by brown trout, whereas brown trout caused grayling to increase its use of shallow water habitats. There were no effects of intraspecific effects on habitat use by either species when pike was present. The number of grayling or trout consumed by pike did not vary among the different treatments. The results showed that variation in flow and predation altered habitat use patterns of brown trout and grayling.","Univ Lund, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Greenberg, LA (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Biol, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",,,,,,,27,18,18,0,10,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGS,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

Despite this, productivity of these Golden Eagles was quite low averaging only 0.28 young per occupied territory (N = 25).

These differences were amplified in food-deprived and spatially simple conditions, indicating that Ae. triseriatus predatory behavior may have important retarding effects on the colonization of occupied treehole habitats by Ae. albopictus. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were similar in imposing little (Ae. aegypti) or almost no (Ae. albopictus) predation on Ist instars and in being susceptible to predation by AB, triseriatus. The general lack of species-specific differences between Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus indicates that interspecific predation is not a likely explanation for the rapid displacement of Ae. aegypti by Ae. albopictus in domestic containers in the southeastern United States.","Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; Clark Univ, Dept Biol, Worcester, MA 01610 USA","Edgerly, JS (corresponding author), Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",,,,"NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15 AI-27940-01, R15 AI-28039-01A1] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI027940, R15AI028039] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,31,30,30,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2585,1938-2928,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Discriminant analysis showed that the occurrence of trout at a locality was largely determined by oxygen conditions and medium-sized substrata. At localities where trout occurred, the density of 0+ trout was highest in narrow streams with high oxygen concentrations. For older trout, >0+ in age, stream size and temperature were negatively related to density. Biotic factors also appeared to affect trout density, as trout density was inversely related to abundance of predators and coexisting species. Even intraspecific competition appeared to be important as length of 0+ trout was inversely related to trout density. It is suggested that improvements of water quality may be an effective way to restore sea trout populations in southern Sweden, especially in narrow streams where smelt production has the highest potential.

Many early ecomorphological studies revealed patterns that were taken as indicating character displacement and character release, driven by competition or lack thereof. These patterns may result from a coevolutionary morphological response or from species sorting according to size. Thus, the relationship between morphology and competition may be crucial for understanding both the morphological evolution of animals and the role of competition in structuring communities. Some earlier research perceived as indicating morphological relationships conditioned by interaction of species was conducted on mammals, particularly carnivores. Subsequent criticism in the ecological literature demonstrated that many of the perceived patterns could not be statistically confirmed, thus calling into question this line of evidence for competition. More recent ecological literature relies on strong statistical analyses and careful consideration both of guild composition and of which morphological traits should be examined. This literature, resting largely on mammals, includes several cases that suggest a coevolutionary morphological response to interspecific competition. These studies have focused on the trophic apparatus directly related to food procurement by mammals - the teeth. Island mammals often show striking morphological patterns, some of which have been interpreted as resulting from release from competition with mainland species that have not reached islands. However, few of these patterns were critically evaluated to demonstrate their support for the hypothesis of character release. Despite several decades of interest and research, many questions regarding competitively induced morphological patterns remain unresolved and require further research. Mammals are especially promising subjects for such research.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Dayan, T (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",,,,,,,153,149,153,2,67,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,SEP,1998,28,3,,,,,99,124,,10.1046/j.1365-2907.1998.00029.x,,,26,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,118JD,WOS:000075834000001,,,,,2021-09-21,

An integrated Geographical Information System (GIS)-Spatially Explicit Population Dynamics Model (SEPM) for investigating the dynamics of red squirrel Sciurus vulgar is and grey squirrel S. carolinensis populations in different landscapes is described. 2. Using the model, we simulated processes of reproduction, mortality and dispersal in individual populations of squirrels in habitat blocks identified within a GIS. We modelled dispersal as a process whereby individual animals moved between blocks of habitat separated by areas of unsuitable habitat. An interference model simulating the effects of competition between the grey and red squirrels was incorporated where both species occupied the same habitat blocks. 3. The model was used to investigate the spread of grey squirrels and its impact on the distribution of red squirrels in Norfolk, UK, where historical information on the decline in the red squirrel and the expansion of the grey squirrel were available. 4. We examined the effect of a range of life history scenarios differing in terms of adult mortality, juvenile mortality, fecundity, habitat carrying capacity and maximum dispersal distances. Model predictions were closest to the observed expansion of the grey squirrel and decline in the red squirrel when mortality was lower and fecundity higher than the averages recorded for the grey squirrel in the United Kingdom.","UNIV NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE,DEPT AGR & ENVIRONM SCI,NEWCASTLE TYNE NE1 7RU,TYNE & WEAR,ENGLAND; INST TERR ECOL,MONKSWOOD,ENGLAND","Rushton, SP (corresponding author), UNIV NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE,CTR LAND USE,NEWCASTLE TYNE NE1 7RU,TYNE & WEAR,ENGLAND.",,"Lurz, Peter/O-5108-2019",,,,,36,72,75,2,71,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We present one-and two-species models of sessile organisms incorporating competition for space and two forms of cooperation: habitat amelioration and positive recruitment. In these models, habitat amelioration reduces an organism's mortality rate when it is surrounded by other organisms (''safety-in-numbers''), and positive intraspecific recruitment enables juveniles to use the shelter of established individuals as settlement (or germination) sites. A single-species model incorporating both forms of cooperation may exhibit sharp discontinuities in population density along an environmental gradient. In a two-species model the same mechanisms may lead to sharp boundaries in species composition if, as empirical studies suggest, a trade-off exists between colonization and cooperation abilities (e.g., strong cooperators are poor colonizers). Positive interspecific recruitment obscures the interspecific boundaries.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & MARINE BIOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA",,,"Nisbet, Roger M/B-6951-2014",,,,,37,57,61,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1997,78,7,,,,,2004,2017,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2004:CACASE]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XZ789,WOS:A1997XZ78900007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Meadows were flooded artificially every autumn, but no water management or agricultural activities were carried out during the breeding seasons over the 8 year study period, 1988 - 1995. All three species laid clutches in their preferred nest sites during the early laying period, and this resulted in the formation of single-species colonies. Preferred nest sites for lapwings were areas of low vegetation a long way from the water. Godwits preferred high vegetation near the water, whereas redshanks showed a preference for areas mid way between the two latter. In preferred areas, where single species-colonies developed, the frequency of aggressive interactions was higher than in mixed colonies or on solitary nest sites. In mid and late laying periods, pairs nested in nonpreferred sites, presumably due to competition, and this produced mixed-species colonies or solitary nest sites. Lapwings benefited from reduced effects of predation and flooding by rainfall in three-species colonies, where they attained their highest hatching success. Godwits benefited from nesting with lapwings and achieved their highest hatching success in two-species colonies because they nested further from the water and lost fewer clutches from flooding than in single-species colonies. Redshanks suffered nest losses due to attacks of neighbouring lapwings and achieved their highest hatching success in two-species colonies where they bred with godwits. The conspecific and heterospecific interactions produced colonies with various compositions that reflected the balance of costs and benefits for each species to achieve its highest hatching success.","Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Gen Zool, H-1445 Budapest, Hungary","Hegyi, Z (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Gen Zool, Pf 330,Puskin U 3, H-1445 Budapest, Hungary.",Sasvari@abc.hu,,,,,,20,5,6,1,18,INST VERTEBRATE BIOLOGY AS CR,BRNO,"KVETNA 8, BRNO 603 65, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-7893,,,FOLIA ZOOL,Folia Zool.,,1997,46,4,,,,,303,314,,,,,12,Zoology,Zoology,YQ623,WOS:000071406400002,,,,,2021-09-21,

An introduced bacterial strain, e.g. a genetically modified micro-organism (GEMMO), was assumed to distribute among the pores of the different size classes. This strain (the invader) was assumed to compete with the indigenous soil biota. Key aspect in this competition was the available pore space. The model predicted that generally the GEMMO invader bacteria ultimately did not become established in soil. Extinction of the invader was, however, often slow, and could take in the order of years. Very harsh conditions in soil were seen to enhance the pore space available for colonization and hence the probability that the invader was able to expel the indigenous microflora and become established. Extinction of the invader was slower when it was introduced when soil conditions were becoming more favourable for microbial life than when conditions were worsening.","TNO,MW,DEPT BIOL,2600 JA DELFT,NETHERLANDS; DLO,INST SOIL FERTIL RES,IPO,6700 GW WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS",,,,"van der Hoeven, Nelly/0000-0001-6465-5215",,,,23,5,7,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

In particular, escape from parasitoids, predators and competitors could mediate a successful host shift by compensating for decreased feeding performance on a new plant. Here I investigate the effects that two braconid wasp parasitoids (Opius lectus and Biosteres melleus) have on sympatric host races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) infesting apple (Malus pumila) and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) at a field site near Grant, Michigan, USA. Levels of parasitoid attack were much lower for fly larvae infesting the derived host apple (13%) compared to the ancestral host hawthorn (46%). At least three factors contributed to apples being a relatively safe haven from parasitoids for maggots. First, apples were larger (mean fruit width = 5.2 cm) than hawthorns (mean width = 1.6 cm). Apples therefore provided greater physical protection for fly larvae than hawthorns because the ovipositors of female wasps were too short to reach a majority of maggots feeding within apples. Second, apples had an earlier fruiting phenology than hawthorns and the seasonal distribution of O. lectus parasitoids was asynchronous with the development of larvae in apples. Third, hawthorn fruits were infested by various species of caterpillars (tortricids and an agonoxenid) and a curculionid weevil to a much greater degree than apples (65% compared to 11%). These heterospecific insects forced fly larvae to feed near the surface of hawthorn fruits where they were more prone to detection and attack from braconids (73% of larvae feeding in hawthorns with heterospecific insects were parasitized compared to 34% of larvae infesting hawthorns without caterpillars and weevils). Data from other Rhagoletis and tephritid species suggest that escape from parasitoids may be a common theme in host range expansion and race formation for these flies.",,"FEDER, JL (corresponding author), UNIV NOTRE DAME,DEPT BIOL SCI,NOTRE DAME,IN 46556, USA.",,,,,,,31,139,141,0,51,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1995,76,3,,,,,801,813,,10.2307/1939346,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QU358,WOS:A1995QU35800011,,,,,2021-09-21,

Evidence is, however, scant. We test the proposition that nest predation has been an important selective factor in the evolution of the rapid developmental rates characteristic of altricial birds. We compare the incubation and nestling periods of altrical land birds from islands that lack native mammalian and reptilian nest predators with those of phylogenetically related species from areas with predators. We show that open-nesting native species from islands take longer to hatch and fledge than related species from continents, controlling for body mass. In contrast, species that have been recently introduced to islands have similar incubation and nestling periods there compared to those in their region of origin. In addition, we show that statistically different regression equations describe the interspecific allometric relationships between incubation and nestling period and body mass in hole-nesting and open-nesting species, the latter of which presumably face higher predation pressure. We confirm that, in relation to body mass, hole-nesting species develop more slowly.

Many models have been proposed to explain the evolution of this suite of traits. In this paper I describe the first experimental test of the assumption that forms the foundation of all these models: that begging behaviour bears a direct cost. Miniature two-way radios hidden inside artificial nests were used to measure changes in predation rates with changes in begging. This showed that begging was costly for birds that nest on the ground, but there was no cost for those that nest in trees. Further, the cost of begging for ground-nesters was an increasing function of begging rate. For ground nests, these data suggest that nest predation could act both as a check on the evolutionary exaggeration of begging traits, and as a mechanism to enforce the honesty of begging signals. The marked variation in the predation cost of begging in different nesting sites suggests that this cost may form a good framework for investigations of the interspecific diversity of begging calls.",,"HASKELL, D (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT, CORSON HALL, ITHACA, NY 14850 USA.",,,"Haskell, David G./0000-0003-1580-9438",,,,16,197,202,1,46,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In freshwater pelagic communities, the collective efficiency of herbivorous plankton in consuming primary producers is up to 10 times as great as is the efficiency of forest herbivores in consuming their food. Conversely, forest predators are about three times as efficient in consuming herbivore production. as are zooplanktivorous fish. The presence of an additional level, piscivorous fish, in pelagic communities accounts for the difference. In the aquatic system, herbivorous zooplankton are freed from predation by the effect of piscivorous fish on their predators; in the terrestrial system, green plants are freed from herbivory by predation on the herbivores. We explain the contrast between freshwater pelagic systems and forests and prairies as follows: Pelagic ecosystems have more trophic levels as a result of selection for small rapidly growing primary producers, which cannot hold space in the fluid medium, in contrast to large space-occupying producers in the terrestrial environment. Consumers in pelagic systems are more frequently gape limited in the size range of food they can ingest than are grasping consumers in terrestrial systems. This difference makes for two largely distinct levels of predators in pelagic communities. The energy within the living, nondetrital components is more finely divided between trophic levels in pelagic systems than in terrestrial systems. Ecological efficiencies do not determine trophic structure; rather, they are its product.","UNIV N CAROLINA, DEPT BIOL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27599 USA","HAIRSTON, NG (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,176,388,392,2,270,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

In the second experiment mice had both nonvolatile and volatile cues available from the same sources as in experiment 1. All age and sex class and female reproductive condition groups exhibited odor cue preferences except juvenile females. There were no specific odor cue preferences exhibited by any of the responder types with regard to odors from juvenile females. In the third and fifth experiments, mice were presented with nonvolatile plus volatile or only volatile urine odor cues, respectively, from four genera, Mus, Peromyscus, Microtus, and Homo. Mice of all age classes and both sexes preferred Mus musculus odor, were neutral toward Microtus ochrogaster odor, and avoided odors from Peromyscus leucopus and Homo sapiens; these patterns were the same regardless of whether only volatile or both volatile and nonvolatile cues were presented. The fourth and sixth experiments involved testing volatile cues only and volatile cues plus nonvolatile cues from human sweat or feces from dogs, cats, or shrews. Mice avoided the human sweat and feces from cats and shrews, but were neutral toward the odor of dog feces. There were effects on whether mice were trapped in the interior of the enclosure or on the perimeter for some odors tested in these six experiments. The findings provide insights regarding possible functions of odor cues in the behavioral ecology of house mice.

However, the evolutionary processes underlying the emergence of phenotypic diversity can typically only be understood at the population level. Consequently, how subtle phenotypic differences at the intraspecific level can give rise to larger-scale changes in performance and ecology remains poorly understood. We here tested for the covariation between ecology, bite force, jaw muscle architecture, and the three-dimensional shape of the cranium and mandible in 16 insular populations of the lizards Podarcis melisellensis and P. sicula. We then compared the patterns observed at the among-population level with those observed at the interspecific level. We found that three-dimensional head shape as well as jaw musculature evolve similarly under similar ecological circumstances. Depending on the type of food consumed or on the level of sexual competition, different muscle groups were more developed and appeared to underlie changes in cranium and mandible shape. Our findings show that the local selective regimes are primary drivers of phenotypic variation resulting in predictable patterns of form and function. Moreover, intraspecific patterns of variation were generally consistent with those at the interspecific level, suggesting that microevolutionary variation may translate into macroevolutionary patterns of ecomorphological diversity.","[Taverne, Maxime; Herrel, Anthony] Museum Natl dHistoire Nat, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Dept Adaptat Vivant, UMR 7179, Paris, France; [Dutel, Hugo] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Dutel, Hugo; Fagan, Michael] Univ Hull, Dept Engn, Med & Biol Engn Res Grp, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Stambuk, Anamaria; Lisicic, Duje; Tadic, Zoran] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Zagreb, Croatia; [Fabre, Anne-Claire] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, London, England","Taverne, M (corresponding author), Museum Natl dHistoire Nat, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Dept Adaptat Vivant, UMR 7179, Paris, France.",maxime.taverne@mnhn.fr,"Taverne, Maxime/K-7564-2018; Herrel, Anthony/C-3712-2013; Fabre, Anne-Claire/J-4492-2014","Taverne, Maxime/0000-0003-3355-6200; Herrel, Anthony/0000-0003-0991-4434; Stambuk, Anamaria/0000-0002-3177-7694; Tadic, Zoran/0000-0002-7651-4425; Fabre, Anne-Claire/0000-0001-7310-1775; Dutel, Hugo/0000-0002-1908-5150",National Geographic Explorer Grant; Sorbonne Universite [Idex SUPER SU-17-R-DOC-03]; Croatian Science Foundation [HRZZ-IP-2016-06-9177]; doctoral school ED227 (Transhumance program),"We would like to thank the associate editor Miriam Zelditch and the three anonymous reviewers for their very constructive and insightful comments that really helped us in improving the manuscript.

In Poland, three different species of those beetles develop on the same host plant and use the same resources, which can lead to increased competition. We tested preferences of weevil females towards acorn size chosen for oviposition as well as reproduction time and other characteristics of their breeding behavior. The results clearly indicate that particular species prefer acorns of different masses and breeds in different periods corresponding to different stages of fruit growth. In other words, this enables weevils to pass each other during reproduction. Furthermore, one of the studied species varies distinctly also in terms of the number of laid eggs and the manner of locating them within the acorn tissues. Our observations support the hypothesis that niche partitioning among the species appears to be occurring when the resources-acorns, are limited. The work helps to understand how multi-species communities of insects cope in order to survive in a shared habitat. Oak seed predatory weevils occurring in Poland are prone to increased interspecific competition due to the limited number of Quercus species, compared to southern Europe, in which they can develop. Therefore, analyses on the preferences of three weevil species for acorn sizes chosen for reproduction, as well as on reproductive period duration, were performed. Cafeteria-type experiments were set for females of three species associated with one oak species. Females were allowed to choose and oviposit in acorns of different sizes and growth stages. Research revealed statistically significant differences between the masses of acorns chosen for oviposition by females of Curculio glandium (the biggest), C. pellitus (medium), and C. venosus (the smallest). Studied weevils also differed in terms of the beginning of the reproductive period, which corresponded with the increasing mass of growing acorns. Moreover, C. glandium was observed to be the only species to perform radial egg galleries and lay a considerably higher and varied number of eggs. The results support the hypothesis of a strategy aimed at reducing interspecific competition between Curculio spp. in terms of limited host plant species number.","[Reut, Michal; Moniuszko, Hanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Hort Sci, Dept Plant Protect, Sect Appl Entomol, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Chrabaszcz, Mariusz] Univ Wroclaw, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Ecol Biogeochem & Environm Protect, Kanonia 6-8, PL-50328 Wroclaw, Poland","Reut, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Hort Sci, Dept Plant Protect, Sect Appl Entomol, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",michal_reut@sggw.edu.pl; mariusz.chrabaszcz@uwr.edu.pl; hanna_moniuszko@sggw.edu.pl,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,AUG,2021,12,8,,,,,,,687,10.3390/insects12080687,,,11,Entomology,Entomology,UG3QR,WOS:000689171900001,34442253,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

In mammalian carnivores, to reduce the risks of negative encounters between competitors, species can employ a strategy of temporal partitioning, adapting activity patterns to limit synchronous activity. This strategy of non-human competitor avoidance, however, may be influenced by the expansion of human activities, which has driven wild mammals towards nocturnality. We hypothesise that the disruption of temporal niche partitioning by humans and their activities could increase temporal overlap between carnivores, enhancing interspecific competition. We reviewed the published literature systematically and employed generalised linear models to evaluate quantitatively the relative influence of a range of human, meteorological and ecological variables on coefficients of temporal overlap within mammalian terrestrial carnivore communities (orders Carnivora and Didelphimorphia) on a global scale. None of the models investigated showed evidence of an impact of humans on temporal partitioning between carnivores on a global scale. This illustrates that temporal avoidance of humans and competitors does not always follow a consistent pattern and that its strength may be context-dependent and relative to other dimensions of niche partitioning (spatial and trophic). Similarly, the regulation of activity patterns may be strongly site-specific and may be influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic characteristics. Temporal avoidance of both humans and competitors by carnivores may take the form of short, reactive responses that do not impact activity patterns in the longer term. Although we did not detect a global disruption of temporal partitioning due to human disturbance, carnivore communities may still experience an increase in interspecific competition in other niche dimensions. Further research would benefit from using controlled experimental designs and investigating multiple dimensions of niche partitioning simultaneously. Finally, we recommend complementing the coefficient of temporal overlap with other metrics of fine-scale spatiotemporal interactions.","[Seveque, Anthony; Gentle, Louise K.; Yarnell, Richard W.; Uzal, Antonio] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0QF, Notts, England; [Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose] Oviedo Univ, Res Unit Biodivers UO CSIC PA, Mieres 33600, Spain","Seveque, A (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0QF, Notts, England.",anthony.seveque@ntu.ac.uk; louise.gentle@ntu.ac.uk; jv.lopezbao@gmail.com; richard.yarnell@ntu.ac.uk; antonio.uzal@ntu.ac.uk,,,"Nottingham Trent University; Ramon & Cajal research contract from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [RYC-2015-18932]","A.S. received funding from a Nottingham Trent University Vice-Chancellor's bursary scholarship.

Integrating these features into a trait-based quantitative framework requires a conceptual and quantitative synthesis of how multiple species and their functional traits interact and respond to changing environments, a challenge known in community ecology as the fourth-corner problem. We propose such a novel synthesis, implemented as an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model. This allows us to (1) simultaneously model trait-trait and trait-environment relationships by explicitly accounting for both intra- and interspecific trait variabilities in a single analysis using all available data types, (2) quantify the strength of the trait-environment relationships, (3) identify trade-offs between multiple traits in multiple species, and (4) faithfully propagate our modeling uncertainties when making species-specific and community-wide trait predictions, reducing false confidence in our spatial prediction results. We apply this integrated approach to the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, a sentinel ecosystem impacted simultaneously by both climate change and multiple types of human exploitation. The Sundarbans presents extensive variability in environmental variables, such as salinity and siltation, driven by changing seawater levels from the south and freshwater damming from the north. We find that tree species growing under stress have a typical functional response to the environmental drivers with inter-specific variability around this average, and the amount of variability is further contingent upon the nature and magnitude of the environmental drivers. Our model captures the retreat in traits related to resource acquisition and a plastic enhancement of traits related to resource conservation, both clear indications of stress. We predict that, if historical increases in salinity and siltation are maintained, one-third of whole-ecosystem productivity will be lost by 2050. Our integrated modeling approach bridges community and ecosystem ecology through simultaneously modeling trait-environment correlations and trait-trait trade-offs at organismal, community, and ecosystem levels; provides a generalizable foundation for powerful modeling of trait-environment linkages under changing environments to predict their consequences on ecosystem functioning and services; and is readily applicable across the Earth's ecosystems.","[Sarker, Swapan Kumar; Reeve, Richard; Matthiopoulos, Jason] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Sarker, Swapan Kumar] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh","Reeve, R (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Richard.Reeve@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Sarker, Swapan Kumar/0000-0002-9933-0493","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, United Kingdom [BDCA-2013-6]; SUST Research Centre, Bangladesh [FES/2020/2/01]; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/L004070/1, BB/ P004202/1]; University of Glasgow start-up fund","We are thankful to the editor and reviewers for suggestions that improved this manuscript.

In particular, wood decay is better predicted by variation in fungal communities than in climate. Multiple links exist: interspecific competition slows decomposition in more diverse fungal communities, whereas trait variation between different communities also affects process rates. Here, we paired field and laboratory experiments using a dispersal gradient at a forest-shrubland ecotone to examine how fungi affect wood decomposition across scales. We observed that while fungal communities closer to forests were capable of faster decomposition, wood containing diverse fungal communities decomposed more slowly, independent of location. Dispersal-driven stochasticity in small-scale community assembly was nested within large-scale turnover in the regional species pool, decoupling the two patterns. We thus find multiple distinct links between microbes and ecosystem function that manifest across different spatial scales.","[Smith, Gabriel Reuben; Peay, Kabir G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Smith, Gabriel Reuben] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Global Ecosyst Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland","Smith, GR (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Smith, GR (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Global Ecosyst Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland.",grsmith@stanford.edu,,"Peay, Kabir/0000-0002-7998-7412",Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1845544]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Mycological Society of America,"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: 1845544; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: Graduate Research Fellowship; Mycological Society of America, Grant/Award Number: Forest Fungal Ecology Award",,56,0,0,13,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

In this study, we evaluate how traits interact with intraspecific density to modulate performance (per capita birth rate) and whether the traits associated with intraspecific competitive ability are similar across multiple species. We used an experimental system of four cladoceran zooplankton species, experimentally manipulated the density of conspecifics, and measured a range of morphological and life history characteristics (body mass, body length, second antenna length, eye diameter, relative growth rate, age at first reproduction, and birth rate). With causal modeling, we identified significant trait-density relationships for three out of four species, although the specific traits that predicted birth rate varied from species to species. In general, individuals at higher densities displayed smaller morphological traits and shifts towards slower relative growth rates and delayed onset of reproduction. We also asked more generally if there are consistent trait-mediated impacts of density across multiple species. The interspecific model identified significant trait-density relationships for body length, age at first reproduction, and relative growth rate. Unexpectedly, we found little evidence for trait-based competition due to mechanisms such as limiting similarity or hierarchical competition, and rather noted the potential for trait plasticity and constraints on plasticity affecting performance in response to the competitive environment.","[Frances, Dachin N.; Barber, Amelia J.; Tucker, Caroline M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Tucker, Caroline M.] Univ N Carolina, Environm Ecol & Energy Program, Murray Venable Hall,CB 3275, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Tucker, CM (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.; Tucker, CM (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Environm Ecol & Energy Program, Murray Venable Hall,CB 3275, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",carolinemtucker@gmail.com,,,,,,66,1,1,24,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2021,102,4,,,,,,,e03294,10.1002/ecy.3294,,MAR 2021,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RH8PO,WOS:000626547900001,33559149,,,,2021-09-21,

Intriguingly, most venomous mammal species belong to Eulipotyphla (solenodons, shrews). This fact may be linked to their high metabolic rate and a nearly continuous demand of nutritious food, and thus it relates the venom functions to facilitation of their efficient foraging. While mammalian venoms have been investigated using biochemical and molecular assays, studies of their ecological functions have been neglected for a long time. Therefore, we provide here an overview of what is currently known about eulipotyphlan venoms, followed by a discussion of how these venoms might have evolved under ecological pressures related to food acquisition, ecological interactions, and defense and protection. We delineate six mutually nonexclusive functions of venom (prey hunting, food hoarding, food digestion, reducing intra- and interspecific conflicts, avoidance of predation risk, weapons in intraspecific competition) and a number of different subfunctions for eulipotyphlans, among which some are so far only hypothetical while others have some empirical confirmation. The functions resulting from the need for food acquisition seem to be the most important for solenodons and especially for shrews. We also present several hypotheses explaining why, despite so many potentially beneficial functions, venomousness is rare even among eulipotyphlans. The tentativeness of many of the arguments presented in this review highlights our main conclusion, i.e., insights regarding the functions of eulipotyphlan venoms merit additional study.","[Kowalski, Krzysztof] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Vertebrate Zool & Ecol, Inst Biol, Fac Biol & Vet Sci, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Rychlik, Leszek] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Dept Systemat Zool, Fac Biol, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland","Rychlik, L (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Dept Systemat Zool, Fac Biol, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",k.kowalski@umk.pl; lrychlik@amu.edu.pl,"; Rychlik, Leszek/B-2956-2013","Kowalski, Krzysztof/0000-0001-6320-8384; Rychlik, Leszek/0000-0002-1479-1443",Nicolaus Copernicus Univeristy in Torun,"This research was supported by budgets of the Department of Vertebrate Zoology and Ecology (NCU, Torun) and the Department of Systematic Zoology (AMU, Poznan).

Food represents one of the most important resources influencing competition, and differences in the trophic niche of native and invasive species can affect their ability to coexist. Moreover, in sympatric native and invasive species of similar body size and high sexual dimorphism, competition for food between individuals of the same sex may be higher than intraspecific competition between males and females, thus making the overall competitive interactions more complex. The aim of this study was to investigate the intraspecific and intrasexual competition for food resources between two sexually dimorphic mustelids, the native polecat Mustela putorius and invasive American mink Neovison vison, in riparian habitats of Bialowie(z) over dota Forest (Poland). Based on an analysis of 1215 scats, we studied the food habits of eight polecat and 24 mink individuals. The trophic niches of the polecat and mink were narrow and overlapped considerably. The diet of both predators was dominated by amphibians (mainly the common frog Rana temporaria), which comprised up to 94.1% and 89.7% of polecat and mink prey biomass, respectively. Individual diet variation was low within each sex group of both species. Interspecific similarities in body mass of the sexes and intraspecific differences in body mass between the sexes did not affect pairwise niche overlaps. However, we observed some mechanisms of food segregation between the sexes and species that reduced intra- and interspecies competition. Polecat males hunted more common toads Bufo bufo than polecat females, mink males and mink females. They also hunted larger frogs than polecat females, and the opposite pattern was recorded in mink. We conclude that two predator species exploiting abundant prey can coexist despite a very high overlap in their food niches.","[Zalewski, A.; Szymura, M.; Kowalczyk, R.] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Ul Stoczek 1, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Brzezinski, M.] Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Warsaw, Poland","Zalewski, A (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Ul Stoczek 1, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland.",zalewski@ibs.bialowieza.pl,,"Brzezinski, Marcin/0000-0002-6300-0425; Kowalczyk, Rafal/0000-0001-7264-2158; Zalewski, Andrzej/0000-0003-4518-2787",KBN Grant [6 P04F 018 18],"We thank E.

Here we provide aspects of basic life-history data for 2 populations of the critically endangered Tamesi molly Poecilia latipunctata (Poeciliidae), which is native to the headwaters of the Rio Tamesi in northeastern Mexico. Furthermore, we compare their life history to that of 2 syntopic species, the Atlantic molly (Poecilia mexicana) and the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa). Life histories of P. latipunctata are largely similar to that of other mollies: male size was normally distributed in both populations, and females produced 1 clutch at a time, while relying predominantly on yolk for embryo provisioning. However, at our 2 sample sites, P. latipunctata males were smaller than P. mexicana males, and P. latipunctata females produced significantly larger offspring than either P. formosa or P. mexicana. Based on patterns of male and offspring size, we cautiously suggest that, besides anthropogenic disturbance, P. latipunctata might also be suffering from strong interspecific competition, and we call on more research into the basic biology of this species (including its competitive ability).","[Riesch, Rudiger] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Biol Sci, Egham Hill, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Makowicz, Amber M.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 319 Stadium Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Makowicz, Amber M.; Joachim, Brandon; Schlupp, Ingo] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, 730 Van Vleet Oval, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Garcia-De Leon, Francisco J.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Lab Genet Conservac, Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, 195 Playa Pala Santa Rita Sur, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico","Riesch, R (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Biol Sci, Egham Hill, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",rudiger.riesch@rhul.ac.uk,,"Riesch, Rudiger/0000-0002-0223-1254; Garcia de Leon, Francisco Javier/0000-0003-2323-2560",CIBNOR; University of Oklahoma,FJGdL thanks CIBNOR for its support for this study.

However, other processes, such as ecological sorting, result in the same pattern of trait variation. In this study, we characterize character displacement in eight species of snail-feeding Acoptolabrus ground beetles in the Far East. Acoptolabrus exhibit divergent feeding phenotypes, including species with a slender forebody that is able to intrude into large shells and species with stout heads and mandibles for crushing small shells. The pattern of character displacement in feeding phenotypes was confirmed by multivariate analysis of body dimensions. Molecular phylogenetic analysis, divergence time estimation and biogeographical analysis revealed that sympatry and phenotypic divergence occurred repeatedly during the Pleistocene and almost simultaneously within each geographical area. Comparative analysis revealed that the evolution of feeding phenotypes best fitted a selective model with three adaptive optima, corresponding to the three cases of sympatry with a congener. Repeated coincidences of sympatry and adaptive differentiation in feeding phenotypes suggested causal relationships, although the precise order of events was difficult to discriminate. This study provides insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of interspecific interactions and adaptive phenotypic diversification.","[Akiyama, Kazutoshi; Park, Yong Hwan; Shinohara, Tadashi; Takami, Yasuoki] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Human Dev & Environm, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Jang, Tae Woong; Park, Yong Hwan; Kim, Jong Kuk] Kangwon Natl Univ, Coll Forest & Environm Sci, Chunchon 24341, South Korea; [Park, Yong Hwan] Korea Natl Arboretum, Div Forest Biodivers, Pochon 11186, South Korea; [Konuma, Junji] Toho Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Funabashi, Chiba 2748510, Japan; [Liang, Hongbin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kubota, Kohei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Forest Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Sota, Teiji] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Kim, Jung Lark] Uiduk Univ, Dept Hlth Management, Gyeongju 38004, South Korea","Takami, Y (corresponding author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Human Dev & Environm, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",takami@people.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Takami, Yasuoki/T-7336-2019",,"Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (Korea-Japan Basic Scientific Promotion Program)Korea Science and Engineering Foundation [11, F01-2001-000-20014-0]; Japan-Korea Basic Science Cooperation Program; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP14560114, JP17405007, JP23405009, JP17H04603]","We thank K.

There was no temporal segregation among the carnivores. Carnivores synchronized their activity with that of their main prey, the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). In contrast, we did observe temporal segregation between the puma (Puma concolor), coyote (Canis latrans), and bobcat (Lynx rufus), with mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). There was little activity overlap between predators and livestock (Bos taurus, Equus caballus). However, to avoid conflict resulting from livestock predation we suggest increasing and improving surveillance, and that calves and females close to calving be sheltered.

Objectives: The objectives of the present study were to assess the diet components of E. lineatus and S. sierra, as well as to evaluate the niche width, trophic level, and trophic overlap between the two species, by size and season. Methods: Biological samples were obtained weekly from small-scale fishery catches in Bahia de Acapulco, Mexico. The E lineatus sampling period occurred from October 2016 to October 2017, whereas S. sierra was sampled from October 2016 to June 2018. The Prey-specific Index of Relative Importance (% PSIRI) was used to evaluate the importance of each prey item in the diet of the predator. Levin's index (B-i) was used as a measure of niche width. The Morisita-Horn index was used to evaluate diet overlap by size (juveniles or adults), by season (dry or wet), and between the two species. The trophic level (TL) of predators was calculated using the Cortes' method. Results: A total of 262 K. lineatus stomachs were analyzed (42 % were empty and 58 % contained food) and a total of 209 S. sierra stomachs were analyzed (74.6 % were empty and 25.3 % contained food). Of the total E. lineatus specimens sampled, 107 were juveniles and 155 were adults. Black skipjack juveniles fed on five food items and adults fed on 13 food items. Of the total S. sierra specimens sampled, 75 were juveniles and 134 were adults. Pacific sierra juveniles and adults fed on five food items. The diet of the two species comprised fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. The two species showed narrow niche width. The diet of juvenile and adult E. lineatus presented differences with growth, contrary to what was observed for juveniles and adults of S. sierra. There were no significant differences in diet by season for both species. The trophic overlap obtained between the two species was low. The trophic level calculated for both species indicated that are tertiary consumers. Conclusions: Black skipjack and Pacific sierra are tertiary predators and present a specialist behavior, feeding mainly on lish from the families Engraulidae and Clupeidae. Although a degree of similarity in the dietary food components of these species was observed, there was not a high degree of interspecific competition for food.","[Sandoval-Ramirez, Adriana] Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Ctr Ciencias Desarrollo Reg, Los Pinos S-N, Acapulco 39640, Guerrero, Mexico; [Cerdenares-Ladron de Guevara, Genoveva] Univ del Mar, Campus Puerto Angel Ciudad Univ, San Pedro Pochutla 70902, Oaxaca, Mexico; [Aucencio Rojas-Herrera, Agustin; Violante-Gonzalez, Juan; Garcia-Ibanez, Sergio] Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Fac Ecol Marina, Gran Via Trop 20, Acapulco 39390, Guerrero, Mexico; [Carlos Hernandez-Gomez, Juan] Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Unidad Acad Matemat, Carlos E Adame 54, Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico","Rojas-Herrera, AA (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Fac Ecol Marina, Gran Via Trop 20, Acapulco 39390, Guerrero, Mexico.",san_ramz@hotmail.com; gcerdenares@gmail.com; rojash56@hotmail.com; viojuang@yahoo.com.mx; sergariba@gmail.com; jcarloshg@gmail.com,,,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),The authors thank the fishermen who caught the fishes.

It is also acknowledged that biotic interactions can even have major effects on local population dynamics and scale-up to determine wider species' ranges (Wisz et al., 2013). Notwithstanding, the study of biotic interactions has been mostly ignored in biogeography and phylogeography research, for which it has been long assumed that abiotic factors (e.g. climate) mostly drive the ecological and evolutionary processes that underlie species' distribution. Consequently, our knowledge is scarce about the role of biotic interactions in determining spatial patterns of genetic diversity and structure. In a From the Cover article in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Ortego & Knowles (2020) address the study of positive and negative plant-plant interactions and test whether their demographic consequences translate into broadscale patterns of genomic variation in two oak species from the iconic California Floristic Province. The integrative approach undertaken in this study reveals that some models that incorporate competition or facilitation better explain genomic patterns than null models in which species respond only to variations in environmental suitability. These findings highlight the relevance of biologically informed model-based approaches for inferring the evolutionary consequences of species' range dynamics, which is of particular importance in today's global change context.","[Gracia Martinez, Eva Gracia] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Avda Univ Sn, Elche 03202, Spain","Martinez, EGG (corresponding author), Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Avda Univ Sn, Elche 03202, Spain.",egracia@umh.es,"Gracia, Eva/H-2270-2015","Gracia, Eva/0000-0003-0790-163X",Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [PID2019-105682RA-I00/AEI/10.13039/50110001103],"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: PID2019-105682RA-I00/AEI/10.13039/50110001103",,12,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Intraspecific and intraguild communication have received a lot of attention, especially among bee taxa. However, little is known about interspecific chemical communication in general and in non-bees in particular. Ants, such as Formica francoeuri, also are opportunistic floral visitors who seek the carbohydrate-rich rewards of flowers. Thus, these ants likely encounter aggressive competitors for nectar, such as bees. Here, we performed a series of experiments to examine how ant foragers respond to bee pheromones, venom and sting glands in the context of foraging. Understanding how ants utilize non-target chemical cues will identify previously cryptic interactions and provide new insights into the hidden mechanisms governing foraging decisions. As the foraging decisions by floral visitors have a direct impact on the pollination mutualism, studies such as this will help us build better predictive models of plant-pollinator networks and develop hypotheses as to how these interaction networks may change with shifts in the floral visitor community.","[Phan, P.

Human disturbance is rapidly altering the spatial and temporal niches of animals, but the impact of humans on resource consumption and partitioning-arguably the most important niche axis-is poorly understood. We assessed resource consumption and trophic niche partitioning as a function of human disturbance at the individual, population, and community levels using stable isotope analysis of 684 carnivores from seven communities in North America. We detected significant responses to human disturbance at all three levels of biological organization: individual carnivores consumed more human food subsidies in disturbed landscapes, leading to significant increases in trophic niche width and trophic niche overlap among species ranging from mesocarnivores to apex predators. Trophic niche partitioning is the primary mechanism regulating coexistence in many communities, and our results indicate that humans fundamentally alter resource niches and competitive interactions among terrestrial consumers. Among carnivores, niche overlap can trigger interspecific competition and intraguild predation, while the consumption of human foods significantly increases human-carnivore conflict. Our results suggest that human disturbances, especially in the form of food subsidies, may threaten carnivores by increasing the probability of both interspecific competition and human-carnivore conflict. Ultimately, these findings illustrate a potential decoupling of predator-prey dynamics, with impacts likely cascading to populations, communities, and ecosystems.","[Manlick, Philip J.; Pauli, Jonathan N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Manlick, Philip J.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Manlick, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.; Manlick, PJ (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",pmanlick@unm.edu,,"Manlick, Philip/0000-0001-9143-9446","NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) Grant [DGE-1144752]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, USDA Hatch Projects [1006604, 1003605]; University of Wisconsin Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology; American Society of Mammalogists; American Museum of Natural History; National Park Service","We thank the many biologists who helped provide samples for this project, including J.

However, the actual threat posed by the introduced cichlids cannot be assessed without data on the local feeding habits of all three species. This paper describes the diet of O. hunteri and both introduced species, focusing on seasonal changes in food-source availability. Microscopic analysis of gut content in 35 fishes collected over a 20-month period was compared with the composition of littoral food sources and seasonal variation in the limnetic phytoplankton and complemented with exploratory stable-isotope analysis of fish tissue. We found that all three tilapiines in Lake Chala are herbivorous, and during most of the year, they feed on algae and organic detritus on and between rocks in the littoral zone. However, in July-September they migrate to open water to feed on blooming phytoplankton. Interspecific differences in gut content and stable-isotope composition suggest that O. hunteri may have a competitive advantage over the two newcomers by making better use of this seasonal extra food resource. However, this advantage may erode when continuing climate change starts affecting the bloom's predictability.","[Dieleman, Jorunn; Cocquyt, Christine; Verschuren, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Limnol Unit, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Cocquyt, Christine] Meise Bot Garden, Nieuwelaan 38, B-1860 Meise, Belgium; [Nyingi, Wanja Dorothy] Natl Museums Kenya, Dept Zool, Ichthyol Sect, POB 40658-00100, Nairobi, Kenya","Verschuren, D (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Limnol Unit, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",dirk.verschuren@UGent.be,,"Cocquyt, Christine/0000-0002-0047-4180; Verschuren, Dirk/0000-0002-9116-5446",Ghent UniversityGhent University [A14/TT/0923]; National Museums of Kenya (NMK) [A14/TT/0923]; Ghent University Special Research Fund through Collaborative Research Activity 'DeepCHALLA'; Belgian Science Policy Brain-be project [BR/121/A2 PAMEXEA],"This study was carried out under Memorandum of Understanding A14/TT/0923 between Ghent University and the National Museums of Kenya (NMK), and the institutional affiliation of DV with NMK.

Socio-ecological factors are likely to influence social complexity, but no attempt has been made to explain the differentiation of social relationships using multiple socio-ecological factors. Here, we propose a conceptual framework based on four components underlying multiple socio-ecological factors that influence the differentiation of social relationships: the extent of within-group contest competition to access resources, the extent to which individuals differ in their ability to provide a variety of services, the need for group-level cooperation and the constraints on social interactions. We use the framework to make predictions about the degree of relationship differentiation that can be expected within a group according to the cumulative contribution of multiple socio-ecological factors to each of the four components. The framework has broad applicability, since the four components are likely to be relevant to a wide range of animal taxa and to additional socio-ecological factors not explicitly dealt with here. Hence, the framework can be used as the basis for the development of novel and testable hypotheses about intra- and interspecific differences in relationship differentiation and social complexity.","[Moscovice, Liza R.] Leibniz Inst Farm Anim Biol, Inst Behav Physiol, Dummerstorf, Germany; [Sueur, Cedric] Univ Strasbourg, Dept Ecol Physiol & Ethol, CNRS, IPHC,UMR 7178, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Sueur, Cedric] Inst Univ France, Paris, France; [Aureli, Filippo] Univ Veracruzana, Inst Neuroetol, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Aureli, Filippo] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","Aureli, F (corresponding author), Univ Veracruzana, Inst Neuroetol, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico.; Aureli, F (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",faureli@uv.mx,"; Sueur, Cedric/A-4020-2011","Aureli, Filippo/0000-0002-0671-013X; Sueur, Cedric/0000-0001-8206-2739","Leibniz Science Campus Primate Cognition at the Leibniz Institute for Primate Research; University of Gottingen, Germany","We would like to thank Oliver Schulke, Julia Ostner and Gabriele Schino for insightful comments on an early draft.

An ecological model for the community was developed by means of interspecific relationship including competition and predation to calculate the APDP. As a case study, we reported here the ecotoxicological effects of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) collected from Bohai oil field on densities of two algae, Platymonas subcordiformis and Isochrysis galbana, a rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, and of a cladocera, Penilia avirostris, in single species and a microcosm experiment Time scales expressing toxic effect increased with increasing levels of toxic effect from molecule to community. Remarkable periodic changes in densities were found during the tests in microcosm experiment, revealing a strong species reaction. The minimum time scale characterizing toxic effect at a community level should be the common cycle of population densities of the microcosm. In addition, the cycles of plankton densities shortened in general with increasing PHC, showing an evident toxic effect on the microcosm. Using APDP as the endpoint, a threshold concentration for the modeled microcosm was calculated to be 0.404 mg-PHC-1. The APDP was found to be more sensitive and reliable than the standing crops of populations as the endpoint This indicated that the APDP, an endpoint at the community level, could be quantitatively related to the endpoints at the population level, and led to the quantitative concentration-toxic effect relationship at the community level.","[Wang, Changyou; Wang, Siwen; Luo, Zhuhua; Mao, Longjiang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Xinming] Jiangsu Environm Monitoring Ctr, Nanjing 210036, Peoples R China; [Yang, Bin] Beibu Gulf Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Marine Disaster Beibu Gulf, Qinzhou 535011, Peoples R China; [Liang, Shengkang] Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Marine Chem Theory & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China","Wang, CY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",chy.w@hotmail.com,,,Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2020r028]; National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC1402101]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This study was supported by the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST (Project No. 2020r028), the National Key Research and Development Program (Project No. 2016YFC1402101), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,83,0,0,5,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-6513,1090-2414,,ECOTOX ENVIRON SAFE,Ecotox.

Using a multipronged approach to gain new insights into D. pigrum function, we observed phenotypic interactions and predictions of genomic capacity that support the idea of a role for microbe-microbe interactions involving D. pigrum in shaping the composition of human nasal microbiota. We identified in vivo community-level and in vitro phenotypic cooperation by specific nasal Corynebacterium species. Also, D. pigrum inhibited S. aureus growth in vitro, whereas robust inhibition of S. pneumoniae required both D. pigrum and a nasal Corynebacterium together. D. pigrum L-lactic acid production was insufficient to account for these inhibitions. Genomic analysis of 11 strains revealed that D. pigrum has a small genome (average 1.86 Mb) and multiple predicted auxotrophies consistent with D. pigrum relying on its human host and on cocolonizing bacteria for key nutrients. Further, the accessory genome of D. pigrum harbored a diverse repertoire of biosynthetic gene clusters, some of which may have a role in microbe-microbe interactions. These new insights into D. pigrum's functions advance the field from compositional analysis to genomic and phenotypic experimentation on a potentially beneficial bacterial resident of the human upper respiratory tract and lay the foundation for future animal and clinical experiments. IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans. For both, nasal colonization is a risk factor for infection. Studies of nasal microbiota identify Dolosigranulum pigrum as a benign bacterium present when adults are free of S. aureus or when children are free of S. pneumoniae. Here, we validated these in vivo associations with functional assays. We found that D. pigrum inhibited S. aureus in vitro and, together with a specific nasal Corynebacterium species, also inhibited S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, genomic analysis of D. pigrum indicated that it must obtain key nutrients from other nasal bacteria or from humans. These phenotypic interactions support the idea of a role for microbe-microbe interactions in shaping the composition of human nasal microbiota and implicate D. pigrum as a mutualist of humans. These findings support the feasibility of future development of microbe-targeted interventions to reshape nasal microbiota composition to exclude S. aureus and/or S. pneumoniae.","[Brugger, Silvio D.] Univ Zurich, Univ Hosp Zurich, Dept Infect Dis & Hosp Epidemiol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Brugger, Silvio D.; Eslami, Sara M.; Escapa, Isabel F.; Lemon, Katherine P.] Forsyth Inst Microbiol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Brugger, Silvio D.; Escapa, Isabel F.] Harvard Sch Dent Med, Dept Oral Med Infect & Immun, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pettigrew, Melinda M.] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, New Haven, CT USA; [Escapa, Isabel F.; Lemon, Katherine P.] Baylor Coll Med, Alkek Ctr Metagen & Microbiome Res, Dept Mol Virol & Microbiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Henke, Matthew T.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kong, Yong] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT USA; [Kong, Yong] Yale Univ, WM Keck Fdn Biotechnol Resource Lab, New Haven, CT USA; [Lemon, Katherine P.] Harvard Med Sch, Div Infect Dis, Boston Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lemon, Katherine P.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Sect Infect Dis, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lemon, Katherine P.] Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Brugger, SD (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Univ Hosp Zurich, Dept Infect Dis & Hosp Epidemiol, Zurich, Switzerland.; Brugger, SD; Lemon, KP (corresponding author), Forsyth Inst Microbiol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.; Brugger, SD (corresponding author), Harvard Sch Dent Med, Dept Oral Med Infect & Immun, Boston, MA 02115 USA.; Lemon, KP (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Alkek Ctr Metagen & Microbiome Res, Dept Mol Virol & Microbiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.; Lemon, KP (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Div Infect Dis, Boston Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA.; Lemon, KP (corresponding author), Texas Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Sect Infect Dis, Houston, TX 77030 USA.; Lemon, KP (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",silvio.brugger@usz.ch; katherine.lemon@bcm.edu,,"Lemon, Katherine/0000-0003-1542-1679; F.

Long-term productivity stability in plant communities is often associated with greater species, phylogenetic or functional diversity, more complex size and age structures, or higher asynchrony in species fluctuations (compensatory dynamics), all potentially increasing community resistance to perturbations. However, the relative importance of these stabilizing pathways is still poorly understood, especially in old-growth species-rich forests. Here we explore how compensatory dynamics and multiple facets of diversity underpin temporal stability of wood biomass production over forty years in a Japanese temperate forest, based on more than 45 500 stem increments from 15 species. Whereas the effect of species richness and phylogenetic diversity was small, the old-growth structural attributes markedly increased community stability via increased asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring species. Greater standing tree volume, stem density and interspecific variation in growth rates enhanced productivity stability both directly and indirectly via increased asynchrony. This corroborates the predictions of increased compensatory dynamics with increased asymmetric competition for light in a more productive environment. Asymmetric competition in old-growth patches, between dominant oaks and sub-canopy shade-tolerant firs and maples, is a major driver of productivity stability over time via compensatory dynamics. Overall productivity remains relatively constant in old-growth patches, as abundant firs and maples in the lower canopy layers compensate for biomass losses in canopy oaks caused by aging, wind and snow disturbances. Younger forest patches, composed of fast-growing, shade-intolerant species, had a lower stability of productivity, with reduced stem basal area and tree density due to higher understory bamboo coverage preventing tree regeneration and growth. We provide new insights into mechanisms underlying the stability of ecosystem functioning in diverse forest ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of preserving and supporting old-growth forests and their structural complexity.","[Dolezal, Jiri; Fibich, Pavel; Altman, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Dolezal, Jiri; Fibich, Pavel; Leps, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Uemura, Shigeru] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Forest Res Stn, Nayoro, Hokkaido, Japan; [Takahashi, Koichi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Hara, Toshihiko] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","Dolezal, J (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.; Dolezal, J (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",jiriddolezal@gmail.com,"Altman, Jan/B-4305-2015; Fibich, Pavel/B-3013-2015; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013","Fibich, Pavel/0000-0001-9066-3753; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051","Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-19376S, 17-07378S, 20-05840Y]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]; Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship","The study was funded by the Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University and by Czech Science Foundation (grants 17-19376S, 17-07378S and 20-05840Y), Czech Academy of Sciences (RVO 67985939) and Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship.",,65,4,4,20,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2020,129,11,,,,,1692,1703,,10.1111/oik.07379,,AUG 2020,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OM5SL,WOS:000555270000001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Although intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in movement behaviors is pervasive, its consequences for ecological community dynamics are still not fully understood. Using a newly developed individual-based model, we analyzed how given and constant ITVs in foraging movement affect differences in foraging efficiencies between species competing for common resources under various resource distributions. Further, we analyzed how the effect of ITV on emerging differences in competitive abilities ultimately affects species coexistence. The model is generic but mimics observed patterns of among-individual covariation between personality, movement and space use in ground-dwelling rodents. Interacting species differed in their mean behavioral types along a slow-fast continuum, integrating consistent individual variation in average behavioral expression and responsiveness (i.e. behavioral reaction norms). We found that ITV reduced interspecific differences in competitive abilities by 5-35% and thereby promoted coexistence via an equalizing mechanism. The emergent relationships between behavioral types and foraging efficiency are characteristic for specific environmental contexts of resource distribution and population density. As these relationships are asymmetric, species that were either 'too fast' or 'too slow' benefited differently from ITV. Thus, ITV in movement behavior has consequences for species coexistence but to predict its effect in a given system requires intimate knowledge on how variation in movement traits relates to fitness components along an environmental gradient.","[Milles, Alexander] Univ Potsdam, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, Muhlenberg 3, DE-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Milles, Alexander; Grimm, Volker] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Leipzig, Germany; [Dammhahn, Melanie] Univ Potsdam, Anim Ecol, Potsdam, Germany; [Dammhahn, Melanie] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany","Grimm, V (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Leipzig, Germany.",volker.grimm@ufz.de,"Dammhahn, Melanie/AAD-5479-2019; Milles, Alexander/AAZ-4653-2020","Milles, Alexander/0000-0001-7603-1899; Grimm, Volker/0000-0002-3221-9512",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG-GRK 2118/1],This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the framework of the BioMove Research Training Group (DFG-GRK 2118/1).,,68,2,2,3,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2020,129,10,,,,,1441,1454,,10.1111/oik.07431,,JUL 2020,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NU9ES,WOS:000546174900001,,hybrid,,,2021-09-21,

Aggregation frequently increases competition for food, and interspecific differences in female sociality among mammals are commonly attributed to contrasts in ecological parameters, including variation in activity timing, the distribution of resources, as well as the risk of predation. However, there is increasing indication that differences in female sociality are also associated with phylogenetic relationships and with contrasts in life-history parameters. We show here that evolutionary transitions from systems where breeding females usually occupy separate ranges (singular breeding) to systems where breeding females usually aggregate (plural breeding) have occurred more frequently in monotocous lineages where females produce single young than in polytocous ones where they produce litters. A likely explanation of this association is that competition between breeding females for resources is reduced where they produce single young and is more intense where they produce litters. Our findings reinforce evidence that variation in life-history parameters plays an important role in shaping the evolution of social behavior.","[Lukas, Dieter; Clutton-Brock, Tim] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Lukas, Dieter] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Behav Ecol & Culture, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Lukas, D (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.; Lukas, D (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Behav Ecol & Culture, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",dieter_lukas@eva.mpg.de,,"Lukas, Dieter/0000-0002-7141-3545",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [294494THCB2011],This work was supported by the European Research Council (grant 294494THCB2011).,,89,2,2,1,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

In bird species, nonbreeders often move through large areas whereby periods of long-term settlement can alternate with short-term visits. In food-caching species these differences in the degree of local settlement might change the benefits gained from storing food, and caching may only be advantageous during periods of prolonged settlement. We examined whether differences in local settlement influence food-caching behaviour of wild common ravens at a local anthropogenic food source with high interspecific and intraspecific competition. We found that individuals with a higher degree of site fidelity (i.e. prolonged periods of local settlement) engaged in food caching more than individuals with less site fidelity (i.e. short periods of local settlement); this effect was even stronger in the presence of potential predators representing a high-risk foraging situation. Further, juvenile ravens were less likely to cache than subadults and adults, and an increasing number of conspecifics present at the feeding site decreased the likelihood of caching. We found considerable individual variation in respect to the area used for caching. We suggest that individuals with higher site fidelity may gain more benefits from caching food and/or that they are more successful in obtaining food potentially due to more experience with the local foraging situation. Research is needed to examine the exact causes of the observed link between food-caching behaviour and the different degrees of site fidelity. Our findings show that differences in movement and settlement decisions can influence ecological aspects such as food acquisition and thus may have important consequences for individual fitness and population dynamics.

However, mixing effects on drought responses vary substantially with site conditions and species identity. We combined annually resolved tree-ring data and repeated forest inventory data spanning the last 90 years to examine the effect of species-specific neighbourhood competition on the drought response (resistance, recovery and resilience) of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) for six drought events that occurred since the 1970s at three sites in Switzerland. We found predominantly weak neighbourhood competition and tree species diversity effects, with significant interspecific influences only for resistance and recovery of beech. These minor neighbourhood effects were outweighed by tree age and size effects. Although age effects depended on species identity and components of resilience, tree size consistently negatively affected all species. Our results emphasize that diversity effects may vary for each given species combination which makes broader conclusions challenging. This is because species interact through their specific set of traits and interactions vary in space and time. Adaptive management strategies are likely to be more effective when they promote more drought-tolerant species and reductions in stand density. Despite the absence of an unequivocal advantage of tree diversity on drought resilience, striving towards species-rich forests nonetheless allows for a risk spreading among multiple species and the reinforced provision of numerous ecosystem services.","[Gillerot, Loic; Levesque, Mathieu] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Forest Management Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Forrester, David I.; Bottero, Alessandra; Rigling, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Forrester, David I.; Bottero, Alessandra; Rigling, Andreas] SwissForestLab, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Rigling, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Zurich, Switzerland","Gillerot, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Forest Management Grp, Zurich, Switzerland.",loic.gillerot@hotmail.com,"Bottero, Alessandra/AAR-8459-2021; Levesque, Mathieu/K-1681-2013","Bottero, Alessandra/0000-0002-0410-2675; Levesque, Mathieu/0000-0003-0273-510X",,,,113,4,4,3,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,JAN,2021,24,1,,,,,20,36,,10.1007/s10021-020-00501-y,,APR 2020,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QL3RQ,WOS:000527527500001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Recent ecological theory posits that biodiversity is sustained by a combination of species differences reducing interspecific competition and species similarities increasing time to competitive exclusion. Together, these mechanisms counterintuitively predict that competing species should cluster by traits, in contrast with traditional expectations of trait overdispersion. Here, we show for the first time that trees in a tropical forest exhibit a clustering pattern. In a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, species abundances exhibit clusters in two traits connected to light capture strategy, suggesting that competition for light structures community composition. Notably, we find four clusters by maximum height, quantitatively supporting the classical grouping of Neotropical woody plants into shrubs, understory, midstory, and canopy layers.","[D'Andrea, Rafael; Guittar, John; Figueroa, Hector; Ostling, Annette] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1105 North Univ Ave,Biol Sci Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [D'Andrea, Rafael; O'Dwyer, James P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 265 Morrill Hall,MC-116,505 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Guittar, John] Michigan State Univ, Dep Plant Biol, Plant Biol Labs, 612 Wilson Rd,Rm 166, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wright, S.

Modern coexistence theory (MCT) has been widely adopted as a framework to investigate the tolerance to perturbations in relative reductions of per capita growth rates, often using metrics that explicitly eliminate the independent role of intrinsic growth rates. More recently, the structural approach (SA) was introduced to investigate the tolerance of communities to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates as a function of the strength of intraspecific and interspecific competition. Because the external perturbations are likely to happen in both intrinsic growth rates and competition strengths, no framework alone can fully disentangle the effects of external perturbations. Here we combine MCT and SA to disentangle the tolerance in coexistence and priority effects of a pair of competing species when subject to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates and competition strengths. Through this combination, we reveal the emergence of a key trade-off: increasing the tolerance to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates typically decreases the tolerance in competition strengths, and vice versa. Furthermore, this trade-off is stronger under coexistence than under priority effects. We test this combined framework on competing pairs of 18 California annual plant species. For both coexistence and priority effects, we find that the tolerance to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates is maximized instead of that to perturbations in competition strengths in the studied annual plant communities. Synthesis. Our combined framework of modern coexistence theory and structural approach illustrates that it is possible to disentangle the impact of different external perturbations on the persistence of species. Importantly, our findings show that species interactions may reveal whether communities are dominated either by changes in intrinsic growth rates or by competition strengths. Overall, this combined framework can open a new perspective to understand and predict the response of populations to changing environmental conditions.","[Song, Chuliang; Saavedra, Serguei] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rohr, Rudolf P.] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol Ecol & Evolut, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Vasseur, David] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT USA","Song, CL (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",clsong@mit.edu,"Song, Chuliang/J-3231-2019","Song, Chuliang/0000-0001-7490-8626; Vasseur, David/0000-0003-1706-9613",MITSUI Chair; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [31003A_182386]; NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1754012],"We thank Tadashi Fukami, Tess Grainger and Jonathan Levine for insightful discussions.

To test potential influential factors, we focused on the last twenty years, i.e. a period with ocean warming, a transient but significant drop in zooplankton biomass, and accelerating interspecific competition resulting from primarily Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) entering these high-latitude waters in large quantities, the new mackerel era in the Nordic Seas. Adult NSSH concurrently allocated relatively less to growth in length than weight resulting in higher body condition. Growth likely decreased in warmer waters under stiff prey competition to support reproductive costs. Condition and reproductive responses were not only immediate but were also lagged by three seasons, corresponding to the period when new oocytes are produced. Furthermore, fecundity increased in warmer waters while egg size dropped. Hence, fine-tuned trade-off mechanisms were apparent and varied. We demonstrate that evaluations of reproductive trade-offs based on pooled data are misleading; poor- and good-condition NSSH followed different reproductive trajectories. These findings emphasize difficult-to-predict trends in life-history traits should be tracked longitudinally by the individuals and their aggregate cohort, as they are linked to complex overarching environmental phenomena, like ecosystem carrying capacity and climate fluctuations.","[Schmidt, Thassya C. dos Santos; Devine, Jennifer A.; Slotte, Aril; Claireaux, Marion; Kjesbu, Olav Sigurd] Inst Marine Res, POB 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Schmidt, Thassya C. dos Santos; Claireaux, Marion; Johannessen, Arne; Enberg, Katja] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, POB 7803, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Oskarsson, Gudmundur J.; Kennedy, James] Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, Skulagata 4,POB 1390, IS-121 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Kennedy, James] Biopol, IS-545 Skagastrond, Iceland; [Kurita, Yutaka] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Tohoku Natl Fisheries Res Inst, 3-27-5 Shinhama, Shiogama, Miyagi 9850001, Japan; [Devine, Jennifer A.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd NIWA, 217 Akersten St, Port Nelson 7010, Nelson, New Zealand","Schmidt, TCD (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, POB 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.",thassya@hi.no; Jennifer.Devine@niwa.co.nz; aril.slotte@hi.no; marion.claireaux@gmail.com; Arne.Johannessen@uib.no; Katja.Enberg@uib.no; gjos@hafogvatn.is; james.kennedy@hafogvatn.is; kurita@affrc.go.jp; olav.kjesbu@hi.no,"Enberg, Katja/C-8630-2009; Schmidt, Thassya Christina dos Santos/AAE-4974-2019","Enberg, Katja/0000-0002-0045-7604; Schmidt, Thassya Christina dos Santos/0000-0002-6803-7681","National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), BrazilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [240467/2012-4]; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [243735]; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries/IMR, Norway [14861]","The authors are thankful to Kjell Arne Mork for providing qualityassured temperature data, and the technical staff at the Pelagic Research Group for herring field sampling and processing.

However, due to the uncertainty and complexity, it is difficult to assess the food web health and apply them to ecosystem management. In this research, we established a TIO-IS (Total-input-output-interaction strength analysis) method to assess food web health, combining topology and interspecific interaction. In detail, we selected eight three-species modules containing six types of interspecific interaction and 64 four-species modules to evaluate food-web health (FWH). Furthermore, we used ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) analysis to test correlation between network complexity and interspecific interaction. This work will enhance the traditional methods in terms of (a) constructing a systematic and integrative indicators system to assess food web health; (b) analyzing community stability under different topology structures; (c) coding different types species in aquatic ecosystem. As the results, omnivory and trophic cascade had higher FWH than other interactions. By ranking, we got the health degree of the interaction of these six species respectively: omnivory, trophic cascade, multi-predators, exploitive competition, interguild predator and loop. The occurrence frequency of interaction relationship were respectively 0.88, 0.84, 0.68, 0.52, 0.12, 0. Additionally, about 16% of network structures have been shaping the uniform pattern for each species node. It is concluded that the health food web should be satisfied with three primary conditions: a) there exist multiple component types (i.e. species with multiple trophic levels); b) it is with high probability that there have coexistence with omnivory and trophic cascade relationship for sub-module types (the weak interaction swamping hypothesis); c) it is likely that some nodes shape high connectivity, which lead to the inhomogeneous distribution of connectivity in a web (keystone species hypothesis). This research will improve the development of ecosystem management, provide an indicator to evaluate aquatic ecosystem, and conducive to realize manual design of food web.","[Xu, Yan; Peng, Jianfeng; Qu, Jiuhui] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Water & Ecol, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yan; Cai, Yanpeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Cai, Yanpeng] Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainable Communities, 120,2 Res Dr, Regina, SK S4S 7H9, Canada; [Yang, Zhifeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Watershed Environm Restorat, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xin] Xian Univ Architectural & Technol, Sch Environm & Municipal Engn, Shannxi 710055, Peoples R China","Peng, JF (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Water & Ecol, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",pjf1995@163.com,"Sun, Xin/A-3792-2012","Sun, Xin/0000-0003-4737-9452","Enterprise Service Projects of China [20182001499]; Beijing Science and Technology Foundation [20181090497]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41907403, 31900281]; General Environmental Planning of Chenghai, Yunnann Province, China","This research was supported by the Enterprise Service Projects of China (20182001499), was supported by the Beijing Science and Technology Foundation (No. 20181090497), was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41907403, 31900281), and was supported by the General Environmental Planning of Chenghai, Yunnann Province, China.",,70,1,2,7,59,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

However, vegetation structure may also drive diversity patterns, especially for tree-dwelling species, via its effects on microhabitat use and competitive interactions. Here we investigate these effects on the diversity and community structure of tree-nesting ants over elevation. We exhaustively sampled ant nests in 1254 trees within continuous plots of primary rainforest at low (200 m a.s.l.), mid (900 m a.s.l.) and high (1800 m a.s.l.) elevation in Papua New Guinea. Ant diversity, nest abundance and tree occupancy peaked at mid-elevation. Although host tree diversity also peaked at mid-elevation, there was low specialisation of ant species to tree species at all elevations. Mid-elevation trees hosted more species, more nests and a greater diversity of nest types than trees of a similar size at low or high elevation. Tree size and nest microhabitat use were the strongest predictors of species composition, explaining twice as much of the variability in the communities than elevation. At mid to high elevation there were proportionally fewer large nests than in the lowlands, with an increase in smaller nests in live hollow twigs and epiphytes. There was high species turnover between elevations, and between trees within elevations. Species co-occurrence patterns within trees differed with tree size, and with elevation. In large trees species tended to co-occur at random at low and high elevation, but co-occurred more often than expected by chance at mid elevation, indicating an elevational shift in competitive interactions. We conclude that the more extreme diurnal temperatures at higher elevations, combined with increased epiphyte availability, drive ants to nest in more insulated microhabitats. This results in smaller colony sizes and a decrease in interspecific competition, thereby boosting species co-existence at mid elevation.","[Plowman, Nichola S.; Mottl, Ondrej; Novotny, Vojtech; Klimes, Petr] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Biol Ctr, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Plowman, Nichola S.; Mottl, Ondrej; Novotny, Vojtech] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Idigel, Cliffson; Philip, Frank Jurgen; Rimandai, Maling] New Guinea Binatang Res Ctr, Madang, Papua N Guinea","Plowman, NS (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Biol Ctr, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",nichola.plowman@gmail.com,"Klimes, Petr/G-6823-2014; Novotny, Vojtech/G-9434-2014; Mottl, Ondrej/AAC-7606-2019","Klimes, Petr/0000-0002-6561-4455; Novotny, Vojtech/0000-0001-7918-8023; Mottl, Ondrej/0000-0002-9796-5081","European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [669609]; GACR EXPRO [19-28126X]; Czech Science Foundation Center for Tropical Biology [14-36098G]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [FNRS-17-04]; Grant Agency of Univ. of South Bohemia [GAJU 152/2016/P, 038/2019/P]","This project was supported by European Research Council (Project no. 669609), GACR EXPRO (project 19-28126X), Czech Science Foundation Center for Tropical Biology (14-36098G), Czech Academy of Sciences (FNRS-17-04) and the Grant Agency of Univ. of South Bohemia (GAJU 152/2016/P, 038/2019/P).",,62,7,7,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,MAR,2020,43,3,,,,,431,442,,10.1111/ecog.04730,,NOV 2019,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KQ8KV,WOS:000502130900001,,hybrid,,,2021-09-21,

In this study, we tested predictions of these three hypotheses regarding territories of 19 packs of endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) over 2 years in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. If territory size was supported by the RDH, then we would observe (1) wild dog territories would be larger when resource patches were more dispersed, (2) pack sizes would be larger when resource patches were rich, and (3) pack size would not affect territory size. If supported by the IPH, then we would observe (4) larger territories would experience less intrusions, and (5) there would be an increase in territory overlap in areas of low resource dispersion. Finally, if supported by the IGPH, we would observe (6) territories would be larger in areas of higher lion (Panthera leo) density, as evidence of a spatial avoidance strategy. We found that the IGPH was fully supported (6), the IPH half supported (5), and the RDH partially supported (1 and 3), where we found spatial partitioning of wild dogs with lions, potentially mediated by resources and territory overlap with conspecifics. Ultimately, our results show that subordinate carnivores must balance a trade-off between dominant interspecific competitors and conspecifics to successfully coexist in areas with dominant carnivores.","[Marneweck, C.; Parker, D.

We further tested (1) the contrasting predictions of resource competition theory vs. the benthic model of coexistence on how the number of added nutrients constrains species richness, (2) the relationship between species richness and evenness, and (3) the biodiversity-ecosystem-function paradigm. Implementing a combination of field and lab experiments that manipulated for the first time in benthic algae herbivory and/or niche dimensionality, i.e., the number of added nutrients (NAN), including nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and manganese, we made the following discoveries. First, important predictors of guild composition were herbivory (field) and NAN (lab); of richness, NAN (field) and NAN and guild composition (lab); of evenness, guild composition (field and lab) and herbivory (field); and of biomass, guild composition, NAN, and richness + evenness (field and lab). Herbivory increased the proportions of the low profile and motile guilds but decreased the proportion of the high profile guild. In the absence of grazing, greater proportions of the high profile guild resulted in elevated richness and biomass but diminished evenness, whereas in the presence of grazing, these relationships generally disappeared. Second, both experiments confirmed the prediction of the benthic model that species richness increases with NAN, a pattern inconsistent with resource competition theory. Third, supplementation with manganese and/or iron increased algal richness, indicating that micronutrients, which have generally been overlooked in stream ecology, added dimensions to the algal niche. Fourth, the richness-evenness relationship, observed only in the absence of herbivory, depended on the size of the species pool. It was positive at richness lower than 49 species (lab), implying complementarity and facilitation, while at higher richness (field and lab), this relationship was negative, consistent with negative interspecific interactions. Finally, the greater dependence of biomass production on guild composition and NAN than on richness and evenness suggests that more comprehensive, environmentally explicit, and trait-based approaches are necessary for the study of the biodiversity-ecosystem-function paradigm.","[Passy, Sophia, I] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, 501 S Nedderman Dr, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Larson, Chad A.] Washington State Dept Ecol, Environm Assessment Program, 300 Desmond Dr SE, Lacey, WA 98503, Australia","Passy, SI (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, 501 S Nedderman Dr, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",sophia.passy@uta.edu,"Passy, Sophia I./I-1449-2019","Larson, Chad/0000-0002-0329-8979",,,,63,8,8,6,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2019,100,11,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.2831,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JK2WQ,WOS:000494707600017,31323142,,,,2021-09-21,

EPPs are widely used in plant community studies focused on negative density-dependence (NDD) to quantify competitive interactions. Because of the nature of the bias, conspecific NDD is often overestimated in recruitment analyses, and in some cases, can be erroneously detected when absent. In contrast, for survival analyses, EPPs typically cause NDD to be underestimated, but underestimation is more severe for abundant species and for heterospecific effects, thereby generating spurious negative relationships between the strength of NDD and the abundances of con- and heterospecifics. This can explain why many studies observed rare species to suffer more severely from conspecific NDD, and heterospecific effects to be disproportionally smaller than conspecific effects. In general, such species-dependent bias is often related to traits associated with likely mechanisms of NDD, which creates false patterns and complicates the ecological interpretation of the analyses. Classic examples taken from literature and simulations demonstrate that this bias has been pervasive, which calls into question the emerging paradigm that intraspecific competition has been demonstrated by direct field measurements to be generally stronger than interspecific competition.","[Detto, Matteo; Visser, Marco D.; Pacala, Stephen W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Detto, Matteo; Wright, S.

The classic theory predicts that stable co-occurrence of competitive species requires niche differentiation. In fact, the co-occurring species are often differentiated from each other. However, the neutral theory assuming equivalence of the reproductive rate of all individuals regardless of the species in a biological community has successfully recreated the observed patterns of species abundance distribution. This success is based on the unrealistic assumption suggesting that some mechanisms eliminate interspecific differences in the reproductive rates. Here, I present sexual selection as a candidate of the mechanisms by constructing analytical and simulation models. Sexual selection affects the traits that increase mating success even at the expense of fecundity when the species is abundant. By contrast, when the species is at a relatively low density, this negative effect on fecundity is mitigated because less competition for mating occurs in the rare species. The analytical model of this effect on fecundity predicted that sexual organisms stop population growth before exhausting resources due to the effect. This prediction was confirmed by simulation models. The simulations also showed that hundreds of competitive species with interspecific differences in reproductive potential can coexist over 10,000 generations. Moreover, species abundance distributions obtained from the simulations were similar to the patterns observed in field data. Given the generality of sexual reproduction in nature, sexual selection is likely to play a significant role in sustaining biodiversity over a broad range of environments. Synthesis. Evolution does not always maximize population growth rate. This study shows that evolution of sexual selection controls the population growth rate according to density and stabilizes the population size. This stabilizing effect has a potential to rescue endangered species from extinction, prevent overgrowth of common species, promote coexistence of competitive species, and successfully recreate the observed patterns of species abundance distribution.","[Kobayashi, Kazuya] Kyoto Univ, Hokkaido Forest Res Stn, Field Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Kyoto, Hokkaido, Japan","Kobayashi, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Hokkaido Forest Res Stn, Field Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Kyoto, Hokkaido, Japan.",kobakaz@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"kobayashi, kazuya/J-5507-2013","kobayashi, kazuya/0000-0002-9475-6807","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17H05048]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant/Award Number: 17H05048",,31,6,6,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

How these changes affect microbial community properties is an open question. We address this question using a two-species consortium in which species interactions change from exploitation to competition depending on the carbon source provided. We built a mathematical model and calibrated it using single-species growth measurements. This model predicted that low frequencies of change between carbon sources lead to species loss, while intermediate and high frequencies of change maintained both species. We experimentally confirmed these predictions by growing co-cultures in fluctuating environments. These findings complement more established concepts of a diversity peak at intermediate disturbance frequencies. They also provide a mechanistic understanding for how the dynamics at the community level emerges from single-species behaviours and interspecific interactions. Our findings suggest that changes in species interactions can profoundly impact the ecological dynamics and properties of microbial systems.","[Rodriguez-Verdugo, Alejandra; Vulin, Clement; Ackermann, Martin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rodriguez-Verdugo, Alejandra; Vulin, Clement; Ackermann, Martin] Eawag, Dept Environm Microbiol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Rodriguez-Verdugo, Alejandra] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Adaptat Changing Environm, Zurich, Switzerland","Rodriguez-Verdugo, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.; Rodriguez-Verdugo, A (corresponding author), Eawag, Dept Environm Microbiol, Dubendorf, Switzerland.; Rodriguez-Verdugo, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Adaptat Changing Environm, Zurich, Switzerland.",alejanr1@uci.edu,"Ackermann, Martin/V-4554-2017","Ackermann, Martin/0000-0003-0087-4819; Vulin, Clement/0000-0003-3914-0708",Swiss National FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); European Molecular Biological Organization (EMBO) long-term postdoctoral fellowship [ALTF 241-2015]; Adaptation to a Changing environment (ACE) postdoctoral fellowship; CASCADE fellowship [PCOFUND-GA-2012-600181]; Eawag; ETHETH Zurich,"We thank SOren Molin and Sunje Johanna Pamp for providing the strains.

Baseline data on current interactions are needed to improve predictions regarding future changes associated with global warming. Ringed seals Pusa hispida and bearded seals Erignathus barbatus are Arctic species that co-occur across much of this region. In this study, both species were equipped with GPS Argos CTD satellite relay data loggers in Svalbard, Norway, to investigate spatial overlap and species-specific behaviour (2011-2013). Ringed seals spent most of their time near tidal glacial fronts, whereas bearded seals were distributed in shallow, coastal areas; surfacing locations and haul-out events of ringed seals occurred closer to tidal glacier fronts. Thus, spatial overlap was limited between these species, occurring principally in shallow areas near tidal glacier fronts. Ringed seals generally had smaller home ranges, spent less time diving, had shorter dive durations, shorter surface durations between dives, spent a smaller proportion of their dive time in the bottom phase of dives and used different depths for foraging (deeper in autumn and shallower in spring) than bearded seals. Bearded seals dived into Transformed Atlantic Water in the winter, whereas ringed seals occupied Arctic Water masses during this time. Interspecific competition between these species is likely low currently, as they forage in different areas. Future changes in the Arctic may lead to changes in abundance, distribution and diet of these 2 Arctic pinnipeds, with potential consequences for the level of spatial overlap and competition between them.","[Hamilton, Charmain D.; Kovacs, Kit M.; Lydersen, Christian] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway","Hamilton, CD (corresponding author), Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.",charmain.hamilton@npolar.no,,,"Norwegian Polar Institute's Centre for Ice, Climate and Ecosystems (ICE)","We thank Lars Boehme, Hans Lund, Benjamin Merkel and Bobben Severinsen for their assistance in the capture and tagging of bearded seals and ringed seals.

Understanding ODSs provides fundamental insights into the biological and ecological processes that function at the individual, population and community levels, and is critical for the development and testing of hypotheses around key concepts in trophic theory on model organisms. Here, we synthesise historic and contemporary research on ODSs in fishes, and identify where further research is required. Numerous biotic and abiotic factors can directly or indirectly influence ODSs, but the most influential of these may vary spatially, temporally and interspecifically. Within the constraints imposed by prey availability, we identified competition and predation risk as the major drivers of ODSs in fishes. These drivers do not directly affect the trophic ontogeny of fishes, but may have an indirect effect on diet trajectories through ontogenetic changes in habitat use and concomitant changes in prey availability. The synthesis provides compelling evidence that ODSs can have profound ecological consequences for fish by, for example, enhancing individual growth and lifetime reproductive output or reducing the risk of mortality. ODSs may also influence food-web dynamics and facilitate the coexistence of sympatric species through resource partitioning, but we currently lack a holistic understanding of the consequences of ODSs for population, community and ecosystem processes and functioning. Studies attempting to address these knowledge gaps have largely focused on theoretical approaches, but empirical research under natural conditions, including phylogenetic and evolutionary considerations, is required to test the concepts. Research focusing on inter-individual variation in ontogenetic trajectories has also been limited, with the complex relationships between individual behaviour and environmental heterogeneity representing a particularly promising area for future research.","[Sanchez-Hernandez, Javier] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Biol, Dept Zool Xenet & Antropol Fis, Campus Vida S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Nunn, Andy D.] Univ Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Hull Int Fisheries Inst, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Adams, Colin E.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Scottish Ctr Ecol & Nat Environm, Glasgow G63 0AW, Lanark, Scotland; [Amundsen, Per-Arne] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Sanchez-Hernandez, J (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Biol, Dept Zool Xenet & Antropol Fis, Campus Vida S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",javier.sanchez@usc.es,"Nunn, Andy D./J-6341-2017; Sanchez-Hernandez, Javier/J-2544-2014","Nunn, Andy D./0000-0001-8370-1221; Sanchez-Hernandez, Javier/0000-0001-9684-4774; Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216","Galician Plan for Research, Innovation, and Growth (Plan I2C, Xunta de Galicia)","We thank Tom Cameron and an anonymous referee for constructive comments on the submitted manuscript, and Alison Cooper for editing the revised version.

Therefore, different hermit crab species that coexist in intertidal areas are commonly involved in intraspecific and interspecific competition for shells. We assess if differences in shell preference, exploitation ability, or competition by interference can explain the partitioning of shells between the coexisting species Calcinus californiensis and Clibanarius albidigitus. Clibanarius preferred shells of Nerita funiculata among the six gastropod shells tested, while Calcinus did not establish a hierarchy in shell preference. Therefore, the preference for gastropod shell species does not seem to diminish the competition for shells in the wild. Clibanarius identified and attended to chemical cues signalling potential sites of available shells (chemical cues of dead gastropods); Calcinus did not respond to these cues (competition by exploitation). However, Calcinus was more successful in obtaining a new shell by interspecific shell fighting than Clibanarius. Consequently, the use of better quality shells (intact shells) by Calcinus in the wild can be explained by its greater fighting ability compared with Clibanarius. The bias in shell distributions through dominance by shell fighting, more than by exploitation ability, has also been suggested for other hermit crab species of these genera.","[Alcaraz, Guillermina; Kruesi, Karla] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Lab Ecofisiol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Alcaraz, G (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Lab Ecofisiol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",alcaraz@ciencias.unam.mx,,,"Programa deApoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT, UNAM)Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN-211915]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CB-284007]","This work was supported by the Programa deApoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT, UNAM, IN-211915) and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT, CB-284007).",,64,1,1,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Here, the potential impact of introduced American bullfrogs (juveniles and adults) on native adult green frogs, Pelophylax kl. esculentus (Linnaeus, 1758), was investigated in a pond ecosystem by means of stomach-content and stable-isotope analyses. Specifically, this study was aimed at assessing the impact of the American bullfrog on native green frogs in terms of predation and competition (i.e. feeding ecology and habitat use), and uncovering changes in interspecific interactions linked to the ontogenetic dietary-habitat shifts of the invaders. Stomach contents and isotope analyses suggest that L. catesbeianus changes trophic position in the food chain and undergoes ontogenetic dietary-habitat shifts during its life cycle. The species therefore has the potential to exert a double impact on native green frogs: as a predator at the adult stage and as a competitor (for food and habitat use) at the juvenile stage. Stomach-content and isotope analyses gave similar results, suggesting that the predation impact by adult American bullfrogs on green frogs is mediated by the presence of the alien red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852). Juvenile American bullfrogs and native amphibians overlap in their diet composition and in their habitat use, suggesting the existence of potential competition between the two species. Ontogenetic dietary-habitat shifts in the American bullfrog, local conditions, and trophic interactions should be seriously considered in management approaches to promote the long-term coexistence of L. catesbeianus and native amphibians. Such management options have been neglected in the literature, and are worthy of further investigation to understand their efficacy on native species.","[Bissattini, Alessandra M.; Buono, Vincenzo; Vignoli, Leonardo] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Sci, Viale Marconi 446, I-00154 Rome, Italy","Bissattini, AM (corresponding author), Roma Tre Univ, Dept Sci, Viale Marconi 446, I-00154 Rome, Italy.",alessandramaria.bissattini@uniroma3.it,"Vignoli, Leonardo/F-2663-2011","Vignoli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1599-092X",,,,103,9,9,6,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Reliable predictions of population spread rates are essential to forecast biological invasions. Recent studies have shown that populations spreading through favourable habitat can rapidly evolve higher dispersal and reproductive rates at the expansion front, which accelerates spread velocity. However, spreading populations are likely to eventually encounter stressful conditions in the expanded range. How evolution during spread in favourable environments affects subsequent population growth in harsher environments is currently unknown. 2. We examined evolutionary change in performance under drought, interspecific competition, and heat stress for populations of Arabidopsis thaliana that experienced six generations of spread through replicated experimental landscapes of favourable habitat. To quantify how population performance under stress differed between leading edge and founding populations, we combined individual tests of genotype performance under stress with knowledge of the genotype frequency changes that occurred over the replicate invasions. 3. After spreading through favourable environments, the average silique production of individuals exposed to drought or interspecific competition was lower in leading edge than founding populations. This change was driven by the evolution of lower intrinsic silique production, which was correlated with increased seed size, a trait that evolved as populations spread. The ability of plants to tolerate drought or interspecific competition, however, did not change markedly during spread. Heat tolerance did increase in leading edge populations, and this trait was associated with the evolution of taller plants during spread through favourable habitat. 5. Synthesis. We conclude that evolution during spread in favourable environments may affect the ability of populations to grow under stressful conditions as experienced in the expanded range, through changes in either intrinsic fecundity or stress tolerance. Thus, evolution during spread may constrain or extend the eventual range limit of nonnative species invasions.","[Lustenhouwer, Nicky; Levine, Jonathan M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Williams, Jennifer L.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Lustenhouwer, N (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",lustenhouwer@usys.ethz.ch,"Lustenhouwer, Nicky/I-6981-2019; Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014; Williams, Jennifer L/H-1717-2011","Williams, Jennifer L/0000-0002-4497-4961; Lustenhouwer, Nicky/0000-0002-5157-857X",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [31003A_141025],"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 31003A_141025",,57,5,5,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

These viruses are well-recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism, to hurdle the interspecies barriers and to adapt ecological variations. It is predicted that the inherent genetic diversity of CoVs caused by accumulation of point mutations and high frequency of homologous recombination is the principal determinant of these competences. Several CoVs (e.g. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been recorded to cross the interspecies barrier, inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a primary cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Although it has long been known as a restrictive cattle pathogen, CoVs that are closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans and in other ruminant species. Biologic, antigenic and genetic analyses of the so-called 'bovine-like CoVs' proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species. In this review, the different bovine-like CoVs that have been identified in domesticated ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary camel, llama and alpaca) and wild ruminants (deer, wild cattle, antelopes, giraffes and wild goats) are discussed in terms of epidemiology, transmission and virus characteristics. The presented data denote the importance of these viruses in the persistence of BCoV in nature, spread to new geographical zones, and continuous emergence of disease epidemics in cattle farms.","[Amer, Haitham Mohamed] Cairo Univ, Dept Virol, Fac Vet Med, Giza 11221, Egypt","Amer, HM (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Dept Virol, Fac Vet Med, Giza 11221, Egypt.",hamoamer@cu.edu.eg,,,,,,100,31,34,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1466-2523,1475-2654,,ANIM HEALTH RES REV,Anim.

Combined effects of global and local stressors can be difficult to predict as they are underpinned by influences on individual species and interactions between them, which in turn may be affected by absolute and relative densities. Here we tested experimentally the influence of increased temperature and/or nutrients on individual species, interactions between them and the consequences for ecosystem functioning. Elevated temperature had a more positive influence on functioning when species were combined in mixtures than when in monoculture. Responses to increased nutrients were positive irrespective of whether a species was in monoculture or in a mixture. Additionally, those effects were modified by changes in the relative density of the species, which in some cases resulted in shifts from negative interspecific interactions (competition) to positive interactions (facilitation) or vice versa.","[Brooks, Paul R.; Crowe, Tasman P.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Brooks, Paul R.; Crowe, Tasman P.] Univ Coll Dublin, Earth Inst, Dublin, Ireland","Brooks, PR (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin, Ireland.; Brooks, PR (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Earth Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",paul.brooks@ucd.ie,,"Brooks, Paul/0000-0002-8105-0813","UCD Graduate Research and Education Programme in Sustainable Development - Irish Research Council for Science Engineering and Technology; Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social SciencesIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology",PRB was supported by the UCD Graduate Research and Education Programme in Sustainable Development (funded by the Irish Research Council for Science Engineering and Technology and the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences.,,89,5,5,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2018,127,12,,,,,1746,1758,,10.1111/oik.04459,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC5OB,WOS:000451851200005,,,,,2021-09-21,

The consequences of intraguild interactions on the foraging efficiency of the two coccinellid species were investigated by evaluating the functional responses of single beetles and intra- and interspecific combinations to densities of the spirea aphid, Aphis citricola van der Goot (Hemiptera: Aphididae), on apple seedlings, during 2 and 12 h under laboratory conditions. A type II functional response was observed in all the bioassays. Solitary H. axyridis consumed significantly more aphids than single P. japonica in both exposure periods. However, at intermediate prey densities the prey consumption of P. japonica was slightly greater than that of H. axyridis. The 95% confidence intervals of the functional response curves of conspecific and heterospecific pairs overlapped at 2 h. In contrast, conspecific pairs of H. axyridis showed a higher functional response curve at 12 h compared to a combination of H. axyridis and P. japonica. Prey's predation risk reduction was only detected for paired H. axyridis and mixed predators compared to their estimated functional responses at the 2-h foraging period. By comparing functional responses between intraguild predatory lady beetle combinations, we could further predict the potential ecosystem service provided by these natural enemies.","[Feng, Yi; Zhou, Zhao-Xu; An, Meng-Ru; Li, Yu-Dan; Liu, Zhi-Guo; Wang, Lin-Lin; Ren, Jin-Ze; Liu, Tong-Xian] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yi; Zhou, Zhao-Xu; An, Meng-Ru; Li, Yu-Dan; Liu, Zhi-Guo; Wang, Lin-Lin; Ren, Jin-Ze; Liu, Tong-Xian] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Minist Agr, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops Northwes, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zhao-Xu] Gansu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Liu, TX (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Liu, TX (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Minist Agr, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops Northwes, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",txliu@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"Liu, Tong-Xian/0000-0002-7686-0686",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31272089]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Z109021611]; national college students' science and technology innovation project [201610712004],"We thank Xing-Lin Yu for assistance in field collection of insects.

Hypothesized reasons for these divergences vary, but most relate a taxon's morphology to its ecological niche. Morphology is known to diverge when species co-occur with competitors or predators and when species occur across different habitats and environments. A less understood divergence from ecogeographic trends is niche fixation, wherein species become locked into particular niches due to their community interactions or foraging ecology. A form of niche fixation has been hypothesized in the theory of interspecies social dominance mimicry (ISDM), in which mimics maintain relatively constant size ratios with models to perpetuate their mimicry. If true, mimics should display variation and trends in tandem with their models. Here, I use mass as a proxy for body size and examine ecogeographic trends in two sets of woodpeckers (Picidae): a Nearctic group which has been reported to interact via ISDM, and a Neotropical group which, based on similar appearances and overlapping distributions, is a potential ISDM system. I found ecogeographic trends suggestive of differential evolutionary responses, and I found evidence against niche fixation in the Nearctic clade. The Neotropic clade showed limited evidence for tandem size evolution between models and mimics, but inconsistencies in the size ratios between mimic and model populations. Here, I discuss the implications of observing divergent ecogeographic trends within mimicry systems, with specific emphasis on how environment, ecology, and community interactions guide evolution.","[Cooper, Jacob C.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Cooper, Jacob C.] Field Museum, Integrat Res Ctr, Life Sci Sect, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Cooper, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Cooper, JC (corresponding author), Field Museum, Integrat Res Ctr, Life Sci Sect, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",jccooper@uchicago.edu,"Cooper, Jacob/AAV-1207-2020","Cooper, Jacob/0000-0003-2182-3236",Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the Univ. of Chicago,"This work was funded by my graduate program, the Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the Univ. of Chicago.",,79,0,0,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0908-8857,1600-048X,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

However, linking competitive interactions to predator distribution patterns is difficult and theoretical models predict different habitat selection patterns dependent on habitat quality and how competition manifests itself. While models generally consider competitors to be either equal in ability, or for one phenotype to have a fixed advantage over the other, few studies consider that an animal may only have a competitive advantage in specific habitats. We used ? 10 years of telemetry data, habitat surveys and behavioral experiments, to show spatial partitioning between and within two species of reef shark (grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhinchos and blacktip reef sharks C. melanopterus) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Within a species, sharks remained within small sub-habitats' with very few movements of individuals between sub-habitats, which previous models have suggested could be caused by intra-specific competition. Blacktip reef sharks were more broadly distributed across habitat types but a greater proportion used lagoon and backreef habitats, while grey reef sharks preferred forereef habitats. Grey reef sharks at a nearby atoll where blacktip reef sharks are absent, were distributed more broadly between habitat types than when both species were present. A series of individual-based models predict that habitat separation would only arise if there are competitive interactions between species that are habitat-specific, with grey reefs having a competitive advantage on the forereefs and blacktips in the lagoons and backreef.

Distinct foraging strategies may emerge within a population in response to heterogeneous resources, competition and learning, among other drivers. We assessed individual variation in, and ecological consequences of, an unusual, specialized foraging tactic between animals and humans. In southern Brazil, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, herd fish schools towards artisanal fishermen, who cast nets in response to behavioural cues from the dolphins. This apparent cooperative tactic likely involves costs as well as benefits for both interacting parties, but such trade-offs remain poorly understood, especially for dolphins. We show that individual dolphins vary markedly in the frequency with which they interact with fishermen, and that this foraging variation is linked to ranging behaviour. Not all individual dolphins interact with fishermen; those that routinely do so concentrate around the limited interaction sites and have smaller home ranges than independent foragers. This suggests that foraging with fishermen increases foraging success and reduces search costs (i.e. foraging range). Competition for interaction sites may offset such benefits, since some individuals often forage at the high-quality sites while others forage at low-quality sites. Taken together, our findings suggest that two alternative tactics emerge in the population from trade-offs involving food access, foraging area, learning techniques and competition: dolphins either forage by themselves over larger areas on unpredictable resource patches (passing fish schools), or learn to interact with fishermen to access and compete for more predictable resource patches (interaction sites). By revealing some of the ecological drivers of this remarkable human-animal interaction, our study contributes two broader insights. First, specialized foraging can have ranging consequences for individuals and so structure the population spatially; second, interspecific cooperation may be founded upon intraspecific competition.

Climate and land-use change contribute to accelerated rates of range expansion. However, the role of biotic interactions in promoting or hindering woody range expanders is still unclear. We investigated the combined effects of abiotic (soil properties and climate) and biotic (simulated grazing and intra-and interspecific plant-plant interactions) factors on a woody rangeexpander, Juniperus virginiana, which has been spreading into grasslands and old-field habitats in North America. We hypothesized that interspecific competition would negatively affect growth and survival of J. virginiana due to belowground competition with herbaceous species; grazing would favor J. virginiana via competitive release, and intraspecific interactions would be beneficial to tree seedlings during early life stages by means of facilitation. We also predicted that a thicker winter snowpack would have a positive impact on tree growth by providing protection from frost damage. In a multisite field experiment, we exposed J. virginiana seedlings to intra-and interspecific interactions, as well as simulated grazing of surrounding herbaceous species. These treatments were repeated at three different sites that vary in soil properties and that are situated along a precipitation gradient. Additionally, we conducted a snow-manipulation experiment at one of the sites. We conducted our monitoring for two consecutive growing seasons characterized by very different rainfall conditions, the second growing season receiving between 6% and 14% more rainfall than the first. Under lower rainfall availability, interspecific interactions between tree seedlings and herbaceous species negatively affected seedling growth rates. However, this effect was detectable only during the drier year and at the site characterized by more favorable soil properties. During winter, we found that deeper snow cover was associated with decreased growth rate of plants, probably due to repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Our results indicate that the role of biotic interactions had an effect only under harsh climatic conditions and that abiotic factors may affect range expansion directly and indirectly via biotic interactions.","[Tomiolo, Sara; Ward, David] Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Cunningham Hall, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Tomiolo, Sara] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark","Tomiolo, S (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Cunningham Hall, Kent, OH 44242 USA.; Tomiolo, S (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.",sara.tomiolo@gmail.com,,"Tomiolo, Sara/0000-0002-5071-5851","Herrick Trust, Kent State University","We thank Melissa Davis, Jean Engohang-Ndong, Jim Morales, and the staff of Geauga and Tuscarawas campuses for technical and logistic support in the field.

The aim of this study was to investigate if exploitative prey-resource competition occurs between the two sympatric pitcher plant species, Nepenthes rafflesiana and N. gracilis in Singapore. We first investigated if prey-resource partitioning occurs between these two species, and then investigated niche shift in N. gracilis by examining its pitcher contents along an in situ gradient of N. rafflesiana interspecific competition. Our results showed clear evidence of resource partitioning between the two species, but contrary to the expectation of competition, proximity to N. rafflesiana pitchers correlated with higher total prey numbers in N. gracilis pitchers. Our multivariate model of prey assemblages further suggested that N. rafflesiana facilitates N. gracilis prey capture, especially in several ant taxa that are trapped by both species. Concurrently, we found strong evidence for intraspecific competition between N. gracilis pitchers, suggesting that prey resources are exhaustible by pitcher-predation. Our results show that resource partitioning can be associated with facilitative interactions, instead of competition as is usually assumed. Facilitation is more typically expected between phylogenetically distant species, but divergences in resource acquisition strategies can permit facilitation between congeners.","[Lam, Weng Ngai; Chong, Kwek Yan; Tan, Hugh Tiang Wah] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, 14 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Wang, Wendy Yanling; Cheong, Loong Fah; Koh, Joseph Kok Hong; Foo, Maosheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kong Chian Nat Hist Museum, 2 Conservatory Dr, Singapore 117377, Singapore","Lam, WN (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, 14 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.",wengngai@u.nus.edu,"Chong, Kwek Yan/K-8375-2016; Lam, Weng Ngai/N-3582-2017","Chong, Kwek Yan/0000-0003-4754-8957; Lam, Weng Ngai/0000-0002-1188-1363",,,,54,8,8,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAR,2018,219,3,,,,,299,311,,10.1007/s11258-018-0796-4,,,13,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FX3MS,WOS:000425976700006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Towards the northern edge of species ranges the role of biotic interactions gradually decreases while the impact of climate oscillations becomes more important. This study examined the long-term changes in abundance, individual growth rates and shell shape characteristics of Macoma balthica, one of the dominant species in White Sea soft-bottom intertidal communities. To test the role of predators in changes in clam abundance, we examined the number of moonsnails Amauropsis islandica. Macoma balthica exhibited spatially synchronous population dynamics at six sites in Kandalaksha Bay, where densities of clams varied between 140 and 8500 ind. m(-2) during the 21-year period of observations. Statistical modelling using generalized additive models (GAM) shows that a combination of mild winter and warm summer led to an increase in M. balthica density the following year. Predation by A. islandica had no impact on changes in M. balthica density. Growth rates of M. balthica were higher during a cool decade, but clams that lived in a wanner period were characterized by more globose shells. Our results suggest that the climate oscillations can be regarded as the key factor causing the shift in abundance of M. balthica in the White Sea during the last two decades via recruitment and survival.","[Genelt-Yanovskiy, Evgeny A.; Nazarova, Sophia A.] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Hydrobiol, St Petersburg, Russia; [Genelt-Yanovskiy, Evgeny A.; Aristov, Dmitriy A.; Nazarova, Sophia A.] Russian Acad Sci, Zool Inst, St Petersburg, Russia; [Aristov, Dmitriy A.; Poloskin, Alexey V.] Lab Marine Benth Ecol & Hydrobiol, St Petersburg, Russia; [Poloskin, Alexey V.] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg, Russia","Nazarova, SA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Marine Res Lab, Zool Inst, Univ Skaya Emb 1, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",sophia.nazarova@gmail.com,"Nazarova, Sophia A./H-4001-2013; Aristov, Dmitriy/O-6042-2017; Genelt-Yanovskiy, Evgeny A./C-9970-2013; Poloskin, Alexey V/F-8183-2016","Nazarova, Sophia A./0000-0003-1856-1976; Aristov, Dmitriy/0000-0001-5271-9568; Genelt-Yanovskiy, Evgeny A./0000-0001-7115-2181; Poloskin, Alexey V/0000-0002-7992-3793",RFBRRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [16-34-00682]; SPbSU Action 2 research project [1.38.253.2014],"The study was partially supported by RFBR grant No 16-34-00682, and SPbSU Action 2 research project No. 1.38.253.2014.",,90,2,2,1,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

As distress calls may trigger antipredator behaviour even in individuals that are not under attack, we tested whether this defensive behaviour induced behavioural changes in neighbouring conspecifics. We compared the behavioural responses of two species of Neotropical hylid frogs (genus Boana) to conspecific distress calls and white noise. Individuals of both species interrupted their vocal activity and decreased call rate after hearing the distress call. Natural variation on signal intensity calibrated among the nearest neighbours did not influence the response and we did not observe negative phonotaxis after any acoustic stimulus. Despite the fact that many predators are acoustically oriented, we could not determine if such response (reduced call rate) was induced by risk assessment or by the masking effect on advertisement calls. Boana faber responded similarly to white noise and distress calls, while B. bischoffi responded more intensely to distress calls. Duration of silence after playbacks in B. faber was longer than B. bischoffi. We suggest that, if the signals are interpreted as a risk cue by neighbouring conspecifics, each species may be preyed upon by different predators, as they may have led to distinct defensive strategies and different responses to distress calls. If risk assessment information is included in distress calls, it triggers behavioural responses only in the nearest neighbours, as we did not observe responses on the vocal activity of the interspecific chorus. Our results add relevant data about acoustic communication and interpretations by anurans, highlighting the importance of considering cues within common and widespread signals.","[Forti, Lucas Rodriguez; Toledo, Luis Felipe] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Forti, Lucas Rodriguez; Toledo, Luis Felipe] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Multiusuario Bioacust LMBio, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Bella Sanches Forti, Anna Barbara] Fac Direito Sorocaba, Rua Doutora Ursulina Lopes Torres, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Marquez, Rafael] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat CSIC, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Fonoteca Zool, Madrid, Spain","Forti, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Forti, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Multiusuario Bioacust LMBio, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lucas_forti@yahoo.com.br,"Toledo, Luis Felipe/I-4017-2012; Forti, Lucas/E-8207-2013","Toledo, Luis Felipe/0000-0002-4929-9598; Forti, Lucas/0000-0003-3057-2141; Marquez, Rafael/0000-0002-2070-860X","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/21519-4, 2014/23388-7]; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas [CGL2011-16159-E]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [302589/2013-9, 300896/2016-6, 438675/2016-9, 150041/2017-9, 405285/2013-2]; Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [ACOURA CGL2008-04814]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Grant/Award Number: #2013/21519-4 and #2014/23388-7; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Grant/Award Number: CGL2011-16159-E; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Grant/Award Number: #302589/2013-9, #300896/2016-6, #438675/2016-9, #150041/2017-9 and #405285/2013-2; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: ACOURA CGL2008-04814; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad",,32,5,5,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,DEC,2017,123,12,,,,,942,948,,10.1111/eth.12693,,,7,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FM2YC,WOS:000414867800007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Although previous studies have investigated the effect of intra-annual rainfall variability on plant growth and ecosystem dynamics, the impacts of interannual rainfall variability remain understudied. This paper uses satellite data and develops a new mechanistic model to investigate the response of tree-grass composition to increasing interannual rainfall variability in arid to sub-humid ecosystems along the Kalahari Transect in Southern Africa. Both satellite data and model results show that increasing interannual rainfall fluctuations favor deep-rooted trees over shallow-rooted grasses in drier environments (that is, mean annual rainfall, MAP < 900-1000 mm) but favor grasses over trees in wetter environments (that is, MAP > 900-1000 mm). Trees have a competitive advantage over grasses in dry environments because their generally deeper root systems allow them to have exclusive access to the increased deep soil water resources expected to occur in wet years as a result of the stronger interannual rainfall fluctuations. In relatively wet environments, grasses are favored because of their high growth rate that allows them to take advantage of the window of opportunity existing in years with above average precipitation and thus increase fire-induced tree mortality. Thus, under increasing interannual rainfall fluctuations both direct effects on soil water availability and indirect effects mediated by tree-grass interactions and fire dynamics are expected to play an important role in determining changes in plant community composition.","[Yu, Kailiang; Saha, Michael Vijay; D'Odorico, Paolo] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [D'Odorico, Paolo] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA","Yu, KL (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",ky9hc@virginia.edu,,,"China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; VPR Office of the University of Virginia; National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center, NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1052875]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1052875] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This research was funded through a fellowship from China Scholarship Council, a Grant from the VPR Office of the University of Virginia, and a Grant from the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center, NSF DBI-1052875.

A wide range of models is already available for this type of analysis, and the field is still under active development. One of the most needed development concerns models that better account for the effect of within-and between-clade interspecific interactions on trait evolution, which can result from processes as diverse as competition, predation, parasitism, or mutualism. Here, we begin by developing a very general comparative phylogenetic framework for (multi)-trait evolution that can be applied to both ultrametric and nonultrametric trees. This framework not only encapsulates many previous models of continuous univariate and multivariate phenotypic evolution, but also paves the way for the consideration of a much broader series of models in which lineages coevolve, meaning that trait changes in one lineage are influenced by the value of traits in other, interacting lineages. Next, we provide a standard way for deriving the probabilistic distribution of traits at tip branches under our framework. We show that a multivariate normal distribution remains the expected distribution for a broad class of models accounting for interspecific interactions. Our derivations allow us to fit various models efficiently, and in particular greatly reduce the computation time needed to fit the recently proposed phenotype matching model. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our framework by developing a toy model for mutualistic coevolution.

In the last three decades, PA's have expanded considerably; however, quantitative assessments of how well they have mitigated threats to habitat and biodiversity are very limited. Habitat bordering PA's and the wildlife that use it are threatened by a wide-range of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., edge effects, fragmentation, and introduced predators) and this situation is particularly acute for low-density, poorly studied carnivore communities. From 2010 to 2015, we photographically sampled within (contiguous forest) and bordering (degraded, fragmented forest) a UNESCO World Heritage rainforest PA in Madagascar - Ranomafana National Park (RNP). We investigated the effects of invasive predators, local people presence, and habitat quality on the endemic rainforest carnivore community using static, dynamic, and co-occurrence models. We found native carnivores to be absent or have a low probability of occurrence in degraded forest bordering the PA, while local people and dogs (Canis familiaris) had high occurrence. Madagascar's largest endemic carnivore, the fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and the much smaller ring-tailed vontsira (Galidia elegans), occurrence in RNP declined rapidly over six years; their strong co-occurrence with dogs suggests interspecific competition, direct aggression/mortality, or disease as the cause. We highlight the dangers posed to biodiversity, particularly carnivores, from anthropogenic pressures bordering PA's and present recommendations to address increased human and dog activity, including programs to control dogs and their impact on biodiversity.","[Farris, Zach J.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Farris, Zach J.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Gerber, Brian D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Valenta, Kim] McGill Univ, Dept Anthropol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Rafaliarison, Radoniaina; Razafimahaimodison, Jean Claude; Randriana, Zoavina; Wright, Patricia C.] Ctr ValBio, Ranomafana, Fianarantsoa Pr, Madagascar; [Larney, Eileen] Conservat Int, Moore Ctr Sci, TEAM Network, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Rajaonarivelo, Tsiky] Vetclinic, Lot 2 E 2 ZWR, Ampandrianomby, Madagascar; [Wright, Patricia C.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Chapman, Colin A.] McGill Univ, Dept Anthropol, McGill Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Chapman, Colin A.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, 2300 Southern Blvd, Bronx, NY 10460 USA","Farris, ZJ (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, 101 Rouse Life Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",zjfarris@auburn.edu; bgerber@colostate.edu; colin.chapman@mcgill.ca,"Chapman, Colin/S-1911-2019; Farris, Zach J./AAW-6579-2020","Chapman, Colin/0000-0002-8827-8140; ",Ruffourd Foundation [8964-1]; Compassionate Conservation Virginia McKenna Award; Born Free Foundation,"Funding: Research conducted by the Mad Dog Initiative was supported by the Ruffourd Foundation (#8964-1), Compassionate Conservation Virginia McKenna Award, and the Born Free Foundation.

Major declines in P. longirostris populations have been caused primarily by habitat loss and mortality via invasive species (e.g., predation from birds and cats) and human waste products (e.g., trapped in discarded bottles). However, biotic interactions and interspecific competition with invasive lizards have also been identified as potentially detrimental to P. longisrostris populations. Here, we provide the first occurrence records of a highly invasive lizard, the Cuban brown anole (Anolis sagrei), on Bermuda. We assess the brown anole's diet, habitat use, morphology, and island-wide distribution for comparison to the native skink, P. longirostris. Results of this study indicate that A. sagrei in Bermuda are highly terrestrial (>60% of all lizards observed on the ground vs. in trees) and forage primarily on terrestrial invertebrates. These data indicate substantial ecological overlap with the exclusively-terrestrial P. longirostris. This is in contrast to the other established non-native lizards on Bermuda, which are principally arboreal and have successfully coexisted with P. longirostris for [60 years. At present, the geographic distributions of A. sagrei and P. longirostris do not overlap. However, all extant skink populations are within several kilometers of brown anole populations (with the nearest being <0.5 km). The extensive overlap in ecological niche between the Bermuda skink and the invasive brown anole will likely present a serious conservation threat if contact is made. This study is exceptional in providing clear in situ ecological data which predict a conservation threat of an established invasive species to a Critically Endangered island endemic prior to coexistence. Continued monitoring of this situation as P. longirostris and A. sagrei inevitably come into contact will allow these a priori hypotheses of conservation risk via ecological overlap to be tested.","[Stroud, James T.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Stroud, James T.] Fairchild Trop Bot Gardens, Coral Gables, FL 33156 USA; [Giery, Sean T.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Outerbridge, Mark E.] Dept Environm & Nat Resources, 17 North Shore Rd, Hamilton Parish FL04, Bermuda","Stroud, JT (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",jamesTstroud@gmail.com,,"Stroud, James/0000-0003-0734-6795",FIU Judith Evans Parker Travel Fund; FIU Dissertation Evidence Acquisition Fellowship; NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1406399]; Bermuda Zoological Society (Eric Clee Fund),"This is contribution #246, Bermuda Biodiversity Project (BBP), Bermuda Aquarium, Natural History Museum and Zoo, Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

In the dry tropics, including African savannas, many trees grow new leaves during the dry season - weeks or months before the rains typically start. This syndrome of pre-rain green-up has long been recognized at small scales, but the high spatial and interspecific variability in leaf phenology has precluded regional generalizations. We used remote sensing data to show that this precocious phenology is ubiquitous across the woodlands and savannas of southern tropical Africa. In 70% of the study area, green-up preceded rain onset by > 20 d (42% > 40 d). All the main vegetation formations exhibited pre-rain green-up, by as much as 53 +/- 18 d (in the wet miombo). Green-up showed low interannual variability (SD between years = 11 d), and high spatial variability (> 100 d). These results are consistent with a high degree of local phenological adaptation, and an insolation trigger of green-up. Tree-tree competition and niche separation may explain the ubiquity of this precocious phenology. The ubiquity of pre-rain green-up described here challenges existing model representations and suggests resistance (but not necessarily resilience) to the delay in rain onset predicted under climate change.","[Ryan, Casey M.; Williams, Mathew; Grace, John; Woollen, Emily; Lehmann, Caroline E.

Over 80% of Atlantic Forest remnants in Brazil are < 50 ha and lack resident populations of large predators (jaguars, Panthera onca, and pumas, Puma concolor). Mesopredators with opportunistic life-history characteristics (e.g., ocelots, Leopardus pardalis) are now hypothesized to be the dominant competitor(s) in these systems and may negatively affect the spatial or temporal distribution of other sympatric mesocarnivores. We used camera-trap data, occupancy models, and temporal overlap indexes to explore whether ocelot occurrence influenced the habitat use or activity patterns of 6 mesocarnivores in reserves of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Ocelot occurrence did not influence the habitat use of these mesocarnivores. Moreover, the ability of some mesocarnivore species, especially the little spotted cat (L. guttulus), to adjust their activity patterns to avoid direct contact with ocelots may facilitate their coexistence in these Atlantic Forest remnants. Ocelot occurrence did not influence the activity pattern of 2 nocturnal species (the crab-eating fox, Cerdocyon thous, and the crab-eating raccoon, Procyon cancrivorus), suggesting that these species are more tolerant of ocelots than other mesocarnivores. The probability of occupancy varied among species, with tayra (Eira barbara) and South American coati (Nasua nasua) having the highest occupancy estimates; overall, occupancy by mesocarnivores correlated negatively with reserve size. Because mesocarnivores are important drivers of ecosystem function, structure, and dynamics and may occupy unique roles that cannot be filled by larger carnivores, future studies should assess environmental factors influencing the use of these small remnants of Atlantic Forest by each mesocarnivore species.","[Massara, Rodrigo L.; Paschoal, Ana Maria O.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Geral, Lab Ecol & Conservacao, Ave Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Massara, Rodrigo L.; Paschoal, Ana Maria O.] Inst SerraDiCal Pesquisa & Conservacao, Rua Jose Hemeterio de Andrade 570, BR-30493180 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Bailey, Larissa L.; Doherty, Paul F., Jr.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, 1474 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Chiarello, Adriano G.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biol, Fac Filosofia Ciencias & Letras Ribeirao Preto, Ave Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14040901 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil","Massara, RL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Geral, Lab Ecol & Conservacao, Ave Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.; Massara, RL (corresponding author), Inst SerraDiCal Pesquisa & Conservacao, Rua Jose Hemeterio de Andrade 570, BR-30493180 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",rmassara@gmail.com,"Paschoal, Ana Maria O/N-6631-2016; Massara, Rodrigo Lima/Q-2223-2015; Bailey, Larissa/A-2565-2009; Bailey, Larissa/ABH-3513-2020; Chiarello, Adriano Garcia/G-2510-2012","Paschoal, Ana Maria O/0000-0001-8560-1056; Massara, Rodrigo Lima/0000-0003-1221-2185; Chiarello, Adriano Garcia/0000-0003-1914-5480",Brazilian Science Council (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [PQ 305902/2014-8]; Minas Gerais Science Foundation (FAPEMIG)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"This study was funded by the Brazilian Science Council (CNPq) and Minas Gerais Science Foundation (FAPEMIG).

At large spatial or temporal scales, this can result in the costly loss of access to resources. However, fine-scale reactive avoidance may minimize the risk of aggressive encounters for subordinate predators while maintaining access to resources, thereby providing a mechanism for coexistence. We investigated fine-scale spatiotemporal avoidance in a guild of African predators characterized by intense interference competition. Vulnerable to food stealing and direct killing, cheetahs are expected to avoid both larger predators; hyenas are expected to avoid lions. We deployed a grid of 225 camera traps across 1,125 km(2) in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, to evaluate concurrent patterns of habitat use by lions, hyenas, cheetahs, and their primary prey. We used hurdle models to evaluate whether smaller species avoided areas preferred by larger species, and we used time-to-event models to evaluate fine-scale temporal avoidance in the hours immediately surrounding top predator activity. We found no evidence of long-term displacement of subordinate species, even at fine spatial scales. Instead, hyenas and cheetahs were positively associated with lions except in areas with exceptionally high lion use. Hyenas and lions appeared to actively track each, while cheetahs appear to maintain long-term access to sites with high lion use by actively avoiding those areas just in the hours immediately following lion activity. Our results suggest that cheetahs are able to use patches of preferred habitat by avoiding lions on a moment-to-moment basis. Such fine-scale temporal avoidance is likely to be less costly than long-term avoidance of preferred areas: This may help explain why cheetahs are able to coexist with lions despite high rates of lion-inflicted mortality, and highlights reactive avoidance as a general mechanism for predator coexistence.","[Swanson, Alexandra; Arnold, Todd; Kosmala, Margaret; Forester, James; Packer, Craig] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Swanson, Alexandra] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford, England; [Kosmala, Margaret] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Swanson, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford, England.",swanson.ali@gmail.com,"Arnold, Todd W./H-6945-2019; Forester, James/A-3298-2012","Forester, James/0000-0002-5392-9556; Arnold, Todd/0000-0002-7920-772X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1020479]; University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute; Serengeti crowd; Explorer's Club; UMN Thesis Research Grants; UMN Office of International Programs; American Society of Mammalogists; Minnesota Zoo Ulysses S.

The densities of Platymonas helgolandica var. tsingtaoensis, Isochrysis galbana, and Brachionus plicatilis in single-species tests and customized ecosystems were examined in response to a concentration gradient of petroleum hydrocarbons ranging from 0 to 8.0 mg L-1. A three-population ecological model with interspecies competition-grazing relationships was used to characterize population sizes with concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons. A threshold concentration of the simplified plankton ecosystem of 0.376 mg L-1 for petroleum hydrocarbons was calculated from the proposed model, which was higher than the no-effect concentration of 0.056 mg L-1 derived from the single-species toxicity tests and the predicted no-effect concentration of 0.076 mg L-1 calculated from the species sensitivity distribution. This finding indicates that interspecies competition and grazing reduced the toxic effect of petroleum hydrocarbons at the community level. The sensitivity analysis for model parameters demonstrates that plankton population biomasses are highly sensitive to filtration rates. Antagonism between interspecies interactions and petroleum hydrocarbon toxicity was attributed to the reduced filtration rate and zooplankton grazing pressure. The proposed method is a simple means to address the concern regarding the impacts of ecological interactions on ecological risk assessments of pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we examined whether food resource partitioning (differential use of foraging habitat or the consumption of different prey species) between common murres (COMU, Uria aalge) and thick-billed murres (TBMU, U. lomvia) breeding on the same colony in the Bering Sea increases with a predictable increase in energy demands between the incubation and chick-rearing stages of reproduction. We assessed the seasonal dynamics of food availability via corticosterone (CORT) levels and examined adult diet (via stable isotope analysis of nitrogen and carbon, SI) and chick diets (based on nest observations). We compared chick provisioning patterns and examined the characteristics of parental foraging habitat via deployment of bird-borne temperature-depth recorders. We found that CORT levels remained low and similar between the species and reproductive stages, reflecting relatively stable and favorable foraging conditions for both murre species during the study period. Comparisons of SI between murres and their potential prey indicated that diets were similar between the species during incubation and diverged during chick-rearing. Chick-rearing common and thick-billed murres also used different foraging habitats, as reflected in travel distances to foraging areas and sea surface temperature distributions of their foraging dives. TBMUs performed shorter foraging trips, deeper dives and delivered squid to their chicks, while COMUs foraged farther from the colony, performed shallower dives, and delivered fish species to their chicks. These results suggest that food resource partitioning between murre species increased during chick-rearing under favorable foraging conditions. Whether the dietary segregation reflected species-specific differences in adults' foraging efficiency, differences in chicks' dietary requirements, or was a way of reducing competition remains unknown. Regardless of the causal mechanism(s), food resource partitioning might ameliorate interspecific competition between sympatrically breeding birds during periods of increased energy demands.","[Barger, Christopher P.; Young, Rebecca C.; Will, Alexis; Kitaysky, Alexander S.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Irving 311, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Ito, Motohiro] Natl Inst Polar Res, Midori Cho 10-3, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan","Barger, CP (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Irving 311, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",cpbarger@alaska.edu,,,"Calvin J.

However, little is known about how different plant traits and stress types influence these vegetation changes. In this study, we propose the use of relative stress tolerance curves to couple stress tolerance and competitive abilities in a dynamic vegetation model. This model overcomes the difficulties of 1) accounting for variations in interspecific interactions with changes in the hydrological regime, and 2) simulating vegetation dynamics in response to continuously changing stress levels in the tidal restriction region. The model was applied to the tidal restriction area of the Yellow River Delta. Key determinants for altered species abundance of Phragmites australis and Tamarix chinensis were interspecific competitive abilities and waterlogging stress, respectively. Waterlogging stress and interspecific competitive ability under soil salinity stress were key determinants for altered Suaeda glauca abundance. Analysis of multiple scenarios revealed that the simulated plant community is hysteretic to changes in the hydrological regime. The structure of the simulated plant community was constant in the first 4 years after tidal reintroduction due to hysteretic effects, but recovered rapidly thereafter. To achieve efficient restoration effects of a plant community, a rapid alteration of the hydrological regime is recommended to decrease the extent of hysteresis effects.","[Qi, Man; Sun, Tao; Xue, SuFeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Min] Kumoh Natl Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 1 Yangho Dong, Gumi 730701, Gyeongbuk, South Korea","Sun, T (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",suntao@bnu.edu.cn,"Qi, Man/AAK-1565-2021; Zhan, Min/AAU-7829-2020","ZHAN, MIN/0000-0002-8459-0428; ZHAN, MIN/0000-0001-5699-4639",National Basic Research Program of China (973)National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB430402]; National Science Foundation for Innovative Research Group [51121003]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51279007],"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973) ( 2013CB430402), the National Science Foundation for Innovative Research Group ( No. 51121003), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( No. 51279007).",,46,9,9,4,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,MAR,2016,36,,,1,,,S31,S43,,10.1007/s13157-015-0639-1,,,13,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DF9UK,WOS:000371706900004,,,,,2021-09-21,

To allow for coexistence species would differentiate in resource use. Species that have similar ecology could coexist providing that they have different patterns of habitat use and associations with different environmental variables. In addition, similarity among species could be influenced by habitat structure and resource availability. Here, we build models of habitat use in high resolution (50 x 50 m), for two closely related species of birds in Northeast Brazil (Herpsilochmus sellowi-Caatinga Antwren and Herpsilochmus pectoralis-Pectoral Antwren). We use ecological niche factor analysis to detail the relationship between species and their habitat requirements. Our models brought new information about habitat use and how species respond to environmental variability. Habitat heterogeneity promotes the existence of distinct habitats that can be differently occupied by the species. Our analysis revealed that the two species have different strategies. H. pectoralis was very selective (specialist), while H. sellowi was habitat generalist. The use of different habitats can reduce the effect of interspecific competition to levels that allow coexistence. Our results suggest that habitat segregation as proposed by classical niche theory can explain coexistence of these two species in our study site.","[Costa, Gabriel C.; Franca, Karol L.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Ecol, Ctr Biociencias, Campus Univ Lagoa Nova, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Oliveira-Junior, Tonny M.; Pichorim, Mauro] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Biociencias, Campus Univ Lagoa Nova, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil","Costa, GC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Ecol, Ctr Biociencias, Campus Univ Lagoa Nova, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil.",costagc@mac.com; lyncoln22@yahoo.com.br; tonnybass@hotmail.com; mauropichorim@yahoo.com.br,"Pichorim, Mauro/H-2224-2014","Pichorim, Mauro/0000-0002-9340-9010; Costa, Gabriel/0000-0002-6777-6706","Brazilian Research and Technological Development Council [474945/2010-3]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [201413/2014-0, 302776/2012-5, 563352/2010-8]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1136586] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was partially supported by the Brazilian Research and Technological Development Council [CNPq Process 474945/2010-3] and GCC thanks CNPq [grant numbers 201413/2014-0, 302776/2012-5 and 563352/2010-8].",,54,3,4,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1843,,,COGENT ENVIRON SCI,Cogent Environ.

Species' response to abiotic environmental variation can be influenced by local community structure and interspecific interactions, particularly in restricted habitats such as islands and lakes. In temperate lakes, future increase in water temperature and run-off of terrestrial (allochthonous) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are predicted to alter community composition and the overall ecosystem productivity. However, little is known about how the present community structure and abiotic environmental variation interact to affect the abundance of native fish populations. 2. We used a space-for-time approach to study how local community structure interact with lake morphometric and climatic characteristics (i.e. temperature and catchment productivity) to affect brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) yield in 283 Norwegian lakes located in different biogeographical regions. 3. Brown trout yield (based on data from standardized survey gill net fishing; g 100 m(-2) gill net night(-1)) was generally lower in lakes where other fish species were present than in lakes with brown trout only. The yield showed an overall negative relationship with increasing temperature and a positive relationship with lake shoreline complexity. Brown trout yield was also negatively correlated with DOC load (measured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy) and lake size and depth (measured using terrain slope as a proxy), but only in lakes where other fish species were present. The observed negative response of brown trout yield to increasing DOC load and proportion of the pelagic open-water area is likely due to restricted (littoral) niche availability and competitive dominance of more pelagic fishes such as Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)). 4. Our study highlights that, through competitive interactions, the local community structure can influence the response of a species' abundance to variation in abiotic conditions. Changes in biomass and niche use of top predators (such as the brown trout), associated with predicted changes in direct and indirect climatic factors, may have further influences on the structure and function of temperate lake ecosystems.","[Eloranta, Antti P.; Helland, Ingeborg P.; Sandlund, Odd T.; Hesthagen, Trygve; Ugedal, Ola; Finstad, Anders G.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Finstad, Anders G.] NTNU Univ Museum, Dept Nat Hist, NO-7013 Trondheim, Norway","Eloranta, AP (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, POB 5685 Sluppen, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway.",antti.eloranta@nina.no,"Finstad, Anders/H-6519-2015; Helland, Ingeborg Palm/B-5615-2008; Eloranta, Antti Pekka/AAA-1426-2020","Finstad, Anders/0000-0003-4529-6266; Helland, Ingeborg Palm/0000-0001-7380-3152; Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135","Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission [228714, 221410]; Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk","We are grateful for the helpful and constructive comments given by the two anonymous reviewers.

Juvenile or early benthic phase (EBP) lobsters live under the same boulders as these crabs and are potentially vulnerable to crab predation and competition. Time-lapse photography was used to quantify aggressive interactions between EBP lobsters and invasive crabs in the laboratory. Lobsters behaved far more aggressively toward Asian shore crabs (initiating 11.8 attacks/h) than green crabs (4.9 attacks/h). Crab behavior varied widely as well, as green crabs were five times more likely to attack EBP lobsters than were Asian shore crabs. Thus, lobsters initiated 75.5% of aggressive interactions with Asian shore crabs, compared with only 22.3% with green crabs. Invasion history was a possible reason for this disparity, as green crabs have shared geographic range with American lobsters for more than 100 y, compared with only more than 10 y for Asian shore crabs. Differences in lobster responses to the two crab species suggest that aggressive behavior is the default for EBP lobsters and that they attacked the novel species (H. sanguineus) because they had not developed avoidance behavior to the potential crab threat. Green crabs posed more of a predation threat than Asian shore crabs, consuming over 80% of lobsters in 24-h trials. These results suggest that invasion history and predator-prey adaptation may shape the behavior and ecological interactions of native and invasive species.","[Lord, Joshua P.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Dalvano, Brielle E.] Bates Coll, Dept Biol, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA","Lord, JP (corresponding author), Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",joshua.p.lord@gmail.com,,"Lord, Joshua/0000-0003-3020-5704",,,,42,6,6,2,37,NATL SHELLFISHERIES ASSOC,GROTON,"C/O DR.

One underexplored source of variation in cancer susceptibility may arise from trade-offs between reproductive competitiveness (e.g. sexually selected traits, earlier reproduction and higher fertility) and cancer defence. We build a model that contrasts the probabilistic onset of cancer with other, extrinsic causes of mortality and use it to predict that intense reproductive competition will lower cancer defences and increase cancer incidence. We explore the trade-off between cancer defences and intraspecific competition across different extrinsic mortality conditions and different levels of trade-off intensity, and find the largest effect of competition on cancer in species where low extrinsic mortality combines with strong trade-offs. In such species, selection to delay cancer and selection to outcompete conspecifics are both strong, and the latter conflicts with the former. We discuss evidence for the assumed trade-off between reproductive competitiveness and cancer susceptibility. Sexually selected traits such as ornaments or large body size require high levels of cell proliferation and appear to be associated with greater cancer susceptibility. Similar associations exist for female traits such as continuous egg-laying in domestic hens and earlier reproductive maturity. Trade-offs between reproduction and cancer defences may be instantiated by a variety of mechanisms, including higher levels of growth factors and hormones, less efficient cell-cycle control and less DNA repair, or simply a larger number of cell divisions (relevant when reproductive success requires large body size or rapid reproductive cycles). These mechanisms can affect intra-and interspecific variation in cancer susceptibility arising from rapid cell proliferation during reproductive maturation, intrasexual competition and reproduction.","[Boddy, Amy M.; Aktipis, C.

Previous investigations of these concerns have focused on Double-crested Cormorant interactions with other species within homogeneous breeding environments, making broad patterns difficult to identify. The present study examined how nest location, nest density, and species identity mediate agonistic interactions among Double-crested Cormorants and Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) nesting at a colony site in central Minnesota, USA. Twenty-six Double-crested Cormorant nests and 27 Great Blue Heron nests were observed for 30 min weekly for 8 weeks during the breeding season to estimate frequency of agonistic behavior and identify species-level patterns of interaction. Most agonistic interactions observed (81%) were intraspecific interactions among Double-crested Cormorants; Great Blue Herons engaged in a higher combined total count of interspecific and intraspecific interactions when they nested near Double-crested Cormorants. Interspecific interactions were more common among ground-nesting birds than among tree-nesting birds. This study suggests that further investigation into impacts of Double-crested Cormorants on co-nesting birds is most warranted for ground-nesting colonies.","[Wyman, Katherine E.] Univ Minnesota, Conservat Biol Grad Program, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Cuthbert, Francesca J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Wyman, KE (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Conservat Biol Grad Program, 135 Skok Hall,2003 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",wyman057@umn.edu,,,Sigma Xi; Richard and Judi Huempfner Avian Research Fellowship (Bell Museum of Natural History); Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station,"The authors are grateful to L.

Although ecological theory has, for a long time, addressed the premise that ecological space can be filled to 'capacity' with species, only with the availability of time-calibrated phylogenies has it been possible to test the hypothesis that diversification slows as the number of species in a region increases. Focusing on the deciduous trees of eastern North America, this study tested predictions from competition theory concerning the distribution and abundance of species. Methods Local assemblages of trees tabulated in a previous study published in 1950 were analysed. Assemblages were ordinated with respect to species composition by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS). Distributions of trees were analysed by taxonomically nested analysis of variance, discriminant analysis based on NMS scores, and canonical correlation analysis of NMS scores and Bioclim climate variables. Key Results Most of the variance in species abundance and distribution was concentrated among closely related (i.e. congeneric) species, indicating evolutionary lability. Species distribution and abundance were unrelated to the number of close relatives, suggesting that competitive effects are diffuse. Distances between pairs of congeneric species in NMS space did not differ significantly from distances between more distantly related species, in contrast to the predictions of both competitive habitat partitioning and ecological sorting of species. Conclusions Eastern deciduous forests of North America do not appear to be saturated with species. The distributions and abundances of individual species provide little evidence of being shaped by competition from related (i.e. ecologically similar) species and, by inference, that diversification is constrained by interspecific competition.","Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA","Ricklefs, RE (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, One Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",ricklefs@umsl.edu,,,,,,115,5,5,4,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

We examined the relative importance of both biotic (initial height, conspecific seedling density) and abiotic (canopy openness, per cent sand, soil water content) drivers using survival data for 1842 seedlings of 12 dipterocarp species for 1.5 y following mast fruiting in an old-growth Bornean tropical rain forest. More than 30% of all dipterocarp seedlings survived 1.5 y after mast fruiting. When all species were analysed together, we found that initial seedling height, canopy openness and conspecific seedling density affected dipterocarp seedling survival. Negative density dependence indicated that predators were not satiated, but dipterocarp seedlings rather suffered from host-specific natural enemies or intraspecific competition.

Domestic dogs are unusual in that play is routinely performed by adults, both socially, with conspecifics and with humans, and also asocially, with objects. This enhanced playfulness is commonly thought to be a side effect of paedomorphosis, the perpetuation of juvenile traits into adulthood, but here we suggest that the functions of the different types of play are sufficiently distinct that they are unlikely to have arisen through a single evolutionary mechanism. Solitary play with objects appears to be derived from predatory behaviour: preferred toys are those that can be dismembered, and a complex habituation-like feedback system inhibits play with objects that are resistant to alteration. Intraspecific social play is structurally different from interspecific play and may therefore be motivationally distinct and serve different goals; for example, dogs often compete over objects when playing with other dogs, but are usually more cooperative when the play partner is human. The majority of dogs do not seem to regard competitive games played with a human partner as dominance contests: rather, winning possession of objects during games appears to be simply rewarding. Play may be an important factor in sociality, since dogs are capable of extracting social information not only from games in which they participate, but also from games that they observe between third parties. We suggest that the domestic dog's characteristic playfulness in social contexts is an adaptive trait, selected during domestication to facilitate both training for specific purposes, and the formation of emotionally-based bonds between dog and owner. Play frequency and form may therefore be an indicator of the quality of dog-owner relationships. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bradshaw, John W.

Morphological features that lead to increased locomotor performance, such as faster sprint speed, are thought to evolve in concert with habitat use. The latter depends on available habitat structure and how the animal moves within that habitat. Thus, this behavioural variation will impact how natural selection acts on locomotion and morphology. Quantifying the interplay between escape behaviour and locomotor morphology across habitats that vary in structural composition could reveal how selection acts on locomotion at local levels. Substrate features, such as incline and topographical variation, are likely key drivers of morphological and functional disparity among terrestrial animals. We investigated the impact of habitat variation and escape behaviour on morphology, including the adhesive system, of Rhoptropus afer, a diurnal and cursorial gecko from Namibia. Substrate incline and topographical variation are likely important for this pad-bearing gecko due to the trade-off between adhering and sprinting (i.e. using adhesion results in decreased sprint speed). We corroborate the hypothesis that the adhesive system exhibits the greatest degree of reduction in populations that utilize the flattest terrain during an escape. Our findings suggest that the adhesive apparatus is detrimental to rapid locomotion on relatively horizontal surfaces and may thus be counterproductive to the evasion of predators in such situations. A broad scale analysis of geckos would determine whether diversity of adhesive morphology is driven primarily by habitat use. Phenotypic plasticity of the adhesive system and interspecific competition are plausible candidates for driving our results. However, it is unclear whether the differences we observed have a genetic basis. Future work should focus on how variation of the adhesive system impacts downstream locomotor components such as kinematics and mechanics and how the integration of these traits is related to habitat use.","[Collins, Clint E.; Higham, Timothy E.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Russell, Anthony P.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Collins, CE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",clint.collins@email.ucr.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1147043]; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [9745-2008],"The Namibia Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources and Gobabeb Research and Training Centre provided valuable laboratory space, accommodation and advice.

In predator communities, interspecific interactions are influenced by a diversity of factors; therefore, the behavioural patterns of composing species will differ due to locally adapted interactions. We deployed 32-41 camera-traps in five study areas across the Iberian Peninsula to investigate the temporal relations between mesocarnivores in SW Europe. The selection for a period of the diel cycle and plasticity in activity patterns was evaluated using the Jacobs Selection Index (JSI) and the coefficient of activity overlap (a dagger(1)). Furthermore, we investigated whether temporal shifts can facilitate coexistence by reducing activity overlap. Seven species of mesocarnivores were detected and were assigned into one of three behaviourally distinct groups: diurnal (JSI(day) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.8), strictly nocturnal (JSI(night) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.8) or facultative nocturnal species (0.4 a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand JSI(night) > 0.8). Most species exhibited substantial flexibility, which allowed them to locally adapt their foraging strategies (intraspecific a dagger(1) = 0.70-0.77). Mean Delta(1) from all interspecific pairwise comparisons was negatively correlated with the number of carnivore species with a parts per thousand yen10 detections (r -0.76, p = 0.02). Our results suggest that temporal segregation is likely to play an important role in facilitating mesocarnivore coexistence, especially with increasing community complexity, where most species' activity peaks were asynchronous. These results contribute to understanding the dynamics and behavioural strategies of coexisting mesocarnivores, crucial for forecasting the possible outcomes of conservation or management actions.","[Monterroso, Pedro; Ferreras, Pablo] CSIC UCLM JCCM, IREC, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; [Monterroso, Pedro; Alves, Paulo Celio] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBio, P-4485661 Vairao, Vila Do Conde, Portugal; [Monterroso, Pedro; Alves, Paulo Celio] Univ Porto, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias, P-4150150 Oporto, Portugal; [Alves, Paulo Celio] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59801 USA","Monterroso, P (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBio, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Vila Do Conde, Portugal.",pmonterroso@cibio.up.pt,"Ferreras, Pablo/A-6017-2009; Monterroso, Pedro/F-1809-2013; Alves, Paulo C/B-5448-2009","Ferreras, Pablo/0000-0002-1116-6706; Monterroso, Pedro/0000-0002-7911-3651; Alves, Paulo C/0000-0003-4797-0939",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BD/37795/2007]; Spanish National Plan - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CGL2009-10741]; EU-FEDER fundsEuropean Commission; Spanish Organismo Autonomo Parques Nacionales [OAPN 352/2011],"This work was partially supported by a PhD grant from the Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) to PM (SFRH/BD/37795/2007) and two research projects, one from the Spanish National Plan (project ref: CGL2009-10741) funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and EU-FEDER funds, and another one from the Spanish Organismo Autonomo Parques Nacionales (project ref: OAPN 352/2011).

All individual trees with diameter at breast height larger than 2.5 cm in a 1-ha plot were mapped and measured. The overall pattern of this species was a regular distribution at scales up to 2 in. Its juveniles and subadults were strongly aggregated, but adult trees were regular at scales of up to 3 m, implying evidence of density dependent thinning. The spatial pattern of S. macrophyllus strongly affected the patterning of the whole plot. In S. macrophyllus, juveniles and subadults were similarly distributed relative to adults and showed additional clumping independent of the adults. The overall interspecific association between adults of other species and S. macrophyllus at different life-history stages also showed independence. We conclude that S. macrophyllus is a predominant competitor within the community and it follows a gap-phase regeneration mode.","[Nguyen, H.; Wiegand, K.; Getzin, S.] Univ Goettingen, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, Dept Ecosyst Modelling, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Getzin, S.] UFZ, UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modeling, D-04301 Leipzig, Germany","Nguyen, H (corresponding author), Hatay Community Coll, Fac Agr Sci, Hanoi, Vietnam.",hatay@fpt.vn,,"Wiegand, Kerstin/0000-0003-4854-0607; Nguyen, Hai/0000-0001-5066-7565","Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam; Ministry of Science and Culture, State of Lower Saxony (Ministry of Science and Culture; Cluster of Excellence 'Functional Biodiversity Research')","This study was financed by the Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam and the Ministry of Science and Culture, State of Lower Saxony (Ministry of Science and Culture; Cluster of Excellence 'Functional Biodiversity Research').

Although insufficient to prove coexistence, trait comparisons provide a first step to identify functional differences between co-occurring congeneric species in relation to mechanisms of coexistence. Here, a comparative review on life history and ecological traits is presented for two pairs of co-occurring species of spiny lobsters in the genus Panulirus: P. gracilis and P. inflatus from the Eastern Central Pacific region, and P. argus and P. guttatus from the Caribbean region. Panulirus gracilis and P. inflatus have similar larval, postlarval, and adult sizes and a similar diet, but differ in degree of habitat specialization, fecundity, and growth rate. However, little is known on behavioral traits of these two species that may influence their competitive abilities and susceptibility to predators. The more abundant information on P. argus and P. guttatus shows that these two species differ more broadly in degree of habitat specialization, larval, postlarval and adult sizes, diet, fecundity, growth rate, degree of sociality, defense mechanisms, susceptibility to predators, and chemical ecology, suggesting a greater degree of niche differentiation between P. argus and P. guttatus than between P. gracilis and P. inflatus. Whether the substantial niche differentiation and apparent interspecific trade-offs between P. argus and P. guttatus relative to P. gracilis and P. inflatus reflect an earlier divergence of the former pair of species in the evolution of the genus constitutes an intriguing hypothesis. However, whether or not post-divergence evolution of each species pair occurred in sympatry remains uncertain.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales, Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico","Briones-Fourzan, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales, Prol Av Ninos Heroes S-N, Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico.",briones@cmarl.unam.mx,"Fourzan, Patricia Briones/AAD-4736-2020","Briones-Fourzan, Patricia/0000-0003-4096-1415",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de MexicoUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (Mexico)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [101200],"Support for elaborating and presenting this review at the 2013 Summer Meeting of The Crustacean Society in San Jose, Costa Rica, was provided by Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (Mexico) through Project No. 101200.

Understanding resource use within these species assemblages may help predict how species relative abundance might influence ecosystem functioning. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, 4 species of rorqual whales (blue Balaenoptera musculus, fin B. physalus, minke B. acutorostrata and humpback Megaptera novaeangliae) coexist during the summer feeding period. They can be observed within hundreds of meters of one another, suggesting an overlap in ecological niches; yet fine-scale habitat use analyses suggest some resource partitioning. While major ecological changes have been observed in marine ecosystems, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, we have little understanding of how the removal of predatory fish might cascade through ecosystems. Here, we take advantage of a 19 yr tissue collection subsequent to a fishery collapse (which occurred in 1992) to investigate trophic niche partitioning within a guild of rorqual whales following the loss of a key ecosystem component, groundfish. We analyzed stable isotope ratios for 626 rorqual individuals sampled between 1992 and 2010. Using Bayesian isotopic mixing models, we demonstrated that the 4 rorqual species segregated trophically by consuming different proportions of shared prey. An overall increase in delta N-15 values over the study period (post groundfish collapse), particularly for fin and humpback whales, suggested a progressive use of higher-trophic level prey, such as small pelagic fish, whereas the stability of blue whale diet over time confirmed their specialized feeding behaviour. This study provides the first long-term assessment of trophic ecology among rorqual populations on this Northwest Atlantic feeding ground, and evidence for differential resource use among large marine predators following ecosystem change.","[Gavrilchuk, Katherine; Beauplet, Gwenael] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Gavrilchuk, Katherine; Ramp, Christian; Sears, Richard] Mingan Isl Cetacean Study, St Lambert, PQ J4P 1T3, Canada; [Lesage, Veronique] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Maurice Lamontagne Inst, Mont Joli, PQ G5H 3Z4, Canada; [Berube, Martine] Univ Groningen, Ctr Evolutionary & Ecol Studies, NL-9712 CP Groningen, Netherlands; [Bearhop, Stuart] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England","Gavrilchuk, K (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Quebec Ocean, 1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",katy.gavrilchuk@gmail.com,"Lesage, Veronique/ABE-2682-2020; Bearhop, Stuart/G-3105-2012","Bearhop, Stuart/0000-0002-5864-0129; Berube, Martine/0000-0002-1831-2657",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); J.-Arthur Vincent Foundation; Quebec-Ocean; NSERC-Individual Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); FQRNT-Etablissement Nouveaux Chercheurs,"We extend special thanks to the Mingan Island Cetacean Study (MICS) team for rorqual data collection, and S.

These changes also may affect the evolution of natural populations either directly or indirectly by altering the outcome of species interactions that are important drivers of evolution. This latter indirect pathway may be especially important for evolutionary responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO(2)), which appear to have minimal direct effects on plant evolution but have large effects on interspecific interactions, such as competition. We manipulated competitive and CO2 environments of experimental Arabidopsis thaliana populations to test whether eCO(2) alters evolutionary trajectories indirectly by altering selection imposed by competitors. We found that interspecific competition increased selection on growth traits, reduced heritabilities, and altered genetic covariances between traits and that the magnitude of these effects depended upon the CO2 environment. Although eCO(2) had minimal direct effects on evolutionary processes, eCO(2) typically reduced the strength of selection imposed by competitors and, therefore, relaxed selection on plant traits when competitors were present. Our results indicate that global changes may affect plant evolution indirectly by altering competitive interactions and underscore the importance of conducting research in natural communities when attempting to predict population responses to global change.","[Lau, Jennifer A.; Tiffin, Peter] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Shaw, Ruth G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forestry, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia","Lau, JA (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",jenlau@msu.edu,,"Tiffin, Peter/0000-0003-1975-610X; Lau, Jennifer/0000-0002-8344-5421; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOB 0620318, DEB 0080382, 0322057]","We thank M.

In other words, kin selection-a form of intra-population dynamics-might enhance the species richness of the community, a higher-level structure. The converse effect, from higher to lower levels, might also operate, whereby strong interspecific competition may limit the evolution of selfish individual traits. If the latter effect were to prove more important, it would challenge the common view that intra-population dynamics (via individual or gene selection) is the main driver of evolution.","Univ Ryukyus, Kagoshima Univ, Fac Agr, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan","Tsuji, K (corresponding author), Univ Ryukyus, Kagoshima Univ, Fac Agr, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.",tsujik@agr.u-ryukyu.ac.jp,"Tsuji, Kazuki/D-6607-2014","Tsuji, Kazuki/0000-0002-2027-8582","KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23405011, 25660266]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23405011, 25660266] Funding Source: KAKEN",This study was supported in part by KAKENHI (23405011 and 25660266).,,33,7,7,0,24,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

Kleptoparasitic interactions, whereby crabs take prey from whelks, have been documented, although results from previous experiments are not consistent with respect to the presence and frequency of such interactions, perhaps because of the sizes of crabs used. We conducted a lab experiment to clarify the effects of interactions among crabs and whelks on consumption of blue mussels. Crab density, size, and whelk presence were manipulated, and number of mussels and mussel sizes consumed by crabs were assessed during a series of 10-day trials. In the absence of whelks, two small crabs foraging together consumed no more prey than a single crab, suggesting substantial inhibition of feeding through interference competition or other negative intraspecific interactions. Presence of whelks led to increased consumption, either through a reduction of this interference or other stimulatory mechanisms. Such effects were less apparent for large crabs and small crabs feeding without conspecifics. We found clear evidence of kleptoparasitism in all crab treatments, though this feeding mode only contributed substantially to the diet of small crabs in the presence of conspecifics. Small crabs feeding in pairs kleptoparasitized larger mussels than they consumed independently, allowing them to exploit prey larger than they usually would. Our size-specific results highlight the importance of considering predator size when studying such interactions. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We incubated a mixed natural diatom community from coastal New Zealand waters in a short-term (two-week) incubation experiment using a factorial matrix of warming and/or elevated pCO(2) and measured effects on community structure. We then isolated the dominant diatoms in clonal cultures and conditioned them for 1 year under the same temperature and pCO(2) conditions from which they were isolated, in order to allow for extended selection or acclimation by these abiotic environmental change factors in the absence of interspecific interactions. These conditioned isolates were then recombined into 'artificial' communities modelled after the original natural assemblage and allowed to compete under conditions identical to those in the short-term natural community experiment. In general, the resulting structure of both the unconditioned natural community and conditioned 'artificial' community experiments was similar, despite differences such as the loss of two species in the latter. pCO(2) and temperature had both individual and interactive effects on community structure, but temperature was more influential, as warming significantly reduced species richness. In this case, our short-term manipulative experiment with a mixed natural assemblage spanning weeks served as a reasonable proxy to predict the effects of global change forcing on diatom community structure after the component species were conditioned in isolation over an extended timescale. Future studies will be required to assess whether or not this is also the case for other types of algal communities from other marine regimes.","[Tatters, Avery O.; Schnetzer, Astrid; Fu, Feixue; Caron, David A.; Lie, Alle A.

Organisms often have smaller body sizes under warmer climates (Bergmann's rule and the temperature-size rule), and body size is a major determinant of life histories, demography, population size, nutrient turnover rate, and food-web structure. Therefore, by altering body sizes in whole communities, current warming can potentially disrupt ecosystem function and services. However, the underlying drivers of warming-induced body downsizing remain far from clear. Here, we show that thermal clines in body size are predicted from universal laws of ecology and metabolism, so that size-dependent selection from competition (both intra and interspecific) and predation favors smaller individuals under warmer conditions. We validate this prediction using 4.1x10(6) individual body size measurements from French river fish spanning 29years and 52 species. Our results suggest that warming-induced body downsizing is an emergent property of size-structured food webs, and highlight the need to consider trophic interactions when predicting biosphere reorganizations under global warming.","[Edeline, Eric] Univ Paris 06, UMR BIOEMCO 7618, Ecole Normale Super, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Lacroix, Gerard] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR BIOEMCO 7618, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Lacroix, Gerard] UMS CEREEP Ecotron IleDeFrance 3194, F-77140 St Pierre Les Nemours, France; [Delire, Christine] CNRS Meteo France, UMR GAME CNRM 3589, Toulouse, France; [Poulet, Nicolas] French Natl Agcy Water & Aquat Environm ONEMA, Direct Action Sci & Tech, F-94300 Vincennes, France; [Legendre, Stephane] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR Ecol & Evolut 7625, F-75230 Paris 05, France","Edeline, E (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, UMR BIOEMCO 7618, Ecole Normale Super, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75230 Paris 05, France.",edeline@biologie.ens.fr,,"Poulet, Nicolas/0000-0002-5611-0749; Delire, Christine/0000-0002-6114-3211",French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR); ANR BLANCFrench National Research Agency (ANR); PHYTBACK [10-BLAN-1709-01]; ANR CEPSFrench National Research Agency (ANR); PULSE project; ANR PEXTFrench National Research Agency (ANR); EVORANGE project,"This study was supported by research grants from the French National Research Agency (ANR BLANC, PHYTBACK project 10-BLAN-1709-01, ANR CEP&S, PULSE project, ANR PEXT, EVORANGE project).

Future predictions of fish distributions and catches based on bioclimate envelope models are available, but to date they have not considered interspecific interactions. We address this by combining the species-based Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model (DBEM) with a size-based trophic model. The new approach provides spatially and temporally resolved predictions of changes in species' size, abundance and catch potential that account for the effects of ecological interactions. Predicted latitudinal shifts are, on average, reduced by 20% when species interactions are incorporated, compared to DBEM predictions, with pelagic species showing the greatest reductions. Goodness-of-fit of biomass data from fish stock assessments in the North Atlantic between 1991 and 2003 is improved slightly by including species interactions. The differences between predictions from the two models may be relatively modest because, at the North Atlantic basin scale, (i) predators and competitors may respond to climate change together; (ii) existing parameterization of the DBEM might implicitly incorporate trophic interactions; and/or (iii) trophic interactions might not be the main driver of responses to climate. Future analyses using ecologically explicit models and data will improve understanding of the effects of inter-specific interactions on responses to climate change, and better inform managers about plausible ecological and fishery consequences of a changing environment.","[Fernandes, Jose A.; Jennings, Simon; Grant, Alastair] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Fernandes, Jose A.; Butenschoen, Momme; de Mora, Lee; Barange, Manuel] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL13 DH, Devon, England; [Cheung, William W.

Currently, predictions on the vulnerability of ecological communities to extinction cascades are based on models that focus on bottom-up effects, which cannot capture the effects of extinctions at higher trophic levels. We show, in experimental insect communities, that harvesting of single carnivorous parasitoid species led to a significant increase in extinction rate of other parasitoid species, separated by four trophic links. Harvesting resulted in the release of prey from top-down control, leading to increased interspecific competition at the herbivore trophic level. This resulted in increased extinction rates of non-harvested parasitoid species when their host had become rare relative to other herbivores. The results demonstrate a mechanism for horizontal extinction cascades, and illustrate that altering the relationship between a predator and its prey can cause wide-ranging ripple effects through ecosystems, including unexpected extinctions.","[Sanders, Dirk; Sutter, Louis] Inst Ecol & Evolut, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Sanders, Dirk; van Veen, F.

Though the spatial patterning of fruits, leaves, and insects has been explored among primate foods, comparatively less is known about exudate distributions. Tree exudates are a renewable resource, provide long-term evidence of exploitation, and may be selectively exploited to manipulate spatial distribution. We assessed the spatial patterning of trees gouged by common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to determine if they exhibit a uniform, random, or clumped distribution. We also asked whether marmosets selectively gouge trees in home range centers, which may afford them exclusive access to exudates. We explored whether spatial or physical characteristics of trees predict how intensely gouged trees were exploited. The mean nearest neighbor distance of gouged trees was significantly closer than expected for a random distribution and Ripley's K-function showed that gouged trees were clumped across all spatial scales in our study area. Clumping may enable marmosets to reduce day and home ranges and facilitate repeated gouging of trees. Gouged trees were not closer to marmosets' home range centers than peripheries, nor were centrally located trees more intensely gouged. Increased gouging intensity was associated with larger tree circumferences, although this effect was primarily driven by interspecific differences in circumference. Although marmosets may benefit from exploiting clumped exudates, they do not concentrate gouging in areas where they are more likely to gain exclusive access. Species-specific tree characteristics such as exudate quality and/or bark properties may play a larger role in determining gouging patterns than intergroup feeding competition.","[Thompson, Cynthia L.; Robl, Nicholas J.; Vinyard, Christopher J.] NE Ohio Med Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Rootstown, OH 44272 USA; [Robl, Nicholas J.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Valena-Montenegro, Monica M.] Ctr Nacl Pesquisa & Conservacao Primatas Brasilei, Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao Biodiversidade, BR-70670350 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Maranhao Valle, Yumma Bernardo; Borstelmann de Oliveira, Maria Adelia] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Lab Ecofisiol & Comportamento Anim, Dept Morfol & Fisiol Anim, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil","Thompson, CL (corresponding author), NE Ohio Med Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Rootstown, OH 44272 USA.",cthompson@neomed.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-0094666]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; Leakey Foundation,"We thank P.

We found geographic mosaics in associations between lucanid beetles (Dorcus rectus and Dorcus striatipennis) and symbiotic mites (Haitlingeria sp. and Sandrophela sp., respectively) that were caused by the collapse of host specificity in the northern part of Japan. Haitlingeria sp. was only collected from the surface of the exoskeleton of D. rectus in south and central Japan. Sandrophela sp. showed host specificity in southern to central Japan but was found on both beetle species in areas where Haitlingeria sp. was not found. Because Haitlingeria sp. was able to reproduce on D. rectus collected from Haitlingeria-free regions and no significant differences were observed in average temperature between the host-specific and nonspecific regions bordering on each other, we suggest that the expansion of Haitlingeria sp. in the north has been limited for unknown reasons. When both mites were placed together on D. rectus, only Haitlingeria sp. reproduced, probably because it killed Sandrophela sp., especially juveniles. Thus, we conclude that Sandrophela sp. has expanded its host use to include D. rectus in areas where Haitlingeria sp. is absent. We hypothesise that false host specificity in the canestriniids has been maintained by habitat isolation and/or aggressive behaviour toward competitors.

Shrimps were the most important prey categories in the diet of R. velezi, while teleosts and cephalopods dominated the diet of M. henlei. Diet comparisons between different stages of R. velezi and M. henlei revealed clear ontogenetic dietary shifts: crustaceans (mainly shrimps, crabs and stomatopods) dominated the diet of immature individuals, and adults had a higher proportion of teleosts. The results suggest that R. velezi is an epibenthic predator that specializes in shrimps during early life stages, and to a lesser extent, teleosts as it matures, while M. henlei is an opportunistic predator with a highly diverse diet consisting of teleosts, cephalopods, shrimps and stomatopods. This study also found little evidence of dietary overlap between species or life stages and suggests that intra- and interspecific competition between R. velezi and M. henlei may be reduced by: (1) diet specialization in immature stages of R. velezi, (2) ontogenetic dietary shifts between immature and mature individuals, (3) prey-size selectivity in larger individuals of R. velezi and (4) differences in depth utilization in overlapping geographical regions.","[Espinoza, M.; Wehrtmann, I.

Although evolutionary game theory and the dynamic modelling of leaf turnover have been suggested useful to solve this problem, there is no model that combines these features. Here, we present such a model of leaf area dynamics that incorporates game theory. Leaf area index (LAI; leaf area per unit ground area) was predicted to increase with an increasing degree of interaction between genetically distinct neighbour plants in light interception. This implies that stands of clonal plants that consist of genetically identical daughter ramets have different LAI from other plants. LAI was also sensitive to the assumed vertical pattern of leaf shedding: LAI was predicted to increase with the degree to which leaves were assumed to be shed from higher positions in the canopy. Our model provides more realistic predictions of LAI than previous static optimization, dynamic optimization or static game theoretical models. We suggest that both leaf dynamics and game theoretical considerations of plant competition are indispensable to scale from individual leaf traits to the structure and functioning of vegetation stands, especially in herbaceous species.","[Hikosaka, Kouki] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Hikosaka, Kouki] JST, CREST, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020076, Japan; [Anten, Niels P.

Here, we develop a model that quantifies the impact of size-specific interspecies competition on abundances of differently sized dinosaurs and mammals, taking into account the extended niche breadth realized during ontogeny among large oviparous species. Our model predicts low diversity at intermediate size classes (between approx. 1 and 1000 kg), consistent with observed diversity distributions of dinosaurs, and of Mesozoic land vertebrates in general. It also provides a mechanism-based on an understanding of different ecological and evolutionary constraints across vertebrate groups-that explains how mammals and birds, but not dinosaurs, were able to persist beyond the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, and how post-K-T mammals were able to diversify into larger size categories.","[Codron, Daryl; Mueller, Dennis W.

Ecological character displacement (evolutionary divergence among populations of interacting species within a community), as well as community-wide character displacement (even dispersion of species traits within a community via species sorting), have been widely reported and are typically interpreted as evidence for interspecific competition. However, defining an appropriate null distribution with which to assess the observed distribution of traits within a community has proved controversial. Phylogenetic methods provide an alternative approach to evaluating community structure, but such methods also require an appropriate null and have typically overlooked the potential for evolutionary dynamics within communities. Here, we present a novel phylogenetic framework that uses evolutionary expectations to generate a simple null model of the expected distribution of traits among co-occurring species. Using a stochastic Brownian motion model of trait change, we illustrate that the expected community-wide dispersion of traits varies with phylogenetic tree shape. We then use data on body mass for mammals to evaluate the accuracy with which phylogeny can predict the empirical distribution of traits and find a strong correlation between predicted and observed trait distributions. We suggest that deviations from phylogenetic expectations may therefore provide a useful tool for evaluating the role of competition in shaping community structure. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach using empirical data on body mass and a phylogeny for a small community of terrestrial mammals in Yotvata, Israel, and reveal evidence consistent with ecological and community-wide character displacement. Our method unites ecological and evolutionary approaches, and it provides a novel framework for exploring community structure.","[Davies, T.

Mobile facultative scavengers are likely to negatively impact tundra biodiversity as dominant competitors or predators, if they spill over into tundra. Here, we provide the first quantitative assessments of the structure of a scavenger guild in low arctic tundra with emphasis on how it changes along spatial gradients from neighbouring ecosystems (i.e. forest and coast) and with altitude (i.e. productivity gradients). We also assess the likelihood of interactions between guild members that may negatively impact vulnerable tundra species. Location North-eastern part of Norway. Methods Extensive records of scavenger prevalence were obtained by deploying automatic digital cameras at experimental carcasses in tundra regions covering several thousand square kilometres and three winters in northern Norway. Main conclusions We found short-range neighbourhood effects of forest and coast within the tundra scavenger guild. Species richness declined steeply with decreasing distance from the neighbouring ecosystems, in particular subarctic forest, and with increasing altitude. Bird species with strongholds in forest (golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos and hooded crow Corvus cornix) or along the coast (white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla) were mostly responsible for short-range neighbourhood effects on guild structure. However, the two most abundant guild members, the common raven Corvus corax and the red fox Vulpes vulpes, exhibited no spatial patterns within the range of neighbourhoods and altitudes examined. There was a clear diurnal segregation in the use of carcasses between birds and mammals reducing the likelihood of direct interactions between these two taxa. Presence of red fox appeared to exclude the arctic fox Vulpes lagopus, the only endemic tundra species within the guild, from carcasses.","[Killengreen, Siw T.; Stromseng, Elise; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Killengreen, ST (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",siw.killengreen@uit.no,"Killengreen, Siw/G-9205-2016; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039",Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management,"We would like to thank Ashild Bye, John Andre Henden, Erik Isakson, Bjorn Hugo Kristoffersen, Arne Petter Sarre, Elin Skog and Alfred Orjebu for skilled help during field work.

Bogs are nutrient-poor peatland ecosystems that are sensitive to nitrogen (N) deposition. Production of peat mosses (i.e. the peat-forming genus Sphagnum) is known to decrease under elevated N deposition, but the causal mechanisms are poorly understood. 2. It is predicted that increased N deposition will cause changes in Sphagnum species composition, with fast-growing species benefiting from increased N availability in contrast to slow-growing species. Knowledge of species-specific responses to N availability can help us to understand interspecific competitive relationships. 3. We investigated the direct effects of N application on plant physiology in three Sphagnum species by exposing shoots to a range of N doses (corresponding to depositions of 0-5 6 g m) 2 year) 1), over 5 months, in a greenhouse experiment. The species investigated included one that grows high above the water-table (Sphagnum fuscum) and two that grow lower down (Sphagnum balticum and Sphagnum fallax). S. fuscum and S. balticum originate from ombrotrophic and S. fallax from minerotrophic environments. To estimate N responses, we measured the performance and light-capture kinetics of the photosynthetic apparatus (maximum photosynthetic rate and Fv/Fm), biomass production, shoot formation, and N and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the tissue. 4. Tissue nitrogen concentration generally increased with N application rate, and photosynthetic rate increased with N concentration, although S. balticum exhibited a unimodal response. With respect to production, a negative response to N application rate was found in S. fallax and S. fuscum (weak), while production in S. balticum was unrelated to application rate. S. fallax was the fastest-growing species, producing two to three times more biomass per shoot compared with the other species. 5. The mismatch between photosynthetic capacity and production could partly be explained by an increased N : P ratio following N application. Phosphorus limitation may not negatively affect photosynthetic capacity, but may hamper production. 6. The fast-growing species S. fallax is considered to benefit from increased N deposition, but we found a negative physiological response, suggesting stoichiometric constraints. Thus, we conclude that responses to N deposition cannot be predicted in a simple way from physiological traits related to growth rate without considering local environmental factors.","[Granath, Gustaf; Rydin, Hakan] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Plant Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Strengbom, Joachim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Granath, G (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Plant Ecol & Evolut, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",Gustaf.Granath@ebc.uu.se,"Granath, Gustaf/AAE-7759-2019","Granath, Gustaf/0000-0002-3632-9102; Strengbom, Joachim/0000-0002-1720-5016",FormasSwedish Research Council Formas; VRSwedish Research Council,We wish to thank Juul Limpens and Rien Aerts for comments on the manuscript.

The influence of body size on coexistence is well studied under the exclusive resources framework, but has received less attention under the shared-resources framework. We investigate body-size-dependent allometric extensions of a classical MacArthur-type model where two consumers compete for two shared resources. The equilibrium coexistence criteria are compared against the general predictions of the alternative framework over exclusive resources. From the asymmetry in body size allometry of resource encounter versus demand our model shows, counterintuitively, and contrary to the exclusive resource framework, that a smaller consumer should be competitively superior across a wide range of supplies of the two resource types. Experimental studies are reviewed to resolve this difference among the two frameworks that arise from their respective assumptions over resource distribution. Another prediction is that the smaller consumer may have relatively stronger control over equilibrium resource abundance, and the loss of smaller consumers from a community may induce relatively stronger trophic cascades. Finally, from satiating consumers' functional response, our model predicts that greater difference among resource sizes can allow a broader range of consumer body sizes to coexist, and this is consistent with the predictions of the alternative framework over exclusive resources. Overall, this analysis provides an objective comparison of the two alternative approaches to understand species coexistence that have heretofore developed in relative isolation. It advances classical consumer-resource theory to show how body size can be an important factor in resource competition and coexistence.","[Bagchi, Sumanta] Texas A&M Univ, Deparment Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Bagchi, Sumanta; Ritchie, Mark E.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Bagchi, Sumanta] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore 570002, Karnataka, India","Bagchi, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Deparment Ecosyst Sci & Management, 325 Anim Ind Bldg, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",sumanta@ncf-india.org,,,"National Science Foundation (DDIG)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0608287, DEB-0543398]; National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; Wildlife Conservation Society; Rufford Maurice Laing Foundation","Support was received from National Science Foundation (DDIG DEB-0608287 to SB and DEB-0543398 to MER) and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (to MER) while preparing this manuscript.

An understanding of how heathlands change through time is central to the development of management strategies that aim to conserve them and maintain coexistence of their plants and animals. We briefly review the development of this understanding for Sydney's coastal heathlands from the emergence of the first published work in the 1930s. In our previous work, we focussed on fire regimes and interspecific competition between plants as important processes that drive ecosystem dynamics (succession) and mediate species coexistence and diversity. Here, we synthesise our understanding of heathland dynamics into a state and transition framework. We first develop a simple classification of heathland states based on their composition of plant functional types and developmental stage with time since fire. We then propose a qualitative model that predicts transitions between states conditional upon intervals between fires,, fire-mediated life cycle processes of component plant species and interactions between species. We applied the model to predict qualitative changes in heathland state under contrasting fire regime scenarios, and tested example predictions using a long-term study of heathland dynamics in Royal National Park. Empirical observations of overstorey and understorey change were generally consistent with model predictions, subject to variability between sites. Importantly, the model helps to identify fire scenarios that promote dynamic coexistence of multiple heathland states that each support different components of heathland biota. We conclude that simple process models can be very useful for informing management decisions by describing expected responses to alternative management strategies. These predictions lend themselves to testing in adaptive management experiments that seek to spread risks and improve understanding of ecosystem dynamics for future management.","[Keith, David A.; Tozer, Mark G.] New South Wales Off Environm & Heritage, Hurstville, NSW 2220, Australia; [Keith, David A.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Wetlands & Rivers Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Keith, DA (corresponding author), New South Wales Off Environm & Heritage, POB 1967, Hurstville, NSW 2220, Australia.",david.keith@unsw.edu.au; mark.tozer@environment.nsw.gov.au,,,,,,39,8,9,0,10,LINNEAN SOC NEW SOUTH WALES,NEW SOUTH WALES,"PO BOX 137, MATRAVILLE, NEW SOUTH WALES, 2036, AUSTRALIA",0370-047X,,,P LINN SOC N S W,Proc.

With the ever increasing popularity of home aquaria, there is now an urgent need to address our current lack of knowledge regarding welfare of mixed-species assemblages. Here we investigated the welfare of four commonly kept species of ornamental fish held in different species combinations and group sizes. Specifically we asked two questions (1) whether the presence of angelfish (Pterophylum scalare) altered the behaviour of a mixed group of white cloud mountain minnows (Tanichthys albonubes), neon tetras (Paracheirodon innesi) and tiger barbs (Barbus tetrazona) and (2) whether group size affected behaviour and welfare in a mixed group assemblage of angelfish, white cloud mountain minnows and neon tetras. Behaviours including intra and interspecific interactions (darting and aggressive attacks), shoaling, and use of environmental enrichment were measured. Angelfish appeared to have a beneficial effect on the welfare of small shoaling species by reducing aggression but had little effect on other behaviours. For white cloud mountain minnows and neon tetras, larger group sizes resulted in increased natural behaviours (i.e. a tendency to shoal). Interestingly, the present study highlighted the problems in predicting the effects of environmental enrichment with both species and group size altering the way enrichment was used (e.g. as shelter from competitors or as a resource worth aggressively defending). Setting scientifically determined guidelines on appropriate species assemblages or stocking densities for ornamental fish is challenged by the plethora of group sizes and combinations found within home aquaria; research as in the present study serves to provide insights into welfare issues which may not become apparent within unrepresentative, single-species studies.

Here, we present the results of a baseline study designed to assess the status of this exotic species in northeastern Ohio and to explore its potential impacts on local ant communities and the extent to which it has been incorporated into the diet of a native predator, the red-backed salamander. At the sites where N. flavipes occurred, we found a sixfold increase in total ant abundance, with 87% of all ants collected being N. flavipes. The high numerical dominance of N. flavipes did not lead to observable changes in the species richness and abundance of the native ant community. At baits, N. flavipes did not engage in interspecific combat and did not exhibit aggression towards native ants. Thus, aggression and interference competition are not likely factors explaining the high local abundance of N. flavipes. Red-backed salamanders have incorporated N. flavipes into their diet, but further research is needed to understand the interactions of N. flavipes within the forest-floor food web. Although we did not detect changes in the local ant communities in the presence of N. flavipes, we argue that this species' high local abundance and ability to forage at cooler temperatures may give it a competitive advantage and thereby affect native ants through exploitative competition.","[Ivanov, Kaloyan] Cleveland Museum Nat Hist, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Lockhart, Owen M.; Walton, B.

Males used small holes as spawning nests, usually staying at the nest and maintaining the area while showing exclusive behaviors. Their home ranges were limited to areas within 30 cm distance from the nest for over 2 months. Four heterospecific fishes were threatened when they approached to within 6-14 cm of the nest holes, and two species of carnivorous snails were removed at points 0-30 cm from the nest entrance. There were no significant differences between the distances from the nest entrances to the points defended against fish and those used for foraging. As the four heterospecific species have similar feeding habits to those of N. bryope, the area defended against fishes may function as a foraging territory. At 24 h following the removal of nest owners, carnivorous snails had gathered to actively prey on eggs, indicating that the area defended against snails may function as a territory for protection against egg predators. Although the positions of females where males started courtship displays were significantly farther than the foraging points and the positions of threatened fishes, males displayed no territoriality against conspecific males. The fact that males did not leave the nest hole during the courtship suggests that it may be costly to maintain a courtship territory. These results show that males of tube blenny maintain territories for egg guarding and for protecting food resources around their nest holes in the spawning season.","[Murase, Atsunobu; Sunobe, Tomoki] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Fish Behav Ecol, Tateyama Stn, Field Sci Ctr, Chiba 2940308, Japan","Murase, A (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Fish Behav Ecol, Tateyama Stn, Field Sci Ctr, 670 Banda, Chiba 2940308, Japan.",atsunobum@yahoo.co.jp,,,,,,32,3,4,0,12,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",0289-0771,,,J ETHOL,J.

Eutrophic environments provide conditions for accelerating trematode transmission and this would increase the strength of interspecific interactions. To test these predictions, we provide the first known assessment for a pulmonate snail host, and for highly productive aquatic environments, of the rates of colonisation and extinction at the level of individual snail host patches, of a large guild of trematode species. Using a uniquely large dataset from a relatively long-term mark-recapture study of Lymnaea stagnalis in six eutrophic fishponds in central Europe, we demonstrate extraordinarily rapid colonisation by trematodes of a snail host, thus meeting the assumptions of the competitive exclusion model. Overall annual colonisation rates ranged from 243% to 503% year(-1) so that the odds of trematode establishment in an individual snail in these ponds are two to five times per year. Extinction rates were substantially lower than colonisation rates and, therefore, would not result in turnover rates high enough to significantly affect prevalence patterns in the snail populations. At the species level, analyses of sample-based estimates of probabilities of colonisation revealed that shared species traits associated with transmission and competitive abilities determined the limits of colonisation abilities. Colonisation rates were exceedingly high for the species transmitted to the snails passively via eggs. There was a significant effect of species competitive abilities on colonisation rates due to subordinate species being substantially better colonisers than both strong and weak dominants, a pattern consistent with the predictions of the competition-colonisation trade-off hypothesis. Our results suggest that, with the extraordinarily high trematode colonisation potential in the area studied, the spatial and temporal patterns of intraspecific heterogeneity in recruitment may provide conditions for intensification of interspecific interactions so that complex community assembly rules may be involved.

Competition is thought to be a major influence on community assembly, ecology and evolution; presence of competitors may cause divergence in traits related to resource use (character displacement). 2. Such traits, however, often vary clinally, and this phenomenon may be independent of the presence or absence of competing species. 3. The presence of such clines can either obscure the effects of competition, or create an impression that competition is operating when, in fact, it is not. 4. We corrected for clinal variation while testing for character displacement in two well-studied weasel (Mustela) guilds, in the Nearctic and the west Palaearctic. 5. Without accounting for clines, our results agreed with previous studies suggesting character displacement in these guilds. 6. However, when we corrected for clines, predictions of competition theory were not met - and often we obtained evidence for character convergence in sympatry. 7. This may suggest that the nature of the resource base may be more important than interspecific competition in shaping morphology and size in these carnivores. 8. Our results highlight the need to account for geographic variation when studying character displacement and cast some doubt on prevailing ideas regarding the effect of competition on morphological evolution.","[Meiri, Shai; Dayan, Tamar] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Simberloff, Daniel] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Meiri, S (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",uncshai@post.tau.ac.il,"Meiri, Shai/D-2403-2010","Meiri, Shai/0000-0003-3839-6330",Alon Fellowship,"We thank Emma Goldberg, Jonathan Davies, Russ Lande and Ally Bede Phillimore for valuable discussion.

With regard to a large community scale, the recently propounded neutral theory suggests that species abundances are more influenced by history and chance than they are by interspecies competition. This inference is mainly based on the probability that competitive exclusion is largely slowed by recruitment limitation, which may be common in species rich communities. In this respect, a theoretical study conducted by Hurtt and Pacala (1995) for a niche differentiated community has been frequently cited to support neutral coexistence. In this paper, we focused on the effect of symmetric recruitment limitation on delaying species competitive exclusion caused by both symmetric and asymmetric competition in a large homogeneous habitat. By removing niche differentiation in space, we found that recruitment limitation could delay competitive exclusion to some extent, but the effect was rather limited compared to that predicted by Hurtt and Pacala's model for a niche differentiated community. Our results imply that niche differentiation may be important for species coexistence even on large scales and this has already been confirmed in some species rich communities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the breeding performance of the second generation was evaluated in three bivoltine populations of I. typographus in the SE Alps. Length of the maternal galleries (from 40.5 to 44.8 mm), population growth rate (PGR; from 0.7 to 3.6), and emerged adults per m(2) (from 669 to 1,570 insects/m(2)) varied among populations and were negatively correlated with bark colonisation density. Pheromone traps set up in the three investigated forests differed in the number of trapped beetles, with mean captures ranging between 5,310 and 19,850 insects per trap. The populations giving the highest captures in the traps showed the lowest bark colonisation density (248 vs. 489 maternal galleries per m(2)) and the best breeding performance. The populations of parasitoids and predators corresponded to just 1-9 and 2-10% of the emerging I. typographus adults, respectively, and phloem temperature never reached thresholds lethal to I. typographus. Interspecific competition was negligible, whereas intraspecific competition was found to be the main factor affecting the breeding performance of the second generation, although with different intensity according to the colonisation density. It is hypothesised that competition with the first generation and spring precipitation influence the number of suitable hosts available to the second generation.","[Faccoli, Massimo] Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy; [Bernardinelli, Iris] Univ Udine, Dept Biol, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Faccoli, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy.",massimo.faccoli@unipd.it,"Faccoli, Massimo/AAC-8141-2020",,"Direzione Centrale delle Risorse Agricole, Naturali, Forestali e della Montagna-Regione Autonoma Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy); PRIN projectMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN) [200774ENMR]","The authors would like to thank Fabio Stergulc, Olle Anderbrant, Andrea Battisti, Marc Kenis and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments on earlier versions of the manuscript, and to Alison Garside for linguistic proofreading.

We investigated the life history, annual production and competition of two congeneric mayflies: Andesiops torrens and Andesiops peruvianus in a Patagonian mountain headwater stream (La Hoya). From July 2004 to June 2005 a monthly sampling was conducted at riffle areas using a Surber net. Mean density of A. torrens ranged from 26 to 1080 ind m(-2) whereas that of A. peruvianus ranged from 7 to 629 ind m(-2). The annual production and P/B ratios of A. torrens (0.18 g m(-2), 3.90) and A. peruvianus (0.11 g m(-2), 3.35) at La Hoya stream were low, but within the expected values for cold water environments at high elevations. The two species had a similar larval life history with small larvae predominating in late summer and early autumn, middle size larvae being represented throughout winter, and mature larvae and emergence occurring in summer. As a result A. torrens and A. peruvianus showed moderately synchronized univoltine life cycles. The temporal interspecific overlap on both density and biomass was very low. This suggests that these two species of grazers reduce the competition for resources by having a marked temporal segregation. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

In other species, however, juveniles fledge with a body plumage that is just a pale representation of adult female plumage. The reasons for this variation are poorly understood. Several hypotheses concerning social (parent-offspring, adult-juvenile, juvenile-juvenile), ecological (predation risk) and physiological (costs of plumage development) implications of juvenile body plumage are presented in relation to predictions concerning associations with certain ecological and life-history attributes of avian species. In the present study, we conduct a phylogenetically corrected comparative analysis of Western Palearctic passerines looking for sources of variation in the incidence of distinct and adult-like juvenile body plumages. We scored plumages based on plates in the Handbook of the Birds of the Western Palearctic (Cramp & Perrins, 1988-1994; Oxford University Press) (HBWP) and entered body mass, migratory habits, habitat, nestling diet, breeding dispersion, gregariousness, duration of the nestling period, type of nest, conspicuousness of female plumage, and sexual dimorphism as explanatory variables, as presented in HBWP, in phylogenetic generalized least square regression analyses. One-third of the species presented distinct juvenile body plumages, which lasted on average for the first 2 months of life. Body mass, conspicuousness of female plumage, migratory habits, and habitat were significantly associated with interspecific variation in distinctness of juvenile plumage, with smaller species, more conspicuous species, migrants, and species from forested habitats showing distinct juvenile plumages with higher frequency. The phylogenetic signal was moderately high. Assuming that conspicuous adult plumage is costlier to produce than distinct juvenile body plumage (pigments, conspicuousness), the need to acquire social status among juveniles before the winter may explain the more adult-like plumage in resident species because juveniles will probably compete with individuals that they may have known during their first months of life. On the other hand, migrant juveniles may compete with a different set of individuals in winter quarters and can use savings in resources necessary for developing adult-like plumages to improve migration capacity by allocating resources to other functions. The association with habitat could be related to juveniles in open habitats participating in more extended interactions with other juveniles than in forested habitats where lower visibility may reduce the capacity to detect or respond to signals from juvenile conspecifics. More studies on this possibly crucial life stage are needed.

The present study focused on the effects of competition on trophic niche by: (1) analyzing temporal changes in the diet of Snowy Egret (Egretta thula) on a Brazilian mangrove swamp before and after its breeding site was colonized by two congeners, Little Blue Heron (E. caerulea) and Tricolored Heron (E. tricolor); and (2) comparing spatial changes in the diet of the three egret species at the study site with six additional localities from the literature. Nestling boluses were analyzed in the 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons, when Snowy Egret was the only species ill the area, and in 1995 and 1996, when the two other species were present. At the study site, although Snowy Egret consumed a greater proportion of molly fish (Poecilia spp.) than the two other egrets, all egrets fed mainly on mollies and shrimps, providing grounds for competition and trophic interference. However, contrary to the predictions of trade-off models, the Snowy Egret's trophic niche enlarged when the area was colonized by the other two egrets, suggesting that environmental variability is more relevant than competition in shaping trophic niche. The three egrets fed on similar resources to those found at other sites collated from the literature. Tricolored Heron appeared the most specialized species, showing a consistent, mangrove-related diet; Snowy Egret had a similar, but more variable diet, and Little Blue Heron showed the greatest trophic diversity, with a highly variable diet between sites. Overall, temporal and spatial variability in the trophic niches of egrets better match an independently-evolved pattern of resource use rather than predictions from competitive models of niche coevolution.

The fish, which was first collected in 1995, was probably introduced via the aquarium trade or through the Johor River in Malaysia. The growth, feeding and reproductive characteristics were found to follow its ecology in its native range in southern Asia, and its establishment in Singapore could be due to the similarity in environment and availability of food. Changes in intestinal length indicated diet shifts from a predominantly herbivorous to an omnivorous one as it matured. Stomach contents did not provide comparable evidence. Diet similarity to two other introduced cichlids may imply that interspecies resource competition exists. Closer monitoring is needed to determine its effects on the local environment.","[Ng, T.

We modify this classical competition model to allow interspecific cooperation through trading. We show that resource trade expands the realm of stable coexistence, and that optimal trading partners competitively invade and exclude any other trading or non-trading strategy. We show that natural selection favours evolution towards establishment of a trading relationship so long as partners can establish long-term associations even though cooperation may result in a decrease in abundance of one species. This theory substantively expands traditional applications of resource competition models and suggests additional empirical experimentation.","[de Mazancourt, Claire] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Schwartz, Mark W.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","de Mazancourt, C (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",claire.demazancourt@mcgill.ca,"Schwartz, Mark/G-1066-2011","Schwartz, Mark/0000-0002-3739-6542",,,,52,51,52,0,81,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Chironomidae constituted a substantial proportion of the diet of the two species in both habitats. The results indicated that both zooplankton (Cladocera) and large macroinvertebrates (EPT-species) made up a higher proportion of the minnow diet in the early phase of the minnow establishment (1975-1977) than later, and that the significance of small macroinvertebrates (Chironomidae) as prey has increased during the same period. Dietary analysis of the sympatric brown trout and minnow population in vre Heimdalsvatn does not provide a definitive conclusion about the degree of competition between the two species. However, together with the findings in other studies in vre Heimdalsvatn that have documented reduced recruitment and individual growth of brown trout, decreased individual growth of minnows and a marked decline in the density of large crustaceans (Lepidurus arcticus and Gammarus lacustris) in the shallow littoral of the lake during the last decades indicates that competitive interactions between the two species are likely. This is probably an example of the competition between two fish species with a high degree of dietary overlap when living in sympatry, most likely caused by absence of alternative prey and alternative habitats due to the high predation risk for both brown trout parr and minnows in deeper parts and in the open waters of the lake.","[Museth, Jon] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NINA, N-2624 Fakkelgarden, Lillehammer, Norway; [Borgstrom, Reidar; Brittain, John E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway; [Brittain, John E.] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, N-0318 Oslo, Norway","Museth, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NINA, N-2624 Fakkelgarden, Lillehammer, Norway.",jon.museth@nina.no,,,,,,50,20,21,0,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR,2010,642,1,,,,,93,100,,10.1007/s10750-010-0162-6,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,571UX,WOS:000275782400009,,,,,2021-09-21,

The steady increase in the number of vacation cabins and roads, and thus also in human garbage and road-killed animals, may subsidise easily available food resources and improve red fox survival in these otherwise marginal areas. In Borgefjell National Park, Norway, 14 of 27 known arctic fox dens were used by arctic fox during 2001-2005. The dens that were used were situated at higher altitudes, farther from natural red fox habitats, than unused dens. In the best of our logistic regression models, there was also a statistical negative effect of the number of cabins within 7 X 7 km squares around the den sites. Hence, our results support the prediction that the arctic fox is less likely to use areas where human activity might be benefiting red foxes. A successful conservation strategy for the arctic fox will probably require a reduction of the driving forces behind the red fox expansion in the alpine areas.","[Selas, Vidar; Johnsen, Borge Steinmo] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Eide, Nina E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway","Selas, V (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",vidar.selas@umb.no; borgesjohnsen@hotmail.com; nina.eide@nina.no,,,,,,38,12,12,6,64,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,MAR,2010,16,1,,,,,107,112,,10.2981/09-023,,,6,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,588HY,WOS:000277061200012,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Little information is available on the importance of biotic interactions in shaping the communities in these habitats. A common observation in the freshwater rock pool community assembly process is the clearly separated density peaks of fairy shrimp (Anostraca) and cladocerans (Anomopoda) over time. Fairy shrimp (Anostraca), the flagship group and dominant filter feeders of temporary waters hatch early after inundation. This contrasts with the occurrence pattern of coexisting cladocerans, which despite higher chances of abortive hatching occur later during the hydroperiod. To study this apparent succession pattern and test the possible presence of a biotic interaction, we set up enclosure experiments in freshwater rock pools in Western Australia and monitored cladoceran (Macrothrix hardingii) densities in the presence of variable densities or absence of fairy shrimp (Branchinella longirostris). The anomopod cladoceran populations decreased with increasing anostracan densities revealing a negative biotic interaction. The competitive dominance of anostracans most probably was mainly due to exploitation competition, with possibly elements of interference competition or predation included. Early hatching and competitive superiority may help anostracans in temporary pools to monopolize the habitat with respect to small and/or other filter feeding invertebrates. As such they influence succession dynamics and invertebrate community structure, making anostracans keystone species of temporary pools.","[Jocque, M.; Vanschoenwinkel, B.; Brendonck, L.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Jocque, M (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Cent Lab Gen Ecol, 2 Yurii Gagarin St, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria.",MerlijnJocque@gmail.com,"Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/I-9021-2019","Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/0000-0002-8973-6297; Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420",IWT (Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); Fund for scientific research Flanders (FWO)FWO [G.0118.03],"We thank David Angeler, Anne Robertson and an anonymous reviewer for suggestions to improve the manuscript.

Extended logistic model for growth of single-species populations. Ecol. Model. 205, 159-168] is improved to be applicable to the study of the dynamics of interacting populations. The improved procedure is based on three assumptions: resource availability changes with population size as a variable, resource supply to populations and population demand for resources are defined as functions of resource availability and population size, and the variables of resource availability and population size shift in the supply function attracted to the demand function. These assumptions are organized into three equations. The equations can generate the dynamics models of plant, herbivore, and cletritivore populations, and their own resources. The models can be used to describe prey-predator dynamics. They naturally contain nonlinear terms for the predator's numerical and functional responses. Depending on the terms, the fluctuations in resource availability and population size stabilize. The three equations can also generate the dynamics models of different populations consuming the same resources. The analysis of zero isoclines of the models shows that a superior population can be simply defined as one with a higher intrinsic rate of natural increase, that a stable coexistence may be realized with the intraspecific interference or the interspecific facilitation of superiors, and that the interspecific interference or the intraspecific facilitation of inferiors may make the coexistence unstable and the inferiors winners depending on their initial population size.

The proportion of sunny, anticyclonic days, per year (i.e., high levels of solar radiation) was the main environmental predictor explaining the distribution and abundance pattern of the Bonelli's eagle. Sparse plant formations (mainly shrublands) had also a positive effect, while altitude, agricultural land and deciduous forests had a negative influence. The relative abundance of one of its main preys, the Red Partridge (Alectoris rufa), favored the probability of occurrence of Bonelli's eagle, but only in the less sunny areas located in the north of Spain. The relative abundance of its main competitor, the Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), was slightly but positively correlated with both the distribution and the abundance of the Bonelli's eagle in the Spanish portion of the Iberian Peninsula, probably due to similarities in their habitat preferences.

Decline of native anurans has been linked to possible competition with adult O. septentrionalis but interactions during the larval stage are largely unknown. Rearing O. septentrionalis tadpoles along with two native anurans, the Squirrel Treefrog (Hyla squirella) and the Southern Toad (Bufo terrestris) in both experimental artificial ponds and laboratory aquaria, the role of competition as the mechanism driving the dynamics of invaded amphibian communities in Florida was examined. Also examined was the role of priority effects and variation between pond locations in altering interactions between O. septentrionalis and native anuran larvae. Interspecific competition was strong during the larval stage; the presence of O. septentrionalis reduced larval performance and survival of native anurans. Pond location alone had little effect on interspecific interactions, but priority effects were strong. Pond location and priority effects acted together to influence species interactions. The selective influence of different interaction modifiers acted to increase or decrease the impacts of exotic species on native taxa.","[Knight, C.

Agardh, Sargassum subrepandum (Forssk.) C. Agardh, and Turbinaria triquetra (J. Agardh) Kutz. (Phaeophyceae) on shallow reef flats in the southern Red Sea. Thallus length and biomass varied strongly with season, with the highest values occurring in the cooler months. Thallus densities showed no significant temporal variation. Log-total biomass versus log-density relationships were positive throughout the growth season without any decrease in the slope of the relationship. In two populations, biomass-density combinations approached the interspecific biomass-density line, but the massive annual shedding of modules occurred before self-thinning would set in. Allometric length-biomass relationships varied with season in all populations and were associated with seasonal module initiation, growth, and shedding. Evidence of a strong asymmetric competition was found in two high-density populations. These populations showed a predominance of small thalli during peak development, asymmetrical Lorenz curves, increasing Gini coefficients, and increasing thallus length relative to biomass during the main growth phase. In two other less crowded populations, small thalli were absent during peak development, Lorenz curves were symmetrical, and Gini coefficients decreased during the main growth phase. In these populations, size equalization appears to be due to responses at the modular level rather than size-dependent mortality. We conclude that changes in size structure in this highly seasonal environment are determined by module dynamics, modified by asymmetric competition in some populations, with a minor role of recruitment and no regulatory effect of self-thinning.","[Ateweberhan, Mebrahtu; Breeman, Anneke M.] Univ Groningen, Dept Marine Biol, POB 14, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Ateweberhan, Mebrahtu] Univ Asmara, Dept Fisheries & Marine Biol, Asmera, Eritrea; [Bruggemann, J.

The objective of this review is to describe the dynamics of root structure and function in boreal and northern temperate forests and examine how edaphic and climatic characteristics and intra- and interspecific root competition impact root dynamics. Fine roots exhibit distinct seasonal trends of production and mortality. Over the extent of stand development, coarse root biomass increases until maturity, while the response of fine roots remains unclear. Roots are predominantly restricted to the upper soil layers, and spatial variability of roots in the horizontal direction decreases with decreasing root size. Root/shoot ratio decreases gradually through stand development. On nutrient-rich sites, roots are more concentrated around respective stems and root systems are more branched than on nutrient-poor sites. Plants generally root deeper under low soil moisture conditions, while roots tend to grow horizontally into rich rather than poor patches of soil. Plants adapt their biomass allocation strategies to edaphic and climatic variation according to the functional equilibrium hypothesis. Although root production is projected to increase, providing nutrients are not limiting, following elevated carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures, how root turnover and above- and below-ground carbon allocation may change remains uncertain. Stands composed of species with different rooting characteristics may attain greater root production compared to single-species stands or mixtures of similar species from reduced exploitative competition. Alternatively, plants can produce greater root biomass with a competing plant than growing alone as a result of self root discrimination. Future research is needed to address how elevated carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures will feedback upon soil resource availability to influence plant responses from the organism- to the ecosystem-level.","[Brassard, Brian W.; Chen, Han Y.

Location Morocco. Methods Restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques applied on cytochrome b haplotypes were used to discriminate G. cristata and G. randonii, and to investigate the effects of interspecific hybridization in their contact zone. A comprehensive statistical framework was then designed to test Bergmann's rule in our three Galerida species (using altitude as a proxy for cold temperatures), while controlling for the possible influence of interspecific hybridization and competition and accounting for spatial autocorrelation. The method we propose is conservative in the sense that potentially confounding factors are adjusted so as to maximize their influence on the variable of interest. Results Bergmann's rule was strongly supported in G. theklae and G. randonii. However, body size did not respond to altitude in G. cristata, a result that was not simply explained by species-specific differences in geographical ranges and altitudinal span. In G. cristata, we detected a tendency for body size to increase with aridity, in agreement with an alternative definition of Bergmann's rule. However, since G. cristata also hybridizes with G. randonii in a contact zone located in the most arid part of the range of G. cristata, we could not tease apart the relative contribution of selection and hybridization in driving this pattern. Main conclusions This study highlights the need for careful statistical designs that allow meaningful variables to be picked out from large sets of potential factors. When taking these factors into account, we found that Bergmann's rule was still strongly supported in two out of the three species examined.","[Guillaumet, Alban] CNRS, UMR 5175, CEFE, EPHE, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Guillaumet, Alban; Desmarais, Eric] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, CC 63, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France","Guillaumet, A (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5175, CEFE, EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",alban.guillaumet@cefe.cnrs.fr,,,,,,51,27,30,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

However, few studies have examined the potential contribution of plant antagonists, such as insect herbivores and pathogens, to the pattern of local adaptation. Here, a reciprocal transplant experiment was set up at three sites across Europe using two common plant species, Holcus lanatus and Plantago lanceolata. The amount of damage by the main above-ground plant antagonists was measured: a rust fungus infecting Holcus and a specialist beetle feeding on Plantago, both in low-density monoculture plots and in competition with interspecific neighbours. Strong genetic differentiation among provenances in the amount of damage by antagonists in both species was found. Local provenances of Holcus had significantly higher amounts of rust infection than foreign provenances, whereas local provenances of Plantago were significantly less damaged by the specialist beetle than the foreign provenances. The presence of surrounding vegetation affected the amount of damage but had little influence on the ranking of plant provenances. The opposite pattern of population differentiation in resistance to local antagonists in the two species suggests that it will be difficult to predict the consequences of plant translocations for interactions with organisms of higher trophic levels.","[Cremieux, Lisele; Bischoff, Armin; Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz; Steinger, Thomas] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, Unit Ecol & Evolut, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Smilauerova, Majka; Dolezal, Jiri; Leps, Jan] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Lawson, Clare S.; Mortimer, Simon R.; Edwards, Andrew R.; Brook, Alex J.] Univ Reading, Ctr Agrienvironm Res, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Lanta, Vojtech] Inst Bot CAS CZ, Trebon 37901, Czech Republic; [Tscheulin, Thomas] Univ Aegean, Lab Biogeog & Ecol, Dept Geog, GR-81100 Mitilini, Greece; [Macel, Mirka] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands","Cremieux, L (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, Unit Ecol & Evolut, Chemin Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",lisele.cremieux@unifr.ch,"Dolezal, Jiri/H-1583-2014; Steinger, Thomas/J-6802-2012; Macel, Mirka/I-2010-2012; Smilauerova, Marie/D-7428-2016; Tscheulin, T./B-9722-2011; Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz/H-5277-2011; Lanta, Vojtech/J-7032-2017; Mortimer, Simon R/B-5154-2008; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; , AGROCAMPUS OUEST/O-6651-2016","Steinger, Thomas/0000-0001-8658-1579; Macel, Mirka/0000-0003-4122-6797; Smilauerova, Marie/0000-0002-0349-4179; Tscheulin, T./0000-0002-9901-1521; Lanta, Vojtech/0000-0003-4484-3838; Mortimer, Simon R/0000-0001-6160-6741; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; , AGROCAMPUS OUEST/0000-0002-1800-4558",Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science [01.0086]; European CommunityEuropean Commission [EVK2-CT-2001-00123],"We thank all students and technicians who helped in the field, particularly Franziska Leuenberger, Lus Escher, Blanka Divisova, Jemma Daniels, Katherine Robinson and Victoria Chapman.

Interspecific differences in quantum yield of PS II photochemistry, apparent electron transport rate, non-photochemical quenching and the values of the cardinal points of light response curves of these parameters resulted from the shade adaptation of leaves and leaf life-span. Acclimation to shade did not increase sensitivity to strong PS II downregulation induced by light patch of low intensity but predisposed both species to photoinhibition caused by high light stress. They were able to efficiently use fight patches of low intensity, but after high light stress beech leaves from the Larix stand recovered more dynamically in quantum yield of PS II photochemistry than silver fir.

For example, migratory water birds are believed to suffer from competition with resident fish populations for shared food resources. While observational evidence in support of this hypothesis is accumulating, replicated experiments addressing this issue at the proper spatial scale are lacking. Here, we report from a replicated whole-system experiment in which we stocked large (0.07 km(2)), shallow (<= 2.5 m deep), highly eutrophic ponds in the bird protection area Ismaninger Speichersee mit Fischteichen'' with different densities of carp and assessed the responses of water birds and their food resources during summer over several years. In all years, the biomasses of benthic macroinvertebrates, macroalgae, and macrophytes as well as the densities of herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous water birds were reduced in carp ponds compared to fishshless ponds. The negative effects of carp on food resources and on the numbers of water birds feeding in carp ponds increased over the season (May-September) and were stronger at high than at low stocking densities of carp. Consequently, differences in resource densities between ponds with and without carp increased, and the ranking of ponds with respect to resource densities became more predictable over the season. These factors may have contributed to a seasonal improvement of the birds' abilities to track resource densities across ponds, as suggested by tight correlations of bird numbers on ponds with resource densities late, but not early, in the season.","Univ Munich, Dept Biol II, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Haas, K (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Dept Biol II, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",karin_haas@web.de,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,58,62,68,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2007,88,11,,,,,2915,2925,,10.1890/06-1981.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,233CL,WOS:000251067900028,18051660,,,,2021-09-21,

However, this research has been biased almost exclusively towards vascular plants. Very little is known about the role and applicability of functional traits of non-vascular cryptogams, particularly bryophytes and lichens, with respect to biogeochemical cycling. Yet these organisms are paramount determinants of biogeochemistry in several biomes, particularly cold biomes and tropical rainforests, where they: (1) contribute substantially to above-ground biomass (lichens, bryophytes); (2) host nitrogen-fixing bacteria, providing major soil N input (lichens, bryophytes); (3) control soil chemistry and nutrition through the accumulation of recalcitrant polyphenols (bryophytes) and through their control over soil and vegetation hydrology and temperatures; (4) both promote erosion (rock weathering by lichens) and prevent it (biological crusts in deserts); (5) provide a staple food to mammals such as reindeer (lichens) and arthropodes, with important feedbacks to soils and biota; and (6) both facilitate and compete with vascular plants. Approach Here we review current knowledge about interspecific variation in cryptogam traits with respect to biogeochemical cycling and discuss to what extent traits and measuring protocols needed for bryophytes and lichens correspond with those applied to vascular plants. We also propose and discuss several new or recently introduced traits that may help us understand and predict the control of cryptogams over several aspects of the biogeochemistry of ecosystems. Conclusions Whilst many methodological challenges lie ahead, comparative cryptogam ecology has the potential to meet some of the important challenges of understanding and predicting the biogeochemical and climate consequences of large-scale environmental changes driving shifts in the cryptogam components of vegetation composition.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Dept Syst Ecol, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Dept Plant Ecol, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands","Cornelissen, JHC (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Dept Syst Ecol, Inst Ecol Sci, Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",hans.cornelissen@ecology.falw.vu.nl,"Soudzilovskaia, Nadejda A./N-4140-2015; Lang, Simone/AAE-5730-2020",,,,,193,256,279,17,251,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

We investigated how the presence or absence of pine squirrels (Tamiasciurits spp.) influences the ecology and (co)evolution of seed-dispersal mutualisms between Clark's Nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) and limber (Pinus flexilis) and whitebark (P. albicaulis) pines. Nutcrackers are the primary seed dispersers of these pines. Therefore both nutcrackers and pines potentially benefit from the evolution of a cone structure that enhances seed harvest by nutcrackers. Pine squirrels are the dominant predispersal seed predator of these pines throughout the Sierra Nevada-Cascades and Rocky Mountains and do not disperse seeds, so that pines benefit from deterring seed harvest by pine squirrels. To determine whether pines have evolved in response to selection by nutcrackers and pine squirrels, we conducted studies in ranges with pine squirrels and in ranges in the Great Basin and northern Montana where populations of the pines have apparently evolved without pine squirrels for 10000 years or more. Cone evolution was convergent between both pines and among phylogeographically independent populations with and without pine squirrels, consistent with variation in selection by nutcrackers and pine squirrels. Where pine squirrels were present, they out-competed nutcrackers for seeds, nutcrackers were less abundant, and selection by pine squirrels constrained the evolution of cone and seed traits that facilitate seed dispersal by nutcrackcrs. In the absence of pine squirrels, nutcrackers were more than twice as abundant, selection by pine squirrels on cone structure was relaxed, and selection on cone structure by nutcrackers resulted in cones that increased the foraging efficiency of nutcrackers and improved their potential for seed dispersal.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Siepielski, AM (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",asiepiel@uwyo.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021",,,,,69,39,41,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

We used an ecomorphological approach to determine how coexisting species in the Old World fruit bat genus, Cynopterus, assort in morphological and ecological space. The study was conducted in peninsular Malaysia where 4 species of Cynopterus are broadly sympatric. Interspecific separation in resource use was estimated along 3 main axes: habitat, based on abundance across a habitat gradient at 2 sites; trophic niche, inferred from a suite of cranial and postcranial characters; and locomotory behavior and efficiency, inferred from wing morphology. Habitat associations, overall size, and the size and shape of the trophic apparatus were all important in separating 2 or more species, whereas interspecific differences in wing morphology were minor. In combination, the results of this study suggest that relatively minor separation among Cynopterus species pairs along single axes of resource use is sufficient to counteract overlap on other axes, and pen-nit the coexistence of potential competitors.","Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Zool, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Campbell, P (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",pcampbel@zoo.ufl.edu,"akbar, zubaid/H-7964-2013; Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014; Campbell, Polly/I-6252-2015","Campbell, Polly/0000-0001-7660-9814",,,,100,22,25,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

Franco). Even though these species are well known, the autogenic development of these species in an unmanaged plant community falls outside of traditional silvicultural experience. We therefore present an explorative study, aimed to map out differences between these species under conditions of co-occurrence, and develop hypotheses on the further development of these sapling communities. We focused on differences in height, and particularly the architectural contribution to height. We analyzed interspecific differences in the height-mass and height-DBH relationship, biomass partitioning, and slenderness for a total of 177 saplings up to 13.7 cm DBH and 11.8 m high. Average annual height and diameter growth rates of an additional 48 saplings are presented for comparison with the static architectural data. Betula had a high stem biomass, high stem slenderness, and low leaf mass. The reverse was true for Pseudotsuga. Larix behaved as an intermediate species. Pinus however deviated from the classical pioneer-climax dichotomy in having a low slenderness and low height per unit biomass while being a highly light-demanding species. The static height-mass relationship shows a similar species ranking when compared to average annual height growth rates, but not when compared to diameter growth rates. This underlines the importance of a species' architecture for its height development and suggesting a predictable stratification between species. Based on the results regarding species' stratification in heights and a priori information on light demand, it is hypothesized that in the studied gap-phase regeneration Betula, Larix and Pseudotsuga will partition the available light. Pinus however will be overtopped and given its need for high-light environments, is expected to be competitively excluded. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Location: North-western North America. Methods:We compared four bioclimatic variables [actual evapotranspiration (AET), water deficit (DEF), mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCO), and growing degree-days (GDD5)] with the distribution of T. heterophylla at a 2-km grid cell resolution. The distribution is based on a zonal ecosystem classification where T. heterophylla is the dominant late-successional species. For each bioclimatic variable and at each degree of latitude, we calculated the threshold that best defines the T. heterophylla distribution and assessed the extent to which T. heterophylla was segregated to one end of the bioclimatic gradient. We also fitted two forms of multivariate bioclimatic models to predict the T. heterophylla distribution: a simple threshold model and a complex Gaussian mixture model. Each model was trained separately on the coastal and interior distributions, and predicted areas outside of the T. heterophylla distribution (overprediction) were evaluated with respect to known outlier populations. Results: Actual evapotranspiration was the most accurate predictor across the T. heterophylla distribution; other variables were important only in certain areas. There was strong latitudinal variation in the thresholds of all variables except AET, and the interior distribution had wider bioclimatic thresholds than the coastal distribution. The coastal distribution was predicted accurately by both bioclimatic models; areas of overprediction rarely occurred > 10 km from the observed distribution and generally matched small outlier populations. In contrast, the interior distribution was poorly predicted by both models; areas of overprediction occurred up to 140 km from the observed distribution and did not match outlier populations. The greatest overprediction occurred in Idaho and Montana in areas supporting species that typically co-exist with T. heterophylla. Main conclusions: The high predictive capacity of AET is consistent with this species' physiological requirements for a mild and humid climate. Spatial variation of MTCO, GDD5 and DEF thresholds probably reflects both the correlation of these variables with AET and ecotypic variation. The level of overprediction in portions of the interior suggests that T. heterophylla has not completely expanded into its potential habitat. Tsuga heterophylla became common in the interior 2000-3500 years ago, compared with > 9000 years ago in the coastal region. The limited time for dispersal, coupled with frequent fires at the margins of the distribution and competition with disturbance-adapted species, may have retarded range expansion in the interior. This study demonstrates that bioclimatic modelling can help identify various climatic and non-climatic controls on species distributions.","Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Gavin, DG (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",dgavin@uoregon.edu,"Gavin, Daniel G/C-9214-2009","Gavin, Daniel G/0000-0001-8743-3949",,,,64,55,56,0,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Despite this, very little is known of what forces drive evolutionary changes in body mass and, consequently, shape patterns of body mass distribution exhibited by animal radiations. The search for factors that may influence evolutionary processes in general frequently focuses on environmental parameters such as climate change or interspecific competition. With respect to body mass, there is also the suggestion that evolutionary lineages may follow an inherent trend toward increased body mass, known as Cope's rule. The present paper investigates whether overall directional trends of body mass change, or correlations between patterns of body mass evolution and environmental factors have influenced the evolution of body mass in plesiadapiforms and primates. Analyses of the global fossil record of plesiadapiforms and primates suggest that the former did indeed follow an overall trend toward increased body mass compatible with the predictions of Cope's rule. In contrast, neither primates as a whole, nor a number of individual primate radiations (Adapiformes, Omomyiformes, and Anthropoidea), show any indication of overall directional patterns of body mass change. No correlations of primate body mass change with either the latitudinal distribution of fossil species, or with estimates of global temperature trends, were found. There is evidence, however, that direct competition between omomyiforms and adapiforms (the two main primate radiations known from the Paleogene) influenced processes of body mass evolution in omomyiforms.","Nat Hist Museum, Dept Palaeontol, Human Origins Grp, London SW7 5BD, England","Soligo, C (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Palaeontol, Human Origins Grp, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",C.Soligo@nhm.ac.uk,,,,,,37,19,19,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9483,1096-8644,,AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL,Am.

While utilizing several natural enemies may enhance control, there is also the potential for disruptive interspecific interactions. Such interactions may be studied in the laboratory by focusing on the details of the interactions themselves and attempting to infer population level consequences from their sum, or by focusing more directly on the overall effects on natural enemy populations: we term these approaches 'reductionist' and 'holistic.' Here we conduct a holistic laboratory study on interactions between three species of parasitoid wasps that are parasitoids of the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae): Cephalonomia stephanoderis Betrem, C. hyalinipennis Ashmead and Prorops nasuta Waterston (all Hymenoptera: Bethylidae). We find evidence for both intra- and inter-specific resource competition. Interactions between C stephanoderis and P. nasuta, both indigenous to Africa, appear to be approximately symmetrical, while C hyalinipennis, naturally found in the coffee plantations of Chiapas, Mexico, may exert a disruptive influence. C hyalinipennis also has a low population growth rate. We now consider it to be a detrimental invader of the Mexican coffee agro-ecosystem that should not be encouraged by augmentative release or introduced into other regions. Overall, the most successful species, in terms of both emergence and female production, was P. nasuta. We compare these results with those from prior reductionist and holistic studies, and with observations on patterns of establishment of these bethylid species in the field. Given that it is increasingly clear that disruptive inter-specific interactions are generally common when multiple species are deployed in biological control, screening of potential agents should consider such interactions alongside the more 'traditional' focus on host specificity.

The present study was designed to investigate how fecundity. growth rate of seedlings and competitive ability contribute to the invasion potential within this genus. The relative growth rate and response to interspecific competition from neighbouring vegetation were determined for 15 species. Relations between these characteristics and other species traits identified in previous studies (germination, seed production and seed mass) were examined and used to explain the invasion success of particular species in Europe. Ability to germinate in the light was the only significant predictor of invasion success in six European countries. Fecundity is another trait contributing to invasion success. The most successful invaders within the genus are poor at competing with native vegetation, and an ability to escape from competition seems crucial for invasion success. Oenothera biennis. the most successful invader, is not outstanding in any of the characteristics assessed but is well placed in most of them. We suggest that a 'Jack-of-all-trades' strategy may be beneficial for an invader. The parental chromosomes of the species Studied had no effect on the distribution of traits; hence the conclusions drawn at the species level are not biased by the specific banding pattern within the genus (permanent translocation heterozygosity). The present study indicates that comparative studies of closely related species may indicate the determinants of invasion success if they include many characteristics of the complete life cycle.

The behavioural response of small mammals to reduced cover has been well documented. However, very little is known about the effect of cover on community and population dynamics. Australian small mammals generally inhabit extremely dynamic ecosystems, where cover and food supplies are greatly affected by fire. Species are described as early or late seral specialists, generally returning to a disturbed area once their habitat requirements are met. Habitat requirements have loosely been interpreted as cover and food supply, however, these factors are not mutually exclusive and few studies have attempted to determine the driving factors behind small mammal succession. In this study, we manipulated specific aspects of cover in the eucalypt forests of Fraser Island and show that the behaviour and population dynamics of small mammals were greatly affected. A reduction of cover from grass-trees (Xanthorrhoea johnsonii) did not affect small mammal species composition, however, the abundance and size structure distribution of the dominant species (Rattus fuscipes) decreased. Patch use by rodents also decreased after cover was reduced. Rattus fuscipes must trade-off remaining in an environment with increased risk of predation, or disperse to an area with greater cover but increased competition. Juveniles dominated (> 60%) populations of R. fuscipes after cover was reduced, however, size distributions of control sites were relatively more even (< 25% juvenile). While adult R. fuscipes are either killed by predators or disperse to other areas, juveniles that remained or immigrated to an area of reduced cover gained a selective advantage over those in control sites, because reduced competition with adults increased body condition of juvenile R. fuscipes.","Univ Queensland, Nat & Rural Syst Management, Fraser Isl Fire Ecol Grp, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia","Spencer, RJ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ricky.spencer@pestat.com.au,"Baxter, Greg/AAQ-5364-2021; Baxter, Gregory/F-3582-2010","Baxter, Greg/0000-0003-1816-4970; ",,,,54,21,22,0,34,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1442-9985,,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,DEC,2005,30,8,,,,,876,884,,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,985XC,WOS:000233411000007,,,,,2021-09-21,

We investigated interspecific patterns of circulating testosterone in male birds to test the hypothesis that testosterone plays a crucial role in sexual selection as determined by degree of polygyny and extra-pair paternity. We predicted that the evolution of increased levels of polygyny and extra-pair paternity would have resulted in the evolution of increased levels of testosterone to allow males more efficiently to compete for mates. This hypothesis was tested in comparative analyses of 116 species of birds using Generalized Least Squares Models. We assessed the importance of latitudinal distribution, because this can confound the relationship between testosterone and mating success. There were weak positive phylogenetic correlations between measures of testosterone and estimates of mating success at the social level, but this association appeared to be confounded by latitudinal distribution, a significant correlate of testosterone titers. However, we found a significantly positive relationship between peak and residual peak testosterone (which is the peak testosterone level that is controlled for the baseline level) and extra-pair paternity independent of latitude. These results suggest that selection pressures arising from social and sexual mating differently affected testosterone levels with the former being mediated by factors associated with latitudinal distribution. An analysis of residual testes size revealed a positive association between peak and residual testosterone and testes size relative to body size. In a path analysis, we show that relative testis size primarily evolved in association with intense sperm competition and thus high sperm production, and these mechanisms had a secondary impact on blood testosterone levels at a phylogenetic scale. Our results suggest that sperm competition has played an important role in the evolution of reproductive mechanisms in birds. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

I present an evolutionary framework in which to interpret this variation, and highlight the importance for the framework of (i) the distribution of receptive ( typically immediate post-emergence) females, which ordinarily translates into the distribution of nests, and (ii) the density of competing males. Other than the highly polyandrous honey bees ( Apis), most female bees are thought to be monandrous, though genetic data with which to support this view are generally lacking. Given the opportunity, male bees are typically polygamous. I highlight intraspecific diversity in rendezvous site, male behaviour and mating system, which is in part predicted from the conceptual framework. Finally, I suggest that inbreeding may be far more widespread among bees than has hitherto been considered the case.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland","Paxton, RJ (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",r.paxton@qub.ac.uk,"Paxton, Robert/D-7082-2015","Paxton, Robert/0000-0003-2517-1351",,,,81,115,118,1,58,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",0044-8435,1297-9678,,APIDOLOGIE,Apidologie,APR-JUN,2005,36,2,,,,,145,156,,10.1051/apido:2005007,,,12,Entomology,Entomology,933YC,WOS:000229667800002,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2021-09-21,

Concentration profiles under steady-state transport conditions were generated by measuring TCE concentrations at sample ports located at various locations along the length of the column. The results indicated that a pseudo-first-order model is adequate at describing degradation kinetics for low initial TCE concentrations, but not for higher initial concentrations. The deviation from pseudo-first-order kinetics can be explained by interspecies competition for reactive sites between TCE and a dominant reaction product. A modification of the pseudo-first-order model that accounts for product interference predicts laboratory data for high initial concentration profiles, but deviates slightly as initial concentrations approach the solubility of TCE. The data clearly demonstrate the importance of accurately describing reaction kinetics for the purpose of designing iron wall treatment systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, intraspecific variation was examined for five species collected from two localities. The subtropical strains of Scaptodrosophila coracina, Drosophila bizonata and D. daruma were less tolerant to cold than their temperate strains. However, the difference of cold tolerance between these two geographic strains was much smaller than the difference between the species restricted to the subtropical region and those occurring in the temperate region. In D. auraria and D. suzukii, no difference was observed in thermal tolerance between their cool- and warm-temperate strains. Thus, geographic variation in thermal tolerance within species was low or negligible. Interspecific comparisons by phylogenetic independent contrasts revealed that species which had the northern boundaries of their distributions at higher latitudes were generally more tolerant to cold than those which had their boundaries at lower latitudes. However, the data for some species did not agree with this trend. The use of man-protected warm places for overwintering, competition or predation would also affect their distributions. It also appeared that species which had their southern boundaries at higher latitudes were generally more cold-tolerant. The acquisition of cold tolerance may lower a fly's capacity to compete, survive or reproduce in warmer climates. On the other hand, no relation was observed between heat tolerance and latitudinal distribution. Heat tolerance was higher in species inhabiting openlands or the forest canopy than in those inhabiting the forest understorey.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan","Kimura, MT (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",mtk@ees.hokudai.ac.jp,,,,,,65,184,190,3,120,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2004,140,3,,,,,442,449,,10.1007/s00442-004-1605-4,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,842MP,WOS:000223008700008,15221433,,,,2021-09-21,

Although disrupting disturbances seem an obvious explanation for such shifts, evidence for large disturbances is not always apparent. Here we show that complex communities tend to move through occasional catastrophic shifts in response to gradual environmental change or evolution. This tendency is caused by multiple attractors that may exist in such systems. We show that alternative attractors arise robustly in randomly generated multispecies models, especially if competition is symmetrical and if interspecific competition is allowed to exceed intraspecific competition. Inclusion of predators as a second trophic level did not alter the results greatly, although it reduced the probability of alternative attractors somewhat. These results suggest that alternative attractors may commonly arise from interactions between large numbers of species. Consequently, the response of complex communities to environmental change is expected to be characterized by hysteresis and sudden shifts. Some unexplained regime shifts observed in ecosystems could be related to alternative attractors arising from complex species interactions. Additionally, our results support the idea that ancient mass extinctions may partly be due to an intrinsic loss of stability of species configurations.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands","van Nes, EH (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, POB 8080, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands.",egbert.vannes@wur.nl; marten.scheffer@wur.nl,"van Nes, Egbert H/F-2681-2011; Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012","van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X",,,,63,84,85,2,44,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Whilst the specific threats vary among species, problems such as introduced predators, loss of suitable nesting habitat and inter- and intra-specific competition for nest sites are common to many situations. This paper reports on an experiment to increase the availability of secure nest sites at a colony of Madeiran storm petrels breeding on an islet (free from introduced predators) in the Azores islands where there is evidence of interspecific competition. The provision of nest boxes that were designed to exclude larger species led to around a 12% increase in the size of the breeding population in the first year and a 28% increase over the original colony size in the second year. Over three seasons, the breeding success of storm petrels nesting in boxes averaged 2.9 times greater than that of birds at natural sites, despite their likely reproductive inexperience. The techniques presented here should serve as a model for conservation management of other burrowing procellariiform species in situations where colony size or breeding performance is believed to be constrained by nest site quality.

In mixed cultures there was complete elimination of C. megacephala and C. macellaria.

We examine whether abundance is related to diet breadth. The floral visits of bumblebees were examined on Salisbury Plain, UK. All of the species examined gathered pollen mostly from Fabaceae. All species gathered nectar from a broader range of flowers than they did pollen, and longer-tongued bees had a narrower diet breadth when collecting nectar. B. hortorum (the species with the longest tongue) specialized on Trifolium pratense. As predicted, abundant species had a broader diet than rare species. Species with similar-length tongues visiting similar flowers. However, interspecific competition did not appear to be important since species with similar tongue lengths and high niche overlap co-occurred at high abundance. We suggest that the rare species may be those with short colony cycles, in which dependence on high quality food to rear larvae quickly forces specialization.","Sch Biol Sci, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England","Goulson, D (corresponding author), Sch Biol Sci, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Biomed Sci Bldg,Bassett Crescent E, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England.",,"Goulson, David/A-2462-2010","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876",,,,38,151,157,2,103,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",0044-8435,,,APIDOLOGIE,Apidologie,JAN-FEB,2004,35,1,,,,,55,63,,10.1051/apido:2003062,,,9,Entomology,Entomology,760GK,WOS:000187803100007,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2021-09-21,

Existing records of rainfall, cattle management, wildlife numbers, captures, hunting and predation were analysed and, together with a demographic model and limited fieldwork, used to identify the probable cause of this decline. There was no convincing evidence that cheetah predation, excessive legal or illegal offtakes, a food shortage as a direct consequence of the 1994/1995 drought, or interspecific competition with wild herbivores were likely causes. After the 1991/1992 drought, tsessebe number was negatively correlated with cattle biomass, suggesting that cattle and tsessebe have competed for food since then. Two factors probably caused a long-lasting reduction in the dry-season availability of green grass leaf (the preferred food of tsessebe). First, drought and heavy grazing pressure by cattle may have shifted sward composition away from leafy grasses and towards grass species with small, wiry leaves. Secondly, while shrub encroachment has been occurring for decades, the 1991/1992 drought probably encouraged the establishment of another cohort of bushes, which now compete with grasses for soil moisture, reducing the water available for grass growth during the dry season. The competition between tsessebe and cattle was masked by significant cattle destocking during 1992-1995, but became apparent after 1995 when cattle numbers were increased. This competition was exaggerated by a general decline, since 1994, in rainfall during September October, which further reduced the late dry season supply of green grass.

The effect of the removal of Timarcha lugens (Chrysomelidae), one of the main herbivores of Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae), on the abundance of co-occurring phytophagous insects, the abundance of non-phytophagous arthropods (detritivores, predators, and parasitoids), and the structure and diversity of the entire arthropod community, was studied for 3 years (1999-2001). 2. There was competition between T. lugens and co-occurring herbivores; the removal of T. lugens was correlated with an increase in the abundance of sap-suckers, flower-feeders, and, above all, folivores. 3. Timarcha lugens also had an indirect effect on arthropods belonging to other trophic levels; the abundance of predators increased significantly after the removal of T. lugens . 4. Community composition was affected by the experimental removal. In addition, the diversity of the overall community increased after removal of T. lugens . 5. The study demonstrated experimentally that T. lugens has a significant effect not only on other species belonging to the same trophic level, but also on the abundance of species belonging to higher trophic levels, and, consequently, on the entire structure and diversity of the complex community in which it is immersed.","Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Gonzalez-Megias, A (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",bgyagm@leeds.ac.uk,"Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017; Megias, Adela Gonzalez/P-8974-2016","Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664; Megias, Adela Gonzalez/0000-0002-2292-9334",,,,49,22,25,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Benthic algae grew on the pool beds, and macroinvertebrates colonized the pools. Ayu predominantly grazed the algae, occasionally forming territories. Japanese dace fed on both benthic algae and invertebrates when ayu were absent, and predominantly on invertebrates when ayu were present. The presence of Japanese dace reduced the number of invertebrates and increased algal biomass (chlorophyll a) through trophic cascades, but the effects of respiration and excretion of dace did not notably increase algal biomass probably because the water continuously pumped into the pools was already nutrient rich. The growth rate of ayu was enhanced in the presence of Japanese dace due to increased algal biomass. In contrast, as the number of ayu increased, the growth rate of Japanese dace was reduced because of the exploitation of benthic algae and occasional attacks by ayu on dace. The relationship between ayu and Japanese dace is not merely competitive, but partly indirect contramensalism through trophic cascades. The occasional attacks by ayu on Japanese dace were mainly directed at individuals moving near the pool beds and therefore might function to increase benthic algal resources by limiting grazing by dace.","Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Fisheries Res Agcy, Ueda, Nagano 3860031, Japan","Katano, O (corresponding author), Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Fisheries Res Agcy, 1088 Komaki, Ueda, Nagano 3860031, Japan.",,,"Yamamoto, Shoichiro/0000-0003-4155-7852",,,,72,18,21,0,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2003,84,5,,,,,1311,1323,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1311:ICTTCB]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,700PN,WOS:000184120500023,,,,,2021-09-21,

The type and quality of the sleeping sites differed between the two species. M. murinus used protected wooden shelters (tree holes) more frequently than M. ravelobensis, and M. ravelobensis used a broader variety of less protected sites (e.g., branches, lianas, and leaves) than M. murinus. Whereas male M. murinus usually slept alone, and female M. murinus mostly slept in groups, both sexes of M. ravelobensis slept in mixed-sex sleeping groups. M. murinus relied on crypsis in their sleeping sites, whereas M. ravelobensis regularly showed a flight response to the approach of an observer. This behavioral difference could indicate an adaptation to a higher predation risk in less protected sleeping sites. Whereas female M. murinus showed a high site fidelity, male M. murinus and both sexes of M. ravelobensis frequently changed their sleeping sites, which may also be interpreted as an antipredator strategy. The results are discussed with respect to three possible ecological explanations: interspecies competition, restricted resource availability, and niche differentiation. The latter is the most likely explanation for these interspecific differences.","Hannover Sch Vet Med, Inst Zool, D-30559 Hannover, Germany","Radespiel, U (corresponding author), Hannover Sch Vet Med, Inst Zool, Bunteweg 17, D-30559 Hannover, Germany.",,,,,,,36,87,90,1,27,WILEY-LISS,NEW YORK,"DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA",0275-2565,,,AM J PRIMATOL,Am.

While most species of hole-breeding passerines start their breeding period on average one week earlier due to higher temperatures in spring, G. glis appears on average four weeks earlier in the nest boxes. This leads to an increase in predation of eggs or juvenile birds. The Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), a migratory bird and a late breeder, is especially affected.","Univ Frankfurt, Ecol Field Ctr, D-36381 Schluchtern, Germany","Koppmann-Rumpf, B (corresponding author), Univ Frankfurt, Ecol Field Ctr, Schlagweg 19, D-36381 Schluchtern, Germany.",cheberer@gmx.de,,,,,,7,18,22,0,9,HUNGARIAN NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM,BUDAPEST,"BAROSS U 13, H-1088 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",1217-8837,,,ACTA ZOOL ACAD SCI H,Acta Zool.

In this context a long-term intensive fishery programme aiming at reducing charr density, and thereby increasing growth and harvestable sizes, was initiated in the early 1980s in a Norwegian alpine lake. Here we present long-term data on catch statistics and changes in mean weights of charr caught with gill nets on spawning grounds, as well as changes in mean weight of juvenile charr caught with funnel traps during the 1990s. Furthermore, we present results from shorter-term studies on growth, size- and age-distribution, and size-related habitat and resource utilisation of Arctic charr and brown trout, Salmo trutta, in this lake. Mean weight (+/-SD) of charr caught on the spawning grounds increased significantly from 129.8 g (+/-11.9) in the years 1982-1990 to 213.1 g (+/-37.8) in the years 1996-1999, whereas catch per unit of effort decreased significantly. Mean weight of juveniles caught in funnel traps increased significantly from 21.2 g (+/-6.9) in 1993 to 41.9 g (+/-14.8) in 1999. Apparently the increase in weight of spawning charr coincided with the onset of trap fishing for juvenile charr. Compared to generally shallow dwelling trout, charr grew rapidly and were generally found in deeper areas of the take. Charr went through a distinct size-related niche shift from mainly consuming small zooplankton in the pelagic to consuming large benthic prey in shallower waters. Resource and habitat utilisation in different size-groups of charr and trout are discussed with respect to possible competitive and predatory intra- and interspecific interactions, and with regard to management of charr populations.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Zool, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Museum Nat Hist & Archaeol, Dept Nat Hist, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Norwegian Minist Fisheries, N-0032 Oslo, Norway","Langeland, A (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Zool, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",,"Finstad, Anders/H-6519-2015","Finstad, Anders/0000-0003-4529-6266",,,,24,8,8,1,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Seven species of mustelid carnivore live in the British Isles: weasel, stoat, mink, polecat, pine marten, badger and otter. Recent studies have hypothesized that coexistence of these species is facilitated by partitioning of resources according to prey size, particularly that of mammalian prey. This hypothesis has been supported by evidence of character displacement derived from even size ratios in skull length and canine diameter. 2. To test whether this hypothesis is supported by empirical data, 98 studies of the diet of mustelids living in Great Britain and Ireland were analysed. Two main predictions were tested; that larger males ate larger prey than females and that larger species ate larger prey than smaller species. 3. Male mustelids ate larger prey than females but there was no relationship between predator size and prey size, either for all species or when largely vermivorous badgers and piscivorous otters were excluded. There was no difference in dietary niche breadth between the sexes. Dietary niche breadth increased with body size in the assemblage excluding otters and badgers. The dietary niches of mustelids were partitioned along several axes, none of which was clearly related to prey size. 4. The dietary niches of the five species living in Ireland (stoat, mink, pine marten, otter and badger) were more similar to one another in Ireland than in Great Britain and there was no difference in niche breadth between Irish and British mustelids. There was no evidence of competitive release in the diets of Irish mustelids. 5. Resource partitioning according to prey size is apparent between the sexes within species, and this is probably correlated to sexual selection for size dimorphism. Empirical data do not, however, support a hypothesis of resource partitioning according to prey size between species. Interspecific aggression provides an alternative hypothesis explaining character displacement among mustelids.","Game Conservancy Trust, Forest in Teesdale DL12 0HA, Barnard Castle, England","Mcdonald, RA (corresponding author), Game Conservancy Trust, Forest in Teesdale DL12 0HA, Barnard Castle, England.",rmcdonald@gct.org.uk,"McDonald, Robbie/AAK-2718-2020; McDonald, Robbie A/A-2931-2012","McDonald, Robbie/0000-0002-6922-3195; McDonald, Robbie A/0000-0002-6922-3195",,,,154,111,112,0,96,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Most successional theories focus on the rise to dominance, assuming demise is the result of competition, but other factors can cause differential mortality among species, including physical disturbance, senescence, and consumers. In rocky intertidal communities on the coast of Washington state, USA, gaps in mussel beds exhibit a succession from predator-susceptible to predator-resistant species following disturbance, suggesting that differential consumption by mobile species may play an important role in the demise of early succession species and the eventual dominance of the mussel Mytilus californianus. Experimental manipulation of a dominant species earlier in succession, the blue mussel Mytilus trossulus, demonstrated that this species inhibits the invasion of M. californianus in the absence of predators. Experimental manipulation of predatory snails (Nucella emarginata and Nucella canaliculata), which feed heavily on M. trossulus but not M. californianus, greatly increased the rate at which M. californianus invaded gaps. These results and those of other studies indicate that consumers frequently have important effects on the dynamics of succession in benthic marine systems, and might also play a role in other settings.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Wootton, JT (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",twootton@uchicago.edu,"Wootton, J.

Inferences have been based upon both artificial and natural studies of in situ fertilization success, because natural gamete concentrations have been difficult to measure. Here, gamete concentrations and the timing of fertilization were examined during the tidal cycle in the fucoid alga Fucus vesiculosus L. on the Maine coast at Pemaquid Point and in the Narraguagus River estuary. Gamete concentrations were assessed by collecting samples from the water column throughout the tidal cycle; sperm were identified by indirect immunofluorescence using a F vesiculosus-selective monoclonal antibody raised against sperm from a Maine population of this species. Eggs were detected visually, and fertilization was assessed by the presence and position of a sperm pronucleus within the egg, Gamete release occurred only on calmer days (Pemaquid Point) or calmer periods of the tidal cycle (Narraguagus estuary), and sperm:egg ratios near the time of fertilization ranged from 10:1 to 70:1. Fertilization success was 100% in both locations. Nearly all eggs were fertilized within a 1 h interval of the 6 to 7 h long high tide, 2 to 3 h after algae were covered by seawater, Gamete release occurred at low tide after a prolonged period (3 wk) of stormy weather that inhibited gamete release during high tide; this has implications for dispersal and interspecific hybridization, Archival environmental data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, 1982 to 2000) were used to predict the frequency of successful reproduction during high tide and the potential for gamete release at low tide, These studies demonstrate that sperm are not limiting to fertilization in F. vesiculosus.","Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Brawley, SH (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, 5722 Deering Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",brawley@maine.edu,,,,,,48,46,48,0,21,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In a survey of 35 sites within the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA, Nuttallia was found almost exclusively in sandy substrates, higher in the intertidal than most native clams (>1 m above mean lower low water). The distinctive distribution of Nuttallia suggested that tidal height and sediment composition may be important physical factors that control its refuge availability, regulating its exposure to predation and ultimately the success of its invasion. I tethered Nuttallia for 24 h in the high intertidal where it is typically found and in the low intertidal at an elevation where it was never found. Clams restrained to the surface suffered high mortality from crab predation at both tidal heights, whereas control clams with unrestricted burrowing movement exhibited high mortality rates only in the low intertidal. In a second experiment, I transplanted sediment within and between the two intertidal heights to measure effects of tidal height and sediment type on survival and burial depth of Nuttallia. At both tidal heights all clams placed on mud-cobble substrate, naturally common in the low intertidal, suffered high mortality rates (> 60% in 24 h). Nuttallia on loosely packed sand substrate, naturally found in the upper intertidal, survived much better, however, because they buried deeper than in the tightly packed mud. Caged control clams at both tidal heights suffered no mortality. Apparently native predators are mitigating community level impacts of an invader by excluding Nuttallia completely from some beaches with improper sediment characteristics or relegating it in others to a zone not often inhabited by native species, thereby reducing potential competitive interactions. These findings show that a physical habitat characteristic can mediate biotic resistance to an invader and thus control invasion success and community-level impacts. Generally, such physical-biological interactions may explain some of the reported site-to-site variability in invasion Success, as well as the patchy distribution of many soft-sediment infaunal species.","Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Lab, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Zool, Rudman Hall,46 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jebyers@cisunix.unh.edu,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,67,115,135,0,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2002,130,1,,,,,146,156,,10.1007/s004420100777,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,507MP,WOS:000173032500016,28547019,,,,2021-09-21,

High fat reserves provide some benefits related to starvation-risk reduction, but also imply some costs related to increased predation risks In general, subordinate species should increase their level of fat reserves in response to the unpredictability of resource access when in competition with dominants. However, the magnitude of such reserve increases could differ between subordinate species if opportunity of access to resources varies interspecifically in relation to differences in niche breadth due to differences in morphology. We tested the hypothesis that subordinate species (Parus cristatus) with decreased access to food will accumulate more fat than subordinate species (Parus ater) with greater opportunities. Results supported the prediction, We found that crested tit, the species with lower ecological plasticity and thus less access to food under competition, stores more fat daily than the coal tit, the species with higher ecological plasticity owing to its abiltiy to forage while upside down.","CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, E-04001 Almeria, Spain","Barluenga, M (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",marta.barluenga@uni-konstanz.de,"Barbosa, Andres/C-3208-2008; Barluenga, Marta/ABA-4194-2020; Moreno, Eulalia/D-4230-2014","Barbosa, Andres/0000-0001-8434-3649; Barluenga, Marta/0000-0003-1514-0586; Moreno, Eulalia/0000-0002-7197-5679",,,,20,2,2,0,8,UNIVERSITE LAVAL,ST FOY,"PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA",1195-6860,,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2001,8,4,,,,,437,440,,10.1080/11956860.2001.11682672,,,4,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,505RQ,WOS:000172929700004,,,,,2021-09-21,

Growth was strongly negatively density-dependent for both juveniles and subadults. We then used sediment of low organic content (loss on ignition 3.7 %) to test whether the density-dependence of growth was due to a direct crowding effect at high density, or mainly due to food limitation. Using an intermediate amphipod density (2800 ind. m(-2)) expected to give clear growth depression, we added baker's yeast as supplementary food at 6 levels corresponding to an input of 0 (control) to 147 g C m(-2) over an 8 wk period. The 3 highest yeast additions resulted in black, reduced sediment and elevated amphipod mortality in some replicates, but where the sediment did not become reduced, food additions enhanced growth significantly, demonstrating that growth depression at high density was primarily due to food limitation and not to crowding as such.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Stockholm, Asko Lab, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Elmgren, R (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",ragnar_e@system.ecology.su.se,"Elmgren, Ragnar/A-1854-2013",,,,,54,18,18,0,5,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

A stochastic individual-based model for simulating the dynamics of an infectious disease in sympatric red and grey squirrel populations is described. The model simulates the spread of parapoxvirus between squirrels in fragmented populations based on the dispersal of infected animals. the probability of encounters between individuals, exposure to the virus and subsequent mortality. 2. The disease model was integrated with a spatially explicit population dynamics model that simulated red and grey squirrel populations in real landscapes, using habitat information held in a geographical information system. Latin hypercube sampling was used to create a range of realistic life-history and infection scenarios and the model was used to investigate the dynamics of red and grey squirrels in Norfolk between 1966 and 1980. 3. The model predicted that parapoxvirus, like interspecific competition, could have led to the extinction of the red squirrel in Norfolk. The results suggest that the red squirrel-grey squirrel-parapoxvirus interaction represents a system of apparent competition mediated by an infectious agent, as seen in other interactions between resident and exotic species. 4. The need for further epidemiological research on the virus is emphasized. We believe that the combined effects on disease transmission of habitat, behaviour and grey squirrels acting as reservoir hosts will lead to a patchy prevalence and sporadic incidence of parapoxvirus disease in red squirrels and a more rapid local replacement by grey squirrels. 5. These results have implications for conservation management of the red squirrel in the UK. Schemes in which animals are translocated or given supplementary feeding may enhance disease spread by bringing infected animals into contact with others.","Newcastle Univ, Ctr Land Use & Water Resources Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England; NERC, Inst Terr Ecol, Huntingdon PE17 2LS, England","Rushton, SP (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Ctr Land Use & Water Resources Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",steven.rushton@ncl.ac.uk,"Lurz, Peter/O-5108-2019",,,,,67,93,97,3,87,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We also derive UP results of the system with direct interspecific competition between the prey. The role of the most profitable prey item as a keystone species, the magnitude of its carrying capacity, the ability to withstand predation of both prey species, and the ratios of their profitability values (to predators) are important to whether or not adaptive foraging may promote UP. In general, foraging decision rules play no role in UP if the alternative prey item is the keystone species. The result is also not affected by the effect of direct competitive coexistence or dominance relationship of the prey. In some cases, dominance of one of the prey species provides the most advantageous situation for ensuring UP.","Ramkrishna res Inst Sci, Kolkata 700008, W Bengal, India","Sikder, A (corresponding author), Ramkrishna res Inst Sci, Kolkata 700008, W Bengal, India.",,,,,,,18,3,3,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0303-6812,1432-1416,,J MATH BIOL,J.

Over 2 years, seasonal variations in plant water status were measured with the pressure bomb technique for two deciduous shrub species (Cussonia barteri and Crossopteryx febrifuga) and a perennial grass species (Hyparrhenia diplandra) in a humid savanna. Concurrently, soil moisture was sun eyed with the neutron probe technique ill grassy areas and under shrub clumps. Absence of transpiration at dawn was assessed by surveys of the leaf water isotopic signal, and plant water relations were characterized during rainy and dry periods with the pressure-volume curve technique, The seasonal changes in predawn and minimum shoot water potentials were pronounced for the grass species and the shrub C. febrifuga, but weak for the shrub C. barteri Relationships bel ts:cen plant and soil water status showed that both the grass species and the shrub C. febrifuga did not maintain high water potentials when soil moisture in the upper soil lavers decreased. In contrast, the shrub C. barteri exhibited a predawn water potential around -0.5 MPa when the 0 to 60-cm soil layer was at the permanent wilting point. During the early dry season, leaf dehydration was observed for C. febrifuga, but not for C. barteri. We conclude that the grass H. diplandra and the shrub C. febrifuga had very pool and limited access to deep soil layers (below 60 cm), respectively while the shrub C. barteri was able to access this water resource, The relatively low osmotic potential and tissue elasticity measured for C. febrifuga as compared to C. barteri were Consistent with the use of water from upper soil layers by this species, since these characteristics could help water withdrawal and promote turgor maintenance at lower shoot water potentials. Different water uptake patterns could explain the contrasted leaf shedding patterns reported for the two shrub species, These results emphasize that the water economy of deciduous shrub species of African humid savannas call differ significantly and that both grasses and some shrub species acquire water from the upper soil layers even during dry spells. These findings will aid understanding of interspecific competition and modelling ecosystem function in this kind of humid savanna.","Ecole Normale Super, Ecol Lab, URA 258 CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France","Le Roux, X (corresponding author), INRA, UA Bioclimatol, Domaine Crouelle, F-63039 Clermont Ferrand, France.",xlerous@clermont.inra.fr,,"LE ROUX, Xavier/0000-0001-9695-0825",,,,61,42,49,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,1998,113,4,,,,,456,466,,10.1007/s004420050398,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YY879,WOS:000072196300002,28308025,,,,2021-09-21,

To answer this question, seasonal patterns of leaf-level photosynthesis were measured in 27 tallgrass prairie species growing in sites that differed in species composition and productivity due to differences in fire history. Our specific goals were to assess the relationship between gas exchange under field conditions and success (defined as aerial plant cover) for a wide range of species, as well as for these species grouped as dominant and sub-dominant grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Because fire increases productivity and dominance by grasses in this system, we hypothesized that any relationship between photosynthesis and success would be strongest in annually burned sites. We also predicted that regardless of fire history, the dominant species (primarily C-4 grasses) would have higher photosynthetic rates than the less successful species (primarily C-3 grasses, forbs and woody plants). Because forbs and woody species are less abundant in annually burned sites, we expected that these species would have lower photosynthetic rates in annually burned than in infrequently burned sites. As expected, the dominant C-4 grasses had the highest cover on ail sites, relative to other growth forms, and they had the highest maximum and seasonally averaged photosynthetic rates (17.6 +/- 0.42 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Woody species had the lowest average cover as well as the lowest average photosynthetic rates, with subdominant grasses and forbs intermediate in both cover and photosynthesis. Also as predicted, the highest overall photosynthetic rates were found on the most productive annually burned site. Perhaps most importantly, a positive relationship was found between leaf-level photosynthesis and cover for a core group of species when data were combined across all sites. These data support the hypothesis that higher instantaneous rates of leaf-level photosynthesis are indicative of long-term plant success in this grassland. However, in contrast to our predictions, the subdominant grasses, forbs and woody species on the, annually burned site had higher photosynthetic rates than in the less frequently burned sites, even though their average cover was lower on annually burned sites, and hence they were less successful. The direct negative effect of fire on plant cover and species-specific differences in the availability of resources may explain why photosynthesis was high but cover was low in some growth forms in annually burned sites.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Mojave Desert Ecosyst Program, Ft Irwin, CA 92310 USA","Knapp, AK (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,"Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008",,,,,44,39,40,0,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1998,117,1-2,,,,,40,46,,10.1007/s004420050629,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,144YZ,WOS:000077344700006,28308504,,,,2021-09-21,

The patterns extracted are the basis for inferences about habitat preferences of species and inter actions among them. Following the logic of those inferences we develop a set of hierarchical simulations to investigate what patterns are diagnostic of the biological processes of habitat selection and interspecific competition (or facilitation). The simulations also include fishing on the simulated populations. The simulations illustrate that preferences of a pair of species along a habitat gradient produce characteristic patterns when species abundances are plotted on axes of abundance of each species. Directed fishing on one of the species eliminates much of the evidence of the pattern. Adding competitive interactions to habitat preferences creates additional diagnostic patterns in the simulated data. Fishing again eliminates much of the evidence of these patterns. Data from multispecies trawl surveys which capture flatfish produce plots that are consistent with the simulation results, although frequent zero catches for one species in a pair produces patterns not included in the simulations. With regard to explaining the distribution and abundance of flatfish in survey data, any evidence of competitive interactions and much of the evidence of differential habitat selection may be removed by the effects of directed fishing. Further simulations with more complex scenarios of fishing, habitat selection, and competition an warranted.

The model simulates daily growth, mortality, movement, and spawning over the full life cycle of each species for 100 years in a compartmentalized, hypothetical stream configured for the southern Appalachian mountains, USA. Egg and alevin development is temperature-dependent with mortality having constant, spatial, and temperature-dependent components. Daily growth of fry, juveniles, and adults is based on bioenergetics and consumption of drift prey. Mortality rate of fry through adults decreases with length. Model predictions of densities, growth, age, and size structure were similar to those observed in southern Appalachian streams. Five different conditions were simulated to explore the population dynamics and competition between the two species: (1) sympatric populations (baseline), (2) allopatric brook char, (3) allopatric rainbow trout, (4) and (5) sympatric populations with reduced or increased spawning season durations. Results indicated that density-dependence mainly operated during the fry and juvenile stages. Brook char were more affected by interspecific competition than rainbow trout, and crowding of fry negatively affected brook char (with little effect on rainbow trout), whereas low fry density favored brook char.

We examined a case where both functions are accomplished in one song type but seem to be separated into different song parts. Therefore, we firstly tried to confirm the functional separation of the male and female directed parts through recording the natural occurrence of the two song parts and secondly we tried to evaluate possible benefits of such a two part song by means of playback experiments. The song of male moustached warblers Acrocephalus melanopogon consists of a reed warbler-like warbling part often initiated by a repetiton of one simple whistle note (whistle part). According to the general intra-intersexual hypothesis, specifically developed for Acrocephalus warblers, the simple stereotyped beginning (whistle part) should be directed to male competitors and the complex ending (warbling part) to females. We obtained verification of this hypothesis through behavioural observations under natural conditions. For instance, the proportion of warbling song decreases after mating and the relationship between length of warbling song and mating interval - the days between arrival until mating of males - suggests that the warbling part is important for female attraction. The whistle part decreases less steeply after mating and actually increases significantly during the post-fertile period. Furthermore, the occurrence of whistling is related to predator disturbance and intraspecific territorial intrusions. Concerning possible benefits, by offering different playback types to territory holders, fewer males attacked the speaker if whistle intensity increased. So, there seems to be a clear benefit of introducing the song with a male oriented message. The same advantage seems to hold in interspecific context with the reed warbler which was also tested by playback experiments.",,"Fessl, B (corresponding author), KONRAD LORENZ INST VERGLEICHENDE VERHALTENSFORSCH,SAVOYENSTR 1A,A-1160 VIENNA,AUSTRIA.",,,"Fessl, Birgit/0000-0003-1260-6002",,,,37,12,13,0,5,UNIV FIRENZE ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,FLORENCE,"ATTN: PROF.

All species are food limited and there is considerable overlap in the diets of these triclads and leeches. This paper investigates interactions between the two groups using field and laboratory experiments to try to identify the mechanism of their co-existence. Triclad and leech numbers were manipulated inside experimental enclosures, matched by controls, erected on the stony shore of an eutrophic English lake. Increasing the numbers of P. tenuis and D. polychroa prior to the reproductive season in spring resulted in a significant decrease in the numbers and body size of G. complanata and H. stagnalis compared with control populations in the summer months, and vice versa. However, increases and decreases were temporary with a readjustment of numbers and body size to control levels in the autumn after reproduction had ceased. It is suggested that increasing the numbers of either group elevated the severity of both intra- and interspecific competition for food. The ''condition'' of prey may, in part, determine the strength of competition, and this was examined in laboratory experiments in which different densities and ratios of P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were offered either live of recently crushed Asellus aquaticus. In monospecific controls, growth rates of P. tenuis were greater when fed on crushed than live Asellus, but there was no significant difference in the growth of H. stagnalis fed either live or crushed prey. In mixed cultures of predators, P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were the superior competitors when fed on crushed and live Asellus, respectively. However, when competitive pressure was low, at low densities of predators, the presence of H. stagnalis in mixed cultures fed on live prey was beneficial to the growth of P. tenuis. These results are explained in terms of the greater ability of triclads to detect damaged prey, leaking body fluids, due to their sophisticated chemosensory system, and the ability of leeches to capture live prey due to the presence of suckers. It is concluded that co-existence of the two groups in British lakes is assisted by the partitioning of food on a live or damaged basis.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,21,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1996,106,4,,,,,544,550,,10.1007/BF00329714,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UT331,WOS:A1996UT33100019,28307456,,,,2021-09-21,

In nature, however, stream pools often contain not just sunfish and water striders, but also smaller fish such as minnows. Here, we used factorial experiments in seminatural streams to document the direct and indirect effects of sunfish and fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, on water strider survival and behavior. Sunfish, minnows and gerrids all consume surface prey (here, crickets); thus these three species are potential food competitors. Sunfish eat minnows. Accordingly, the presence of sunfish caused minnows to increase their schooling behavior and shift their activity from the surface toward the bottom substrate. The presence of sunfish was also associated with an increase in the number of missing gerrids, whereas minnows caused relatively little gerrid disappearance. Most interestingly, the presence of minnows decreased the effect of sunfish on gerrid disappearance rates; that is, minnows apparently had an indirect positive effect on water strider survival. We suggest that this indirect positive effect reflects the fact that minnows are alternative prey for sunfish. The effects of sunfish and minnows on gerrid mortality explained the influence of these fish on gerrid behavior. Sunfish caused decreases in male gerrid activity, female availability, mating activity, mating frequency and mating duration. Larger males had a mating advantage over smaller males only in pools with sunfish and no minnows. Sunfish also caused a borderline significant decrease in the large female mating advantage. These results were all observed in previous studies and can be viewed as adaptive responses to predation risk. These patterns were not consistent with the expected effects of sunfish as food competitors with water striders. In contrast, minnows had relatively Little influence on water strider behavior and the few significant effects were the opposite of those of sunfish. Minnows caused increases in female activity and in mating duration, a decrease in the large male mating advantage and an increase in the large female mating advantage. These patterns fit the view that minnows caused an increase in gerrid hunger, i.e., that minnows acted as food competitors with gerrids. Finally, planned contrasts against controls showed that, in the presence of both sunfish and minnows, water striders showed no significant behavioral responses to fish (i.e., gerrid behavior in pools with sunfish and minnows did not significantly differ from behavior in fishless pools). The most likely mechanism explaining this pattern is a dilution of sunfish predation risk due to the presence of minnows serving as alternative prey for sunfish.",,"Sih, A (corresponding author), UNIV KENTUCKY,TH MORGAN SCH BIOL SCI,CTR ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV,LEXINGTON,KY 40506, USA.",,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,42,26,26,0,6,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1996,105,2,,,,,179,188,,10.1007/BF00328544,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TV593,WOS:A1996TV59300006,28307080,,,,2021-09-21,

Because hominid and carnivore damage frequencies have not been estimated, however, debate continues on the extent and nature of hominid and carnivore involvement in many assemblages, thereby hindering reconstructions of early Homo socioecology. Analysis of hammerstone- and carnivore-induced damage frequencies on all large mammal limb pieces in the FLK Zinjanthropus, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, fossil assemblage provides direct estimates of hominid and carnivore involvement. Three patterns are clear: (1) hominid-induced damage on 75% of the limb MNE demonstrates that early Homo habitually processed carcass-parts; (2) carnivore damages and fractures occur on 54% and 8-5% of the limb MNE, respectively, indicating a significant carnivore role in assemblage modification, but Dot breakage; (3) the lack of carnivore damage on 60% of hominid-damaged specimens implies that early Homo had regular access to meat-rich carcasses. Because social carnivores also habitually transport food, the biological and ecological forcing mechanisms behind these behaviors are examined for implications for early Homo socioecology. Anti-predator defense is a primary factor in the evolution of sociality in the Carnivora (Gittleman, 1989). Thus, food transport from a carcass by a foraging group is an anti-predator strategy that minimizes interspecific competition at carcasses. Similarly, maintenance of a refuge area to which food is transported to mother and altricial young reflects a risk-reduction strategy to protect the young. Early Homo shared these ecological and biological conditions, occupying with its altricial young (Stanley, 1992) semi-open habitats with high predator densities. Thus, the habitual food transport and processing documented at FLK Zinjanthropus suggest that early Homo was subject to these same socioecological mechanisms that require similar group division into two functional units (foraging and care-giving) when infants are present. Processed animal remains at places like FLK Zinjanthropus may not represent provisioning or food sharing, per se, but merely the intersection of two anti-predator strategies. Nevertheless, the ecological and biological conditions, and prerequisite subsistence behaviors were apparently in place for the development of social behaviors originally envisioned by Isaac (1978a).",,"OLIVER, JS (corresponding author), ILLINOIS STATE MUSEUM,CTR RES & COLLECT,ANTHROPOL SECT,1011 E ASH ST,SPRINGFIELD,IL 62703, USA.",,,,,,,84,89,90,0,7,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 7DX",0047-2484,,,J HUM EVOL,J.

A series of eight shallow wells, four in patches of each grass type, was used to describe physicochemical conditions known to limit the distribution of both grasses. Tidal amplitude, surface and subsurface salinity, and subsurface oxidation-reduction potential were found to be within range, but suboptimal, for both grasses. Evidence of selective grazing upon S. alterniflora was found through examination of grazing sign within the grass patches, observations of feral horse feeding behavior, and examination of feral horse feces for grass epidermal fragments. An exclosure experiment simulated preferential grazing and showed that S. alternifora responded negatively while D. spicata responded positively to simulated preferential grazing of S. alterniflora. These results point to a competitive relationship between the grasses under suboptimal conditions for dominance of either species. Selective herbivory (analogous to predation) upon S. alterniflora was shown to be a plausible factor impacting the competitive relationship to favor D. spicata.

In experiments, conducted at 14-degrees-C and a photoperiod of 16 hrs L: 8 hrs D, three size classes of leeches of each species were each exposed to each of three size classes of each of five prey species, viz. Tubifex sp., Chironomus sp., Asellus aquaticus, Lymnaea peregra and Potamopyrgus jenkinsi. For each prey species, three different types of experiments were performed: one leech exposed to four prey individuals; four leeches of the same species with sixteen prey; and two leeches of each species with sixteen prey. In the first experiment, all sizes of G. complanata were capable of feeding on all sizes of the prey types offered; the same was true for H. stagnalis with exceptions of feeding on large A. aquaticus and large L. peregra. For both species, but especially for G. complanata, there was a trend within each size class of leech for decreasing proportions of fed leeches with increasing prey size, and within each size class of prey for an increasing proportion of fed leeches with increasing leech size; however there were several exceptions to these trends. Both leeches fed extensively on Tubifex sp. but there were significant differences in the proportions feeding on other prey types; G. complanata fed more on A. aquaticus and the two snail species, and less on Chironomus, than H. stagnalis. The effect of increasing the number of leech individuals from one to four individuals, of the same or mixed species, had little effect on the proportion of leeches which had fed. It is concluded that large G. complanata will have access to large individuals of certain prey taxa denied H. stagnalis, which may lessen the intensity of interspecific competition.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,29,7,7,0,4,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN 21,1994,273,2,,,,,67,75,,10.1007/BF00006848,,,9,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,MX529,WOS:A1994MX52900001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Riffle reaches were sampled by electrofishing and their macrohabitat was described in terms of substratum, flow, elevation, and vegetation characteristics. Galaxias densities in reaches containing large trout were lower than reaches with only small trout or no trout and trout size was the most important variable determining galaxias density. Densities of galaxias < 80 mm were reduced in the presence of large trout, but not galaxias > 80 mm. Reaches with large, small, or no trout varied in terms of water depth, percentage cobble, and elevation. However, these differences were unlikely to account for variations in galaxias densities because selection for these particular habitat features accounted for only a small proportion of the observed variation in galaxias density. A change in macrohabitat use by galaxias from fast current velocities in sites without trout to slower velocities in sites with large trout may be explained by competition for areas of high velocity (potentially the better feeding areas). However, a combination of interspecific competition and predation by large brown trout is likely to be responsible for the observed reductions in the density of smaller galaxias.",,"MCINTOSH, AR (corresponding author), UNIV OTAGO,DEPT ZOOL,POB 56,DUNEDIN,NEW ZEALAND.",,"Crowl, Todd/C-9576-2011; McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011; Townsend, Colin/AAZ-2027-2020","McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813; ",,,,0,42,46,1,9,SIR PUBLISHING,WELLINGTON,"PO BOX 399, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND",0028-8330,,,NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH,N.

However, few long-term, large scale field experiments have been conducted in the temperate Neotropics, and such studies are needed to assess the generality of patterns largely derived from studies conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. Since 1988, we have been investigating the role of vertebrate predation, interspecific competition, and small mammal herbivory in a thom scrub community located in 1 national park (Fray Jorge) in north-central Chile (Norte Chico). Large fenced enclosures are used to selectively exclude foxes and avian raptors, and the principal small mammal herbivore, Octodon degus. Initial results have show significant effects of predator exclusions in numbers, survival rates, population structure, and behavior of degus. Although effects of excluding degus and/or predators have been mostly nonsignificant on other small mammal and plant species thus far, large increases have occurred in these groups as a result of an El Nino (ENSO) event in 1991-92. The importance of long-term, large scale studies of this nature is emphasized particularly in the None Chico where unpredictable rainfall events have dramatic effects on the community, and where tho impact of desertification has been particularly severe.",,"MESERVE, PL (corresponding author), NO ILLINOIS UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,DE KALB,IL 60115, USA.",,,,,,,0,20,21,0,12,SOC BIOL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 14164 CORREO, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

Their foraging behaviour has been extensively studied in an attempt to determine their potential for controlling pest aphids, which occur in patches that are relatively short lived and within which the aphids are not uniformly distributed but clumped. In seeking aphid prey ladybirds like other insect predators forage both extensively and intensively, and use visual and olfactory cues for orientation. Intensive search follows an encounter with an aphid and serves to keep the predator in the vicinity of a cluster of prey. The success of larvae in capturing prey is dependent on abiotic and biotic factors such as plant structure, species of aphid attacked, the predator, in particular its age, level of hunger and genetic characteristics, and intra- and interspecific competition. It is suggested that the poor progress in developing a foraging theory for insect predators, and ladybirds in particular, is a consequence of having mainly concentrated on the foraging behaviour of the most voracious stage, the larva. The behaviour of larvae serves to keep them within the patch selected by the adult. Thus for a better understanding we need information on the cues used by ladybird adults to assess the quality of patches of prey.",,"FERRAN, A (corresponding author), INRA,BIOL INVERTEBRES LAB,37 BD CAP,F-06606 ANTIBES,FRANCE.",,,,,,,0,94,96,0,31,"CZECH ACAD SCI, INST ENTOMOLOGY",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"BRANISOVSKA 31, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC 370 05",1210-5759,,,EUR J ENTOMOL,Eur.

We compared changes in the relative abundance of the main component species of the communities in monoculture and mixed culture along a trampling gradient. At no trampling in mixed culture. Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. elatior and Erigeron annuus (roadside herbs. RH) predominated and excluded the trampled community species. Severe trampling markedly reduced the predominance of these roadside herbs, promoted Eragrostis ferruginea (a perennial grass of EP), but suppressed Eleusine indica (an annual grass of ED). These results suggest that the differentiation of trampled and roadside herb communities under heavy trampling are caused by asymmetric competition between their main species. Several species pairs showed a constant rank order of relative cover at high trampling levels. Pennisetum alopecuroides (a perennial grass of both RH and EP) and Eragrostis coexisted, indicating symmetric competition. Eragrostis and Plantago asiatica (a perennial herb of EP) or Poa annua (a winter-annual grass of both EP and ED) coexisted through separation in phenology. Eragrostis promoted the survival of Plantago by moderating unpredictable drought (commensalistic positive interaction).

The three species pairs which shared nest trees were P. cucullatus (35 colonies) and P. nigerrimus (34 colonies), M. rubricollis (71 colonies) and P. tricolor (8 colonies), M. scutatus (22 colonies) and M. nitens (12 colonies). In the first species pair high niche overlap values along all four dimensions (habitat, nest height, nest materials and diet) contradicted Pianka's (1974) niche overlap hypothesis that high overlap is the result of reduced competition. At an inter-generic level his theory appeared applicable because high overlap values along one dimension followed low values along others. May & MacArthur (1972) predicted an inverse relationship between niche overlap and intensity of competition. Low alpha (alpha) values of nest materials (M. rubricollis-P. tricolor) and nest height (M. scutatus-M. nitens) fitted their explanation because competition must have caused complete distinctness in the two axes. Population assessment provided evidence that under shared colony conditions, only one species numerically dominated. Hence competition risk was reduced even though overlapping of certain niche dimensions allowed for the possibility of competition. The beaks of all six species are not specialized for diet although Ploceus spp. is granivorous and Malimbus spp. and P. tricolor are insectivorous. Within the malimbes segregation along this axis was incomplete while only partial niche segregation was evident between the two groups. Ecological separation of P. tricolor nests was considered to be the result of competition from P. cucullatus and P. nigerrimus.",,"DIN, NA (corresponding author), UNIV IFE,NAT HIST MUSEUM,IFE,NIGERIA.",,,,,,,25,5,6,0,14,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0141-6707,,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

We expected an advance in laying date and a reduction in clutch size during warmer springs as a general response to climate warming and a delay in laying date and a reduction in clutch size during warmer winters due to density-dependent effects. As expected, as spring temperature increases laying date advances and as winter temperature increases clutch size is reduced in both species. Density of great tit affected the relationship between winter temperature and laying date in great and blue tit. Specifically, as density of great tit increased and temperature in winter increased both species started to reproduce later. Density of blue tit affected the relationship between spring temperature and blue and great tit laying date. Thus, both species start to reproduce earlier with increasing spring temperature as density of blue tit increases, which was not an expected outcome, since we expected that increasing spring temperature should advance laying date, while increasing density should delay it cancelling each other out. Climate warming and its interaction with density affects clutch size of great tits but not of blue tits. As predicted, great tit clutch size is reduced more with density of blue tits as temperature in winter increases. The relationship between spring temperature and density on clutch size of great tits depends on whether the increase is in density of great tit or blue tit. Therefore, an increase in temperature negatively affected the coexistence of blue and great tits differently in both species. Thus, blue tit clutch size was unaffected by the interaction effect of density with temperature, while great tit clutch size was affected in multiple ways by these interactions terms.","[Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris Saclay, Ecol Systemat Evolut, CNRS, AgroParisTech, Orsay, France;

Physiological studies indicated that DCM was degraded in this mixed culture at least in a three-step process: i) fermentation of DCM to acetate and formate, ii) formate oxidation to CO2 and H-2, and iii) H-2/GO(2) reductive acetogenesis. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing of cultures enriched with formate or H-2 showed that Desulfovibrio was the dominant population followed by Acetobacterium, but sequences representing Dehalobacterium were only present in cultures amended with DCM. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses confirmed that acetate produced from C-13-labelled DCM was marked at the methyl ([2-C-13]acetate), carboxyl ([1-C-13]acetate), and both ([1,2-C-13]acetate) positions, which is in accordance to acetate formed by both direct DCM fermentation and H-2/CO2 acetogenesis. The inhibitory effect of ten different co-contaminants frequently detected in groundwaters on DCM degradation was also investigated. Complete inhibition of DCM degradation was observed when chloroform, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, and diuron were added at 838, 400, and 107 mu M, respectively. However, the inhibited cultures recovered the DCM degradation capability when transferred to fresh medium without co-contaminants. Findings derived from this work are of significant relevance to provide a better understanding of the synergistic interactions among bacteria to accomplish DCM degradation as well as to predict the effect of co-contaminants during anaerobic DCM bioremediation in groundwater.

The ability (or inability) of species to coexist has consequences for diversity and ultimately ecosystem stability. Urbanization is predicted to change species interactions but its relative impact is not well known. Urbanization gradients offer the opportunity to evaluate the effect of humans on species interactions by comparing community dynamics across levels of disturbance. We used camera traps deployed by citizen scientists to survey mammals along urbanization gradients of two cities (Washington, DC and Raleigh, NC, USA). We used a multispecies occupancy model with four competing predator species to test whether forest fragmentation, interspecific interactions, humans or prey had the greatest influence on carnivore distribution. Our study produced 6,413 carnivore detections from 1,260 sites in two cities, sampling both private and public lands. All species used all levels of the urbanization gradient to a similar extent, but co-occurrence of urban-adapted foxes with less urban-adapted bobcats and coyotes was dependent on the availability of green space, especially as urbanization increased. This suggests green space allows less urban-adapted species to occupy suburban areas, but focuses their movements through remaining forest patches, leading to more species interactions. Synthesis and applications. Species interactions, forest fragmentation and human-related covariates were important determinants of carnivore occupancy across a gradient of urbanization with the relative importance of forest fragmentation being highest. We found evidence of both positive and negative interactions across the gradient with some dependent on available green space, suggesting that fragmentation leads to higher levels of spatial interaction. Where green space is adequate, there appears to be sufficient opportunity for coexistence between carnivore species in an urban landscape.","[Parsons, Arielle W.; Schuttler, Stephanie G.; Kays, Roland] North Carolina Museum Nat Sci, Raleigh, NC 27601 USA; [Parsons, Arielle W.; Kays, Roland] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Rota, Christopher T.] West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Wildlife & Fisheries Resources Program, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Forrester, Tavis; McShea, William J.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Front Royal, VA USA; [Forrester, Tavis] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR USA; [Baker-Whatton, Megan C.] Nature Conservancy, 1815 N Lynn St, Arlington, VA USA; [Millspaugh, Joshua J.] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Parsons, AW (corresponding author), North Carolina Museum Nat Sci, Raleigh, NC 27601 USA.; Parsons, AW (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",arielle.parsons@naturalsciences.org,,"Kays, Roland/0000-0002-2947-6665",,,,61,18,20,6,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Most studies investigating the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning focus on species richness, predominantly within the context of productivity-related functions. Consequently, there is limited understanding of how other biodiversity measures, such as species evenness (the distribution of abundance among species), affect complex multitrophic functions such as pollination. We explore the effect of species evenness on the ecosystem function of pollination using a controlled experiment with selected plants and insects in flight cages. We manipulated the relative abundances of plant and pollinator species, while holding species richness, composition, dominance order, and total abundance constant. Then, we tested how numerical species evenness affected network structure and consequently, seed production, in our artificial communities. Contrary to our expectation, numerical dominance in plant communities increased complementarity in pollinator use (reduced pollinator sharing) among plant species. As predicted by theory, this increased complementarity resulted in higher seed production for the most dominant and rare plant species in our cages. Our results show that in a controlled experiential setting, numerical species evenness can alter important aspects of plant-pollinator networks and plant reproduction, irrespective of species richness, composition, and total abundance. Extending this understanding of how species evenness affects ecosystem functioning to natural systems is crucial as anthropogenic disturbances continue to alter species' abundances, likely disrupting ecosystem functions long before extinctions occur.","[Stavert, Jamie R.; Beggs, Jacqueline R.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Auckland, New Zealand; [Stavert, Jamie R.] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Bartomeus, Ignasi] CSIC, EBD, Integrat Ecol Dept, Ave Amer Vespucio 26,Isla Cartuja, E-41092 Seville, Spain; [Gaskett, Anne C.; Pattemore, David E.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Pattemore, David E.] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Hamilton, New Zealand","Stavert, JR (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Auckland, New Zealand.; Stavert, JR (corresponding author), Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",jamie.stavert@gmail.com,"; Pattemore, David/G-1269-2018","Bartomeus, Ignasi/0000-0001-7893-4389; Pattemore, David/0000-0003-4609-2660","University of Auckland; Todd Foundation for Excellence; Ministry of Business Innovation and EmploymentNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) [C11X1309]; BeeFun project [PCIG14-GA-2013-631653]","We thank Emily Grout, Carolina Lara Mendoza, and countless volunteers for their tireless efforts helping to run the experiment.

During this process there is also a redistribution of particulate matter (PM) that is deposited from the atmosphere on vegetative surfaces and transported to soil layers by throughfall and stemflow. We collected samples of rainfall, throughfall, and stemflow from two different forest plots (pine and oak) in a Mediterranean mountainous area and analyzed the amount and size distributions of PM (0.45m<PM<500m). The exploration of backward trajectories revealed that PM content varied significantly. This depended on the origin of the air mass, with Atlantic fronts transporting less PM in the atmosphere than North African dust intrusions, which added disproportionate inputs of PM. Overall, throughfall provided the largest proportion of incoming PM under trees, but, at the base of each tree, stemflow led to a localized input of water that was more PM enriched than water through open precipitation or throughfall. Interspecific differences in PM fluxes were noted with pines retaining more PM in their crowns than oaks. Furthermore, the presence of leaves on oak increased the size and the amount of particulates released by throughfall. The PM in stemflow was smaller and rounder than in throughfall. This study adds to our understanding knowledge of the processes that control the deposition and distribution of PM delivered to forest soils, a fraction that is often ignored in studies of nutrient and energy fluxes in ecosystems.","[Cayuela, Carles; Latron, Jerome; Llorens, Pilar] Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA CSIC, Barcelona, Spain; [Levia, Delphis F.] Univ Delaware, Dept Geog, Newark, DE USA","Cayuela, C (corresponding author), Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA CSIC, Barcelona, Spain.",carles.cayuela@idaea.csic.es,"Latron, Jerome/L-2281-2014; Llorens, Pilar/D-1046-2015","Latron, Jerome/0000-0003-3253-6734; Llorens, Pilar/0000-0003-4591-5303","project TransHyMed - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion [CGL2016-75957-R AEI/FEDER, UE]; project MASCC-DYNAMITE - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion [PCIN-2017-061/AEI]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2014-070609, EEBB-I-16-11510]; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport [PRX15/00326]","This research was supported by the projects TransHyMed (CGL2016-75957-R AEI/FEDER, UE) and MASCC-DYNAMITE (PCIN-2017-061/AEI) funded by the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion.

We explore methods for estimating two important facets of species distributions, namely where the range limit occurs and how species interactions structure distributions. Accurate understanding of range limits is crucial for predicting range dynamics and shifts in response to interspecific interactions and climate change. Additionally, species interactions are increasingly recognized as an important but not well-understood predictor of range shifts. Our objective was to predict range limits and contact zones for two plethodontid salamanders, the highly range-restricted Shenandoah salamander (Plethodon shenandoah) and the wide-ranging red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus). Using detection/non-detection data, we assess four methodological decisions when estimating species' distributions: (1) accounting for imperfect detection, (2) covariates to predict species occurrences, (3) accounting for species interactions, and (4) the inclusion of spatial autocorrelation. We found that Shenandoah salamander and red-backed salamander co-occurrence would have been underestimated and the range edge misidentified had we not accounted for incomplete detection. Covariates related to habitat were not sufficient to explain species' range boundaries. Models that included spatial autocorrelation (i.e., a conditional autoregressive random effect) performed better than models that included just species interactions (i.e., detection and occurrence were conditional on the other species being present) and models that included both spatial autocorrelation and species interactions. Further, we found that the breadth of primary contact zones was typically 60-170 m, which is greater on average than previous estimates. In addition, we frequently observed secondary, disjunct contact zones along the range boundary. Understanding the extent to which species co-occur and how the range boundaries are shaped is crucial to conservation efforts. Our work indicates that accounting for detection is crucial for accurately characterizing range edges and that spatial models may be especially effective in modeling distributions at the boundary.","[Amburgey, S.

The results illustrate that the community composition of cyanobacteria is primarily driven by physical factors and the zooplankton community, and their interactions. Niche differentiation between Microcystis and two N-2-fixing taxa in Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu was observed, whereas small temperature fluctuations in Lake Dianchi supported co-dominance. Through structural equation modelling, predictor variables were aggregated into 'composites' representing their combined effects on species-specific biomass. The model results showed that Microcystis biomass was affected by water temperature and P concentrations across the studied lakes. The biomass of two filamentous taxa, by contrast, exhibited lake-specific responses. Understanding of driving forces of the succession and competition among bloom-forming cyanobacteria will help to guide lake restoration in the context of climate warming and N:P stoichiometry imbalances.","[Shan, Kun; Song, Lirong; Chen, Wei; Li, Lin; Liu, Liming; Wu, Yanlong; Jia, Yunlu; Zhou, Qichao; Peng, Liang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Shan, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Chongqing Inst Green & Intelligent Technol, Big Data Min & Applicat Ctr, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China; [Song, Lirong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Shan, K; Song, LR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",shankun@cigit.ac.cn; lrsong@ihb.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41561144008, 51609229]; Chongqing Science and Technology CommissionNatural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC [cstc2017jcyjAX0241]; National Key Scientific and Technological Project of China [2014ZX07104-006]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2008CB418006]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 41561144008; No. 51609229), Chongqing Science and Technology Commission (No. cstc2017jcyjAX0241), and National Key Scientific and Technological Project of China (2014ZX07104-006).

However, plant quality may also be crucial in mediating herbivore interspecific interactions. This is especially true when competition occurs between distantly related herbivore species, given that small terrestrial herbivores (e.g., insect herbivores) appear to be more sensitive to alterations of plant quality than plant quantity. In this study, we first tested in the field whether large vertebrate herbivores (cattle Bos taurus) exerted a negative effect on smaller insect herbivores (grasshopper Euchorthippus unicolor) through their overlapping foraging preferences for a dominant grass Leymus chinensis. We measured changes in grass quantity, grass quality, and microclimatic conditions in response to vertebrate grazing and conducted additional manipulative studies in the field and the laboratory to identify potential mechanisms underlying the interaction. Our results showed that grazing by large herbivores caused a significant decline in grasshopper population density and individual performance (survival, size, and weight of both female and male E. unicolor), despite a 38% increase in grass nitrogen (N) content in grazed plots. Experiments manipulating N levels of L. chinensis in the field and the laboratory confirmed that enriching plant N had a negative effect on grasshopper individual performance and population size. Therefore, enhanced quality (N content) of plant resources appears to be an important driver in mediating the negative effect of vertebrate grazing on grasshoppers. Synthesis. We document that phylogenetic relatedness and trait similarity can be poor predictors of interaction strength in some cases, since distantly related herbivores of disparate size can interact indirectly via changes in plant quality. Counter-intuitively, the observed negative effect of cattle on grasshoppers was mediated, at least in part, by an increase in plant quality in cattle grazed areas. The implication is that light to moderate grazing, a common management strategy, may contribute to suppression of grasshoppers in the Eurasian steppe grassland system by altering plant nutrient supplies.","[Zhu, Yu; Zhong, Zhiwei; Wang, Deli; Ma, Quanhui; Hassan, Nazim; Zhu, Hui; Wang, Ling] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Sch Environm, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol,Minist Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yu] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pages, Jordi F.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Isle Of Anglesey, Wales; [Finke, Deborah] Univ Missouri, Div Plant Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Wang, D (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Sch Environm, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol,Minist Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wangd@nenu.edu.cn,"Pages, Jordi F/E-7107-2013; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Pages, Jordi F/0000-0001-9346-8312; Liu, Chen/0000-0002-9916-2346; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; ZHU, HUI/0000-0003-0348-5560","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500602]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31230012, 31302012, 31700357]; Program for Introducing Talents to Universities [B16011]; Program for Innovative Research Team in University [IRT-16R11]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2412016KJ023]; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for WalesUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Higher Education Funding Council for England","National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0500602; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31230012, 31302012 and 31700357; Program for Introducing Talents to Universities, Grant/Award Number: B16011; Program for Innovative Research Team in University, Grant/Award Number: IRT-16R11; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2412016KJ023; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales",,69,11,12,9,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Despite its interest for common eggplant (S. melongena L.) breeding, up to now no success has been obtained in introgression breeding of eggplant with American Solanum species. Using an interspecific hybrid between common eggplant and S. elaeagnifolium as maternal parent we were able to obtain several fruits with viable seed after pollination with S. melongena pollen. Twenty individuals of the first backcross (BC1) generation were crossed again to the S. melongena parent and second backcross (BC2) seed was obtained for 17 of them, suggesting that most of the genome of S. elaeagnifolium is likely to be represented in the set of BC2 families. Five plants of each of the two parents, interspecific hybrid and BC1 generation were characterized with morphological descriptors and for pollen viability. The interspecific hybrid was intermediate among parents, although in overall morphological characteristics more similar to the S. elaeagnifolium parent. However, pollen viability of the hybrid was very low (2.6%). The BC1 generation was intermediate in characteristics between the hybrid and the S. melongena parent, with pollen viability increasing to an average of 19.4%. The root system of the inter specific hybrid indicated that it is able to explore larger areas of the soil than the S. melongena parent. The phenolics profile of the fruit of the two parents and hybrid revealed a higher diversity in phenolic constituents in S. elaeagnifolium compared to S. melongena, where the major phenolic compound was chlorogenic acid, while the interspecific hybrid was intermediate. By using flow cytometry it was found that S. elaeagnifolium, S. melongena, and their interspecific hybrid were diploid, although the genome size of S. elaeagnifolium was slightly smaller than that of S. melongena. Our results represent the first report of successful development of backcross generations of common eggplant with a New World Solarium species. This makes available a relatively unexplored, phylogenetically distant genepool for eggplant breeding. The backcross materials obtained can make a relevant contribution to developing new eggplant cultivars with new nutritional and environmental properties.","[Garcia-Fortea, Edgar; Gramazio, Pietro; Vilanova, Santiago; Fita, Ana; Mangino, Giulio; Villanueva, Gloria; Arrones, Andrea; Prohens, Jaime; Plazas, Mariola] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Conservac & Mejora Agrodiversidad Valenciana, Camino Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Knapp, Sandra] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England","Plazas, M (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Conservac & Mejora Agrodiversidad Valenciana, Camino Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",maplaav@btc.upv.es,"Fita, ANA/K-4250-2017; De La O Plazas Avila, Maria/AAA-8711-2019; Gramazio, Pietro/O-3143-2017; Garcia-Fortea, Edgar/AAE-9390-2021; vilanova, santiago/AAA-5743-2019; Prohens, Jaime/H-2228-2015","De La O Plazas Avila, Maria/0000-0001-8090-7312; Gramazio, Pietro/0000-0003-2226-7999; vilanova, santiago/0000-0003-4939-9713; Prohens, Jaime/0000-0003-1181-9065; FITA, ANA/0000-0002-8637-5852; Arrones Olmo, Andrea/0000-0003-3926-0291; Garcia-Fortea, Edgar/0000-0002-1094-7383","Government of Norway; European UnionEuropean Commission [677379]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (MINECO/FEDER) [AGL2015-64755-R]; Conselleria d'Educacio, Investigacio, Cultura i Esport de la Generalitat Valenciana [GRISOLIAP/2016/012]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [FCJI-2015-24835]; Conselleria d'Educacio, Investigacio, Cultura i Esport de la Generalitat Valenciana; Fons Social Europeu [APOSTD/2018/014]; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia","This work was undertaken as part of the initiative Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives, which is supported by the Government of Norway.

Effective management for conservation of these species is therefore hindered. The aim of the present study was to investigate the habitat use and population dynamics of the ash-grey mouse (Pseudomys albocinereus) through trapping and radio-tracking in Boonanarring Nature Reserve, Western Australia. Although there was no relationship between capture rate and time since fire, ash-grey mice selected dense understorey vegetation. Burrows (47% of 19 unique daytime locations), Xanthorrhoea spp. (26%), tree hollows (11%), shrubs (11%), and logs were selected as daytime refuges. Mean (+/- s.e.) short-term home-range size was 1.70 +/- 0.97ha (n=9) (maximum=9.15ha). There was some evidence that ash-grey mice may be excluded from favourable habitat by a high abundance of house mice (Mus musculus). Management to prevent declines of ash-grey mice should minimise threats to significant habitat features - areas with dense understorey vegetation, soils suitable for burrowing, grasstrees, hollow logs, and tree hollows. Suitable management strategies include: retention or rehabilitation of remnant vegetation; exclusion of livestock; low-intensity, small-area burns; and control of weeds, introduced predators and Phytophthora cinnamomi.","[Smith, K.

Prey depletion might cause trophic niche widening in generalist species, but not in specialists, which are expected to increase their foraging effort without diet shifts. In sympatric species feeding on similar resources, reduced food availability can increase interspecific competition and cause trophic niche segregation. To understand these processes, we studied the spatio-temporal variability in diet and niche width in 2 sympatric gull species, the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis and Audouin's gull Ichthyaetus audouinii, which have experienced exponential growth in recent decades due to an increase in anthropogenic food subsidies. We sampled feathers from chicks of both species in several colonies along the western Mediterranean from 2009 to 2011 and performed stable isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur on these feathers. Bayesian modelling shows that both species displayed opportunistic behaviour if different types of resources were available, but could also narrow their trophic niche if 1 resource was abundant. We also provide evidence of trophic segregation between the 2 gull species, suggesting the occurrence of interspecific competition for food. Our meta-population approach provides a comprehensive view of the trophic ecology and the competitive interactions of these gull species. We emphasize the usefulness of 3-dimensional isotope analyses to correctly assess spatio-temporal variability in trophic behaviour of predator species, revealing differences that would remain hidden in single population studies or when using only the isotopic ratios of 2 elements.","[Morera-Pujol, Virginia; Ramos, Raul; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob] Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Morera-Pujol, Virginia; Ramos, Raul; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Mendez, Nestor] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Sede Andina, Inst Invest Recursos Nat Agroecol & Desarrollo Ru, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Cerda-Cuellar, Marta] IRTA, CReSA, Campus Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona 08193, Spain","Morera-Pujol, V (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.; Morera-Pujol, V (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",morera.virginia@gmail.com,"Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Cerda, Marta/U-4534-2018; Morera-Pujol, Virginia/AAE-6412-2020; Perez-Mendez, Nestor/AAB-1505-2020; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/C-3942-2008; Ramos, Raul/S-3112-2016","Cerda, Marta/0000-0001-6842-1299; Morera-Pujol, Virginia/0000-0001-6500-5548; Perez-Mendez, Nestor/0000-0001-6264-2920; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/0000-0002-8691-9397; Ramos, Raul/0000-0002-0551-8605","Spanish INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [FAU2008-00012-C02-01]; MINECO [CGL2009-11278/BOS]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness programme [BES-2014-068025]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [JCI-2012-11848]","Legal permissions for the development of the fieldwork were obtained from the Dept. de Medi Ambient i Habitatge de la Generalitat de Catalunya, Conselleria de Medi Ambient i Mobilitat del Govern de les Illes Balears, Conselleria de Medi Ambient de la Generalitat Valenciana, Consejeria de Medio Ambiente de la Junta de Andalucia, Parc Natural del Delta de l'Ebre, Parc Natural del Montgri, les Illes Medes i el Baix Ter, Parc Natural Illes Columbretes and Parc Natural de Sa Dragonera.

While encounters between coyotes and dogs are difficult to observe, we capitalized on publicly available video recordings of coyote-dog encounters to observe canid behaviors and examined 35 video clips downloaded from YouTube during fall 2014. We identified coyote-dog interactions that were playful, agonistic, or predatory; those that we could not clearly categorize were labeled as other/undetermined. We found that both species were recorded directing play to the other species, which led to mutual play bouts. We observed a similar number of agonistic encounters, which included dogs biting coyotes and coyotes biting dogs. The main difference in agonistic behavior was that coyotes usually showed defensive aggression while dogs did not show defensive aggression. We also observed coyotes ambushing and bite-shaking small dogs in 3 video clips, from which the dogs escaped, but we did not see predatory behavior of dogs toward coyotes. Dog size may be related to types of interactions. No small dogs were involved in agonistic interactions, and only 1 small dog was observed playing with a coyote. From these videos, we conclude that the relationship between coyotes and dogs cannot be simply described as predator-prey; indeed, much of it appears to be social behavior divided between playful and agonistic. Future work that aims to explain the proximate correlates of play and aggression would provide more information for managers who wish to educate humans to reduce human-wildlife conflicts.","[Boydston, Erin E.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, 401 W Hillcrest Dr, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA; [Abelson, Eric S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, La Kretz Ctr Calif Conservat Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kazanjian, Ari; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Abelson, Eric S.] USFS Pacific Southwest Res Stn, 1731 Res Pk Dr, Davis, CA 95618 USA","Boydston, EE (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, 401 W Hillcrest Dr, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA.",eboydston@usgs.gov,,,UCLA La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science; U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area,"E.

In field studies, all gray triggerfish and red snapper were counted and sizes estimated on 24 reef sites. Gray triggerfish were then removed from half of these reef sites, resulting in significantly fewer gray triggerfish on the removal reefs at the start of the experiment. After 7 months the experiment ended and reef sites were resurveyed. Gray triggerfish decreased on both treatments, while the mean number of red snapper did not differ between treatments; however, there were significantly more small (<400 mm total length) red snapper on reefs where gray triggerfish were removed. In seven laboratory growth trials (30 to 35 days each), red snapper held with gray triggerfish had significantly lower growth rates and numerous bite marks compared with red snapper alone. These competitive interactions indicate that management efforts to rebuild and increase gray triggerfish populations may have unintentional negative effects on red snapper populations, particularly for smaller fish.","[Simmons, Carrie M.; Szedlmayer, Stephen T.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA; [Simmons, Carrie M.] Gulf Mexico Fishery Management Council, 4107 West Spruce St,Suite 200, Tampa, FL 33607 USA","Simmons, CM (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA.; Simmons, CM (corresponding author), Gulf Mexico Fishery Management Council, 4107 West Spruce St,Suite 200, Tampa, FL 33607 USA.",carrie.simmons@gulfcouncil.org,,,"Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium [MASGC R/SP-14]; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA06OAR4170078]; Marine Resources Division, Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources","We thank Sabrina Beyer, Allison Chapin, Lee Grove, Diana Miller, David Nadeau, Rebecca Redman, Darin Topping, Rebecca Wingate, and Bill Wildberger for field assistance.

Transmission of parasites between host species affects host population dynamics, interspecific competition, and ecosystem structure and function. In areas where wild and domestic herbivores share grazing land, management of parasites in livestock may affect or be affected by sympatric wildlife due to cross-species transmission. 2. We develop a novel method for simulating transmission potential based on both biotic and abiotic factors in a semi-arid system in Botswana. Optimal timing of antiparasitic treatment in livestock is then compared under a variety of alternative host scenarios, including seasonally migrating wild hosts. 3. In this region, rainfall is the primary driver of seasonality of transmission, but wildlife migration leads to spatial differences in the effectiveness of treatment in domestic animals. Additionally, competent migratory wildlife hosts move parasites across the landscape. 4. Simulated transmission potential matches observed patterns of clinical disease in livestock in the study area. Increased wildlife contact is correlated with a decrease in disease, suggesting that non-competent wild hosts may attenuate transmission by removing infective parasite larvae from livestock pasture. 5. Optimising the timing of treatment according to within-year rainfall patterns was considerably more effective than treating at a standard time of year. By targeting treatment in this way, efficient control can be achieved, mitigating parasite spillover from wildlife where it does occur. 6. Synthesis and applications. This model of parasite transmission potential enables evidence-based management of parasite spillover between wild and domestic species in a spatio-temporally dynamic system. It can be applied in other mixed-use systems to mitigate parasite transmission under altered climate scenarios or changes in host ranges.","[Walker, Josephine G.; Evans, Kate E.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Walker, Josephine G.; Vineer, Hannah Rose; Morgan, Eric R.] Univ Bristol, Cabot Inst, Bristol, Avon, England; [Walker, Josephine G.; Evans, Kate E.] Elephants Africa, Maun, Botswana; [Walker, Josephine G.] Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Vineer, Hannah Rose] Univ Bristol, Sch Vet Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [van Wyk, Jan A.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Vet Trop Dis, Fac Vet Sci, Onderstepoort, South Africa; [Morgan, Eric R.] Queens Univ Belfast, Inst Global Food Secur, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland","Walker, JG (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.; Walker, JG (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Cabot Inst, Bristol, Avon, England.; Walker, JG (corresponding author), Elephants Africa, Maun, Botswana.; Walker, JG (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",j.g.walker@bristol.ac.uk,"; Vineer, Hannah/M-5049-2018","Walker, Josephine/0000-0002-9732-5738; Vineer, Hannah/0000-0002-1488-0315; Morgan, Eric/0000-0002-5999-7728",EUEuropean Commission [288975CP-TP-KBBE.2011.1.2-04]; University of Bristol Postgraduate Research Scholarship; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/M003949/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/M003949/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"EU FP7, Grant/Award Number: 288975CP-TP-KBBE.2011.1.2-04; University of Bristol Postgraduate Research Scholarship; BBSRC, Grant/Award Number: BB/M003949/1",,46,5,6,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

In natural communities, however, other antagonists and symbionts moderate competition. Thus, we have to go beyond studying pairwise interactions. Natural enemies may facilitate coexistence if they affect the superior competitor more strongly, or they can hinder coexistence via apparent competition. Less well studied is the role of symbionts, which may influence species coexistence in conjunction with enemies. Eukaryotes commonly harbour microbial endosymbionts that provide protection against natural enemies, but are costly in their absence. Such defensive symbionts could thus mediate coexistence of species competing for the same resource, both in the presence and in the absence of enemies, but as yet there is little evidence for this claim. We addressed this proposed role of defensive symbionts in replicated simple communities consisting of two aphid species sharing the same host plant and the same natural enemy, a parasitoid wasp. Both, one, or neither species were infected with a resistance-conferring symbiont, and they competed in the absence as well as the presence of parasitoids. The symbiont had significant effects in the absence of parasitoids by lowering competitive ability especially in one species, but the effects were more dramatic in the presence of parasitoids. With both species protected by the symbiont, parasitoid densities remained low and both aphid species persisted. When neither species was protected, parasitoids drove both species to extinction. Surprisingly, the same outcome was observed when only one species was protected. The susceptible species supported high densities of parasitoids that also killed the resistant aphids via mechanisms other than parasitism, presumably by disturbing them to the point of starvation. This is an intriguing form of apparent competition. Our results demonstrate an important role of defensive symbionts in insect communities through modifying species interactions. This highlights the need for experimental data when studying species coexistence in competitive networks. Furthermore, the observation that a susceptible host can negatively affect a resistant host via a shared parasitoid is an instructive insight for biological control.","[Hertaeg, Corinne; Vorburger, Christoph] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Hertaeg, Corinne; Vorburger, Christoph] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, D USYS, Zurich, Switzerland","Vorburger, C (corresponding author), Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland.; Vorburger, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, D USYS, Zurich, Switzerland.",christoph.vorburger@eawag.ch,"Vorburger, Christoph/A-1650-2008; Hertaeg, Corinne/ABA-6078-2020","Vorburger, Christoph/0000-0002-3627-0841; Hertaeg, Corinne/0000-0002-2730-4042","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [CRSII3_154396, PP00P3_146341]","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: CRSII3_154396 and PP00P3_146341",,51,5,5,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

However, ecological interactions between the species that inhabited these ecosystems, such as predator-prey relationships or interspecific competition, are poorly known. To this regard, carnivore marks imprinted on the fossil bones of megamammal remains are very useful for deciphering biological activity and, hence, potential interspecific relationships among taxa. In this article, we study historical fossil collections housed in different European and Argentinean museums that were excavated during the 19th and early 20th centuries in the Pampean region, Argentina, in order to detect carnivore marks on bones of megamammals and provide crucial information on the ecological relationships between South American taxa during the Pleistocene. Our results indicate that the long bones of megafauna from the Pampean region (e.g., the Mylodontidae and Toxodontidae families) exhibit carnivore marks. Furthermore, long bones of medium-sized species and indeterminate bones also present punctures, pits, scores and fractures. Members of the large-carnivore guild, such as ursids, canids and even felids, are recognised as the main agents that inflicted the marks. We hypothesize that the analysed carnivore marks represent the last stages of megaherbivore carcass exploitation, suggesting full consumption of these animals by the same or multiple taxa in a hunting and/or scavenging scenario. Moreover, our observations provide novel insights that help further our understanding of the palaeoecological relationships of these unique communities of megamammals.","[Vanesa Chichkoyan, Karina; Martinez-Navarro, Bienvenido] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social, IPHES, Tarragona, Spain; [Vanesa Chichkoyan, Karina; Martinez-Navarro, Bienvenido] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Area Prehist, Tarragona, Spain; [Figueirido, Borja] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Geol, Malaga, Spain; [Belinchon, Margarita] Museo Ciencias Nat Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Luis Lanata, Jose] UNRN, CONICET, IIDyPCa, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Moigne, Anne-Marie] Musee Homme Paris, Prehist Dept, HnHp, UMR 7194, Paris, France; [Martinez-Navarro, Bienvenido] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain","Figueirido, B (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Geol, Malaga, Spain.",Borja.figueirido@uma.es,"Figueirido, Borja/AAV-7882-2020","Figueirido, Borja/0000-0003-2542-3977",Erasmus Mundus grant inside the International Doctorate in Quaternary and Prehistory programme (KVCH); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2010-15326]; Generalitat de Catalunya Research GroupGeneralitat de Catalunya [GENCAT 2014 SGR 901]; ICREAICREA Funding Source: Custom,"This work was financed by the Erasmus Mundus grant inside the International Doctorate in Quaternary and Prehistory programme (KVCH), and by the CGL2010-15326 project of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, and by the Generalitat de Catalunya Research Group GENCAT 2014 SGR 901.

Understanding whether conservation measures can mitigate anticipated change in climate requires consideration of future climate as well as species interactions. We explored niche relations of martens and fishers at their southern range margins to understand their spatial and temporal dynamics, and how they may be affected by climate change. We used large-scale non-invasive surveys and home range data from radio-marked individuals to explore the spatial dynamics of each species. Marten and fisher were allopatric in the northern/wetter regions but sympatric at intermediate latitudes with lower precipitation. In the driest/southernmost region only fishers occurred. Martens were not detected when annual precipitation was < 900 mm and rare where minimum temperatures exceeded 4 degrees C. Fishers were absent where spring snow was > 650 mm. Classification trees, accounting for multivariate interactions, supported these results. Where sympatric, similar to 70% of a marten's home range overlapped with at least one fisher but martens tended to avoid this area. In sympatry, marten expanded their niche into areas with reduced snowpack, warmer temperatures and uncharacteristic lower elevation habitats. Future climate scenarios predict conditions that favor fishers, but our data suggest martens may be capable of shifting their niche somewhat to warmer and less snowy habitats. The conservation of interacting species at their warm range limits will require land managers be aware of interspecific tolerance, how each may respond uniquely to future climates, and how potential climate refugia can be integrated with existing habitat.","[Zielinski, William J.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Pacific Southwest Stn, 1700 Bayview Dr, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Tucker, Jody M.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Reg, Sequoia Natl Forest, 1839 S Newcomb St, Porterville, CA 93257 USA; [Rennie, Kerry M.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA","Zielinski, WJ (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Pacific Southwest Stn, 1700 Bayview Dr, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.",bzielinski@fs.fed.us,,,USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest RegionUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service,We thank the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station and the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region for financial support and T.

However, to date, there is limited empirical evidence to support them. At least two basic conditions need to be met in order to expect species interactions to be determined by evolutionary relatedness: a phylogenetic signal in the traits involved in the interactions and changes in the interactions as species are more ecologically similar. Here, we report results of a removal experiment in the Chinese Tibetan plateau in which we directly assessed if the nature and/or strength of interactions among twelve alpine meadow plant species were influenced by their phylogenetic relatedness and/or their functional dissimilarity. For each plant species, we compared its biomass production when grown alone to its biomass in presence of another species and used it as a measure of species interactions. Competition between pairs of species was more frequent than facilitation, with 60% of interactions resulting in plants producing less biomass when a second species was present. We found no effect of phylogenetic relatedness on the prevalence or intensity of competition or facilitation, presumably as none of the studied traits showed phylogenetic signal. Functional dissimilarity based on maximum plant height alone was the best predictor of both the prevalence and strength of competition and facilitation, followed by functional dissimilarity using all five functional traits. Our results pinpoint the limited capacity of phylogenetic relatedness as predictor of species interactions; underlining the limitations of using phylogenetic dispersion patterns to infer mechanisms of community assembly. On the contrary, when the right functional traits are used, functional dissimilarity among species can predict both the nature and strength of their interactions; accentuating the relevance of trait-based approaches in community ecology research.","[Lyu, Shengman; Liu, Xiang; Zhou, Shurong] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, 2005 Songhu Rd, CN-200438 Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Venail, Patrick] Univ Geneva, Sect Earth & Environm Sci, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland","Zhou, SR (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, 2005 Songhu Rd, CN-200438 Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhshrong@fudan.edu.cn,"Venail, Patrick/D-2968-2018; Liu, Xiang/A-4154-2017; Lyu, Shengman/AAN-4817-2020","Venail, Patrick/0000-0003-1126-280X; Liu, Xiang/0000-0003-3914-5824; Zhou, Shurong/0000-0002-7093-1703","State Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems, Lanzhou University; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31470563]; Research Project of the Chinese Ministry of EducationMinistry of Education, China [113021A]","This study was supported by the open project of State Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems, Lanzhou University, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470563), and by a Research Project of the Chinese Ministry of Education (113021A).",,70,9,13,5,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2017,126,3,,,,,381,388,,10.1111/oik.03378,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EM0WC,WOS:000395037400008,,,,,2021-09-21,

The evaluation of proarrhythmic activity using a comprehensive in vitro proarrhythmia assay does not fully account for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) differences in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated the correlation between drug-specific parameters describing QT interval prolongation in dogs and in humans. METHODS Using estimates of the drug-specific parameter, data on the slopes of the PKPD relationships of nine compounds with varying QT-prolonging effects (cisapride, sotalol, moxifloxacin, carabersat, GSK945237, SB237376 and GSK618334, and two anonymized NCEs) were analysed. Mean slope estimates varied between -0.98 ms mu M-1 and 6.1 ms mu M-1 in dogs and -10 ms mu M-1 and 90 ms mu M-1 in humans, indicating a wide range of effects on the QT interval. Linear regression techniques were then applied to characterize the correlation between the parameter estimates across species. RESULTS For compounds without a mixed ion channel block, a correlation was observed between the drug-specific parameter in dogs and humans (y = 1.709 + 11.6x; R-2 = 0.989). These results show that per unit concentration, the drug effect on the QT interval in humans is 11.6-fold larger than in dogs. CONCLUSIONS Together with information about the expected therapeutic exposure, the evidence of a correlation between the compound-specific parameter in dogs and in humans represents an opportunity for translating preclinical safety data before progression into the clinic. Whereas further investigation is required to establish the generalizability of our findings, this approach can be used with clinical trial simulations to predict the probability of QT prolongation in humans.","[Dubois, Vincent F.

Niche separation by means of exploitation or interference competition was investigated in two taxa of crop-inhabiting spiders that overlap in microhabitat use and have similar web design. Competition for prey and web sites was tested in microcosm experiments with the most common species that build sheet-webs: Enoplognatha gemina (Theridiidae) and Alioranus pastoralis (Linyphiidae). A field survey over the crop season provided data on spatial and temporal dispersion of Enoplognatha spp. (Theridiidae) and linyphiid spiders (Linyphiidae) and on availability of prey over the season. In the microcosm experiments, both taxa took springtails as prey, but only Enoplognatha fed on aphids. Differences in diet, however, could not be attributed to either exploitative or interference competition. Spatial separation of websites was attained by vertical displacement of webs in the vegetation (Enoplognatha) and by avoidance of patches occupied by conspecific or heterospecific individuals (linyphiids). In the field, densities of linyphiids and Enoplognatha were correlated negatively and webs were over-dispersed relative to a random distribution. Both taxa colonized the field at the start of the season; linyphiids colonized as adults, quickly reproduced, and had a second adult peak; Enoplognatha matured in the middle of the season and their numbers remained fairly constant over the season. The combined experimental manipulations and field data suggest that niche separation occurs at different scales. The hypothesis of competition for websites was partially supported, while prey preference (or tolerance) and temporal differences in life history stages also may explain the negative correlations between densities of the two taxa.","[Opatovsky, Itai] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Opatovsky, Itai] Reg Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Southern Branch Besor, IL-85400 Besor, Israel; [Gavish-Regev, Efrat] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Natl Nat Hist Collect, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel; [Weintraub, Phyllis G.] Agr Res Org, Dept Entomol, IL-85280 Gilat Res Ctr, Israel; [Lubin, Yael] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Opatovsky, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.; Opatovsky, I (corresponding author), Reg Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Southern Branch Besor, IL-85400 Besor, Israel.",itaiopa6@gmail.com,"Lubin, Yael D/F-1382-2012","Lubin, Yael D/0000-0003-3876-1668; Weintraub, Phyllis/0000-0003-0661-9499",Ministry of AgricultureGida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi [857-0578-09]; JNF (Emilio Sacerdote fund) [02-4682]; Sigma Xi; Ben-Gurion University,"We thank Z.

Although a fundamental assumption commonly made when using the model is that species randomly move between habitat patches, most organisms exhibit habitat preference in reality. A method of incorporating habitat preference (directed dispersal) into the Levins metapopulation model was developed in a previous study. In the current study, we extended the approach to explore two-species metacommunity dynamics (i.e. competition and predation) mediated by habitat preference. Our results theoretically revealed that coexistence of competing metapopulations requires conspecific aggregation and heterospecific segregation whereas the conspecific segregation of prey and effective avoidance of unsuitable prey-free patches are crucial for persistence of predator metapopulations. In addition, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated the effect of habitat preference on the outcomes of interspecific interactions. The present study opens a new research avenue in metacommunity ecology in complex nature and contributes to improved landscape management for the conservation of species (e.g. territorial and group-living animals) and biodiversity.","[Nakazawa, Takefumi; Huang, Chi-Gui] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Nakazawa, T (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",take.nkzw@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [104-2621-B-006-003-MY3]",This study was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (104-2621-B-006-003-MY3).

The system permits a detailed study of localised competition with major implications for coral reefs with respect to human impacts including climate change. Using underwater video cameras, this study examined competition among 30 species of large reef fishes (from nine families) for access to shelter provided by 26 tabular structures, which may be the highest reported diversity of vertebrates competing for a single resource. Mean concentrations of fishes under tabular structures were also among the highest biomass recorded on reefs (4.71 kg m(-2)). A generated dominance hierarchy for the occupation of shelter appeared to be primarily driven by the size of fishes. In contrast to previous studies, fishes higher in the hierarchy tended to exhibit the lowest levels of aggression. However, size difference between fishes was found to be strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of aggressive interactions (R (2) = 0.971, P < 0.0001). The strong competition for the shade provided by these corals highlights concerns about future shifts in the structure of large reef fish communities as corals are lost. This is particularly concerning given the critical functional roles played by certain species of large reef fishes that utilise tabular structure for shelter and which occupy the lower ranks of the dominance hierarchy.","[Kerry, J.

We have derived sufficient conditions (parametric restrictions) for extinction of each species and at the same time we also notice that when one or two species go extinction, remaining species can be stable in time average under same parametric restrictions, i.e., extinction of one or two species ensures about the stability in mean of other species. Next, we have proved that the system admits a stationary distribution under some simple parametric conditions, which can be considered as a stability of the system in weak sense. Finally, we have proved that system is globally asymptotically stable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In marine ecosystems, segregation in feeding habits has been largely described as a common mechanism to allow the coexistence of several competing marine predators. However, little is known about the feeding ecology of most species of chondrichthyans, which play a pivotal role in the structure of marine food webs worldwide. In this study, we examined the trophic ecology of 3 relatively abundant chondrichthyans coexisting in the Mediterranean Sea: the blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus, the velvet belly lanternshark Etmopterus spinax and the rabbit fish Chimaera monstrosa. To examine their trophic ecology and interspecific differences in food habits, we combined the analysis of stomach content and stable isotopes. Our results highlighted a trophic segregation between C. monstrosa and the other 2 species. G. melastomus showed a diet composed mainly of cephalopods, while E. spinax preyed mainly on shrimps and C. monstrosa on crabs. Interspecific differences in the trophic niche were likely due to different feeding capabilities and body size. Each species showed different isotopic niche space and trophic level. Specifically, C. monstrosa showed a higher trophic level than E. spinax and G. melastomus. The high trophic levels of the 3 species highlighted their important role as predators in the marine food web. Our results illustrate the utility of using complementary approaches that provide information about the feeding behaviour at short (stomach content) and long-term scales (stable isotopes), which could allow more efficient monitoring of marine food-web changes in the study area.","[Albo-Puigserver, Marta; Navarro, Joan; Coll, Marta; Aguzzi, Jacopo; Saez-Liante, Raquel] CSIC, ICM, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Navarro, Joan] CSIC, EBD, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville 41092, Spain; [Coll, Marta] IRD IFREMER UM2, Lab Ecosyst Marins Exploites, UMR 212, F-34203 Sete, France; [Cardona, Luis] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Cardona, Luis] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Albo-Puigserver, M (corresponding author), CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",albo@icm.csic.es,"Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009; Cardona, Luis/AAL-1354-2021; Cardona, Luis/L-1680-2014; Puigserver, Marta Albo/F-5693-2016; Puigserver, Marta Albo/AAP-5800-2020; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Coll, Marta/A-9488-2012","Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543; Cardona, Luis/0000-0002-7892-1323; Cardona, Luis/0000-0002-7892-1323; Puigserver, Marta Albo/0000-0002-0477-5984; Puigserver, Marta Albo/0000-0002-0477-5984; Coll, Marta/0000-0001-6235-5868",FPI program (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness); Marie Curie GIC project BioWeb; Ramon y Cajal Program (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness); BioWeb project,"We thank Isabel Palomera for her en couragement and support and fishermen from Port de la Selva and Llanca for helping with sample collection.

However, stabilizing interspecific niche differences can promote local diversity. Understanding these mechanisms requires that we simultaneously quantify their effects on demography and link these effects to community dynamics. Successional forests are ideal systems for testing assembly theory because they exhibit rapid community assembly. Here, we leverage functional trait and long-term demographic data to build spatially explicit models of successional community dynamics of lowland rainforests in Costa Rica. First, we ask what the effects and relative importance of four trait-mediated community assembly processes are on tree survival, a major component of fitness. We model trait correlations with relative fitness differences that are both density-independent and -dependent in addition to trait correlations with stabilizing niche differences. Second, we ask how the relative importance of these trait-mediated processes relates to successional changes in functional diversity. Tree dynamics were more strongly influenced by trait-related interspecific variation in average survival than trait-related responses to neighbors, with wood specific gravity (WSG) positively correlated with greater survival. Our findings also suggest that competition was mediated by stabilizing niche differences associated with specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). These drivers of individual-level survival were reflected in successional shifts to higher SLA and LDMC diversity but lower WSG diversity. Our study makes significant advances to identifying the links between individual tree performance, species functional traits, and mechanisms of tropical forest succession.","[Lasky, Jesse R.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lasky, Jesse R.; Uriarte, Maria] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Boukili, Vanessa K.; Chazdon, Robin L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Lasky, JR (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jl3985@columbia.edu,"Chazdon, Robin/O-9766-2018","Chazdon, Robin/0000-0002-7349-5687; Boukili, Vanessa/0000-0002-5950-2123","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1050957, DEB-1110722, 0424767, 0639393, 1147429, 1110722]; Organization for Tropical Studies; Christiane and Christopher Tyson Fellowship; Ronald Bamford Endowment Fund; American Philosophical Society; Garden Club of America Award in Tropical Botany; Andrew Mellon Foundation; University of Connecticut Research Foundation; National Aeronautics and Space Administration Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences [NNH08ZDA001N]","We thank Benedicte Bachelot, Frans Bongers, Robert Muscarella, Naomi Schwartz, and three anonymous reviewers for comments on this manuscript.

Tree mortality has increased in some regions, but its multifactorial nature makes the prediction of likely global trends difficult. The aims of this work are: (1) to assess which abiotic, structural and competition factors influence tree growth and tree mortality in mainland Spain, and (2) to evaluate whether these processes would drive species distributions and would improve current niche model predictions. Location Continental Spain. Methods We projected species distributional models by integrating nonparametric tree growth and tree mortality models based on repeated surveys of diameter at breast height and mortality for 40,721 trees distributed in 45,301 plots, which include the 11 most common canopy tree species in continental Spain, as measured in the second and third National Forest Inventories, with a mean lag time of 11 years. Results Tree growth and tree mortality were explained by an assemblage of many factors, among which climate and competition played a key role. The accuracy of models including tree growth and tree mortality in predicting tree habitat suitability was comparable to classical niche models based on species occurrence. Projections under climate change showed for 9 out of 11 species, a likely increase in tree growth that would be counteracted by an increase in tree mortality, suggesting that even if growth rates increase, mortality would limit the species ranges under global warming expectations. Main conclusions Growth and mortality are major determinants of species distributions. Under future climate change expectations, our model suggests that growth may increase for some Iberian species, but even in this case, species ranges at the rear edge would be limited by an increase in mortality rates.","[Benito-Garzon, Marta; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Zavala, Miguel A.] CIFOR INIA, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Benito-Garzon, Marta] CNRS, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-9140 Orsay, France; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Alcala De Henares 28871, Madrid, Spain","Benito-Garzon, M (corresponding author), CNRS, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-9140 Orsay, France.",marta.benito@gmail.com,"Zavala, Miguel A./H-3603-2015; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/E-5833-2012","Zavala, Miguel A./0000-0003-1456-0132; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/0000-0002-2781-5870",Juan de la CiervaInstituto de Salud Carlos III; Spanish MECSpanish Government [AP2008-01325];  [INTERBOS3-CGL2008-04503-C03-03 (MCI)];  [INIA-SUM2008-00004-C03.01],"We thank the Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentacion y Medio Ambiente (MAGRAMA) for granting access to the Spanish Forest Inventory Data.

Climate warming often leads to shifts in the strength and sign of agonistic interactions among species, which in turn may change their distribution ranges. Notwithstanding the ubiquity of this phenomenon, there is scant literature about how interspecific agonistic behaviour changes with altered thermal regime, especially for invasive species such as three widespread North American crayfishes in Europe (Orconectes limosus, Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus). 2. We conducted a laboratory study to analyse some descriptors of agonistic behaviour in fighting dyads of similarly sized males of the three species' combinations, both at 20 degrees C (the current maximum water temperature in the study area, central France) and 27 degrees C (the maximum expected in the next 80years under the more pessimistic IPCC greenhouse gas emission scenario). 3. The results showed significantly different responses to warming by the three crayfishes. At 27 degrees C, O. limosus spent more time motionless and P.leniusculus was more often the subordinate, independent of the opponent. On the contrary, the agonistic strategy of P.clarkii did not change with temperature: when engaged in fighting, this species outcompeted both O.limosus and P.leniusculus. 4. Caution should be taken when extrapolating laboratory studies to the field, but these results, combined with outputs of previous modelling exercises, suggest that European catchments will become dominated by P.clarkii with climate warming. Ultimately, this might lead to impoverished biodiversity, simplified food webs and altered ecosystem services.","[Gherardi, Francesca; Spigoli, Daniele; Aquiloni, Laura] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Biol, I-50125 Florence, Italy; [Souty-Grosset, Catherine] Univ Poitiers, Poitiers, France","Aquiloni, L (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dipartimento Biol, Via Romana 17, I-50125 Florence, Italy.",laura.aquiloni@unifi.it,,,Regional Council of Poitou-Charentes (France) within the Programme Regional de Bourses de Chercheur Invite' at the University of PoitiersRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine,This work was made possible by a grant to F.G. by the Regional Council of Poitou-Charentes (France) within the 'Programme Regional de Bourses de Chercheur Invite' at the University of Poitiers.

However, we reviewed recent studies and found that only nine of 144 cases are strong examples that have ruled out alternative explanations for an ECD-like pattern. We suggest that the rise in esteem of ECD has outpaced available data and that more complete, rather than simply more, case studies are needed.

Experiments of multiple predator effects on prey populations are extremely demanding, as the number of treatments and the amount of labour associated with these experiments increases exponentially with the number of species in question. Therefore, researchers tend to vary only presence/absence of the species and use only one (supposedly realistic) combination of their numbers in experiments. However, nonlinearities in density dependence, functional responses, interactions between natural enemies etc. are typical for such systems, and nonlinear models of population dynamics generally predict qualitatively different results, if initial absolute densities of the species studied differ, even if their relative densities are maintained. Therefore, testing combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities may not be sufficient. Here we test this prediction experimentally. We show that the population dynamics of a system consisting of 2 natural enemies (aphid predator Adalia bipunctata (L.), and aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani Viereck) and their shared prey (peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer) are strongly affected by the absolute initial densities of the species in question. Even if their relative densities are kept constant, the natural enemy species or combination thereof that most effectively suppresses the prey may depend on the absolute initial densities used in the experiment. Future empirical studies of multiple predator - one prey interactions should therefore use a two-dimensional array of initial densities of the studied species. Varying only combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities is not sufficient and can lead to misleading results.","[Ameixa, Olga M. C.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Within the context of trophic cascades, various treatments using in situ mesocosms were established in a closed estuary to highlight the importance of predation in stabilizing estuarine plankton abundances. Through either the removal (filtration) or addition of certain planktonic groups, five different trophic systems were established. These treatments contained varied numbers of trophic levels and thus different predators at the top of the food chain. The abundances of zooplankton (copepod and polychaete), ciliate, micro-flagellate, nano-flagellate and bacteria were investigated in each treatment, over time. The reference treatment containing apex zooplanktivores (early juvenile mullet) and plankton at natural densities mimicked a natural, stable state of an estuary. Proportional variability (PV) and coefficient of variation (CV) of temporal abundances were calculated for each taxon and showed that apex predators in this experimental ecosystem, when compared to the other systems, induced stability. The presence of these predators therefore had consequences for multiple trophic levels, consistent with trophic cascade theory. Conclusions/Significance: PV and CV proved useful indices for comparing stability. Apex predators exerted a stabilizing pressure through feeding on copepods and polychaetes which cascaded through the ciliates, micro-flagellates, nano-flagellates and bacteria. When compared with treatments without apex predators, the role of predation in structuring planktonic communities in closed estuaries was highlighted.","[Wasserman, Ryan J.; Noyon, Margaux; Froneman, P.

Why provide costly services to another species if the feedback of this provision also happens to benefit intra-specific competitors that provide no service? Rewarding cooperators and punishing defectors can help maintain mutualism; this is not possible, however, when one can only respond to the collective action of one's partners, which is likely to be the case in many common symbioses. We show how the theory of public goods can explain the stability of mutualism when discrimination between cooperators and defectors is not possible: if two groups of individuals trade goods that are non-linear, increasing functions of the number of contributions, their mutualistic interaction is maintained by the exchange of these public goods, even when it is not possible to punish defectors, which can persist at relatively high frequencies. This provides a theoretical justification and testable predictions for the evolution of mutualism in the absence of discrimination mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from GPS positions of sheep (Ovis aries) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) grazing a moorland plot, we modeled the animal movement of each species as a function of the distance between individuals, with the aim to assess the role of animal interactions (i.e., attraction and repulsion) in their spatial movement. We used black box-based models. These models do not require making assumptions about the biological meaning of their parameters. They are data-driven and use embedding complex algorithms that create nonlinear functions that estimate the behavior of the system, in our case the movement of our animals, and its errors. We used an algorithm based on radial basis functions to build models of time series data, using minimum description length as the criteria for model optimization. Included in the model is a factor that captures the collective behavior of the animals based on the distance between individuals. The model emphasizes the spatial relationship between animals from the absolute navigational directions by attenuating the latter. Our simulations showed that animals of the same specie tend to group together, with sheep having a stronger grouping behavior than deer. The dynamics of the model are density dependent, that is, the number of animals within range affects the strength of the interactions and their grouping behavior. A strong swarm behavior was detected by the model, the longer the distance between species, the stronger the attraction between them; and the shorter the separation between species, the stronger their repulsion, which suggests inter- and intra-competition for food and space resources. Our modeling approach is useful to interpret animal movement interactions between animals of the same or different species, in order to unravel complex cooperative or competitive behaviors, or to make predictions of animal movement under different population scenarios.","[Kattas, Graciano Dieck; Small, Michael] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Perez-Barberia, F.

In Ireland, the bank vole was introduced 80 years ago and now occupies a third of the island. The greater white-toothed shrew arrived more recently within the invasive range of the bank vole. We surveyed the abundance of both invasive species and two indigenous species, the wood mouse and pygmy shrew, throughout their respective ranges. The negative effects of invasive on indigenous species were strong and cumulative bringing about species replacement. The greater white-toothed shrew, the second invader, had a positive and synergistic effect on the abundance of the bank vole, the first invader, but a negative and compounding effect on the abundance of the wood mouse and occurrence of the pygmy shrew. The gradual replacement of the wood mouse by the bank vole decreased with distance from the point of the bank vole's introduction whilst no pygmy shrews were captured where both invasive species were present. Such interactions may not be unique to invasions but characteristic of all multispecies communities. Small mammals are central in terrestrial food webs and compositional changes to this community in Ireland are likely to reverberate throughout the ecosystem. Vegetation composition and structure, invertebrate communities and the productivity of avian and mammalian predators are likely to be affected. Control of these invasive species may only be effected through landscape and habitat management.","[Montgomery, W.

Why cooperate if defection potentially reaps greater benefits? It is commonly assumed that spatial structure (limited dispersal) aligns the interests of mutualistic partners. But does spatial structure consistently promote cooperation? Here, we formally model the role of spatial structure in maintaining mutualism. We show theoretically that spatial structure can actually disfavor cooperation by limiting the suite of potential partners. The effect of spatial structuring depends on the scale (fine or coarse level) at which hosts reward their partners. We then test our predictions by using molecular methods to track the abundance of competing, closely related, cooperative, and less cooperative arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal symbionts on host roots over multiple generations. We find that when spatial structure is reduced by mixing soil, the relative success of the more cooperative AM fungal species increases. This challenges previous suggestions that high spatial structuring is critical for stabilizing cooperation in the mycorrhizal mutualism. More generally, our results show, both theoretically and empirically, that contrary to expectations, spatial structuring can select against cooperation.","[Verbruggen, Erik; Akkermans, Geert; Kiers, E.

Within their small societies, size hierarchy determines which fish have access to reproduction. These fishes are also prolific callers whose aggressive sounds seem to play an important role in the social hierarchy. Agonistic interactions being involved in daily behaviour suggest how acoustic communication might play an important role in clownfish group. Sounds were recorded and compared in fourteen clownfish species (some of which have never been recorded before) to evaluate the potential role of acoustic communication as an evolutionary driving force. Results: Surprisingly, the relationship between fish size and both dominant frequency and pulse duration is not only species-specific; all the specimens of the 14 species are situated on exactly the same slope, which means the size of any Amphiprion can be predicted by both acoustic features. The number of pulses broadly overlaps among species, whereas the pulse period displays the most variation even if it shows overlap among sympatric species. Sound comparisons between three species (A. akallopisos, A. ocellaris and A. frenatus) having different types of teeth and body shape do not show differences neither in the acoustic waveform nor in the power spectrum. Conclusion: Significant overlap in acoustic features demonstrates that the sound-producing mechanism is highly conservative among species. Differences in the calls of some species are due to size dimorphism and the sound variation might be in this case a by-product. This morphological constraint does not permit a consideration of acoustic communication as the main driving force in the diversification of clownfishes. Moreover, calls are not produced to find mate and consequently are less subject to variations due to partner preference, which restricts the constraints of diversification. Calls are produced to reach and defend the competition to mate access. However, differences in the pulse period between cohabiting species show that, in some case, sounds can help to differentiate the species, to prevent competition between cohabiting species and to promote the diversification of taxa.","[Colleye, Orphal; Vandewalle, Pierre; Parmentier, Eric] Univ Liege, Lab Morphol Fonct & Evolut, Allee Chim 3, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Lanterbecq, Deborah] Univ Mons Hainaut, Lab Biol Marine, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Lecchini, David] CNRS EPHE, Ctr Rech Insulaire & Observ Environm CRIOBE, USR 3278, Papetoia Moorea 1013, France","Parmentier, E (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Lab Morphol Fonct & Evolut, Allee Chim 3, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",E.Parmentier@ulg.ac.be,"Parmentier, Eric/P-9733-2018","Parmentier, Eric/0000-0002-0391-7530; Lanterbecq, Deborah/0000-0002-1104-9227",Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (F.R.S.-FNRS)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; FRFC from the F.R.S.-FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [2.4.535.10]; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-06-JCJC-0012-01]; MOM [06 PF 15]; CRISP (Coral Reef Initiative in the South Pacific) [C2A],"The authors would like to thank J.M.

Theory indicates that speciation and sexual dimorphism can result from identical ecological conditions, but co-occurrence is unlikely because whichever evolves first should dissipate the disruptive selection necessary to drive evolution of the other. Here, we consider ecological conditions in which disruptive selection can act along multiple ecological axes. Speciation in lake populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has been attributed to disruptive selection due to competition for resources. Head shape in sticklebacks is thought to reflect adaptation to different resource acquisition strategies. We measure sexual dimorphism and species variation in head shape and body size in stickleback populations in two lakes in British Columbia, Canada. We find that sexual dimorphism in head shape is greater than interspecific differences. Using a numerical simulation model that contains two axes of ecological variation, we show that speciation and sexual dimorphism can readily co-occur when the effects of loci underlying sexually dimorphic traits are orthogonal to those underlying sexually selected traits.","[Cooper, Idelle A.] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Gilman, R.

One strategy employed by carnivores to minimize potentially costly interspecific competition is avoidance of dominant species. Recent research has highlighted the importance of consistent individual differences in behavior (i.e. temperament traits) in understanding behavioral variation during predator-prey interactions and intraspecific interactions. However, the importance of such individual differences to interspecific competition has received little attention. Here, we examined the responses of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) to their primary competitors, African lions (Panthera leo), to (1) determine whether hyenas avoid lions and (2) evaluate the potential importance of individual differences in behavior during interspecific competition. Spotted hyenas and lions co-occur throughout much of Africa and are vigorous competitors. Whereas lions sometimes kill hyenas and steal their food, lions also represent a source of food for hyenas via scavenging. Using audio playback experiments, we found that hyenas do not uniformly avoid potential encounters with lions. Indeed, we noted considerable variation among individuals in their responses to lion roars, and this variation reflected consistent individual differences in risk-taking and vigilance tendencies. Individual differences in vigilance behavior were specific to interactions with lions. We conclude that individual differences in behavior have the potential to play an important role in determining the nature and outcome of interspecific competition.","[Watts, Heather E.; Blankenship, Lisa M.; Dawes, Stephanie E.; Holekamp, Kay E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Watts, HE (corresponding author), Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",hwatts1@lmu.edu,"Holekamp, Kay E/G-6054-2010",,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN0113170, IBN0343381, IOB0618022, IOS0819437]; Michigan State University","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (IBN0113170, IBN0343381, IOB0618022, and IOS0819437) and Michigan State University.

Marked declines of aspen have occurred in recent decades, likely due to a combination of effects from changes in fire regimes, herbivory, climate (e.g. drought), and interspecific competition with conifer species. However, it is poorly understood how the effects of these factors are manifested at a landscape scale over decadal time periods. Analysis of field data combined with topographic information collected across the 500,000 ha Owyhee Plateau in southwestern Idaho revealed that aspen in the area occur in three different biophysical settings; First, aspen stands exist at high altitudes on south-facing slopes where local conifer species are not likely to occur because of limiting temperature or precipitation levels under current climate conditions. In these areas aspen is the potential vegetation type rather than conifers. Second, aspen grow on anomalously wet microsites (e.g. near springs), and third, aspen grow within upland mixed aspen/conifer stands, which are experiencing rapid rates of conifer establishment. Based on a paired t-test (alpha = 0.05) we conclude that stands growing on wet microsites show significantly slower successional rates of conifer establishment relative to upland aspen stands. We developed a conceptual state-and-transition model for upland aspen/conifer stands occurring across a range of topographic positions. We then parameterized the model using extensive field data in the vegetation dynamics computer simulation model Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT), and examined the current and future aspen distribution under varying fire regimes. Model results indicate that average fire return intervals of 50-70 years are desirable for maintenance of aspen in upland areas where conifers are present. Under the current fire regime in the area many upland aspen/conifer stands will likely be lost within 80-200 years. Thresholds for the effect of conifer encroachment and browsing on aspen regeneration identified through this research are similar to those described by others across the West. We therefore suggest that the results presented for the Owyhee Plateau are likely applicable to semi-arid aspen woodlands across the American West where succession to conifers is a cause of aspen decline.

The occurrence of animals with simple M-3 morphotypes is higher in the Altai-Sayan mountain system, eastern Siberia (the Yenisei River basin), in the Carpathians, Balkan Mountains, and, probably, in the western regions of Europe. Simple morphotypes occur more frequently in the southern part of European Russia. To the north, the occurrence of simple morphotypes decreases and that of more complicated ones increases. Among Clethrionomys, simple morphotypes occurred more frequently among C. glareolus species that use mainly vegetative plant organs for feeding. The occurrence of simple morphotypes was rare in the cases when seeds and other nongreen plant parts predominated in nutrition of the voles. Based on the structure of the M-3 chewing surface, it is suggested that C. glareolus as the whole genus originated in eastern Asia. The further settling of the species proceeded to the west. The adaptation of the bank vole under new conditions, without competition with the other species of this genus became possible due to the high plasticity of the species under the increasing share of nongreen forage in its nutrition. This fact manifests itself distinctly in settling of C. glareolus in European Russia from the south to the north. This process was accompanied by the complication of the structure of the M-3 chewing surface. The colonization of the West-Siberian Lowland by the northern subspecies C. g. suecicus appeared to occur via the Urals after the sea digression.","[Okulova, N. M.; Andreeva, T.

We also assessed the population trend of red foxes after the re-establishment of lynx in the region, based on various population indices. Fifty per cent of recorded fox mortalities in the radio-tracking study (four of eight) were lynx kills. Adult-sized foxes killed by lynx during radio tracking were in normal condition and of prime age, and were killed after the assumed annual population bottleneck. Albeit based on a small number of kills, this pattern may suggest that lynx predation, at least to some extent, is additive to other mortality in foxes. The annual lynx predation rate was 14% on radio-tracked foxes and 4% on snow-tracked foxes. The population indices of foxes in the main study area decreased by about 10% annually during the study period. The population decrease could potentially be explained by lynx predation alone, but we acknowledge some alternative explanations. Our results point out the possibility that red fox populations can be significantly limited by allowing lynx populations to recover.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Conservat Biol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; Swedish Assoc Hunting & Wildlife Management, Molkom, Sweden","Helldin, JO (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Conservat Biol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",j-o.helldin@nvb.slu.se,,,,,,38,42,42,0,67,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0952-8369,,,J ZOOL,J.

We used Spatially Explicit Population Dynamics Models (SEPMs), successfully used to predict the spread of grey squirrels in England and Piedmont, Italy, to examine the effects of different control scenarios on grey squirrel expansion in a 20000 km(2) area around Ticino Park. Without control, grey squirrels will invade Switzerland within the next two decades, and, concomitantly, the size and distribution of local populations of native red squirrels will be reduced. Simulating different grey squirrel control or removal scenarios suggests that: (i) efficient control is possible and mainly determined by the spatial distribution and woodland size of the 'target' control areas; and (ii) immediate actions must be taken, since delay in grey squirrel control will result in the population increasing and spreading, which makes the problems of successful containment more difficult. Model scenarios were based on surveys that may underestimate the real distribution range and current population size of grey squirrels. Therefore, a combination of hair-tube monitoring and a public participation survey to detect grey squirrel presence, which may also help to increase public awareness, is recommended. Successful containment of further grey squirrel spread will require local co-operation between Italian and Swiss authorities involved in wildlife management.","Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Ambiente Salute Sicurezza, I-21100 Varese, VA, Italy; Newcastle Univ, IRES, Sch Biol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Univ Turin, DIVAPRA Entomol & Zool, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy","Martinoli, A (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Ambiente Salute Sicurezza, Via JH Dunant 3, I-21100 Varese, VA, Italy.",adriano.martinoli@unisubria.it,"Tattoni, Clara/AAG-6917-2020; Lurz, Peter/O-5108-2019; Bertolino, Sandro/V-5508-2019; Preatoni, Damiano G./A-8621-2010; Martinoli, Adriano/L-4924-2016","Tattoni, Clara/0000-0003-1555-5669; Preatoni, Damiano G./0000-0001-8760-1316; Wauters, Lucas/0000-0002-4871-5035; Wauters, Lucas Armand/0000-0002-7012-9200; Martinoli, Adriano/0000-0003-0298-0869",,,,63,29,31,1,75,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

To statistically test overlap values, a randomization algorithm was used to construct a simulated data matrix (i.e., null model) in order to compare observed values of dietary overlap to a distribution of overlap values from the null model. Significant levels (P < 0.05) of dietary overlap occurred in all cases of sympatry as well as allopatry. Average dietary overlap in sympatry was significantly lower than in allopatry, suggesting a dietary shift when in sympatry to reduce competition.

In all four species, the frequency of animals with empty stomachs was significantly lower during the rainy season than during the dry season. The four frog species were mainly arthropod-eating: Araneidae and Blattoidea were preyed upon mainly by the two largest species, Acarina and Lepidoptera were taken mainly by the two smaller species, and Diptera and Formicoidea were eaten frequently by all species. The diet composition was similar between seasons in three of the four species, and H. guttulatus was the only species showing considerable diet variation between seasons.

Theory thus predicts that its heritability will be low and that non-genetic determinants of dominance should prevail. In this field experiment we reciprocally cross-fostered great tits (Parus major) to blue tits (Parus caeruleus) to investigate the impact of early social experience on dominance status in competition over food during winter. Controlling for potential effects of age, size, sex and site-related dominance, we show that cross-fostered birds of both species were subdominant to conspecific immigrants, while controls originating from unmanipulated broods were dominant to conspecific immigrants. Furthermore, blue tits reared by blue tit parents but with at least one great tit broodmate had lower dominance status relative to conspecific immigrants than did controls. Although great tits generally dominated blue tits, cross-fostered birds of both species initiated marginally more fights against the other species than did their respective controls, suggesting faulty species recognition. Since both social parents and broodmates strongly influence the dominance behavior of offspring later in life, we conclude that social conditions experienced at an early age are crucial for the determination of subsequent social dominance.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Hansen, BT (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, POB 1050 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",b.t.hansen@bio.uio.no,"Hansen, Bo Terning/B-1375-2008; Hansen, Bo Terning/AAG-1462-2019","Hansen, Bo Terning/0000-0003-2765-4488; Hansen, Bo Terning/0000-0003-2765-4488",,,,62,26,26,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

To determine this, the density and position of barnacles (Balanus improvisus) in a unidirectional current were manipulated to alter the amount of competition for space and food, respectively. Results indicated that competition for space significantly reduced growth, and marginally reduced survivorship. Competition for food was also detected, but only among uncrowded individuals; thus, it appears to be the weaker of the two interactions. However, under crowded conditions, downstream individuals actually grew more than those upstream. The most likely explanation for this result is that downstream individuals fed more efficiently because they were not exposed to the full force of the current. The results also suggest that since natural densities started high but continually decreased throughout the study, barnacles undergo an ontogenetic shift in the relative importance of these processes.","Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","Lohse, DP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Long Marine Lab, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 100 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",lohse@biology.ucsc.edu,,,,,,36,23,23,1,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0006-3185,1939-8697,,BIOL BULL-US,Biol.

A priori I showed through an extensive nest site analysis that there is considerable nesting habitat overlap between the two species and hence potential for interspecific competition for prime nesting habitat, Buzzards had a significantly lower breeding success when presented with a goshawk dummy compared to control broods but there was no effect of buzzard dummies on reproductive success, Buzzards failing with their breeding attempt tended to select another nest site while successful buzzards more frequently used the same nest again. Buzzard pairs were less often attacked by common crows Corrus corone while exposed to goshawk dummies compared to buzzard dummies. The decision to desert a nest seems to be a trade-off between predation risk on the one hand and protection against crows on the other. Goshawks probed far more aggressive against an intraspecific dummy than buzzards. Buzzards adjusted their level of brood defence against both intra- and interspecific dummies according to the age of offspring but not offspring number, with an increasing brood defence level with increasing offspring age. Thus the behaviour of buzzards towards goshawks is a result of a complex system of trade-offs between predation risk. competition for prime nesting habitat and protection from crows on which brood value acts as a temporal modifier.","Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany","Kruger, O (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",ok212@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,72,45,48,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2002,96,3,,,,,441,452,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.960306.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543QG,WOS:000175112200006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Predictions for fruit size variation were established that focussed on selection for small or large seeds, given a positive allometric relationship between fruit and seed size within the genus, and on the potential for fruits to protect their valuable seed contents. Comparatively smaller fruits were found in species that continually experience frequent disturbance by fire, while both small and large fruits were found among species subjected to both short and long fire intervals. In the latter case where a broad range of fire intervals is possible, some species have adopted a strategy of producing small seeds that provide superior colonisation ability in disturbed conditions, while other species have adopted a strategy of producing large seeds which are between disturbance by fire. Only when more competitive during longer intervals between taxonomic membership at the subgeneric level was accounted for in analyses across all species, did a significant relationship emerge between fruit size and rainfall independently of fire interval and plant height: comparatively larger fruits were found in species experiencing lower average annual rainfall in the subgenera Eucalyptus and Symphyomyrtus. In contrast to previous studies, larger fruits were found only in short species, while small fruits were found in both short and tall species. Many short species have adopted a strategy of protecting their seeds from high fire intensity by producing larger fruit. Since tall species can elevate their fruit far above high fire intensity, they make considerable energy savings by producing smaller fruit. It remains an open question as to why small fruit size occurs in some short species, but we suggest that these species may invest more heavily in vegetative regrowth after fire than in re-establishment by seed.","CSIRO, Ctr Plant Biodivers Res, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Murray, BR (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Gore Hill, Sydney, NSW 2065, Australia.",b.murray@pi.csiro.au,,"Murray, Brad/0000-0002-4734-5976",,,,73,11,13,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,DEC,2001,24,6,,,,,651,658,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.240604.x,,,8,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,515JL,WOS:000173491900004,,,,,2021-09-21,

Some ecologists believe that at least some and possibly most, of the interpretation of this work may be subject to dispute because of potential artefacts associated with the confinement itself. Simulations suggested that moderate or even severe artefacts may arise from using enclosures that are 'too small', which could produce inferential nonsense in some circumstances (Mac Nally, 1997). Here, the influence of differential mobility is explicitly considered in a simulated environment, with organisms confined in enclosures of a variety of sizes. Some simulations involve single populations, while others pit together competitors differing only in mobility. Three foraging strategies based on simple movement principles are simulated. Results indicate that the relationships between resource consumption and mobility will depend upon foraging strategy, often in unexpected ways compared with the implications of spatial averaging. Outcomes of interactions among pairs of populations having the same foraging strategy but with different mobilities also are complex, indicating that the results of confinement experiments may involve non-intuitive interactions between mobility and foraging method. There needs to be a refocusing on basic biology of organisms used in confinement experiments (e.g. movement distributions) and, particularly, constructing defensible statements on why the selected scales were used.

The presence of multi-species aggregations on the water surface raises the question whether the pygidial secretion of one species can elicit an escape response in other species. There were no differences in escape reaction to signals between two strongly scented species (G. aeratus and G. substriatus) and one species without obvious scent (G. opacus). Furthermore. signals were received across the species borders, although only the two species emitting volatile components were able to alarm other individuals. The two scented species (G. aeratus and G. substriatus) often aggregate in large groups on open water, whereas the unscented species (G. opacus and G. minutus) rarely do so, but preferably occur singly or in loose groups among the emergent marginal vegetation of various standing waters. This suggests that the presence of alarm signals is correlated with behaviour and habitat choice. Furthermore, the putatively weak competitor G. opacus spends significantly more time below the water surface than G. substriatus. perhaps as a result of it lacking an alarm function. The occasional presence of individuals of the two unscented species in large aggregates of G. aeratus on open surface, may indicate that they may take advantage of the alarm signals produced by individuals of another species and as result escape approaching danger. It is not known whether G. opacus and G. minutus have lost the ability to produce volatile alarm substances or whether they never have had it. Comparisons with the ca 11000-year-old subfossil localities of G. opacus, however, indicate that at least from that date this species has inhabited localities similar to the present with respect to predation risks and other properties, i.e. mainly small, predatory fish-free waters.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Zool, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; Royal Inst Technol, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Gothenburg, Dept Bot, SE-41319 Gothenburg, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Dept Zool, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Stenson, JAE (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Zool, Box 463, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,34,5,5,0,6,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,1999,87,2,,,,,220,227,,10.2307/3546737,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,262CQ,WOS:000084048400002,,,,,2021-09-21,

The biomass of roach and bream was reduced to 33 and 10%, respectively, after the program. The predominate diet change following this major reduction in fish biomass was an increased use of benthic organisms by most size-classes of roach. Also, bream shifted to benthos at an earlier ontogenetic stage. These diet shifts were most probably attributed to the drastic reduction in biomass of the benthivorous bream, resulting in underexploited benthic invertebrates. In order to test if alterations in diet choice were reflected in the composition of stable isotopes of consumer tissue, we determined the temporal changes in the N-15/N-14 ratio (delta N) of potential fish prey as well as in fish tissue. No temporal trends were found for delta N of fish, possibly due to the high temporal variability in delta N of zooplankton. However, minimum and maximum delta N values of major food organisms (chironomids and zooplankton) were generally reflected in the delta N of both small roach and perch one sampling occasion later (3 months) and in piscivorous perch (exclusively feeding on small fish) two sampling occasions later. Hence, the stable isotope composition could be followed through food links, providing that the consumer mainly fed on one specific food item. However, several other predictions regarding connections between diet and stable isotope composition were not corroborated. We conclude that stable isotope analysis of consumer tissue cannot replace traditional methods of diet determination, but might well provide complementary data.","Univ Lund, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Univ Lund, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.persson@limno1.lu.se,,"Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Persson, Anders/0000-0001-5961-3651",,,,37,88,90,2,33,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Trapping data were taken from a long-term monitoring study of small-mammal populations in Algonquin Park, Ontario. We used data from 1991-1995 from the three habitats used in the enclosure experiment. If competition or predation affects habitat distribution patterns. then, given a choice, mice should select different substrates in the enclosures from those they use in the field. Alternatively, if habitat use is not constrained by interactions with competitors or predators (i.e., if small mammals select habitats), then habitats used in the enclosure should match habitat distributions observed in the field. Habitats used in the field did not match habitats selected in the enclosure experiment for either deer mice or woodland jumping mice.

Notwithstanding a general improvement in the sophistication of experimental work, there remains a major problem when manipulations involve the forced confinement of mobile organisms in enclosures (or 'cages'). Some evidence suggests that outcomes of field experiments depend upon the size of the enclosure used. Simulated field experiments are conducted here to explore some of the implications of the effects of enclosure size on experiments involving consumers engaged in exploitative competition for food resources. The simulations employ calibration data from rocky intertidal systems of South-Eastern Australia, but they are not designed to imitate a specific system but rather to illustrate some potentially general problems associated with confinement experiments. The simulations indicate that there will be enclosure size-dependent effects on consumption rates of individuals, with the severity of effects being inversely related to the enclosure size used (i.e., worse artefacts for smaller enclosures). The mechanism underlying the effect appears to be the more concentrated harvesting of resources by consumers confined to small enclosures, which prevent the food resource from 'escaping' predation as frequently as occurs under unconstrained conditions. The simulations are extended to investigate how the interpretation of interspecific competition may be influenced by the size of enclosure used and, if the results reflect natural conditions, then misleading interpretations are likely to emerge if enclosure sizes are too small relative to natural scales of movement.

We parameterize models that predict population density from one year to the next. In agreement with theoretical expectation all the models have locally stable equilibria, and overcompensation is rare. We demonstrate that interspecific interactions are extremely weak, relative to intraspecific ones, and that the spatial arrangement of species and individuals within them is critical to the observed dynamics. The impact of spatial density-dependent population growth on observed densities was calculated. In 52% of the cases population size would have been increased by at least a factor of 1.5 had there been no interactions between individuals, and in 9% of these it would have increased by a factor of four or more. This effect is shown to be largely a result of intraspecific interactions.

We examine processes regulating the structure of tidepool communities for comparison with emergent substrata. The physical environment of tidepools is highly regulated by the tidal cycle, although fluctuations in physical factors are smaller in tidepools, and the organisms remain submerged for the entire tidal cycle. As a result, the upper limits of the distribution of organisms are extended in tidepools and some species either tend to aggregate in pools or avoid them. The vertical zonation of organisms is not as pronounced in tidepools as on emergent substrata. Herbivory has been shown to influence the distribution and abundance of algal species in tidepools, but the effect of predation in regulating community structure has been less well documented. The importance of interspecific competition has been consistently shown in tidepools, particularly among algal species, which usually are the dominant space occupiers. Although the introduction of most species into tidepools depends upon recruitment from the surrounding water, the effects of variation in the supply of new individuals has not been examined. Aspects of the physical regime such as habitat complexity and wave exposure affect the community structure of tidepools, as they do communities on emergent substrata. However, the specific characteristics of tidepools such as pool depth, volume, orientation, shading and flushing rate make individual pools unique, resulting in large spatial variability in tidepool community structure. For this reason, replication in tidepool studies should be carefully selected. Because of their variable characteristics, well-defined boundaries and tidepools of manageable size can serve as experimental mesocosms to test general ecological theories about community organization.",,"METAXAS, A (corresponding author), DALHOUSIE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, HALIFAX B3H 4J1, NS, CANADA.",,,,,,,140,149,155,1,124,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Removal of C. edulis from around individuals of both shrub species resulted in higher predawn xylem pressure potentials in shrubs from the removal treatments as compared to controls, suggesting that the surrounding C. edulis was utilizing water that would otherwise have been available to these shrubs. In H. ericoides, predawn xylem pressure potentials of removal treatment shrubs remained higher than those of the controls throughout the remainder of the dry season even though these shrubs showed a marked increase in canopy area after removal of surrounding C. edulis. Removal of C. edulis from around H. venetus also initially led to higher predawn xylem pressure potentials in the removal shrubs as compared to the controls and increased production of new leaves. After this initial period the predawn xylem pressure potentials of the removal shrubs were not significantly different from those of controls, suggesting that the demand for water by the increased leaf areas eventually matched the enhanced water availability resulting from C. edulis removal. Also, the morphology of H. venetus shrubs changed to that more typical of unaffected individuals. Thus, C. edulis significantly affected not only the water relations of these two shrub species but also their shoot sizes and overall morphologies.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT BIOL SCI,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106",,,,,,,,47,165,170,1,71,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,COLUMBUS,"OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210",0002-9122,,,AM J BOT,Am.

While some provisioning is targeted at single species of conservation concern, generalised provisioning is more common and can exceed the local availability of natural resources for recipient taxa. Generalised provisioning is enthusiastically promoted by many conservation organisations as a means to foster connection with nature and help wildlife. However, such a vast input of additional resources into the environment must have diverse, ecosystemwide consequences. Direct effects upon recipient taxa have garnered most research interest, and are generally positive in leading to increased survival, productivity and hence population growth. However, we argue that the wider implications for the recipients' non-provisioned competitors, prey and predators are underappreciated and have the potential to generate pervasive negative impacts for biodiversity. The impact of provisioning has also hitherto been considered predominantly in urban contexts, overlooking the movements of wildlife to and from provisioning sources and the widespread nature of both human settlements and provisioning, underappreciating the potential scale of impact. Using a case study of UK garden bird food and nestbox provisioning, we hypothesise how well-intentioned provisioning could be contributing to widespread ecological community change and homogenisation. This may consequently help drive declines in species of conservation concern by asymmetrically benefitting common and adaptable species, leaving their competitors exposed to enhanced direct competition, hyperpredation, mesopredator release and heightened disease transmission risks. We recommend further research into these ecosystem cascades and a more cautious, evidence-based approach to the encouragement of provisioning wildlife.","[Shutt, Jack D.; Lees, Alexander C.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Div Biol & Conservat Ecol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Lees, Alexander C.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Shutt, JD (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Div Biol & Conservat Ecol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England.",jackshutt8@gmail.com,,,,,,95,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

We applied a Markov random fields/conditional random fields (MRF/CRF) modelling to understand whether and how species associations in ectoparasite infracommunities of small mammals vary along environmental gradients across space and time. 2. We analysed the variation in species associations in flea and mite infracommunities of seven host species across localities (spatial scale) and time periods (in the same locality; temporal scale). 3. The performance of the CRF models differed between ectoparasite taxa, scales, and host species. The model performance for flea and mite infracommunities in the majority of host species was satisfying although the proportions of correctly predicted positive occurrences and model sensitivity were moderate. 4. The probability of occurrence of many flea and mite species depended mostly on the occurrence of another flea and mite species (respectively), with many negative interspecific interactions, although occurrences of some species were mainly affected by environmental factors. The patterns of pairwise associations between some ectoparasite species were affected by environmental factors. 5. Although many ectoparasite pairs demonstrated stability in the strength or sign of association across space or time, interactions between other species pairs were spatially or temporally variable, with the association between the same pair of species being stable in one host species and variable in another host species. 6. We conclude that ectoparasite associations are mediated by the off-host environment and may depend on the life histories of both host and ectoparasite species.","[Krasnov, Boris R.; Shenbrot, Georgy I.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Swiss Inst Dryland Environm & Energy Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Vinarski, Maxim V.] St Petersburg State Univ, Lab Macroecol & Biogeog Invertebrates, St Petersburg, Russia; [Vinarski, Maxim V.] Omsk State Univ, Omsk, Russia; [Korallo-Vinarskaya, Natalia P.] Omsk Res Inst Nat Foci Infect, Lab Arthropod Borne Viral Infect, Omsk, Russia; [Korallo-Vinarskaya, Natalia P.] Omsk State Pedag Univ, Omsk, Russia; [Khokhlova, Irina S.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, French Associates Inst Agr & Biotechnol Drylands, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Krasnov, BR (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-8499000 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",krasnov@bgu.ac.il,,,Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [149/17]; Research & Development Operational Program - ERDF [ITMS: 26220220116],We thank Nickolas Clark for help with the MRFcov package.

Evidence consistent with both plasticity and evolutionary divergence exist, but the relative contributions of each to habitat partitioning have been difficult to discern. Here we use a global data set on the breeding occurrence of birds in cities to test predictions of these alternative hypotheses to explain previously described habitat partitioning associated with competitive interference. Consistent with plasticity, the presence of behaviorally dominant congeners in a city was associated with a 65% reduction in the occurrence of subordinate species, but only when the dominant was a widespread breeder in urban habitats. Consistent with evolutionary divergence, increased range-wide overlap with dominant congeners was associated with a 56% reduction in the occurrence of subordinates in cities, even when the dominant was absent from the city. Overall, our results suggest that both plasticity and evolutionary divergence play important, concurrent roles in habitat partitioning among closely related species in urban environments.","[Martin, Paul R.; Burke, Kevin W.; Bonier, Frances] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Martin, PR (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",pm45@queensu.ca,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; University of Canterbury, New Zealand","Funding for this work came from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant program (to P.R.M. and F.B.).

Where grey squirrels are sympatric, red squirrel populations decline through inter-specific competition and squirrelpox virus (SQPV) infection. Grey squirrel eradication from the island of Anglesey facilitated the complete restoration of native red squirrels. Although native species recovery delivered significant ecological and economic benefits, the eradication extended only to a narrow sea-channel boundary, across which grey squirrel dispersal continues to occur. Hence, the long-term sustainability of Anglesey's red squirrel population is vulnerable to grey squirrel re-establishment without continuous intervention. Recent research has demonstrated that as pine marten (Mantes mantes) landscape use intensity increases, so too does red squirrel occupancy, likely linked to parallel declines in grey squirrel occupancy. Restoration of this mustelid predator is a potential tool to deliver sustainable grey squirrel control by restoring a missing trophic component, depressing grey squirrel incursion rates onto Anglesey, reducing red squirrel exposure to SQPV. Recent UK pine marten translocations have sourced animals under licence from wild Scottish populations. We explore the alternative use of captive-bred founders, simultaneously introducing new genetic variability against a limited diversity within extant populations. A current conservation translocation is paired with an ongoing assessment of founder behaviour and 'personality' measured before release. We then highlight the multi-disciplinary approach to delivering applied red squirrel conservation programmes in the face of invasive species.

The two giant petrels (Macronectes spp.) are intriguing in that they are morphologically similar seabirds with overlapping diets and distributions. To better understand the mechanisms allowing their coexistence, we investigated intra- and interspecific niche segregation at Marion Island (Southern Indian Ocean), one of the few localities where they breed in sympatry. We used GPS tracks from 94 individuals and remote-sensed environmental data to quantify habitat use, combined with blood carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios from 90 individuals to characterize their foraging habitat and trophic ecology. Females of both species made distant at-sea foraging trips and fed at a similar trophic level. However, they used distinct pelagic habitats. By contrast, males of both species mainly foraged on or near land, resulting in significant sexual segregation, but high interspecific habitat and diet overlap. However, some males showed flexible behavioural strategies, also making distant, pelagic foraging trips. Using contemporaneous tracking, environmental and stable isotope data we provide a clear example of how sympatric sibling species can be segregated along different foraging behaviour dimensions.","[Reisinger, Ryan R.; Carpenter-Kling, Tegan; Connan, Maelle; Pistorius, Pierre A.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, Marine Apex Predator Res Unit, South Campus, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Reisinger, Ryan R.; Carpenter-Kling, Tegan; Connan, Maelle; Pistorius, Pierre A.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Dept Zool, South Campus, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Reisinger, Ryan R.; Cherel, Yves] La Rochelle Univ, CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Reisinger, Ryan R.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Carpenter-Kling, Tegan; Pistorius, Pierre A.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Dept Zool, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Port Elizabeth, South Africa","Reisinger, RR (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, Marine Apex Predator Res Unit, South Campus, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa.; Reisinger, RR (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Dept Zool, South Campus, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa.; Reisinger, RR (corresponding author), La Rochelle Univ, CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.; Reisinger, RR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",ryan.r.reisinger@gmail.com,"Reisinger, Ryan/D-6151-2014","Reisinger, Ryan/0000-0002-8933-6875; Cherel, Yves/0000-0001-9469-9489","South African National Research Foundation, under the South African National Antarctic Program [SNA93071]; South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research [94916]","This work was funded by the South African National Research Foundation, under the South African National Antarctic Program (grant no.

ForSphagnum-dominated peatlands, an emerging hypothesis is that the change could be triggered by shifts in competitive dominance among plant functional groups, specifically from the currently predominant decay-resistantSphagnumto the more decomposable vascular plants. However, the relationship betweenSphagnumand vascular plant occurrence is notably complex and also includes facilitative interactions that are crucial to the productivity ofSphagnum, and therefore, carbon sequestration. Location Global. Taxa Northern peatlands-Sphagnummoss and vascular plants. Time period Present day and the future. Methods We use a conceptual review to examine underlying mechanisms for the competitive exclusion hypothesis and the nature of facilitative interactions betweenSphagnumand vascular plants under potential global change conditions. We complement the review with an empirical study of peatlands with contrasting hydrology to provide some critical insights into the potential effects of change in plant communities on carbon sequestration. We also propose a conceptual model that presents probable combinations of global change factors and their implications for carbon sequestration. Results Vegetation structure inSphagnum-dominated peatland appears to be driven largely by hydrology, rather than competition among plant functional groups. The peat deposit also exerts some controls (e.g., nutrient immobilization) on biotic structure, thereby acting as resistance against an abrupt shift in plant communities. Main conclusions Peatland controls that constrain vegetation shifts have developed over a millennial time-scale in many peatlands, and the pace of climate change may not allow enough time for the establishment of those mechanisms in younger peatlands. Thus, the persistence of a given peatland as a carbon sink also likely depends on the successional stage of the peatland.","[Oke, Tobi A.] Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, 750 Channel View Dr, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Hager, Heather A.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Oke, TA (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, 750 Channel View Dr, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.",oketobi@gmail.com,,,,,,94,2,2,12,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Populations of many extant forest bird species continue to be depredated by mammals, especially rats, possums, and mustelids. The management history of New Zealand's forests over the past 50 years presents a unique opportunity because a varied program of mammalian predator control has created a replicated management experiment. We conducted a meta-analysis of population-level responses of forest birds to different levels of mammal control recorded across New Zealand. We collected data from 32 uniquely treated sites and 20 extant bird species representing a total of 247 population responses to 3 intensities of invasive mammal control (zero, low, and high). The treatments varied from eradication of invasive mammals via ground-based techniques to periodic suppression of mammals via aerially sown toxin. We modeled population-level responses of birds according to key life history attributes to determine the biological processes that influence species' responses to management. Large endemic species, such as the Kaka (Nestor meridionalis) and New Zealand Pigeon (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae), responded positively at the population level to mammal control in 61 of 77 cases for species >= 20 g compared with 31 positive responses from 78 cases for species <20 g. The Fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa) and Grey Warbler (Gerygone igata), both shallow endemic species, and 4 nonendemic species (Blackbird [Turdus merula], Chaffinch [Fringilla coelebs], Dunnock [Prunella modularis], and Silvereye [Zosterops lateralis]) that arrived in New Zealand in the last 200 years tended to have slight negative or neutral responses to mammal control (59 of 77 cases). Our results suggest that large, deeply endemic forest birds, especially cavity nesters, are most at risk of further decline in the absence of mammal control and, conversely suggest that 6 species apparently tolerate the presence of invasive mammals and may be sensitive to competition from larger endemic birds.","[Fea, Nyree; Hartley, Stephen] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Linklater, Wayne] Calif State Univ Sacramento, 6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA","Fea, N (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",nyree.fea@gmail.com,"Hartley, Stephen/A-2794-2008","Hartley, Stephen/0000-0002-9049-5072; Fea, Nyree/0000-0001-5335-5209; Linklater, Wayne/0000-0003-2627-693X",Holdsworth Charitable Trust [80759-2268],"N.F. collected the data, contacted project managers, and led the analysis and writing of the manuscript.

One possible mechanism thereby is resource partitioning, where each species utilizes a distinct subset of the most limited resource. This resource partitioning is difficult to investigate using empirical research in nature, as only few species are primarily limited by solely one resource, rather than a combination of multiple factors. One exception are the shell-dwelling hermit crabs, which are known to be limited under natural conditions and in suitable habitats primarily by the availability of gastropod shells. In the present study, we used two co-occurring terrestrial hermit crab species, Coenobita rugosus and C. perlatus, to investigate how resource partitioning is realized in nature and whether it could be a driver of coexistence. Results Field sampling of eleven separated hermit crab populations showed that the two co-occurring hermit crab species inhabit the same beach habitat but utilize a distinct subset of the shell resource. Preference experiments and principal component analysis of the shell morphometric data thereby revealed that the observed utilization patterns arise out of different intrinsic preferences towards two distinct shell shapes. While C. rugosus displayed a preference towards a short and globose shell morphology, C. perlatus showed preferences towards an elongated shell morphology with narrow aperture. Conclusion The two terrestrial hermit crab species occur in the same habitat but have evolved different preferences towards distinct subsets of the limiting shell resource. Resource partitioning might therefore be the main driver of their ecological differentiation, which ultimately allowed these co-occurring species to coexist in their environment. As the preferred shell morphology of C. rugosus maximizes reproductive output at the expense of protection, while the preferred shell morphology of C. perlatus maximizes protection against predation at the expense of reproductive output, shell resource partitioning might reflect different strategies to respond to the same set of selective pressures occurring in beach habitats. This work offers empirical support for the competitive exclusion principle-hypothesis and demonstrates that hermit crabs are an ideal model organism to investigate resource partitioning in natural populations.","[Laforsch, Christian] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; BayCEER, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Laforsch, C (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",christian.laforsch@uni-bayreuth.de,"Steibl, Sebastian/ABE-8074-2020","Steibl, Sebastian/0000-0003-4819-8581",Max Weber-Programm-scholarship,"Financial support for accommodation during the field study by the Max Weber-Programm-scholarship.

Here, it is argued that only definition 3 allows for a consistent separation of macroevolution and microevolution. Using this definition, speciation has both microevolutionary and macroevolutionary aspects: the process of morphological transformation is microevolutionary, but the variation among species that it produces is macroevolutionary, as is the rate at which speciation occurs. Selective agents may have differential effects on intraspecific and interspecific variation, with three possible situations: effect at one level only, effect at both levels with the same polarity but potentially different intensity, and effects that oppose between levels. Whereas the impact of all selective agents is direct in macroevolution, microevolution requires intraspecific competition as a mediator between selective agents and evolutionary responses. This mediating role of intraspecific competition occurs in the presence of sexual reproduction and has therefore no analogue at the macroevolutionary level where species are the evolutionary units. Competition between species manifests both on the microevolutionary and macroevolutionary level, but with different effects. In microevolution, interspecific competition spurs evolutionary divergence, whereas it is a potential driver of extinction at the macroevolutionary level. Recasting the Red Queen hypothesis in a macroevolutionary framework suggests that the effects of interspecific competition result in a positive correlation between origination and extinction rates, confirming empirical observations herein referred to as Stanley's rule.","[Hautmann, Michael] Univ Zurich, Palaontol Inst & Museum, Karl Schmid Str 4, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","Hautmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Palaontol Inst & Museum, Karl Schmid Str 4, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",michael.hautmann@pim.uzh.ch,"Hautmann, Michael/E-3656-2012","Hautmann, Michael/0000-0002-7322-8749",,,,63,0,0,5,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-0239,1475-4983,,PALAEONTOLOGY,Paleontology,JAN,2020,63,1,,,,,1,11,,10.1111/pala.12465,,DEC 2019,11,Paleontology,Paleontology,JZ7PB,WOS:000501376200001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Following Hutchinson's seminal suggestion, many theoreticians have tried to create diversity through a fluctuating environment, which impairs or slows down competitive exclusion. However, fluctuating environment models often only produce a dozen of coexisting species at best. Here, we investigate how to create richer communities in fluctuating environments, using an empirically parameterized model. Building on the forced Lotka-Volterra model of Scranton and Vasseur (Theor Ecol 9(3):353-363, 2016), inspired by phytoplankton communities, we have investigated the effect of two coexistence mechanisms, namely the storage effect and higher intra- than interspecific competition strengths (i.e., strong self-regulation). We tuned the intra/inter-competition ratio based on empirical analyses, in which self-regulation dominates interspecific interactions. Although a strong self-regulation maintained more species (50%) than the storage effect (25%), we show that none of the two coexistence mechanisms considered could ensure the coexistence of all species alone. Realistic seasonal environments only aggravated that picture, as they decreased persistence relative to a random environment. However, strong self-regulation and the storage effect combined superadditively so that all species could persist with both mechanisms at work. Our results suggest that combining different coexistence mechanisms into community models might be more fruitful than trying to find which mechanism best explains diversity. We additionally highlight that while biomass-trait distributions provide some clues regarding coexistence mechanisms, they cannot indicate unequivocally which mechanisms are at play.","[Picoche, Coralie; Barraquand, Frederic] Univ Bordeaux, LabEx COTE, Integrat & Theoret Ecol, Bat B2 Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Barraquand, Frederic] CNRS, Inst Math Bordeaux, 351 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France","Picoche, C (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, LabEx COTE, Integrat & Theoret Ecol, Bat B2 Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire, F-33615 Pessac, France.",coralie.picoche@u-bordeaux.fr,,,French ANR through LabEx COTEFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-45],This study was supported by the French ANR through LabEx COTE (ANR-10-LABX-45).,,68,0,0,1,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1874-1738,1874-1746,,THEOR ECOL-NETH,Theor.

Rensch's rule posits that SSD increases with body size in male-biased SSD species and decreases with body size in female-biased SSD species. This pattern, and its inverse, have been mainly explored at the interspecific level, whereas research at the intraspecific level has been largely neglected. Here, we test whether the allometric pattern of SSD in an urodele amphibian conforms to Rensch's rule and evaluate the relative role of four potential mechanisms: sexual selection, fecundity selection, density-dependent resource availability and differential plasticity. Location Iberian Peninsula. Taxon Lissotriton boscai (Amphibia: Caudata: Salamandridae). Methods We used original (field-based) and published data on body size, courtship behaviour and fecundity parameters and a suite of climatic, ecological and genetic (mitochondrial and nuclear markers) predictors to assess these hypotheses. Results The results showed that SSD increased with increasing female mean body size, supporting the inverse Rensch's rule pattern. Primary productivity-related variables and female density were among the most relevant ecological predictors of SSD after accounting for genetic structure and capture date. Main conclusions This study reveals that the interplay between the density-dependent resource availability hypothesis and the differential plasticity hypothesis explains the inverse Rensch's rule. We discuss how combining biogeographical and experimental approaches can provide alternative interpretations to the classical sexual and fecundity selection hypotheses on the interpopulation variation in SSD.","[Penalver-Alcazar, Miguel; Aragon, Pedro] CSIC, MNCN, Dept Biogeog & Cambio Global, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Galan, Pedro] Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Dept Bioloxia, GIBE, La Coruna, Spain","Penalver-Alcazar, M (corresponding author), CSIC, MNCN, Dept Biogeog & Cambio Global, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, Madrid 28006, Spain.",migpenal@ucm.es,"; Galan, Pedro/L-7002-2014","Penalver-Alcazar, Miguel/0000-0002-7449-4862; Galan, Pedro/0000-0002-1681-3343","Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [CGL2014-56416-P, CGL2016-78070-P]","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: CGL2014-56416-P and CGL2016-78070-P",,69,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Each view implies different spatiotemporal community patterns. Along spatial environmental gradients, the organismic view predicts that species turnover is discontinuous, with sharp boundaries between communities, while the individualistic view predicts gradual changes in species composition. Using a spatially explicit multispecies competition model, we show that organismic and individualistic forms of community organisation are two limiting cases along a continuum of outcomes. A high variance of competition strength leads to the emergence of organism-like communities due to the presence of alternative stable states, while weak and uniform interactions induce gradual changes in species composition. Dispersal can play a confounding role in these patterns. Our work highlights the critical importance of considering species interactions to understand and predict the responses of species and communities to environmental changes.","[Liautaud, Kevin; Barbier, Matthieu; Loreau, Michel] CNRS, UMR 5321, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Moulis, France; [Liautaud, Kevin; Barbier, Matthieu; Loreau, Michel] Paul Sabatier Univ, Moulis, France; [van Nes, Egbert H.; Scheffer, Marten] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands","Liautaud, K (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5321, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Moulis, France.; Liautaud, K (corresponding author), Paul Sabatier Univ, Moulis, France.",kevin.liautaud@gmail.com,,"Barbier, Matthieu/0000-0002-0669-8927; LIAUTAUD, Kevin/0000-0001-6164-8415; Scheffer, Marten/0000-0002-2100-0312","TULIP (Towards a unified theory of biotic interactions) Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; BIOSTASES (BIOdiversity, STAbility and sustainability in Spatial Ecological and social-ecological Systems) - European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [666971]; programme of the Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC); European UnionEuropean Commission [643073]","We thank Jean-Francois Arnoldi for insightful discussions in preparing the manuscript, and Gyorgy Barabas and one anonymous referee for their constructive contributions during revisions.

MRCoNS isolates were identified by microbiological and molecular tests. MLST-based phylogenetic analysis was performed in Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using phenotypic and molecular methods. SCCmec type and the presence of biofilm-related ica locus was PCR-tested. Isolates suspected for MRCoNS IT cases were subjected to SmaI-PFGE analysis and individuals from positive households were followed-up for 1 year for carriage dynamics (every 3 months, T0-T4). Nineteen MRCoNS isolates from owners (27.9%) and 12 from pets (16.7%) were detected, coming from 20 households (46.5%). S. epidermidis was predominant (90 and 67% of human and animal strains, respectively), showing high phylogenetic diversity (16 STs among 24 strains). Methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) strains belonged to CC5 (75%), CC11 (12.5%), singleton S556 (8.3%), and S560 (4.17%). Significant host-associated differences were observed for resistance to aminoglycosides, co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol (higher in animal isolates) and tetracycline (higher among human strains). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was common (68.4%) and associated with human strains. Great diversity of ccr and mec complexes were detected, most strains being non-typeable, followed by SCCmecIV and V. Over one third of isolates (most from owners), carried the ica locus, all MRSE CC5. Two sporadic IT cases (T0) were identified in owners and dogs from two households (4.7%), with diverse interspecies-exchanged clones detected along the sampling year, especially in dogs. A comparative analysis of all MRCoNS, with all nasal coagulase positive staphylococci (CoPS) recovered from the same individuals at T0, revealed that CoPS alone was predominant in owners and pets, followed by co-carriage of CoPS and MRCoNS in owners but single MRCoNS in pets. Statistical analyses revealed that owners are more prone to co-carriage and that co-existence of IT cases and co-carriage are positively interrelated. MRCoNS from healthy owners and their pets are genetically heterogeneous MDR strains that are spread in the community. Therefore, pets also contribute to the dissemination of successful human clones. Owner-pet inhabitancy increases the risk for staphylococcal temporal concomitance with its subsequent risk for bacterial infection and genetic exchange.","[Gomez-Sanz, Elena] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Food Nutr & Hlth, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gomez-Sanz, Elena] Ctr Invest Biomed La Rioja CIBIR, Area Microbiol Mol, Logrono, Spain; [Ceballos, Sara; Ruiz-Ripa, Laura; Zarazaga, Myriam; Torres, Carmen] Univ La Rioja, Area Bioquim & Biol Mol, Logrono, Spain","Gomez-Sanz, E (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Food Nutr & Hlth, Zurich, Switzerland.; Gomez-Sanz, E (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Biomed La Rioja CIBIR, Area Microbiol Mol, Logrono, Spain.",elena.gomez@hest.ethz.ch,"Torres, Carmen/C-9027-2013","Torres, Carmen/0000-0003-3709-1690; Gomez-Sanz, Elena/0000-0001-7666-3642","Ministry of Economy and Competitivity of Spain [SAF2009-08570, SAF201235474, SAF2016-76571-R]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)European Commission; European UnionEuropean Commission [659314]","This work was supported by projects SAF2009-08570, SAF201235474, and SAF2016-76571-R from the Ministry of Economy and Competitivity of Spain and the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) as well as by the European Union's Framework Program for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 (2014-2020) under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 659314.",,64,10,10,0,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Understanding the dynamics of their stands is essential in order to better assess natural and anthropogenic impacts. It is usually considered that healthy seagrasses aim to maximize their stand biomass (gDWm(-2)) which may be constrained by resource availability i.e., the local environment sets a carrying capacity. Recently, this paradigm has been tested and reassessed, and it is believed that seagrasses actually maximize their efficiency of space occupationi.e., aim to reach an interspecific boundary line (IBL)as quick as possible. This requires that they simultaneously grow in biomass and iterate new shoots to increase density. However, this strategy depresses their biomass potential.Resultsto comply with this new paradigm, we developed a seagrass growth model that updates the carrying capacities for biomass and shoot density from the seagrass IBL at each time step. The use of a joint biomass and density growth rates enabled parameter estimation with twice the sample sizes and made the model less sensitive to episodic error in either of the variables. The use of instantaneous growth rates enabled the model to be calibrated with data sampled at widely different time intervals. We used data from 24 studies of six seagrass species scattered worldwide. The forecasted allometric biomass-density growth trajectories fit these observations well. Maximum growth and decay rates were found consistently for each species. The growth rates varied seasonally, matching previous observations.ConclusionsState-of-art models predicting both biomass and shoot density in seagrass have not previously incorporated our observation across many seagrass species that dynamics depend on current state relative to IBL. Our model better simulates the biomass-density dynamics of seagrass stands while shedding light on its intricacies. However, it is only valid for established patches where dynamics involve space-filling, not for colonization of new areas.","[Vieira, Vasco M. N. C.

The most often investigated mechanisms mediating coexistence of these species are environmental filtering and niche partitioning. However, the role of other factors, such as species-specific parasites, is still poorly understood. Along the riparian understory of a tropical forest, we explored niche occupation and coexistence between Chrysso intervales and Helvibis longicauda, two related syntopic web-building spiders. We also investigated the effect of H. longicauda mortality induced by a specific fungus parasite, Gibellula pulchra, on the dynamic of C. intervales spatial distribution. Coexistence was mediated mainly by a fine-scale horizontal spatial segregation. H. longicauda built webs almost exclusively close to the river, while C. intervales occupied adjacent areas (10-20 m away from margins). We also found differentiation in other niche dimensions that might allow coexistence, such as in plants occupied, height of web placement, width of leaves used for thread attachment and phenology. H. longicauda mortality caused by fungi was higher during winter than in summer. Consequently, the abundance of C. intervales increased at distances close to the river, indicating competitive release through a density-mediated indirect effect. This demonstrates how non-competitive specific-antagonists can indirectly affect other non-hosts competing community members and influence their spatial distribution in fine-scale ranges. We suggest that environmental filtering restricts H. longicauda to cooler regions; niche partitioning leads populations to occupy different vertical strata and competitive exclusion precludes C. intervales to reach river margins, generating an unusual horizontal zonation pattern.","[Fernandes Cardoso, Joao Custodio] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Recursos Nat, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Michalko, Radek] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Brno, Czech Republic; [Michalko, Radek] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Forest Ecol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Gonzaga, Marcelo Oliveira] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil","Cardoso, JCF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Uberlandia, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Recursos Nat, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.",jcfclg@gmail.com,"Michalko, Radek/Q-2349-2016; Gonzaga, Marcelo O/A-4805-2013; Michalko, Radek/AAT-2529-2021","Michalko, Radek/0000-0003-0831-0823; Gonzaga, Marcelo O/0000-0003-0093-1801; Michalko, Radek/0000-0003-0831-0823","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas GeraisFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [APQ-02104-14]; Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia dos Hymenoptera Parasitoides da Regiao Sudeste (HYMPAR/Sudeste-CNPq/CAPES/Fapesp); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [445832/2014-2, 311823/2017-3]; Masaryk University [MUNI/A/1484/2014]","This project was supported by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (Proc.

We evaluated the effects of marine mammals, fishes, and habitat characteristics on the distribution and relative abundance of marine birds off the coast of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. From May 2012 to 2014, we collected line transect data from 14 shipboard surveys, and novel high-resolution digital videography data from 14 aerial surveys. We compiled five habitat covariates: three static (distance to shore, sea floor slope, and sediment grain size), and two dynamic (sea surface temperature, salinity). We additionally analysed two seabird community covariates: the density of observed marine mammals and detected fish. Using zero-altered models, we tested our hypothesis that plunge-diving seabird species would show positive associations with marine mammals. Our results provide statistical evidence that, alongside competition, facilitative interactions occur among pelagic communities, where subsurface predators improve the detectability and accessibility of prey to surface-feeding seabirds. This study highlights the importance of quantifying community and ecological influences on avian abundance, particularly in predicting the potential exposure of marine birds and mammals to offshore development.","[Goyert, Holly F.; Gardner, Beth] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Veit, Richard R.] CUNY, Coll Staten Isl, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Gilbert, Andrew T.; Connelly, Emily; Duron, Melissa; Johnson, Sarah; Williams, Kathryn] Biodivers Res Inst, Portland, ME USA; [Goyert, Holly F.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Massachusetts Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Goyert, HF (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.; Goyert, HF (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Massachusetts Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",hgoyert@umass.edu,,"Gardner, Marian B (Betty)/0000-0001-5805-7841",Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-EE0005362]; Maryland Energy Administration; Maryland Department of Natural Resources,"This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy under Award Number DE-EE0005362.

Within this context, intraguild competition can limit populations of some species and even play a role in extinction. In this study, we used camera trapping to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of niche partitioning between the African lion Panthera leo leo and the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta in Pendjari Biosphere Reserve, Benin. We found that these predators are more nocturnal in the hunting zone than in the national park of the biosphere reserve. The temporal overlap between lion and hyena was high in the national park (Pianka overlap index 0.88) and low in the hunting zones (0.39). The spatial overlap was low (0.40 in the national park and 0.38 in the hunting zones). The two predators were distributed independently in the national park, but showed significant positive association (co-occurrence) in the hunting zones. We suggest that anthropogenic activities leading to depletion of predators and their prey limit lion and hyena distribution in the hunting zones to some safety areas which are strongly selected by both predators. We recommend to significantly improve conservation efforts in the hunting zones of Pendjari Biosphere Reserve and to expand research of lion-hyena intraguild relationships to improve predator survival in West Africa.","[Sogbohossou, Etotepe A.; Kassa, Barthelemy D.] Univ Abomey Calavi, Lab Appl Ecol, POB 03,BP 294, Cotonou, Benin; [Waltert, Matthias; Khorozyan, Igor] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Burgerstr 50, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Sogbohossou, EA (corresponding author), Univ Abomey Calavi, Lab Appl Ecol, POB 03,BP 294, Cotonou, Benin.",etotepe@gmail.com,"Khorozyan, Igor/A-2510-2019; Waltert, Matthias/E-9134-2010","Waltert, Matthias/0000-0001-7053-0291; Khorozyan, Igor/0000-0002-0657-7500",Panthera Friedman Cheetah Conservation; TWAS/ DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG); IDEAWILD,"EAS received grants from Panthera Friedman Cheetah Conservation, TWAS/ DFG, and IDEAWILD",,50,5,5,3,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Effects of such stressors are increasingly realized by population declines and large-scale extirpation of taxa worldwide. Most notably, cumulative effects of climate and landscape change can limit species' local adaptation and dispersal capabilities, thereby reducing realized niche space and range extent. Resolving the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on species persistence is a pressing challenge in ecology, especially for declining species. For example, wolverines (Gulo gulo L.) persist on only 40% of their historic North American range. While climate change has been shown to be a mechanism of range retractions, anthropogenic landscape disturbance has been recently implicated. We hypothesized these two interact to effect declines. We surveyed wolverine occurrence using camera trapping and genetic tagging at 104 sites at the wolverine range edge, spanning a 15,000 km(2) gradient of climate, topographic, anthropogenic, and biotic variables. We used occupancy and generalized linear models to disentangle the factors explaining wolverine distribution. Persistent spring snow pack-expected to decrease with climate change-was a significant predictor, but so was anthropogenic landscape change. Canid mesocarnivores, which we hypothesize are competitors supported by anthropogenic landscape change, had comparatively weaker effect. Wolverine population declines and range shifts likely result from climate change and landscape change operating in tandem. We contend that similar results are likely for many species and that research that simultaneously examines climate change, landscape change, and the biotic landscape is warranted. Ecology research and species conservation plans that address these interactions are more likely to meet their objectives.","[Heim, Nicole; Volpe, John] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Fisher, Jason T.] Univ Victoria, InnoTech Alberta, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Clevenger, Anthony] Montana State Univ, Western Transportat Inst, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Paczkowski, John] Alberta Environm & Pk, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Heim, N (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.",heimnikki@gmail.com,"Volpe, John P/G-5667-2010","Clevenger, Anthony P/0000-0003-0380-6272",Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures; University of Victoria; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative; Alpine Club of Canada Disney Conservation Fund Parks Canada Patagonia Environmental Fund National Geographic Society; Committee Research Exploration TD Environment Western Transportation Institute; Montana State University Woodcock Foundation,"Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures, Grant/Award Number: Eastern Slopes Predator Project Funding; University of Victoria; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative; Alpine Club of Canada Disney Conservation Fund Parks Canada Patagonia Environmental Fund National Geographic Society; Committee Research Exploration TD Environment Western Transportation Institute; Montana State University Woodcock Foundation",,93,19,20,2,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

For instance, while herbivore identity is often important for eliciting trait changes, we know little about how the strength of induced responses varies with herbivore species. This variation is important, as it may affect interactions between herbivore species and, in turn, herbivore populations, community diversity, and the effectiveness of primary producer responses. To investigate herbivore-specific differences in the strength of induced defenses, we exposed the seaweed Silvetia compressa (hereafter Silvetia) to grazing by isopods (Idotea wosnesenskii, hereafter Idotea), snails (Tegula funebralis, hereafter Tegula), or both herbivores together. After 2 wk, we compared relative tissue palatability by offering each herbivore a choice between conspecific-grazed tissues and either (1) non-grazed tissues, (2) heterospecific-grazed tissues, or (3) tissues grazed by both herbivores. Both species preferred non-grazed over conspecific-grazed tissues, confirming induced changes in palatability. When we directly compared tissues induced by isopods and snails, Tegula-grazed tissues were less palatable than Idotea-grazed tissues, suggesting that Tegula elicits stronger Silvetia responses than Idotea. When offered a choice between heterospecific-grazed and non-grazed tissues, both herbivores responded to heterospecific grazing. Thus, while both herbivores decrease Silvetia palatability, the strength of the response varies with grazer identity, which we would have not predicted had we only compared grazed and nongrazed tissues. Our results suggest that in communities where herbivores elicit defenses of different strength, interspecific herbivore interactions may be asymmetric, depending on which seaweed phenotypes have been induced.","[Jones, Emily; Long, Jeremy] San Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst, San Diego, CA 92106 USA; [Jones, Emily] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA","Jones, E (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst, San Diego, CA 92106 USA.; Jones, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",emjones@ucdavis.edu,,,Inamori Fellowship; Susan and Stephen Weber Endowed Scholarship; Harold and June Grant Memorial Scholarship; CSU COAST; Phycological Society of America; Lerner Gray Grant for Marine Research; CSUMB UROC; SDSU Graduate Student Travel Grants; SDSU JDPE,"We thank G.

In pair-wise interaction trials, compared with L. synagris, L. campechanus demonstrated significantly increased roving behaviour and predatory activity. While no significant difference in these activities was observed between L. campechanus and L. griseus, when all three snappers (Lutjanidae) were grouped together L. campechanus swimming activity significantly decreased in the presence of both tropically-associated species. Overall, L. campechanus were more active and aggressive predators and appear to be competitively resistant to L. griseus and L. synagris. As lower latitude species have continued to become increasingly prevalent in nGOM habitats and regional warming continues to affect resident reef-associated fishes, these findings contribute to the assessment of the effects of warming-related species shifts upon nGOM fishes and document current partial resilience of L. campechanus to climate-related expansions of tropical confamilials.

Assuming a trade-off between competitive ability and ecological generalism, we would predict larger competitive differences between species with different niche widths. Community phylogenetic theory predicts that competition will be stronger among more closely related species, assuming that phylogenetic distance reflects ecological similarity. We would therefore expect the probability of competitive exclusion to be highest among closely related species with different niche widths. Here, we assess how well differences in niche width and phylogenetic distance correlate with co-occurrences among 34 species of Cyperaceae (sedges) in the eastern Canadian subarctic. The Cyperaceae is a species-rich family, with many species sharing similar niches and environmental tolerances, making it a model clade for evaluating the importance of niche width differences and phylogenetic distances on co-occurrence. Consistent with both hypotheses, we found that higher co-occurrence scores correlated with species pairs that were distantly or only intermediately related and that had similar niche widths. Furthermore, we show that this correlation is stronger when considering only more recently diverged species pairs and that there is a triangular relationship between phylogenetic distance and species co-occurrence, suggesting that distantly related species might have both strong and weak competitive interactions. Using co-occurrence as a proxy for competitive outcomes, our results support both a negative correlation between phylogenetic distance and strength of competitive interactions, and a trade-off between niche width and competitive ability.","[Elliott, Tammy L.] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, 4101 Sherbrooke East, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Davies, T.

Competition for limiting resources is a fundamental and well-established driver of niche partitioning, which in turn promotes species coexistence and biodiversity. Although contests are a well-known behavioural mechanism by which organisms compete over limiting resources, there has been surprisingly little application of contest theory to understanding interspecific interactions, niche partitioning, species coexistence and biodiversity. 2. We investigated the link between contest dynamics and community structure using two intertidal rockpool fishes, Bathygobius cocosensis (Gobiidae) and Lepidoblennius haplodactylus (Tripterygiidae), as model species. We assessed the abundance and distribution of the two species on intertidal rocky shores of South-East Australia, and whether distribution patterns were related to abiotic variables. We then conducted interspecific contest experiments between pairs of B. cocosensis and L. haplodactylus of varying size and sex under high and low dissolved oxygen levels to assess the competitive dominance of the species. To relate these results to community structure, we quantified temporal patterns of rockpool fidelity of each species in situ. 3. Field surveys revealed that B. cocosensis was most prevalent in rockpools with higher dissolved oxygen, and L. haplodactylus was most prevalent in rockpools that contained no B. cocosensis. Contest experiments revealed that B. cocosensis displayed higher resource holding power than L. haplodactylus regardless of size asymmetry, sex or dissolved oxygen concentration, although contest intensity was influenced by relative body size of competing individuals. Furthermore, the microhabitat preference of L. haplodactylus was modulated in the presence of B. cocosensis. In the field, B. cocosensis displayed higher rockpool fidelity than L. haplodactylus. 4. In light of these findings, we propose that B. cocosensis is the superior competitor but persistence of both species is likely facilitated by low-cost contest resolution strategies, plasticity in microhabitat preference, negative spatial co-variation and interspecific variation in dispersal and corresponding home range sizes. 5. By using contest theory to understand the dynamics of interspecific contests, insight has been gained into how habitat is partitioned, species coexist and ultimately how biodiversity is maintained.","[Paijmans, Kai C.; Wong, Marian Y.

Dominant ant species are known to determine the structure of ant communities by interfering in the foraging of other ant species. Using bait and pitfall trapping experiments, we performed a pattern analysis at a fine spatial scale of an ant community in a very simplified and homogeneous agroecosystem, that is, a single-crop banana field in Martinique (French West Indies). We found that the community structure was driven by three dominant species (Solenopsis geminata, Nylanderia guatemalensis, and Monomorium ebeninum) and two subdominant species (Pheidole fallax and Brachymyrmex patagonicus). Our results showed that dominant and subdominant species generally maintained numerical dominance at baits across time, although S. geminata, M. ebeninum, and B. patagonicus displayed better abilities to maintain dominance than P. fallax and N. guatemalensis. Almost all interspecific correlations between species abundances, except those between B. patagonicus and N. guatemalensis, were symmetrically negative, suggesting that interference competition prevails in this ground-dwelling ant community. However, we observed variations in the diurnal and nocturnal foraging activity and in the daily occurrence at baits, which may mitigate the effect of interference competition through the induction of spatial and temporal niche partitioning. This may explain the coexistence of dominant, subdominant, and subordinate species in this very simplified agroecosystem, limited in habitat structure and diversity.","[Carval, Dominique; Cotte, Violaine; Resmond, Remi; Perrin, Benjamin] CIRAD, UPR GECO, Le Lamentin, Martinique, France; [Tixier, Philippe] CIRAD, UPR GECO, Montpellier, France; [Tixier, Philippe] CATIE, Dept Agr & Agroforesteria, Turrialba, Costa Rica","Carval, D (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR GECO, Le Lamentin, Martinique, France.",dominique.carval@cirad.fr,"Tixier, Philippe/C-2119-2008","Tixier, Philippe/0000-0001-5147-9777; Carval, Dominique/0000-0002-1525-2855; Resmond, Remi/0000-0003-4805-9688",CIRAD; E.U.

This study aimed to determine how habitat degradation, in terms of changing coral composition under climate change, affected abundance, species richness and aggressive behaviour of juveniles of three damselfishes (Pomacentrus moluccensis, P. amboinensis and Dischistodus perspicillatus, in order of decreasing reliance on coral). Patch reefs were constructed to simulate two types of reefs: present-day reefs that are vulnerable to climate-induced coral bleaching, and reefs with more bleaching-robust coral taxa, thereby simulating the likely future of coral reefs under a warming climate. Fish communities were allowed to establish naturally on the reefs during the summer recruitment period. Climate-robust reefs had lower total species richness of coral-reef fishes than climate-vulnerable reefs, but total fish abundance was not significantly different between reef types (pooled across all species and life-history stages). The nature of aggressive interactions, measured as the number of aggressive chases, varied according to coral composition; on climate-robust reefs, juveniles used the substratum less often to avoid aggression from competitors, and interspecific aggression became relatively more frequent than intraspecific aggression for juveniles of the coral-obligate P. moluccensis. This study highlights the importance of coral composition as a determinant of behaviour and diversity of coral-reef fishes.","[Kok, Judith E.; Hoogenboom, Mia O.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Graham, Nicholas A.

To estimate the consequences of these shifts for the functioning and stability of ecosystems, reliable predictions of alterations in species distributions are needed. Projections with correlative species distribution models, which correlate species' distributions to the abiotic environment, have become a standard approach. Criticism of this approach centres around the omission of relevant biotic feedbacks and triggered the search for alternatives. A new generation of mechanistic process-based species distribution models aims at implementing formulations of relevant biotic processes to cover species' life histories, physiology, dispersal abilities, evolution, and both intra- and interspecific interactions. Although this step towards more structural realism is considered important, it remains unclear whether the resulting projections are more reliable. Structural realism has the advantage that geographic range shifting emerges from the interplay of relevant abiotic and biotic processes. Having implemented the relevant response mechanisms, structural realistic models should better tackle the challenge of generating projections of species responses to (non-analogous) environmental change. However, reliable projections of future species ranges demand ecological information that is currently only available for few species. In this opinion paper, we discuss how the discrepancy between demand for structural realism on the one hand and the related knowledge gaps on the other hand affects the reliability of mechanistic species distribution models. We argue that omission of relevant processes potentially impairs projection accuracy (proximity of the mean outcome to the true value), particularly if species range shifts emerge from species and community dynamics. Yet, insufficient knowledge that limits model specification and parameterization, as well as process complexity, increases projection uncertainty (variance in the outcome of simulated model projections). The accuracy-uncertainty-relation reflects current limits to delivering reliable projections of range shifts. We propose a protocol to improve and communicate projection reliability. The protocol combines modelling and empirical research to efficiently fill critical knowledge gaps that currently limit the reliability of species and community projections. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular H-2 is produced as an endproduct of carbohydrate fermentation and is reoxidised primarily by sulfate-reduction, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. However, the enzymatic basis for these processes is incompletely understood and the hydrogenases responsible have not been investigated. In this work, we surveyed the genomic and metagenomic distribution of hydrogenase-encoding genes in the human colon to infer dominant mechanisms of H-2 cycling. The data demonstrate that 70% of gastrointestinal microbial species listed in the Human Microbiome Project encode the genetic capacity to metabolise H-2. A wide variety of anaerobically-adapted hydrogenases were present, with [FeFe]-hydrogenases predominant. We subsequently analyzed the hydrogenase gene content of stools from 20 healthy human subjects. The hydrogenase gene content of all samples was overwhelmingly dominated by fermentative and electron-bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenases emerging from the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. This study supports that H-2 metabolism in the human gut is driven by fermentative H(2 )production and interspecies H-2 transfer. However, it suggests that electron-bifurcation rather than respiration is the dominant mechanism of H-2 reoxidation in the human colon, generating reduced ferredoxin to sustain carbon-fixation (e.g. acetogenesis) and respiration (via the Rnf complex). This work provides the first comprehensive bioinformatic insight into the mechanisms of H(2 )metabolism in the human colon.","[Wolf, Patricia G.; Gaskins, H.

One way to find these areas is by using publically-available information from other individuals. We tested a freshwater snail, Physa gyrina, for chemoreception of conspecific cues and predicted they could discriminate between cues based on information regarding hunger levels. We placed 'tracker' snails into a 2-arm arena where they could either follow or avoid an area previously used by a 'marker' snail. The hunger levels of both trackers and markers was manipulated, being either starved or fed. Starved and fed trackers did not differ in their following response when markers were hungry, but starved trackers were significantly more likely to follow fed markers, compared to fed trackers that tended to avoid areas used by fed markers. This outcome suggests that P. gyrina uses conspecific chemical cues to find food and potentially in some situations to avoid intra-specific food competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this respect, aggression directed toward heterospecifics is often just as significant as aggression among conspecifics. This is especially true for cichlid fish that share breeding grounds with heterospecifics. Indeed, cichlids are known to differentiate not only between conspecifics that pose different levels of threat but also between heterospecific territorial intruders by directing more aggression toward nonbreeding individuals. To assess whether the ability to make such distinctions could be based on color cues alone, we carried out a field study in which we experimentally presented Amphilophus sagittae cichlid pairs with model intruders of a sympatric congener, Amphilophus xiloaensis, in breeding versus nonbreeding coloration. Consistent with our prediction, we found that A. sagittae exhibited more aggression toward A. xiloaensis models of the latter color type. The results are, to our knowledge, the first to show that territory holders can, based on coloration alone, assess variation among individuals of a species other than their own in the threat posed to offspring survival.","[Lehtonen, Topi K.; Gagnon, Karine] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, SF-20500 Turku, Finland; [Lehtonen, Topi K.] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Biosci, Turku, Finland; [Sowersby, Will; Wong, Bob B.

In terrestrial systems, sessile species often compete for multiple limiting resources (i.e., space, light, and nutrients), but in marine systems, space is viewed as the primary or sole limiting resource. Competition theory, on the other hand, suggests that competition for a single limiting resource is unlikely to maintain high species diversity, but manipulative tests of competition for other resources in marine benthic systems are exceedingly rare. Here, we manipulate the availability of food for a classic system, marine sessile invertebrate communities, and investigate the effects on species diversity, abundance, and composition during early succession as well as on the growth of bryozoan populations in the field. We found the number of species to be greater, available space to be lower, and the community composition to be different in assemblages subjected to increased food availability compared to controls. Similarly, laboratory-settled bryozoans deployed into the field grew more in the presence of enhanced food. Our results suggest that food can act as a limiting resource, affecting both diversity and abundance, even when bare space is still available in hard-substratum communities. Consequently, broadening the view of resource limitation beyond solely space may increase our understanding and predictability of marine sessile systems.","[Svensson, J.

In situ populations of Australia's iconic marsupial, the greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis), are nearing extinction due to the impacts of competition and predation by feral animals and unpredictable climatic events (summer heat waves). In this study, we focussed our aim to identify a non-invasive method to measure adrenal activity in the species and also to identify potential factors that should be considered when comparing physiological stress in semi-free ranging populations of the species. We validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detecting fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) from fresh fecal pellets taken from bilbies within four captive sites and two semi-free ranging populations around Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Our FCM EIA successfully detected the 'raise and fall' pattern of FCM levels within 3 days of exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge. Mean FCM levels differed significantly between the captive sites and between sexes. All male bilbies grouped outdoor in captivity expressed the highest mean FCM level in comparison to all captive males that were housed individually or as groups indoors. Also, semi-free ranging bilbies expressed higher mean FCM levels than the captive bilbies. Overall, our study successfully validated a non-invasive tool for monitoring physiological stress in the greater bilby. In the future, it will be worthwhile to consider factors such as housing conditions, sex and location when comparing the adrenal sensitivity to environmental changes, to help evaluate the success of management interventions (such as predator free enclosures) and support the survival of the species.","[Narayan, Edward J.; Evans, Nicole; Hero, Jean-Marc] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia","Narayan, EJ (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",e.narayan@ga.griffith.edu.au,"Narayan, Edward/E-8238-2016","Narayan, Edward/0000-0003-2719-0900",Save the Bilby Fund; Griffith UniversityGriffith University; Griffith University's Animal Ethics Committee [ENV/17/11/AEC],"This project was completed in accordance with approval from Griffith University's Animal Ethics Committee (ENV/17/11/AEC).

Interannual variation in seasonal weather patterns causes shifts in the relative timing of phenological events of species within communities, but we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of how these phenological shifts affect species interactions. Identifying these mechanisms is critical to predicting how interannual variation affects populations and communities. 2. Species' phenologies, particularly the timing of offspring arrival, play an important role in the annual cycles of community assembly. We hypothesize that shifts in relative arrival of off-spring can alter interspecific interactions through a mechanism called size-mediated priority effects (SMPE), in which individuals that arrive earlier can grow to achieve a body size advantage over those that arrive later. 3. In this study, we used an experimental approach to isolate and quantify the importance of SMPE for species interactions. Specifically, we simulated shifts in relative arrival of the nymphs of two dragonfly species to determine the consequences for their interactions as intraguild predators. 4. We found that shifts in relative arrival altered not only predation strength but also the nature of predator-prey interactions. When arrival differences were great, SMPE allowed the early arriver to prey intensely upon the late arriver, causing exclusion of the late arriver from nearly all habitats. As arrival differences decreased, the early arriver's size advantage also decreased. When arrival differences were smallest, there was mutual predation, and the two species coexisted in similar abundances across habitats. Importantly, we also found a nonlinear scaling relationship between shifts in relative arrival and predation strength. Specifically, small shifts in relative arrival caused large changes in predation strength while subsequent changes had relatively minor effects. 5. These results demonstrate that SMPE can alter not only the outcome of interactions but also the demographic rates of species and the structure of communities. Elucidating the mechanisms that link phenological shifts to species interactions is crucial for understanding the dynamics of seasonal communities as well as for predicting the effects of climate change on these communities.","[Rasmussen, Nick L.; Van Allen, Benjamin G.; Rudolf, Volker H.

Therefore, we predicted that antipredator behavior, here measured as escape behavior when captured by a human, would correlate with risk of parasite infection at the interspecific level with bolder species having more parasites than risk-averse species. Here we tested whether species with more active escape behavior also tended to have high prevalence of blood parasites, specifically hemosporidian parasites. Focusing on effect sizes we found that escape behavior was intermediately and positively related to prevalence of infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, whereas that was not the case for the more virulent Plasmodium. Species that were habitat generalists and hence encountered a greater diversity of habitats had higher prevalence of blood parasites than specialists. In addition, some components of escape behavior were correlated at an intermediate magnitude with habitat exploration, as reflected by the relative frequency of feeding innovations, and coloniality. We failed to find considerable patterns of correlations between most of the behavioral variables and flight initiation distance, another commonly used antipredator behavior. Therefore, behavioral responses to an approaching predator and to being caught by a human likely represent 2 independent axes of antipredator behavior that do not evolve in concert. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that escape behavior is related to risk of infection with blood parasites partially mediated by the effect of habitat generalism.","[Garcia-Longoria, L.] Univ Extremadura, Dept Anim Biol, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain; [Garamszegi, L.

We analyzed survival probability of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss.) trees and saplings, growing in pure and mixed stands experiencing self-thinning, in the Boreal Forest Natural Region of Alberta, Canada. Generalized logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the effects of tree and stand characteristics on the survival probability of both species. Absolute size of the individuals, characterized by diameter at breast height, had a positive effect on the survival of both aspen and spruce. Aspen experienced decreasing survival with size, which is most likely linked to age rather than competition. Significant effects of basal area of trees larger than the subject tree indicated that one-sided inter- and intra-specific competition, rather than two-sided, is the primary driving force of competition-related mortality for both aspen and spruce. Periodic annual increment in diameter was a better predictor of survival than basal area of larger trees, indicating that growth rate is the most important individual characteristic that defines survival of both aspen and spruce in these self-thinning stands.

Ecologists have invoked this limiting similarity hypothesis to explain patterns in the structure and function of biological communities and to inform conservation, restoration, and invasive-species management. However, few studies have empirically tested the validity of the limiting similarity hypothesis. Here we report the results of a laboratory microcosm experiment in which we used a model system of 23 common, co-occurring North American freshwater green algae to quantify the strength of 216 pairwise species' interactions (the difference in population density when grown alone vs. in the presence of another species) along a manipulated gradient of evolutionary relatedness (phylogenetic distance, as the sum of branch lengths separating species on a molecular phylogeny). Interspecific interactions varied widely in these bicultures of phytoplankton, ranging from strong competition (ratio of relative yield in polyculture vs. monoculture << 1) to moderate facilitation (relative yield >1). Yet, we found no evidence that the strength of species' interactions was influenced by their evolutionary relatedness. There was no relationship between phylogenetic distance and the average, minimum (inferior competitor), nor maximum (superior competitor) interaction strength across all biculture communities (respectively, P = 0.19, P = 0.17, P = 0.14; N = 428). When we examined each individual species, only 17% of individual species' interactions strengths varied as a function of phylogenetic distance, and none of these relationships remained significant after Bonferoni correction for multiple tests (N = 23). Last, when we grouped interactions into five qualitatively different types, the frequency of these types was not related to phylogenetic distance among species pairs (F-4,F-422 = 1.63, P = 0.15). Our empirical study adds to several others that suggest the biological underpinnings of competition may not be evolutionarily conserved, and thus, ecologists may need to re-evaluate the previously assumed generality of the limiting similarity hypothesis.","[Fritschie, Keith J.; Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Alexandrou, Markos A.; Oakley, Todd H.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Fritschie, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",kfritsch@uw.edu,,"Oakley, Todd/0000-0002-4478-915X","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1046121, DEB-1046307]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1046121] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",We thank Patrick Venail and Anita Narwani for methodological and conceptual assistance in the formulation of this project.

The unique set of interactions experienced by an individual can also affect how it behaves and its likelihood of winning future encounters. In the present study, we used field experiments to investigate the circumstances under which residency (resident or intruder), behavioural history (prior dominance or subordinance) and body size determined the direction and strength of intraspecific interactions. We paired recently metamorphosed individuals of a coral reef damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, with different suites of these traits to observe how each behaved in a competitive interaction. Our results show the importance of priority and size advantages, and suggest that prior behavioural history has the least influence on the outcome of future confrontations. Prior history was only important when combatants were of similar size, with previously subordinate residents losing against similarly sized previously dominant intruders. Aggression affected space use on a habitat patch and was itself affected by the relative size difference between combatants. Aggressive residents were larger than their competitors, occupied higher areas of the patch and chased intruders to lower areas of the patch and further away from the patch. Space use was not affected by behavioural history. These results demonstrate the importance of priority effects in structuring fish communities, and how an individual's physical and behavioural characteristics interact to predict community dynamics. This has important implications for predicting fish community structure under certain environmental or ecological scenarios. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, competition is not the sole constraint on resource partitioning, and its effects are mediated by factors including the environmental context in which species coexist. Colonial seabirds provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the importance of competition in shaping realized niche widths because their life histories lead to variation in intra- and interspecific competition across the annual cycle. Dense breeding aggregations result in intense competition for prey in surrounding waters, whereas non-breeding dispersal to larger geographical areas produces lower densities of competitors. Bayesian hierarchical models of the isotopic niche, closely aligned to the trophic niche, reveal the degree of segregation between species and functional groups during both time periods. Surprisingly, species explained far more of the variance in the isotopic niche during the non-breeding than the breeding period. Our results underline the key role of non-breeding dynamics in alleviating competition and promoting distinctions between species through the facilitation of resource partitioning. Such situations may be common in a diverse range of communities sustained by ephemeral but abundant food items. This highlights how consideration of the hierarchical grouping of competitive interactions alongside consideration of abiotic constraints across the complete annual cycle allows a full understanding of the role of competition in driving patterns of character displacement.","[Bodey, Thomas W.; Bearhop, Stuart] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, England; [Ward, Eric J.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Phillips, Richard A.] British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [McGill, Rona A.

We predicted therefore that plants with larger body size should impose greater limits on the number of species - especially relatively small ones - that can reside within their immediate neighbourhoods. Species composition was compared within local neighbourhoods surrounding target plants of different sizes belonging to one of the largest herbaceous species found within old-field vegetation in eastern Ontario Canada - Centaurea jacea. Resident species density was generally greater within immediate 'inner' target neighbourhoods than within adjacent circular 'outer' neighbourhoods, and mean body size of resident neighbour species was unrelated to increases in target plant size. As target plant size increased, the proportion of resident neighbour species that were reproductive increased. Relatively big plants of C. jacea do not limit the number or the proportion of reproductive species that can coexist within their immediate neighbourhoods, nor do they cause local exclusion of relatively small species from these neighbourhoods. These results fail to support the 'size-advantage' hypothesis and are more consistent with the 'reproductive economy advantage' hypothesis: success under intense competition is promoted by capacity to recruit offspring that - despite severe suppression - are able to reach their minimum body size needed for reproduction, and hence produce grand-offspring for the next generation. The latter is facilitated by a relatively small minimum reproductive threshold size, which is generally negatively correlated with a relatively large maximum potential body size.

Given that carrion availability is higher in the morning than in the afternoon and that differences in wing-loading and nesting behavior may limit morning activity in some species, there is potential for temporal segregation in resource use to play an important role in the coexistence of avian scavengers. I predicted that Lappet-faced Vultures (Torgos tracheliotos), which have lower wing-loading and lower competitive abilities, would have higher abundance at carrion resources in the morning than White-backed Vultures (Gyps africanus) and Ruppell's Vultures (G. rueppellii). In addition, I predicted that differences in activity patterns among vulture species would affect foraging success. Using experimental carcasses, I examined the effect of time of day on foraging behavior. I quantified foraging success in roosting birds, measured as the proportion of individuals with a full crop. Contrary to predictions, during the dry season White-backed and Ruppell's Vultures were more abundant at carcasses in the morning and Lappet-faced Vultures were more abundant in the afternoon. In the afternoon a large proportion of the Gyps individuals appeared to be satiated and densities were lower at carcasses, perhaps creating a temporal competitive refugium in the afternoon during which Lappet-faced Vultures could feed. However, Lappet-faced Vultures have lower foraging success than White-backed and Ruppell's Vultures. These results demonstrate that temporal segregation occurs, but may not reduce competition, in this scavenging guild.","[Kendall, Corinne J.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kendall, Corinne J.] Natl Museums Kenya, Dept Zool, Ornithol Sect, Nairobi, Kenya","Kendall, CJ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cjk2113@columbia.edu,,,"Peregrine Fund; Explorer's Club; Princeton UniversityPrinceton University; Princeton University, Hawk Mountain Sanctuary","Research was conducted in collaboration with The Peregrine Fund's Pan African Raptor Conservation Program.

However, due in part to the secretive behavior and low detectability of many snake species, this generalization is based on a limited number of studies, most of which focus on a single study site. We examined differences in diet composition, trophic niche overlap, site occupancy and detectability of five sympatric aquatic snake species between two different habitat types in the Southeastern US, replicated at the landscape scale: permanent wetlands with fishes (n=13) and isolated, often ephemeral wetlands without fishes (n=10). We collected >3700 prey items from snakes and compared diet composition among snake species to examine niche breadth and overlap, correcting for relative availability of prey captured independently in the same wetlands. We evaluated evidence for competitive exclusion by estimating the probability of co-occupancy for pairs of snake species in each habitat type using occupancy modeling. In wetlands with fishes, niche overlap was low, suggesting resource partitioning. Conversely, in wetlands without fishes, niche overlap was high, with most species feeding on larval or paedomorphic ambystomatid salamanders, but competitive exclusion did not occur. We suggest that high co-occupancy of aquatic snakes in wetlands without fishes despite the apparent lack of resource partitioning is due to a combination of seasonally high abundance of high quality amphibian prey, unique aspects of predator physiology and stochastic abiotic processes that prevent these systems from reaching equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that snake diets can be highly context (e.g. habitat)-specific. Studies should consider other factors in addition to competition for prey when attempting to understand snake population and community dynamics.","[Durso, A.

Unfortunately, the complexity of such interspecific interactions means that well-meaning management interventions can have unexpected, sometimes detrimental, effects on the species they are intended to protect. Here we report that the abrupt removal of an abundant non-native prey species (domestic sheep) and the cessation of predator control, actions intended to protect huemul deer Hippocamelus bisulcus in the future Patagonia National Park, appear to have had negative effects on this Endangered ungulate. During and following the changes in predator-prey management, predation of huemul fawns and females older than 1 year by native culpeo foxes Lycalopex culpaeus and pumas Puma concolor increased 3- and 5-fold, respectively. Predictions from demographic models suggest that elevated mortality rates of female huemul older than 1 year will, on average, cause this population of huemul to decline. These results highlight risks of unintended consequences when aggressive management actions are taken to protect taxa embedded in complex food webs. They also suggest that careful consideration of both inter- and intra-trophic level effects among all species in a system is warranted before conservation interventions are undertaken.","[Wittmer, Heiko U.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Wittmer, Heiko U.; Elbroch, L.

Individuals are, depending on species, rediae or sporocysts (which asexually reproduce) and cercariae (which develop within rediae or sporocysts and infect the next host). Some species use a division of labour within colonies, with 2 distinct redial morphs: small rediae (non-reproducing) and large rediae (individuals which produce cercariae). The theory of optimal caste ratio predicts that the ratio of caste members (small to large rediae) responds to environmental variability. This was tested in Philophthalmus sp. colonies exposed to host starvation and competition with the trematode, Maritrema novaezealandensis. Philophthalmus sp. infected snails, with and without M. novaezealandensis, were subjected to food treatments. Reproductive output, number of rediae, and the ratio of small to large rediae were compared among treatments. Philophthalmus sp. colonies responded to host starvation and competition; reproductive output was higher in well-fed snails of both infection types compared with snails in lower food treatments and well-fed, single infected snails compared with well-fed double infected snails. Furthermore, the caste ratio in Philophthalmus sp. colonies was altered in response to competition.

In this study, we use a trait-based null modelling approach to test for evidence of deterministic assembly of species according to flowering time in an old-field plant community. Plant species coexisting in one-metre-square plots overlapped in flowering time significantly more than expected. This flowering synchrony was more pronounced when analyses focused on bee-pollinated species. Flowering synchrony was also observed for wind-pollinated species, although for only one of our two null model tests, highlighting the sensitivity of some results to different randomization methods. In general, these patterns suggest that relationships between pollinators and plants can influence community assembly processes. Because our study community is composed of approximately 43% native plant species and 57% exotic species, and because the arrival of new species may complicate plantpollinator interactions, we tested whether flowering time overlap was altered by introduced species. Flowering synchrony was greater in plots with a higher proportion of introduced species. This pattern held for both null model tests, but was slightly stronger when analyses focused on bee-pollinated species. These results indicate that introduced species alter community flowering distributions and in so doing will inevitably affect pollinatorplant interactions. Finally, we tested whether our results were influenced by variation among study plots in above-ground biomass production, which some theory predicts will be related to the importance of competition. Our results were not influenced by this variation, suggesting that resource variation among our plots did not contribute to observed patterns. Synthesis: Our results provide support for predictions that coexisting species should display flowering synchrony, and provide no support for species coexistence via temporal niche partitioning at this scale in this study community. Our results also indicate that introduced species significantly alter the community assembly process such that flowering synchrony is more pronounced in plots with a greater proportion of introduced plant species.","[Dante, Sneha K.; Aarssen, Lonnie W.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Schamp, Brandon S.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada","Schamp, BS (corresponding author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada.",brandon.schamp@algomau.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We thank D.

We consider here a generalization with four species, the minimum number of species allowing other interactions beyond the single loop (one predator, one prey). We show that, contrary to the mean field prediction, on a square lattice the model presents a transition, as the parameter setting the rate at which one species invades another changes, from a coexistence to a state in which one species gets extinct. Such a dependence on the invasion rates shows that the interaction graph structure alone is not enough to predict the outcome of such models. In addition, different invasion rates permit to tune the level of transitiveness, indicating that for the coexistence of all species to persist, there must be a minimum amount of intransitivity.

From 2005 to 2008, we captured, radio-collared, and monitored 11 cape foxes, 22 bat-eared foxes, and 15 black-backed jackals on a game ranch in South Africa to investigate their spatial, habitat, temporal, and dietary resource overlap. Mean annual home-range sizes were 27.7?km2 for cape foxes, 5.0?km2 for bat-eared foxes, and 17.8?km2 for jackal family groups. Home ranges overlapped completely between species, although core areas overlapped less (<45%), with cape foxes and jackals overlapping the least (12%). When active, cape foxes, but not bat-eared foxes, used core areas of jackal groups less than expected. Additionally, both fox species used jackal core areas less than expected for their den sites, suggesting areas outside jackal core areas were used as refuges by foxes. Strong levels of habitat partitioning were not apparent at the study site or home-range levels, although habitat selection for den sites differed between jackals and cape foxes. Jackals were the most diurnal across seasons, whereas cape foxes were the most nocturnal. Diets overlapped little (R0?=?0.200.34) among the canid species, with bat-eared foxes overlapping the least with the others. Jackals killed at least 5 collared bat-eared foxes and 1 collared cape fox, indicating potential interference competition, probably for exclusive use of territorial space rather than over shared resources. We conclude that bat-eared foxes coexisted with jackals primarily by their dietary specialization and group living. Cape foxes coexisted with jackals by exhibiting high levels of spatial, habitat, temporal, and dietary partitioning. Surprisingly, the fox species exhibited positive associations with each other. Our results show the mechanisms that may allow jackals to suppress fox populations, yet also show how foxes, in turn, use different mechanisms to coexist with a dominant canid.

On three Pacific Northwest sites differing in productivity, soil parent material, and understory vegetation community, we evaluated year-5 effects of presence/absence of 5 years of VC on allocation of aboveground biomass and nitrogen (N) between planted Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) and competing vegetation. Equations for predicting bole, branch, foliar, and total dry weights based on stem diameter at a height of 15 cm and total tree height did not differ significantly among sites or by presence or absence of VC. This contrasts with previous research, using diameter at breast height rather than at 15 cm, which found that separate equations were warranted for trees with and without competing vegetation. Estimated whole-tree biomass among the six site/VC combinations ranged from 0.8 to 7.5 Mg ha(-1), and increases in tree biomass associated with VC ranged from 62% to 173% among sites. Among the three sites, there were positive, linear relationships between soil total N content to a depth of 60 cm and both N content of aboveground vegetation (trees plus competing vegetation) and Douglas-fir foliar N concentration. Tree N content increased by 8.4, 8.2, and 40.0 kg N ha(-1) with VC at the three sites, whereas competing vegetation N content decreased with VC by 0.9, 18.8, and 32.0 kg N ha(-1) respectively, at the same sites. Thus, VC did not lead to a direct compensatory tradeoff between aboveground N content of trees and other vegetation. However, soil N content was linearly related to N accumulation and plant growth across the three sites. In addition to differences in N availability among sites, the effect of VC on the redistribution of resources among trees and competing vegetation also was influenced by vegetation community composition and efficacy of VC treatments.

Both rosefinch species as the dominant members of local passerine breeders had similar breeding densities. They did not segregate in clutch initiation date, nesting altitude, habitat patches or nesting plant species, but in nesting plant height, with C. rubicilloides using those taller than the average of local bushes and C. eos using those lower than the average. No overlap in diet fed to nestlings between the two rosefinch species. C. rubicilloides with large and strong beaks primarily exploited the leguminous seeds, whereas C. eos mainly collected small seeds at ground level from a variety of plant species in accord with their smaller beaks. Interspecific aggression and territoriality were lack.

Among-species differences in the expression of constitutive and plastic traits may shape species distributions within a community. For many systems, the relationships among individual species' phenotypes, particularly morphological plasticity, and performance and distribution are poorly understood. 2. I tested whether three co-occurring species of marine snails in the genus Nucella differed in their constitutive and inducible defences against crabs, in terms of growth and shell architectural defence. I also tested whether among-species trait differences were associated with interspecific differences in antipredator performance (resistance to crushing) and distributions along a vertical tidal emersion gradient on rocky shores where the snails co-occur. 3. Species distributed lower on the shore and thus exposed to crabs for longer periods of time exhibited higher constitutive growth rates than the upper-shore species. Lower-shore species also exhibited greater inducible reductions in somatic growth and increases in shell thickening than the upper-shore species. Plastic alterations of the scaling relationship between shell-thickness and somatic growth (i.e. greater shell mass per body mass) enabled the two lower-shore species to produce stronger, more crab-resistant shells in the presence of crabs than their upper-shore congener. 4. Results suggest that species-specific differences in both constitutive and inducible shell defence and growth reflect growth/mortality tradeoffs that are associated with species' vertical distributions along a predation risk gradient. Thus, adaptive differences in inducible morphological defenses should be considered along with more traditionally studied traits such as behaviour and constitutive morphological defenses, when examining traits that influence patterns of species distribution along environmental gradients.","[Bourdeau, Paul E.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Bourdeau, PE (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",bourdea7@msu.edu,"Bourdeau, Paul/AAA-3551-2019","Bourdeau, Paul/0000-0002-8927-1899",A Ruth and Stephen Wainwright Fellowship,"I would like to thank the Director and Staff at Friday Harbor Labs for logistical support.

However, predicting how changes in abiotic variables associated with climate change may affect species performance also depends on the biotic context, which can mediate species responses to climatic change. We conducted a 3-yr field experiment to determine how the herbivorous grasshopper Camnula pellucida (Scudder) responds to manipulations of temperature and population density. Grasshopper survival and fecundity decreased with density, indicating the importance of intraspecific competition. Female fecundity tended to increase with temperature, whereas grasshopper survival exhibited a unimodal response to temperature, with highest survival at intermediate temperatures. Grasshopper performance responses to temperature also depended on density. Peak survival in the low-density treatment occurred in warmer conditions than for the high-density treatment, indicating that the intensity of intraspecific competition varies with temperature. Our data show that changes to the temperature regimen can alter grasshopper performance and determine the intensity of intraspecific competition. However, the effects of temperature on grasshopper performance varied with density. Our data indicate the importance of the biotic context in mediating species responses to climatic factors associated with global change.","[Laws, Angela Nardoni; Belovsky, Gary E.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Laws, AN (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",alaws@ksu.edu,"Belovsky, Gary/C-1255-2014",,University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center,"We thank A.

We present evidence that species interactions may be a significant factor in mediating the regional assembly of the Danish avifauna. Because >95% of breeding species (n = 197) are migratory, we hypothesized that dispersal limitation would not be important and that breeding distributions would largely reflect resource availability and autecological habitat preferences. Instead, we detected a striking pattern of spatial segregation between ecologically similar species at two spatial scales with a suite of null models that factored in the spatial distribution of habitats in Denmark as well as population size and biomass of each species. Habitat utilization analyses indicated that community-wide patterns of spatial segregation could not be attributed to the patchy distribution of habitat or to gross differences in habitat utilization among ecologically similar species. We hypothesize that, when habitat patch size is limited, conspecific attraction in concert with interspecific territoriality may result in spatially segregated distributions of ecologically similar species at larger spatial scales. In the Danish avifauna, the effects of species interactions on community assembly appear pervasive and can be discerned at grain sizes up to four orders of magnitude larger than those of individual territories. These results suggest that species interactions should be incorporated into species distribution modeling algorithms designed to predict species occupancy patterns based on environmental variables.","[Gotelli, Nicholas J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Graves, Gary R.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Rahbek, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Gotelli, NJ (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",ngotelli@uvm.edu,"Graves, Gary R/P-1003-2017; Rahbek, Carsten/L-1129-2013; Rahbek, Carsten/D-9372-2013","Graves, Gary R/0000-0003-1406-5246; Rahbek, Carsten/0000-0003-4585-0300; ",,,,63,176,180,1,91,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Given their importance, shells are acquired and transferred between crabs through several modalities. We conducted observations and experiments at the Asinara Island (Sardinia, Italy) to investigate the efficacy of the different behavioral tactics adopted by the hermit crab Clibanarius erythropus to acquire shells, such as: (1) locomotion and activity at different tidal phases; (2) attendance at shell-supplying sites (simulated predation sites with five different odors: live and dead gastropods, live and dead crabs, predator); and (3) interactions with conspecifics in aggregations on simulated gastropod predation sites. In each tidal phase, locomotion was slow (0.7 cm min(-1)) and, as a consequence, the probability of encountering empty shells and conspecifics was low. Simulated gastropod predation sites quickly attracted a larger number of hermit crabs than the other sites tested. Aggregations seemed to function as shell exchange markets, as previously suggested for other species: the first attendant took the experimental shell and a chain of shell exchanges among conspecifics followed. Our results show that, in C erythropus, aggregation is the most efficient tactic for the acquisition of new shells, whereas in other species, such as Pagurus longicarpus, it is associated with exploitation ability due to the intense locomotion. The interspecific plasticity in hermit crabs' behavior is confirmed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In various studies, sympatric lady beetles differ in habitat-use at the scales of landscapes, single agricultural fields, and single plants. Species also differ in their seasonal and diel activity-patterns. These spatiotemporal differences in habitat-use should lead to complementary impacts on prey, by encouraging different predator species to attack different subsets of the prey population. This in turn should lead to stronger biological control at higher predator diversity levels. Indeed, experimental manipulations of predator species richness in communities that include coccinellids have generally revealed stronger prey suppression with greater predator biodiversity. In these experimental studies, lady beetles sometimes filled unique niches as particularly voracious predators, and often also complemented or facilitated prey capture by other species. Intraguild predation was rarely found to be a strongly disruptive force, perhaps because spatiotemporal niche differences reduced encounters among species. In summary, coccinellid species both respond to and affect their communities in unique ways, generally to the benefit of herbivore suppression. Thus, the best niche fit for coccinellids may be that of a complement to other species, contributing to improved biological control with greater predator biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Location: Sede Boqer, Negev Desert, Israel. Methods: The potential for competitive interactions in two annual plant communities (desert and coastal) from semi-stabilized sand dunes was manipulated by varying seed bank density and therefore the number of potentially interacting individuals. Communities were exposed to three different irrigation regimes, mimicking precipitation at the desert site, the coastal site, and an intermediate precipitation level. Plots were maintained for 3 years, and percentage cover of each species in the plots was recorded at the end of each growing season. We used redundancy analysis to test for effects of initial density, irrigation, and year on the species and functional group composition of the communities. Results: Initial density had significant effects on species composition, and these effects remained significant over 3 years, even as total community percentage cover became more similar among treatments over time. Density effects did not depend on resource availability (irrigation level). Functional group identity or individual plant size did not predict which species would be good competitors, and a species' competitive ability did not predict its abundance in the field. Conclusions: Species interactions strongly affect community composition, and those effects carry over into subsequent years such that competition does not lead to convergence in community structure over time. However, the particular changes in composition observed were not predictable by some of the traits that have been found important in individual-level experiments. We speculate that the outcome of competition in diverse communities will depend on multiple traits, in contrast to the outcome of individual-level pairwise experiments. We also speculate that the shift in composition with density could mean that local variation in density may contribute to maintenance of diversity in this system.","[Rajaniemi, Tara K.] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dept Biol, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA; [Turkington, Roy] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Turkington, Roy] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Goldberg, Deborah] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Rajaniemi, TK (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dept Biol, 285 Old Westport Rd, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.",trajaniemi@umassd.edu; royt@interchange.ubc.ca; degold@umich.edu,,"Rajaniemi, Tara/0000-0003-2861-3901",US-Israel BiNational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [BSF 91-00179]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 96-2973]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Financial support was provided by the US-Israel BiNational Science Foundation (BSF 91-00179 to DG and Linda Olsvig-Whittaker), the National Science Foundation (DEB 96-2973 to DG, RT, and Jessica Gurevitch), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (to RT).

In a study of small coastal streams in eastern Canada, we found patterns suggesting that abundances of a predatory invertebrate, Sweltsa onkos (Plecoptera:Chloroperlidae), are influenced by another predator, Rhyacophila vibox (Trichoptera:Rhyacophilidae). Larval densities of the 2 species were inversely correlated, and mortality of larval S. onkos tended to be higher in streams with many R. vibox. Abundance and mortality of a 3(rd) predatory species, Isoperla montana (Plecoptera:Perlodidae), were unrelated to abundances of the other species. Laboratory behavioral observations confirmed that interactions between R. vibox and S. onkos were asymmetrical; high densities of R. vibox led to higher injury and mortality rates and lower growth rates of S. onkos, whereas S. onkos had no effect on R. vibox growth or mortality. Previous work has shown that R. vibox reaches high densities only in streams with few or no fish, and we conclude that the relative abundances of S. onkos and R. vibox in the study streams might be influenced by differences in Vulnerability to intraguild and fish predation.","[Sircom, Julie; Walde, Sandra J.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 1C8, Canada","Sircom, J (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 1C8, Canada.",jsircom@dal.ca; sandra.walde@dal.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Dalhousie fellowship,"We thank the many students at Dalhousie University and Acadia University who helped with collecting insects.

Resource partitioning between the 3 species was examined, including analysis of fruit items and plants in fecal samples as well as encounter rates in different habitats, to help generate hypotheses about competitive interactions among the species. Overlaps in food resources and habitat use between feral pigs and peccaries were found to be lower than expected. In fact, niche overlap was highest between the native species. Results indicate that currently, feral pigs are not. a direct threat to the native peccaries in the Study area. Differences in morphology and behavior indicate possible mechanisms of niche partitioning between the species. Feral pigs may, nevertheless, impact the wildlife community in other ways as predators of eggs, by destruction of vegetation through rooting, or by functioning as disease reservoirs. Cattle-ranching activities may favor feral pigs and the current anthropogenic changes in the landscape could lead to changes in competitive dynamics between feral pigs and native species.","[Jean Desbiez, Arnaud Leonard; Bodmer, Richard Ernest] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury CT2 7NS, Kent, England; [Jean Desbiez, Arnaud Leonard; Santos, Sandra Aparecida] Embrapa Pantanal, BR-79320900 Corumba, Mato Grosso Sul, Brazil; [Keuroghlian, Alexine] Univ Para Desenvolvimento Estado & Regiao Pantana, Fdn Manoel Barros R Ceara, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso Sul, Brazil; [Keuroghlian, Alexine] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Desbiez, ALJ (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury CT2 7NS, Kent, England.",arnaud@cpap.embrapa.br,,"Bodmer, Richard/0000-0001-8777-2967",European UnionEuropean Commission; Royal Zoological Society of Scotland; Fundacao de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino; Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (FUNDECT/CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"This work was a collaboration between the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) and Embrapa Pantanal.

Here we use permanent plots monitored since 1954 and precisely located phytosociological censuses from 1970 to study compositional changes of subalpine grasslands in two distinct regions of the Swiss Northern Alps. In both areas, warming trends during the monitoring period were associated with changes in land management (abandonment of goat and sheep pasturing or grazing replaced by mowing). Old and recent inventories were compared with correspondence analyses (CA). Ecological indicator values, community-affinities and biological traits of the species were used to infer the factors responsible for triggering the observed changes. In both regions, subalpine grasslands were stable with smaller changes than have previously been observed in alpine environments. Only a few species appeared or disappeared and changes were generally limited to increasing or decreasing frequency and cover of certain taxa. At one site, grazing abandonment favored fallow species. Some of these species were located at their upper altitudinal distribution limits and may have spread because of rising temperatures. In both areas, declining species were predominantly alpine and low-growing species; their decline was probably due to increased competition (e.g., shadow) with more vigorous subalpine taxa no longer limited by grazing. We conclude that vegetation communities can respond rapidly to warming as long as colonization is facilitated by available space or structural change. In the subalpine grasslands studies, changes were mainly driven by land management. These communities have a dense vegetation cover and newly arriving herbaceous species preferring warmer conditions may take some time to establish themselves. However, climate disturbances, such as exceptional drought, may accelerate community changes by opening gaps for new species.","[Vittoz, Pascal; Randin, Christophe] Univ Lausanne, Fac Biol & Med, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Vittoz, Pascal] Univ Lausanne, Fac Geosci & Environm, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bonnet, Francois] La Thomasia, CH-1880 Jardin Alpin De Pont De, Plans Sur Bex, Switzerland; [Hegg, Otto] Univ Bern, Geobot Inst, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland","Vittoz, P (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Fac Biol & Med, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Batiment Biophore, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",pascal.vittoz@unil.ch,"Randin, Christophe F/K-6969-2016","Randin, Christophe F/0000-0002-4171-0178; Vittoz, Pascal/0000-0003-4218-4517",Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) (Switzerland); Centre de conservation de la faune et de la nature (Canton de Vaud); Fondation Audemars Piguet,"This research has been supported by the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) (Switzerland), Centre de conservation de la faune et de la nature (Canton de Vaud) and Fondation Audemars Piguet.

In earlier work with experimental wheat (Triticum aestivum) populations at a single density, we found that stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis) created frequency-dependent selection on its host but competitive interactions between host genotypes reduced the potential for disease to maintain genetic polymorphisms in this highly self-pollinated species; the weaker competitor actually exhibited positive disease-mediated frequency-dependent selection. Based on these results we predicted that at low density, where the overall level of competition is lower, disease would have a stronger impact relative to competition and thus be more likely to maintain genetic polymorphisms; at low densities the greatest effect of disease for negative frequency-dependent selection should be seen in the weak competitor. Here we report on results with wheat stripe rust in which we altered both the frequency and density of host genotypes in factorial combinations of two-way mixtures where each host genotype was attacked by its own specialized race of rust. Within each density disease levels increased with genotype frequencies, creating frequency-dependent disease attack at all densities. Similarly, disease created negative frequency-dependent selection on its host at all densities, as a genotype's fitness was often greater at low than high frequency when disease was present. Disease levels increased with plant density in 1997 but decreased in 1998. While increasing plant density reduced absolute fitness, presumably as a result of increased competition, a genetic polymorphism was not more likely to be maintained at low than high density as we had predicted. Within each density, the impact of disease was insufficient to reverse the slope of the relationship between absolute fitness and planted frequency from positive to negative for the less competitive host genotype, thus preventing the maintenance of a genetic polymorphism.","[Mundt, Christopher C.; Sackett, Kathryn E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Brunet, Johanne] Univ Wisconsin, USDA ARS, Vegetable Crops Res Unit, Dept Hort, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Mundt, CC (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, 2082 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",mundtc@science.oregonstate.edu,,"Brunet, Johanne/0000-0003-4555-7411",USDA NRIUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [96-35303-3206],"We thank Brian Anacker, Lee Cohnstaedt, Dan Coyle, Sarah DeMay, Karen Garrett, Molly Hoffer, Kris Kovar, Susan Lambrecht, Pat Martinez, and Karl Rhinhart for technical assistance.

Coyotes (Canis latrans) are the primary threat to recovery of red wolves (C. rufus) in the wild, through hybridization and loss of the red wolf genotype and habitat occupancy that reduces space available for wolf occupation. We built a stochastic simulation model (using data collected from a recovering red wolf population in northeastern North Carolina as well as from the literature) to examine spatial dynamics of sympatric red wolves and coyotes (independent of habitat influences) and to elucidate the potential role of coyotes on wolf recovery and reintroduction success. Survival of juvenile and adult wolves had the greatest impact on wolf population size and likelihood of extinction. Introducing coyotes to the model had a substantial negative impact on wolf numbers, and the model was highly sensitive to the estimates of the competitive impact of coyotes on red wolves, through declines in wolf productivity. We simulated coyote management from either removal (lower coyote survival) or surgical sterilization (lower coyote reproductive rates) and found that both management strategies increased viability of red wolf populations, especially during initial colonization. Our results suggest that coyotes can inhibit red wolf reintroduction success through competitive interactions, but that management of coyote populations can improve the probability of successful wolf recovery. Additional information on spatial dynamics and dietary overlap between coyotes and wolves in the recovery area is needed to further elucidate the current and potential competitive impact of coyotes on red wolf populations.

The relative density of small roach and perch was significantly decreased while the relative density of young pike increased substantially. Habitat overlap between roach and perch was high during 1978-1980 compared to 2005-2006. However, they were segregated in diet in both periods, but showed a considerable shift in diet after the manipulation. Roach changed its diet mainly towards detritus and zooplankton. Perch utilized more zooplankton and fish. The increased use of zooplankton indicates large zooplankton abundance, probably due to reduction of small roach and perch as a result of increased number of piscivorous pike and perch. Indirectly, a manipulation of large pike in small eutrophic lakes with simple fish communities as in Lake (A) over circle rungen may have a cascading effect on the biotic community, and thus be a managing tool in restoration.

The simulator can predict growth dynamics for coniferous crop trees as well as competing hardwoods and shrubs. Model specification included conifer, shrub, and hardwood competition expressed at the plot-level. The system employs water-holding capacity as an indicator of productivity. Growth data were obtained from 109 plantations, ranging in age from 3 to 25, in southern Oregon and northern California. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco), the most common conifer species, was observed in 80 of the sampled stands. These observations were used for model development of the primary driving functions, which forecast 2-year basal diameter increment, height increment, and crown width increment. Parameters for all three dynamic expressions for growth were estimated using weighted, nonlinear three-stage least squares. This estimation method provided a predictive model with slight improvements in standard errors for two of the three equations (an average of 3% for height and diameter growth) and no improvement for crown width, when compared with two-stage least squares. The system includes competition from shrubs and hardwoods in predictions of height growth, diameter growth and crown width increment. This allows individual-tree/distance-independent simulator architecture to be extended to young plantations in southern Oregon and northern California.","[Ritchie, Martin W.] USDA, US Forest Serv, Pacific SW Res Stn, Redding, CA 96002 USA; [Hamann, Jeff D.] Forest Informat Inc, Corvallis, OR 97339 USA","Ritchie, MW (corresponding author), USDA, US Forest Serv, Pacific SW Res Stn, 3644 Avtech Pkwy, Redding, CA 96002 USA.",mritchie@fs.fed.us; jeff.hamann@forestinformatics.com,,,,,,49,15,19,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,,,NEW FOREST,New For.,MAR,2008,35,2,,,,,173,186,,10.1007/s11056-007-9070-7,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,257AD,WOS:000252770100006,,,,,2021-09-21,

The second aim was to explore the potential importance of competitive interactions in limiting their current distributions using predictive distribution models. Location Iberian Peninsula. Methods Species presence data were collected from records in the literature and private and public collections. Ecological niche factor analysis was performed to extract pseudo-absences (probable absences), which, together with presence data, were modelled using generalized additive models. The models were run twice. Initially we used only environmental variables, and thereafter additional spatial variables were included in order to account for spatially structured factors not accounted for in the environmental variables. Results Highly reliable distribution models were obtained for the three species, with AUC scores (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve) higher than 0.96. The addition of spatial variables to the first model significantly improved the predicted distribution of Corax (Sterocorax) globosus and Corax (Sterocorax) insidiator, by reducing their potential distribution area. In contrast, the model of Corax (Sterocorax) galicianus was not improved by the addition of a spatial term. Main conclusions Generated pseudo - absences, such as those used in this study, helped to avoid problems of using erroneous data (false absences) in distribution records. Pseudo-absences greatly improved the models by only selecting absences within the area with the most unfavourable environmental conditions. The importance of spatial variables to both C. (S.) globosus and C. (S.) insidiator distributions probably relates to a number of unknown factors, such as unique historical events. The absence of established populations of C. (S.) globosus north of the Ebro Valley appears to be one such historical factor. The distribution of C. (S.) galicianus only marginally overlaps with that of C. (S.) globosus, according to our environmental factor models. As this overlap is restricted it is not likely to be a result of competitive exclusion; rather, their geographical segregation seems to be environmentally mediated. The addition of spatial variables reduced the potential habitat of C. (S.) insidiator, eliminating some environmentally optimal areas from its distribution. As no environmental barrier seems apparent in this case, competitive interaction with C. (S.) globosus is a plausible hypothesis for its absence in these optimal parts of its range.","Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolutiva, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; Univ Alcala De Henares, Fac Biol, Dept Zool & Anthropol Fis, E-28871 Madrid, Spain","Jimnez-Valverde, A (corresponding author), Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolutiva, C-Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",mcnaj651@mncn.csic.es,"Jimenez-Valverde, Alberto/L-2755-2014; Lobo, Jorge M/E-2309-2013","Jimenez-Valverde, Alberto/0000-0001-9962-2106; Lobo, Jorge M/0000-0002-3152-4769",,,,89,19,21,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

These changes may affect discontiguous trophic levels via adjacent trophic levels. The invasion of an exotic host species may provide the opportunity to observe the dynamics of changing interspecific interactions among parasitoids belonging to different trophic levels. The exotic large white butterfly Pieris brassicae invaded Hokkaido Island, Japan, and quickly spread throughout the island. Prior to the invasion, the small white butterfly P. rapae was the host of the primary parasitoid Cotesia glomerata, on which both the larval hyperparasitoid Baryscapus galactopus and the pupal hyperparasitoid Trichomalopsis apanteroctena depended. At the time of the invasion, C. glomerata generally laid eggs exclusively in P. rapae. During the five years following the invasion, however, the clutch size of C. glomerata in P. rapae gradually decreased, whereas the clutch size in P. brassicae increased. The field results corresponded well with laboratory experiments showing an increase in the rate of parasitism in P. brassicae. The host expansion of C. glomerata provided the two hyperparasitoids with an opportunity to choose between alternative hosts, that is, C. glomerata within P. brassicae and C. glomerata within P. rapae. Indeed, the pupal hyperparasitoid T. apanteroctena shifted its preference gradually to C. glomerata in P. brassicae, whereas the larval hyperparasitoid B. galactopus maintained a preference for C. glomerata in P. rapae. These changes in host preference may result from differential suitability of the two host types. The larval hyperparasitoid preferred C. glomerata within P. rapae to C. glomerata within P. brassicae, presumably because P. brassicae larvae attacked aggressively, thereby hindering the parasitization, whereas the pupal hyperparasitoid could take advantage of the competition-free resource by shifting its host preference. Consequently, the invasion of P. brassicae has changed the host use of the primary parasitoid C. glomerata and the pupal hyperparasitoid T. apanteroctena within a very short time.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Tanaka, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",sing@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp; nishida@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp; ohsaki@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,49,25,27,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,AUG,2007,61,8,,,,,1791,1802,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00165.x,,,12,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,198AV,WOS:000248600300001,17683423,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Yet, the roles of controphic species of mosquito larvae in affecting mosquito populations have received little attention. Published empirical evidence, although scarce, suggests that controphic species such as zooplankton and anuran larvae compete with mosquito larvae, can positively affect mosquito larvae by consuming bacteria that are pathogenic to mosquito larvae, reduce predation on mosquito larvae by serving as alternative prey, and ultimately cause increased predation on mosquito larvae by causing a numerical response in the predator. We conclude that more extensive theoretical and empirical studies in elucidating the roles of controphic species will better allow us to predict mosquito population dynamics and allow for better management of mosquitoes.","Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Community Ecol Lab, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Entomol, Mosquito Res Lab, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Community Ecol Lab, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",leon@research.haifa.ac.il; jchase@biology2.wustl.edu,,,,,,105,94,104,1,47,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

Facilitation and competition have both been found to operate in harsh environments, but their relative strength may be predicted to change along gradients of herbivory. Moreover, facilitation effects through habitat amelioration and protection from herbivory may act together determining the outcome of neighborhood plant-plant interactions. We tested the hypothesis that grazing pressure alters the balance of positive and negative interactions between palatable and unpalatable species by increasing the strength of positive indirect effects mediated by associational resistance to herbivory. We conducted a two-year factorial experiment in which distance ( i.e., spatial association) from the nearest unpalatable neighbor ( Stipa speciosa) and root competition were manipulated for two palatable grasses ( Poa ligularis and Bromus pictus), at three levels of sheep grazing ( none, moderate, and high) in a Patagonian steppe community. We found that grazing shifted the effect of Stipa on both palatable grasses, from negative ( competition) in the absence of grazing to positive ( facilitation) under increasing herbivore pressure. In ungrazed sites, belowground competition was the dominant interaction, as shown by a significant reduction in performance of palatable grasses transplanted near to Stipa tussocks. In grazed sites, biomass of palatable plants was greater near than far from Stipa regardless of competition treatment. Proximity to Stipa reduced the amount of herbivory suffered by palatable grasses, an indirect effect that was stronger under moderate than under intense grazing. Our results demonstrate that facilitation, resulting mainly from protection against herbivory, is the overriding effect produced by unpalatable neighbors on palatable grasses in this rangeland community. This finding challenges the common view that abiotic stress amelioration should be the predominant type of facilitation in arid environments and highlights the role of herbivory in modulating complex neighborhood plant interactions in grazing systems.","Univ Buenos Aires, Catedra Ecol IFEVA, CONICET, Fac Agron,Dept Recursos Nat & Ambiente, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Graff, P (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Catedra Ecol IFEVA, CONICET, Fac Agron,Dept Recursos Nat & Ambiente, Av San Martin 4453,C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",graff@ifeva.edu.ar,"Graff, Pamela/AAJ-9948-2021","Graff, Pamela/0000-0002-6042-2673",,,,80,132,145,2,114,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2007,88,1,,,,,188,199,,10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[188:SIPANP]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,156RZ,WOS:000245668300022,17489467,,,,2021-09-21,

SQPV causes disease with high mortality in red squirrels but appears non-pathogenic in grey squirrels. Not all populations of introduced grey squirrels carry the virus, notably those in Scotland and Italy, and the rate of red squirrel replacement by grey squirrels is some twenty times faster in those areas where grey squirrels carry the virus. Here we develop strategies to manage the SQPV disease threat to red squirrels by reference to the largest, designated red squirrel refuge site in England, Kielder Forest (50000 ha). Using modelling techniques, we identify four main corridors within the buffer zone by which grey squirrels will reach Kielder, initially within two years and in large numbers within 10 years. Assuming that greys will not settle within Kielder because of the unfavourable nature of the spruce habitat, we predict that SQPV disease will burn out at the edges of the forest, although many red squirrels will die. This burn-out is unlikely to be the scenario in other refuge areas where the habitat is more favourable to greys. We conclude that the conservation of red squirrels will depend on minimising contact between red and grey squirrel populations, and we advocate monitoring grey squirrels in corridors within buffer zones around refuge areas, and removing them when detected.

Available diet data from these species allow us to predict some interference competition for food resources in sympatric populations. We checked the food interference hypothesis in a sympatric population. The diet of both predators was analyzed through scat collection. Seasonal differences in biomass consumption were compared between both species in those items considered as key resources according to biomass consumption. Strawberry tree fruits can be considered as key resource exclusively for genets whereas fungi, blackberries and rabbits are keys for stone martens only. For other key resources consumed by both species (wood mouse and figs) we suggest that a possible mechanism to reduce diet overlap could be the sequential use of these resources: no intensive exploitation by both species of the same key resource during the same season was detected. Figs and wood mouse were used alternatively. Although strawberry tree fruits and blackberry are exclusive key resources of one of the species, their consumptions showed the same pattern.

This resource-ratio theory has been used to make a number of testable predictions about competition and community patterns. We reviewed 1,333 papers that cite Tilman's two publications to determine whether predictions of the resource-ratio theory have been adequately tested and to summarize their general conclusions. Most of the citations do not directly test the theory: only 26 studies provide well-designed tests of one or more predictions, resulting in 42 individual tests of predictions. Most of these tests were conducted in the laboratory or experimental microcosms and used primary producers in freshwater systems. Overall, the predictions of the resource-ratio theory were supported 75% of the time. One of the primary predictions of the model, that species dominance varies with the ratio of resource availabilities, was supported by 13 of 16 tests, but most other predictions have been insufficiently tested.

As these insects form communities within a shared resource unit with well-defined spatial boundaries, they offer a good opportunity to study the guild organization Of communities of endophytic insects. We used random combinations of members of phytophagous taxa, which radiated on hosts of the subtribes Centaureinae and Carduinae, as species pools for null models to determine whether and to what extent the composition of the guilds in Cardueae flower heads follows predictable assembly rules. We tested two hypotheses and found that in both cases the null model can be rejected. Assembly rule 1: species assemblages in flower heads follow the rule of intra-generic isolation (i.e. each guild member belongs to a different genus) significantly more often than random combinations of Cardueae insects. We show that, where violations of this rule occur, they are almost exclusively due to the occurrence of a combination of those congeners of the genera Urophora, Larinus and Cerajocera, whose larval activities differ to some extent temporally and/or spatially. Assembly rule 2: the composition of guilds tends to develop towards a maximum of intra-guild differentiation the three complementary trophic types (e,g. gall and callus feeders, receptacle and ovary chewers, omnivores and intra-guild predators) co-occur in guilds significantly more often than in random combinations. Our results show that the organization of phytophagous guilds in Cardueae flower heads is mainly a result of invasions due to host shifts. We suggest that in addition to larval competition for space and food, constraints such as the availability of enemy-free space and/or 'free rendezvous arenas' have shaped the structure of the guilds investigated.","Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Zwolfer, H (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",h.zwoelfer@freenet.de,,,,,,63,4,5,0,15,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

In this system, each animal species fed on other species according to feeding preference. The food web system evolved via the appearance and extinction of species. The model succeeded in reproducing evolutionary patterns of diversity similar to those seen in the fossil record. This result indicates that the model reproduced the temporal changes of the rates of colonization and extinction of species in the system, which have been decided a priori in the previous stochastic models. In the food web system, the numbers of both predatory and prey species influenced the temporal diversity patterns in each clade in the system. The number of prey species fluctuated strongly, whereas the number of predatory species gradually increased with time. Therefore, temporal diversity patterns were influenced mainly by the number of predatory species. As a result of the gradual increase of the number of predatory species, it was difficult for each clade to maintain its species diversity for a long time. Slight changes of interspecific interaction can sometimes decide the destiny of a clade. When a clade is faced with extinction, if one predatory species of the clade becomes extinct and one or two prey species of the clade appear, the species diversity in the clade increases again. This result indicates that slight changes of interspecific interaction sometimes decide the destiny of a clade.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Geol, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Yoshida, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Geol, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",,,,,,,49,17,18,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Different strategies of habitat selection, and their importance in ecology and evolution, can often be revealed simply by plots of density in adjacent habitats. For individual species, the strategies are closely intertwined with mechanisms of population regulation, and with the persistence of populations through time. For interacting species, strategies of habitat selection are not only responsible for species coexistence, but provide one of the most convenient mechanisms for measuring competition, and the various community structures caused by competitive interactions. Other kinds of interactions, such as those between predators and prey, demonstrate that an understanding of the coevolution of habitat-selection strategies among strongly interacting species is essential to properly interpret their spatial and temporal dynamics. At the evolutionary scale, the frequency dependence associated with habitat selection may often allow populations to diverge and diversify into separate species. Habitat selection thereby demonstrates how we can map microevolutionary strategies in behavior onto their population and community consequences, and from there, onto macroevolutionary patterns of speciation and adaptive radiation. We can anticipate that future studies of habitat selection will not only help us complete those maps, but that they will also continue to enrich the panoply of ideas that shape evolutionary ecology.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; Lakehead Univ, Fac Forestry & Forest Environm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",,,,110,504,522,4,279,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,2003,136,1,,,,,1,13,,10.1007/s00442-003-1241-4,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,692AK,WOS:000183638000001,12690550,,,,2021-09-21,

Previous examinations of possible environmental influences on growth rates of birds yielded few correlations, leading to suggestions that young may be growing at maximum rates allowed within physiological constraints. However, estimations of growth rates can be confounded by variation in relative developmental stage at fledging. Here, we re-estimate growth rates to control for developmental stage. We used these data to examine the potential covariation of growth and development with environmental variation across a sample of 115 North American passerines. Contrary to previous results, we found that growth rates of altricial nestlings were strongly positively correlated to daily nest predation rates, even after controlling for adult body mass and phylogeny. In addition, nestlings of species under stronger predation pressure remained in the nest for a shorter period, and they left the nest at lower body mass relative to adult body mass. Thus, nestlings both grew faster and left the nest at an earlier developmental stage in species with higher risk of predation. Growth patterns were also related to food, clutch size, and latitude. These results support a view that growth and developmental rates of altricial nestlings are strongly influenced by the environmental conditions experienced by species, and they generally lend support to an adaptive view of interspecific variation in growth and developmental rates.","Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Remes, V (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, TF Svobody 26, CZ-77146 Olomouc, Czech Republic.",tmartin@selway.umt.edu,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011; Remes, Vladimir/B-6842-2016","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867; ",,,,78,188,201,1,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,DEC,2002,56,12,,,,,2505,2518,,,,,14,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,637GR,WOS:000180503700016,12583590,,,,2021-09-21,

We studied microhabitat use by partitioning containers into microhabitats that either contained or lacked refuges and recorded movement to determine activity. All five species altered microhabitat preferences and activity levels when they shared tanks with larvae of most species. The smallest species (A. laterale and A. maculatum) spent the most time in the vegetated chamber, used the vegetated chamber more often, and decreased activity in the presence of potential predators. When species were paired, both species usually changed their activity and use of microhabitat in opposite directions. These behaviors may be important in maintaining coexistence among species by reducing interspecific aggression and intraguild predation.","St Josephs Coll, Dept Biol, Rensselaer, IN 47978 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Nat & Appl Sci, Green Bay, WI 54311 USA","Brodman, R (corresponding author), St Josephs Coll, Dept Biol, Rensselaer, IN 47978 USA.",,,,,,,36,18,19,0,9,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,EMPORIA,"EMPORIA STATE UNIV, DIVISION BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 1200 COMMERCIAL ST, EMPORIA, KS 66801-5087 USA",0018-0831,,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,SEP,2002,58,3,,,,,346,354,,10.1655/0018-0831(2002)058[0346:AAMUDI]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Zoology,Zoology,582XM,WOS:000177376500006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Seedlings of Picris hieracioides from populations of the early-(1 year) and the mid-stages of field abandonment (15-40 years) were transplanted in two adjacent old fields, abandoned for 4 (F4) and 20 years (F20) and that differed markedly in floristic composition and vegetation structure. For two years, we experimentally manipulated competition (no-neighbours vs. natural vegetation) and resource availability (addition of water and fertiliser vs. controls) in an attempt to evaluate their influence on survival, reproductive timing, growth and reproductive output throughout the life cycle. Early mortality was higher in non vegetated plots in both fields. Mortality of seedlings was mainly due to herbivory by larvae of genus Agriotes. Flowering throughout the whole experiment was also facilitated by vegetation in the F4 field as a result of the positive effect of annual vegetation and remained unaffected in the F20 field because of the high competitive effect of established perennial vegetation. The addition of resources altered the effect of facilitation and competition on late seedling survival. Survival was enhanced in the vegetated plots of the F4 field, because resource addition increased the shade provided by the canopy of vegetation, protected seedlings from temperature extremes and reduced water loss. Seedling mortality also decreased in the F20 field but in a similar manner to vegetated and non-vegetated subplots, and consequently the outcome of positive and negative interactions remained neutral. The net effect of facilitation and competition resulted in interference later in the life cycle and appeared through final lower growth and reproduction in both fields. However, the greater competition in 1994 than in 1995 in both fields, probably because the size of the rosettes, makes them less susceptible to competition, illustrates the difficulty in predicting the outcome of competition solely of one season for facultative biennial plants. The relative competition intensity calculated using only survivors (RCI1) was unaffected by habitat fertility in both fields. In striking contrast, the relative competition intensity calculated using seedling mortality (RCI2) was significantly higher in subplots without resource addition in both fields because of high seedling mortality in vegetated subplots. Finally, there were no differences in the net effect of facilitation and interference processes among populations from early and mid successional stages showing that phenotypic plasticity buffers the environmental selective pressures linked to successional processes.","Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Vegetal, Avda Diagonal 645, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier J, France","Sans, FX (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Vegetal, Avda Diagonal 645, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",xsans@porthos.bio.ub.es,"Serra, F.

Behavioural-scale measurements on a guild of five species of freshwater pond snails (Mollusca: Pulmonata) indicate a trade-off between the ability to utilize a patch's resource and the ability to quickly find new resource patches. Community-level experiments demonstrate that both species richness and composition are affected by the patchiness of the environment. In particular, treatments with low patchiness are dominated by species best at exploiting local resources (diggers) whereas treatments with high patchiness are dominated by species best at finding new patches (grazers). Results from a controlled mesocosm experiment with two of the most common of these species, Helisoma trivolvis (a relative digger) and Physella gyrina (Physidae) (a relative grazer) show that the patchiness of the environment strongly influences the outcomes of interspecific competition among these two species: the digger performed much better in less patchy habitats, whereas the grazer performed better in more patchy habitats. A two-species model of diggers and grazers modified to incorporate behavioural aspects of patchiness produces this same pattern of competitive outcomes.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Amsterdam, Populat Biol Sect, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands","Chase, JM (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jchase@pitt.edu,,"Richards, Shane/0000-0002-9638-5827",,,,40,46,47,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Increased density is believed to have both a positive effect, by increasing water retention, and a negative effect, by reducing light availability. Mortality of shoot apices, offshoot production, and rates of biomass increase of both individual shoots and whole colonies were recorded in experimental monospecific, known-density colonies of Dicranum majus, Plagiochila asplenioides, Ptilium crista-castrensis, and Rhyridindelphus loreus under controlled relative humidity (four levels) and irradiance (two levels). A phenomenological model was developed, and predictions were made about the responses to increased density under different humidity and resource (light) levels. Mortality was low, but offshoot production generally decreased with density. The effects of density on growth rates varied among species and environmental conditions. As predicted, in dry environments under the high light level, growth rates of D. majus and R. loreus peaked at an intermediate density at which the positive effects of a close packing of shoots balanced the increased competition for light. In humid or dark environments, the relationships between growth rates and density were mostly monotonic and negative. Growth rates of P. crista-castrensis decreased with density under most environmental conditions, whereas density was not shown to have an effect on growth rates of P. asplenioides. The results show that relatively high light levels, compared to those found in their natural spruce forest habitat, are necessary for aggregation to facilitate growth of these bryophytes. Thus, our results indicate that competition for light, rather than a low water availability, limits the performance of individual shoots in colonies of these bryophytes under a wide range of densities and humidity conditions.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Bot, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Pedersen, B (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Bot, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",Baard.Pedersen@chembio.ntnu.no,,"Hanslin, Hans Martin/0000-0002-3224-2368",,,,99,38,45,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2001,82,1,,,,,70,88,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[0070:TFPDDP]2.0.CO;2,,,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393UN,WOS:000166488200007,,,,,2021-09-21,

We attempt a more pluralistic approach in this comparative study of divergence in pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) from the Adirondack region of New York. In some lakes, pumpkinseed forms that use shallow- and open-water environments coexist. We tested four predictions relating to an hypothesis of character release: (1) Pumpkinseed divergence is favored in the absence of the closely related bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus), a known competitor elsewhere. (2) divergence is favored when the combined effects of other planktivorous fish taxa that may impose diffuse competition is reduced, (3) divergence is positively related to lake size because larger lakes provide more distinct and diverse environments, and (4) divergence is favored in lakes dominated by open-water habitat. In two lakes with introduced bluegill (sympatry), bluegill appear to limit pumpkinseed divergence, as they do elsewhere. Pumpkinseeds were neither found in the openwater habitat, nor did they eat significant amounts of open-water prey. In nine allopatric lakes selected for their similarity to the sympatric lakes, pumpkinseeds were ecologically and morphologically divergent, consistent with a character release hypothesis. Morphological divergence followed functional expectations. Open-water pumpkinseeds generally had longer caudal peduncles, shorter heads, thinner bodies, and smaller paired fins compared to shallow-water pumpkinseeds (heritable variation in body shape has been demonstrated elsewhere). Among 26 allopatric lakes, other planktivores had a negative effect on intrapopulation divergence as if they collectively imposed diffuse competition. Surprisingly, lake size was unrelated to divergence, and the amount of open-water habitat had an unexpected negative effect. Mean body size was also negatively related to divergence.

This is true for some habitats, including rocky shores. However, experimental studies indicate that marine soft sediment communities do not function like this. In shallow-water sediments, competition is usually symmetric and relatively weak. Asymmetric competition that leads to the elimination of one species by another on time scales shorter than one generation is rare, apart from interactions that involve large-scale modification or disturbance of the sediment. Competition is therefore relatively unimportant as a process structuring communities and the impact of predation is usually to reduce rather than enhance diversity. These results have been largely ignored by the literature on deep-sea diversity. If deep-sea communities function in similar ways, coexistence of many species within small areas on short time scales does not need further explanation. We do, however, need to explain why abundances of all species remain bounded on large spatial scales and time scales of several generations. The model of diversity maintenance proposed by Huston (1979) and applied to the deep sea by Rex (1983) achieves this by implicit intra-specific, density-dependent processes that increase the population growth rate of species that have become locally rare. This would give robust maintenance of diversity, but there is no evidence for density dependence of this type in the deep sea, and nio plausible mechanisms by which it could occur. Alternative models require either spatial heterogeneity on a scale much larger than that envisaged by the grain-matching hypothesis or the placing of a cap on the abundance of common species, perhaps by frequency-dependent predation. Arbitrating between these possibilities will require assessments of the population dynamics and spatial distribution of individual species on spatial and temporal scales much greater than those usually considered in the deep sea.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Grant, A (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",a.grant@uea.ac.uk,"Grant, Alastair/L-7301-2018","Grant, Alastair/0000-0002-1147-2375",,,,97,19,21,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-9565,,,MAR ECOL-P S Z N I,Mar.

Using the barnacle-seaweed assemblage common in New England rocky intertidal habitats, I tested the hypothesis that species interactions switch from negative to positive at sites across the Cape Cod faunal barrier because of latitudinal variation in thermal stress and predation intensity between these regions. I manipulated Ascophyllum nodosum canopies in the high zone of two sites from each region and then determined the consequences for underlying Semibalanus balanoides recruits and adults for two years (January 1995 through January 1997). In both years, algal canopies reduced barnacle recruitment and growth rates at all sites but greatly increased survival rates only at the southern sites. When integrated in a demographic framework, these data showed that the reproductive fitness potential of individuals was facilitated by the algal canopy at southern sites but was reduced under similar conditions at northern sites. At southern sites, this was likely the result of buffering from physical stresses in the absence of predators. At northern sites, any buffering from physical stress was likely offset by an increase in mortality in the presence of predators. Interestingly. this variability in species interactions appealed to be associated with subtle variation in climate. Facilitation was evident only during 1995, the warmest year on record since 1900. In contrast, interactions were entirely negative during 1996, a slightly cooler year. These results suggest that species interactions in the intertidal zone may be sensitive to even subtle changes in climate. Interspecific buffering of neighbors from thermal stress is likely to be common in other systems and suggests that both aquatic and terrestrial vegetation may become increasingly important to local species persistence as climates change during the next century.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Leonard, GH (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Dept Sci Biol, Pacific Grove,Oceanview Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.",gleonard@leland.stanford.edu,,,,,,90,113,113,2,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,1015,1030,,,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500013,,,,,2021-09-21,

A conceptual framework is provided for dividing coexistence studies and concepts into three distinct time scales. The first six sections deal primarily with ecological-scale, or mesoscale coexistence, defined as coexistence in the classic sense of the competitive exclusion principle and Lotka-Volterra models, wherein interacting populations have had enough time to reach equilibrium. The first four sections briefly review resource partitioning studies and competitive coexistence models, and discuss the relative contributions of, and interaction between empirical and theoretical approaches to the problem of ecological-scale coexistence. The next two sections discuss the importance of biological trade-offs and the role of competition in structuring ecological communities. Based on compelling empirical evidence on both sides of the competition debate, a view of competition's role in structuring communities is proposed wherein the effects of competition are important but incomplete. The next section briefly reviews coexistence as it has been incorporated into habitat selection models, which represents coexistence at a finer time scale generated by the behavioral decisions of individual organisms. Linkages between this type of coexistence and mesoscale coexistence are discussed. Finally, a larger scale of coexistence is explored in which the assumptions of fixed niches, habitats, and species pools in communities are relaxed. This section links global and evolutionary species diversity literature to mesoscale ecological coexistence, focusing on the effects of ecosystem productivity and province size. Factors that govern diversity at large scales may be used to calibrate expectations and make predictions about mesoscale coexistence within particular communities. The study of diversity dynamics at geologic time scales suggests some sort of competitive saturation process, yet community dynamics on the scale of glacial oscillations often appear unsaturated and non-equilibrial. This provides additional support for the idea that competition has an important, but only partial structuring effect on biological communities. Because coexistence is affected by competitive as well as noncompetitive influences, both must be incorporated to develop accurate models, make useful predictions, and gain fuller understanding of the coexistence of species within ecological communities.","Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Gordon, CE (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",calebg@u.arizona.edu,,,,,,155,37,43,1,59,SOC BIOLGIA CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 16164, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,0717-6317,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

Our results indicate a strong negative relationship between neighboring plant density and such plant parameters as shoot and root biomass, and root neck diameter. The number of first order lateral roots and the number of lateral roots per unit of main root length were negatively related to the distance between neighboring plants.

Data were used to test predictions from a mechanistic model of resource partitioning developed from an earlier field experiment. 2, The charrs adopted one of two distinct foraging modes, ambushing drifting invertebrates from relatively fixed foraging positions or actively searching for benthic prey over large areas, The proportion of benthos foragers increased markedly when drifting prey declined, and was much greater in S. malma than S, leucomaenis when drift was lean, upholding predictions made from our earlier experiment. 3. For drift foragers of both species, frequency of foraging attempts decreased as drift rate declined, and aggressive encounters increased. In contrast, for benthos foragers of both species the frequency of foraging attempts was essentially constant across the range of benthos biomass measured, and aggressive encounters remained low. 4. Salvelinus leucomaenis ate larger drifting prey than S, malma, even though the former charr were smaller. In contrast, S, malma foraged on benthic prey at a higher rate than S, leucomaenis, although there was no difference in prey mass. Thus, the optimal point to shift to benthic foraging is at a higher drift threshold for S. malma than S, leucomaenis, most probably due to differences in jaw morphology. Moreover, because dominance for favourable drift foraging positions was based on size alone, S, malma shifted to benthos foraging at a larger size than S. leucomaenis, as predicted by a simple model. 5, Charr consumed distinct prey types according to their foraging mode. Drift foragers primarily ate terrestrial invertebrates, whereas benthos foragers ate mainly chironomid larvae. Consequently, diet overlap was high when drift was abundant and both species were drift foragers, but declined as drift declined and S. malma shifted to benthos foraging. Therefore, species-specific differences in foraging mode shifts across the resource gradient explained the flexible resource partitioning we observed, and probably account for the coexistence of these congeneric charrs in zones of sympatry in northern Japan.","Hokkaido Univ Forests, Tomakomai Res Stn, Tomakomai, Hokkaido 0530035, Japan; Colorado State Univ, Dept Fishery & Wildlife Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Hokkaido Univ, Res Inst N Pacific Fisheries, Hakodate, Hokkaido 041, Japan","Nakano, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",shige@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Fausch, Kurt D/A-8849-2010",,,,,63,150,156,1,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

During general flowering, which occurs at irregular intervals of 3-10 yr, nearly all dipterocarp species together with species of other families come heavily into Bower. We monitored reproductive phenology of 576 individual plants representing 305 species in 56 families in Sarawak, Malaysia. Observations continued for 53 mo from August 1992 and covered one episode of a general flowering cycle. Among 527 effective reproductive events during 43 mo, 57% were concentrated in the general flowering period (GFP) of 10 mo in 1996. We classified 257 species into flowering types based on timing and frequency of flowering, The most abundant type was general flowering (35%), which flowered only during GFP. The others were 'supra-annual (19%), annual (13%), and sub-annual (5%) types. General flowering type and temporal aggregation in reproductive events were commonly found among species in various categories of taxonomic groups, life forms, pollination systems, and fruit types. Possible causes for general flowering, such as promotion of pollination brought about by interspecific synchronization and paucity of climatic cues suitable for flowering trigger, are proposed, in addition to the predator satiation hypothesis of Janzen (1974).","Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Asian & African Area Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0628516, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Kyoto Univ Museum, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; Forest Res Ctr, Forest Dept Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, CREST, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan","Sakai, S (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, U0948, Apartado 2072, Balboa Ancon, Panama.",,"Nagamitsu, Teruyoshi/J-7710-2015; Yumoto, Takakazu/B-6215-2013; Nakashizuka, Tohru/AAO-1081-2020","Nagamitsu, Teruyoshi/0000-0003-3366-7197; Sakai, Shoko/0000-0002-4267-8405",,,,87,179,192,2,68,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,COLUMBUS,"OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA",0002-9122,,,AM J BOT,Am.

As the hot-dry season progressed and food presumably became less available, diets of the two antelopes diverged. Hartebeest maintained a high percentage of grass in their diet, but roan antelope switched from being predominantly grazers (>95% grass) to mixed feeders (<50% grass). As grass feeders, both antelopes have skeletal features that facilitate acquisition and grinding of highly fibrous diets, but 11 of 12, mass-relative indices of the skull morphology of hartebeest exceeded those of room antelope. Because of those differences in skull morphology, and in keeping with the long-faced hypothesis, hartebeest were apparently more capable than room antelope of acquiring and masticating scarce regrowth of perennial grasses when availability of forage was lowest.

Using morphological differences between sympatric species as evidence that competition promotes divergence (e.g., character displacement), has, in particular, drawn harsh criticism because morphological differences may have evolved during allopatry. In contrast to species, alternative phenotypes within a species have a common phylogenetic history, so differences between phenotypes are likely to result from ecological conditions experienced in sympatry. Using cannibal and typical larval phenotypes of the Arizona tiger salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum, we tested two predictions of the hypothesis that resource competition promotes morphological divergence: (1) larval phenotypes should reduce competition by using different resources; and (2) the advantage to developing the alternative, cannibal phenotype should be highest when competition among typical larvae is most intense. We used held surveys and a field experiment to test these predictions. The two larval phenotypes used different resources, especially when competition was intense. The advantage to individual larvae of becoming cannibals was highest when competition for resources among typical larvae was high. These results support the hypothesis that resource competition can promote morphological divergence.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TEMPE,AZ 85287",,,,,,,,43,39,41,0,6,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JUN,1997,51,3,,,,,898,905,,10.2307/2411164,,,8,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,XM065,WOS:A1997XM06500022,28568596,,,,2021-09-21,

The analysis of otter, eel and trout diets showed that this is unlikely. Trout was an unimportant prey item for otters, none were found in the stomachs of 13 large eels, and any predation was probably minimised by the low densities of these predators. Some competition was probably present because crabs occurred in the diets of otters (relative occurrence 41.9%), eels (63.2%) and trout (7.4%), but it was impossible to quantify. Since these predators shared the crab food resource, the guild concept provided the basis for an analysis of their potential competitive relationships. Comparisons between the sizes of crabs selected and those available suggested that resource partitioning was occurring. Trout selected small crabs from the invertebrate drift, and because they were restricted by their mouth gapes. Otters and large eels ate larger, more abundant crab sizes; it is proposed that they instead partition resources spatially by feeding in separate micro-habitats. Intraguild predation by otters on eels may benefit trout by reducing competition for aquatic insects.

We investigated the hypothesis that the duration of a habitat following disturbance mediates the relative importance of physical and biotic control. We combined detailed information on natural populations in a series of temporary ponds with small-scale experiments on specific processes. We compared data on presence/absence and abundance of taxa from temporary ponds showing a gradient of habitat duration with 3 simple models of community structure that incorporate random forces, life history adaptations, and biotic interactions, respectively. Different scales of resolution in describing community structure provide different emphases on which processes are important in these communities. The Life History Model explained patterns of presence/absence in the ponds, but not patterns of abundance of many taxa which best fit a model in which the importance of predation and competition in structuring communities increases with increasing duration. Experimental studies confirmed that the effect of predation and competition in temporary pond communities depends on habitat duration. Predation on all prey species examined increased with increasing pond duration. Predators were more diverse and more abundant in long-duration ponds where effects of their consumption on the abundance of prey taxa were greater than in shorter-duration ponds. Predators from long-duration ponds fed preferentially on prey taxa that predominate in shorter-duration habitats such as Aedes mosquitoes and the fairy shrimp Eubranchipus. Competition between Daphnia and rotifers occurred primarily in intermediate-duration ponds, where Daphnia at typical densities was capable of drastically reducing abundances of Keratella cochlearis in cultures.

This was therefore investigated by analysing the overlap in diets and habitat use between the mountain gorilla population and four other large mammalian herbivore populations. Expected niche overlap values were calculated from random simulations and showed that dietary overlap was unexpectedly low between most species' pairings. Predictions about the effects of competition on the Jive herbivores were produced by computer simulation of the plant-herbivore dynamics. These showed that elephants Loxodonta africana could have the most serious effect on the gorilla population. The other herbivores would appear to have little effect on the food supply. Consequently further increases in the buffalo population should cause little concern for the gorilla population. The conservation of the mountain gorilla is discussed in the light of these findings.","UNIV BRISTOL,DEPT ZOOL,BRISTOL BS8 1UG,AVON,ENGLAND",,,"Plumptre, Andrew J./X-3145-2019","Plumptre, Andrew J./0000-0002-9333-4047",,,,32,10,12,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0006-3207,,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

I performed two experiments in an early-successional site in two consecutive years. In the first experiment I tested the effects of litter and competition, and their interaction, on establishment and growth of tree seedlings. In the second experiment I studied the effect of insecticide application in combination with litter and herb competition on seedling establishment and growth, and on arthropod abundance. In the absence of competition, litter had no significant effect on the biomass of woody seedlings, though it delayed seedling emergence. Herb competition reduced the growth of the woody seedlings, but the addition of leaf litter reduced the density and biomass of the herbs, indirectly improving the growth of the woody seedlings. Litter increased both invertebrate damage to seedling cotyledons and seedling mortality. The application of insecticide increased seedling emergence and reduced seedling mortality, and more so in the presence of litter. The total number of arthropods and the number of plant-chewing arthropods were increased by the addition of litter and reduced by application of insecticide. Thus, litter had, simultaneously, a positive indirect effect on individual biomass through reduced competition, and a negative indirect effect on the number of individuals through increased seed and/or seedling predation, and a negative direct effect on seedling mortality.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,POB 1059,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855; NEW YORK BOT GARDEN,INST ECOSYST STUDIES,MARY FLAGLER CARY ARBORETUM,MILLBROOK,NY 12454",,,,"Facelli, Jose/0000-0002-0408-0082",,,,52,154,167,2,53,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,,,,,1727,1735,,10.2307/1939632,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,WOS:A1994PE26700020,,,,,2021-09-21,

This was done to test the hypothesis that the effects of interspecific competition would decline along gradients as the amount of nutrients decreased and the degree of disturbance increased. Nutrients and disturbance, alone and in interaction, produced significant effects on percent cover of all species, and all species achieved maximum percent cover in the undisturbed regime. The experimental design permitted us to distinguish between percent cover reductions caused directly by nutrients and disturbance from those caused by interspecific competition. When grown in mixture, interspecific competition produced marked changes in the distribution patterns of percent cover that were in addition to the direct impacts of nutrients and disturbance. The absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was greatest in the undisturbed regime, and for many mixtures this competitive effect was significantly reduced or even eliminated in the highly disturbed areas. Along the nutrient gradient the responses were variable and neighbor dependent, but for all species, the absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was generally most severe where percent cover in pure stands was highest. When the data were standardized for differences in percent cover in pure stands and competition was assessed as the percent reduction in percent cover between pure and mixed stands, then the effect of interspecific competition on Trifolium declined along both gradients. The three grasses had a reasonably constant competitive effect across the disturbance gradient, but along the nutrient gradient the highest competitive effects were generally achieved where percent cover in pure stands was highest. We argue that this standardized index is less appropriate because it obscures the obvious differences in interspecific competition effects that are clearly operating within these communities.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT FOREST SCI, VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4, BC, CANADA","TURKINGTON, R (corresponding author), UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT BOT, VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4, BC, CANADA.",,,,,,,41,88,89,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1993,74,3,,,,,863,878,,10.2307/1940812,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KU399,WOS:A1993KU39900020,,,,,2021-09-21,

As a strong test of the prevailing generalization that competition plays a relatively trivial role among suspension-feeding invertebrates in the soft sediments on the estuarine seafloor, we manipulated local densities of bivalves, two species of Katelysia, in a Western Australia lagoon, characterized by exceptionally high bivalve abundances (averaging 157 m-2). 2. Competition appeared weakly and sporadically, evident in only one of five intervals, when survivorship was 20-30% lower, production of undamaged empty shells 3-5 times higher, and average growth of survivors 50% lower for both Katelysia scalarina Lamarck and Katelysia rhytiphora Lamarck in the highest density treatment (320 m-2) than in the others (20-160 m-2). 3. Surprisingly, during both winter-spring intervals survivorship was also 25% lower at the lowest density for both species. The type of mortality was one that resulted in disappearance of the empty shell. Addition of sufficient numbers of sham clams, dead shells filled with sand and implanted in living position in the sediments, acted to prevent the enhancement of mortality at low density. This demonstration of the importance of a structural barrier implies that the agent of mortality at low density is a predator. Sampling error, emigration and post-mortem transport by scavengers can be ruled out by results of direct tests. 4. In a caging experiment, the predatory seastar Coscinasterias calamaria (Gray) replicated the pattern of enhanced predation rate on Katelysia of both species at low density. This represents a candidate for the unknown predator that was deterred by the structural barrier created by crowding of shells. A demersal fish is an alternative candidate. 5. Contrary to previous data for suspension feeders in estuarine soft sediments, which commonly show negative effects of adults on local recruitment of young, recruitment of K. scalarina was greater around higher densities of adult bivalves in one of two tests. Survivorship of recruits did not vary with adult density, suggesting that the recruitment pattern may have resulted from gregarious larval settlement around adults rather than from differences in early post-settlement survivorship. 6. Evolution and expression of gregarious settlement may be a reasonable expectation, given the sporadic and small penalties of competition, and the large and repeated benefits of mutual defences at high density. More broadly, positive interactions such as commensalism, mutualism and facilitation might be expected to be more prevalent in systems like the soft-sediment benthos where competition is so ineffective and relatively unimportant.","UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA, DEPT ZOOL, NEDLANDS, WA 6009, AUSTRALIA","PETERSON, CH (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012; Black, Robert/F-5312-2013","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Black, William/0000-0001-6839-8674",,,,64,57,59,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We conducted an extensive literature review, focusing on 120 wolf diet studies worldwide to assess global patterns of carnivore consumption by wolves and their ecological and human-related determinants. We used a total of 143 sampling sites with data on the consumption of carnivores by wolves. In total, 35 carnivore species were reported to be consumed by wolves, comprising members of all taxonomic carnivore families represented within the gray wolf range. The carnivores were mostly limited to occasional consumption (<5% of wolf diet) but could account for as much as 25% in some study areas. The most frequently consumed carnivore species were those with reported scavenging behavior, belonging to medium-sized generalist canids. Generalized linear model (GLM) analysis revealed that higher magnitudes of carnivore consumption were related to nonprotected areas as well as lower occurrences of wild ungulates, domestic ungulates, and small mammals in wolf diet, while higher numbers of consumed carnivore species were related to nonprotected areas with low vegetation productivity and lower occurrences of domestic ungulates and small mammals in wolf diet. Our results suggest that carnivore consumption by wolves is driven by altered ecosystems and human-dominated landscapes, where mesopredator densities are often increased and prey densities decreased, which intensify competition and the need for alternative food sources.","[Martins, Ines; Mota, Paulo G.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Ciencias Vida, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal; [Krofel, Miha] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Forestry, Vecna Pot 83, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Mota, Paulo G.; Alvares, Francisco] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal","Alvares, F (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.",inesmartinsdb@gmail.com; miha.krofel@gmail.com; pgmota@uc.pt; falvares@cibio.up.pt,"Alvares, Francisco/K-6353-2013","Alvares, Francisco/0000-0002-4033-6989; Krofel, Miha/0000-0002-2010-5219",Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P4-0059],We thank Fernando Martinez-Freiria for helping in GIS and modeling procedures.

Because the vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning are tightly linked, realistic projections of peatland response to climate change require the inclusion of vegetation dynamics in ecosystem models. In peatlands, Sphagnum mosses are key engineers. Moss community composition primarily follows habitat moisture conditions. The known species habitat preference along the prevailing moisture gradient might not directly serve as a reliable predictor for future species compositions, as water table fluctuation is likely to increase. Hence, modelling the mechanisms that control the habitat preference of Sphagna is a good first step for modelling community dynamics in peatlands. In this study, we developed the Peatland Moss Simulator (PMS), which simulates the community dynamics of the peatland moss layer. PMS is a process-based model that employs a stochastic, individual-based approach for simulating competition within the peatland moss layer based on species differences in functional traits. At the shoot-level, growth and competition were driven by net photosynthesis, which was regulated by hydrological processes via the capitulum water content. The model was tested by predicting the habitat preferences of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum fallax - two key species representing dry (hummock) and wet (lawn) habitats in a poor fen peatland (Lakkasuo, Finland). PMS successfully captured the habitat preferences of the two Sphagnum species based on observed variations in trait properties. Our model simulation further showed that the validity of PMS depended on the interspecific differences in the capitulum water content being correctly specified. Neglecting the water content differences led to the failure of PMS to predict the habitat preferences of the species in stochastic simulations. Our work highlights the importance of the capitulum water content with respect to the dynamics and carbon functioning of Sphagnum communities in peatland ecosystems. Thus, studies of peatland responses to changing environmental conditions need to include capitulum water processes as a control on moss community dynamics. Our PMS model could be used as an elemental design for the future development of dynamic vegetation models for peatland ecosystems.","[Gong, Jinnan; Frolking, Steve; Peltola, Heli; Laine, Anna M.; Kokkonen, Nicola; Tuittila, Eeva-Stiina] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland; [Roulet, Nigel] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall,805 Sherbrooke St West Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Roulet, Nigel] Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Burnside Hall,805 Sherbrooke St West Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Frolking, Steve] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Frolking, Steve] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Earth Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Laine, Anna M.] Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol & Genet, POB 3000, Oulu 90014, Finland","Tuittila, ES (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland.",eeva-stiina.tuittila@uef.fi,"Tuittila, Eeva-Stiina/AAR-1211-2021","Tuittila, Eeva-Stiina/0000-0001-8861-3167; Roulet, Nigel/0000-0001-9571-1929; Laine-Petajakangas, Anna Maria/0000-0003-2989-1591",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [287039]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1802825]; Kone Foundation; Fulbright-Saastamoinen Foundation,"This research has been supported by the Academy of Finland (project no. 287039), the US National Science Foundation (grant no. 1802825), the Kone Foundation, and the Fulbright-Saastamoinen Foundation.",,105,3,3,4,6,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,NOV 23,2020,17,22,,,,,5693,5719,,10.5194/bg-17-5693-2020,,,27,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,OW6QJ,WOS:000593008500002,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

We compared the activity times, perch microhabitat characteristics, and diet of these insectivorous lizards to test the prediction that they partition resources. Although we found no difference between the two species in the time at which lizards become active in the morning nor in the composition of their diets, the two species used different structural perch microhabitats. The Ornate Tree Lizard selected higher and narrower perches with more closed canopy than the Striped Plateau Lizard, and males generally occupied higher perches than females. These differences in perch microhabitat use may reduce interspecific competition and allow these two sympatric species to cohabitate.","[Bergeron, Rachel; Blouin-Demers, Gabriel] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Bergeron, R (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, 30 Marie Curie Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",rberg079@gmail.com,,,University of Ottawa; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We are grateful to Alannah Lymburner and Nicolas Ouellette for help with data collection.

We explored density-dependent fitness attributes and carry-over effects in Crawfish Frogs (Rana areolata) using a set of field enclosure experiments and a series of field data. Using field enclosures, we hypothesized that 1) at high densities, intraspecific competition would produce smaller Crawfish Frog juveniles that took longer to metamorphose; 2) at high densities, interspecific competition would also produce smaller Crawfish Frog juveniles that took longer to metamorphose; and 3) vertebrate (ambystomatid salamander) predation on Crawfish Frog larvae would reduce survivorship, but by releasing competition pressure would produce relatively larger tadpoles that metamorphosed earlier. Further, we hypothesized 4) that these enclosure results would apply to field data, and that fitness attributes in newly metamorphosed Crawfish Frogs would carry over to first-time breeding adults. Our results confirmed all four hypotheses. Specifically, in Crawfish Frogs, at high densities, both intra- and interspecific competition reduced size (length and mass) at metamorphosis (hypotheses 1 and 2), and predation reduced survivorship and increased size at metamorphosis (hypothesis 3). Finally, we observed density-dependent fitness effects on newly metamorphosed Crawfish Frog juvenile size (length and mass), and carry-over effects from the larval stage on juvenile survival, adult size, and breeding adult numbers (hypothesis 4). In the absence of predators, high densities of intra- and interspecific competitors had no effect on Crawfish Frog larval survivorship. We also present suggestive evidence for compensatory effects. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the patterns of these interactions, as well as the role of these relationships in informing management guidelines intended to ensure the future of this species of conservation concern.","[Stiles, Rochelle M.] San Francisco Zool Soc, 1 Zoo Rd, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Terrell, Vanessa C.

The number of natural enemies that should be introduced to control a pest is a controversial subject in biocontrol. A previous semi-mechanistic model parameterised using a laboratory system consisting of two parasitoid wasps,Anisopteromalus calandraeandHeterospilus prosopidis, parasitising a pest beetle,Callosobruchus chinensis, indicated that the introduction of the non-native parasitoidH. prosopidisdecreases the level of intraspecific interference between nativeA. calandraefemales.The model also suggested that this decrease was the main factor destabilising the population dynamics of the host-parasitoid system, resulting in chaos. 2. To test this population-level decrease and host density independence in the interference ofA. calandrae, we observed individual behaviours to quantify the level of intraspecific interference between twoA. calandraefemales in the presence or absence ofH. prosopidisat two different host densities. 3. WhenH. prosopidiswas present, the number of direct antagonistic interference events betweenA. calandraefemales, sting duration, host feeding events (but not stinging events), and patch residence time were reduced. However, the presence ofH. prosopidisdecreased the patch residence time and the proportion of hosts parasitised byA. calandraeonly when the host density was low. 4. The reduction in intraspecific interference betweenA. calandraefemales byH. prosopidisand its host density independence support the population-level prediction, whereas the observed reduction in host-feeding behaviours inA. calandraebyH. prosopidiswas not predicted. Overall pest control by the native parasitoid was unaffected by the non-native parasitoid as host density increased.","[Nakamichi, Yasufumi] Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Fukuoka, Japan; [Nakamichi, Yasufumi] Natl Inst Mat Sci NIMS, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Tuda, Midori] Kyushu Univ, Inst Biol Control, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Japan; [Tuda, Midori] Kyushu Univ, Dept Bioresource Sci, Lab Insect Nat Enemies, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Japan; [Wajnberg, Eric] INRAE, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Wajnberg, Eric] INRIA, Projet Hephaistos, Sophia Antipolis, France","Tuda, M (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Inst Biol Control, Lab Insect Nat Enemies, Fac Agr, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",tuda@grt.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17H04612, 19K06840]","This study was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI grants (17H04612, 19K06840) to MT.

The Pacific oyster has, however, established populations on the west coast of the Istria peninsula, in the northeast Adriatic Sea. Current distribution, abundance and size structure of the flat and Pacific oysters were studied there along spatial and depth gradients in natural and artificial habitats to assess their potential for coexistence. This is the first quantitative assessment of native and non-native oyster populations on a Mediterranean-wide scale providing a baseline for determining future changes in their distribution. Both species were omnipresent, with the Pacific oyster displaying a more pronounced variability in abundance and size in relation to survey regions and depths. The population density of flat oysters was low, generally less than 1 individual/m(2), with no difference among regions. The density of the Pacific oyster was significantly higher, being on average 5 individuals/m(2). Dense, reef-forming aggregations of Pacific oysters were contained in Lim Bay, a nationally-important shellfish aquaculture area, where its mean density was 107 individuals/m(2). Along the open coastline its densities were considerably lower and followed a latitudinal gradient. The observed abundance and size distribution patterns of the Pacific oyster suggest that Lim Bay was the introduction point, with feral settlement likely originating from short-lived experimental aquaculture trials and subsequently dispersing by prevailing local currents. The flat oysters were larger in size and settled at different depths compared to the Pacific oysters. The vertical range of Pacific oysters was mostly contained in the tidal zone, while flat oysters were present in the subtidal exclusively. Such spatial partitioning likely resulted from introduced oysters occupying a vacant ecological niche and not due to interspecific competitive exclusion. Habitat type had a strong effect on proliferation of Pacific oysters. Artificial hard substrata harboured more abundant and larger Pacific oysters than the natural rocky shore habitat. The possibility of multiple local introduction pathways in ports and marinas is also discussed. Currently, there seems to be no spatial competition between the two oyster species, but as it is hard to predict future possible impacts of non-native species, we strongly suggest regular monitoring of the Pacific oyster, prioritising sensitive and protected areas as well as areas at the edge of its distribution.","[Staglicic, Nika; Segvic-Bubic, Tanja; Ezgeta-Balic, Daria; Varezic, Dubravka Bojanic; Grubisic, Leon; Zuvic, Luka] Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, Setaliste Ivana Mestrovica 63, Split 21000, Croatia; [Lin, Yaping; Briski, Elizabeta] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dustembrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Lin, Yaping] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, 18 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China","Segvic-Bubic, T (corresponding author), Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, Setaliste Ivana Mestrovica 63, Split 21000, Croatia.",tsegvic@izor.hr,"Briski, Elizabeta/A-7910-2015; Bubic, Tanja Segvic/O-6841-2016; Balic, Daria Ezgeta/G-9440-2017","Bubic, Tanja Segvic/0000-0003-4405-1611; Balic, Daria Ezgeta/0000-0003-0763-3647; Bojanic Varezic, Dubravka/0000-0002-9733-9427","Unity through Knowledge Fund (UKF) project Competition between native Ostrea edulis and invasive Crassostrea gigas oysters in the Adriatic Sea - effects on the ecosystem, fisheries and aquaculture (COCOA) under UKF [2/17]; Alexander von Humboldt Sofja Kovalevskaja AwardAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","This work was fully supported by the Unity through Knowledge Fund (UKF) project Competition between native Ostrea edulis and invasive Crassostrea gigas oysters in the Adriatic Sea - effects on the ecosystem, fisheries and aquaculture (COCOA) under UKF Grant Agreement no. 2/17.

Temporal avoidance of interspecific aggression can enable access to resources without spatial exclusion. Apex predators, including humans, can affect mesopredator activity patterns. Human context might also modify temporal interactions between predators. We explored activity patterns, nocturnality and the effects of human activity upon a guild of carnivores (grey wolf, Canis lupus; Eurasian lynx, Lynx lynx; red fox, Vulpes vulpes) using travel routes in Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia. Humans were diurnal, foxes nocturnal and large carnivores active during the night, immediately after sunrise and before sunset. Carnivore activity patterns overlapped greatly and to a similar extent for all pairings. Activity curves followed expectations based on interspecific killing, with activity peaks coinciding where body size differences were small (wolf and lynx) but not when they were intermediate (foxes to large carnivores). Carnivore activity, particularly fox, overlapped much less with that of diurnal humans. Foxes responded to higher large carnivore activity by being more nocturnal. Low light levels likely provide safer conditions by reducing the visual detectability of mesopredators. The nocturnal effect of large carnivores was however moderated and reduced by human activity. This could perhaps be due to temporal shielding or interference with risk cues. Subtle temporal avoidance and nocturnality may enable mesopredators to cope with interspecific aggression at shared spatial resources. Higher human activity moderated the effects of top-down temporal suppression which could consequently affect the trophic interactions of mesopredators.Significance statementTemporal partitioning can provide an important mechanism for spatial resource access and species coexistence. Our findings show that carnivores partition the use of shared travel routes in time, using the cover of darkness to travel safely where their suppressors (large carnivores) are more active. We however observed fox nocturnality to be flexible, with responses depending on the activity levels but also the composition of apex predators. High human activity modified the top-down temporal suppression of mesopredators by large carnivores. The use of time by predators can have demographic and trophic consequences. Prey accessibility and susceptibility can be temporally variable. As such, the ecosystem services and the ecological roles of predators may be affected by human time use as well as that of intraguild competitors. Temporal interactions should not be overlooked when evaluating human use and conservation priorities in protected areas.","[Haswell, Peter M.; Jones, Katherine A.; Hayward, Matt W.] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Kusak, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Vet Fac, Dept Biol, Heinzelova 55, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Hayward, Matt W.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Hayward, Matt W.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Hayward, Matt W.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, Pretoria, South Africa","Haswell, PM (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",p.m.haswell@bangor.ac.uk,"Hayward, Matt W./F-3569-2010; Haswell, Peter/AAL-9477-2021","Hayward, Matt W./0000-0002-5574-1653; Haswell, Peter/0000-0002-3440-739X; Kusak, Josip/0000-0002-5544-6486; Jones, Katherine/0000-0001-7547-6781",Bernd Thies Foundation; UK Wolf Conservation Trust; Coalbourn Charitable Trust; Nacionalni Park Plitvicka Jezera (Plitvice Lakes National Park); Ann Vernon Memorial Travel Fund; Sir Ian McKellen; EuroNatur; Bangor University,"This work received funding from Nacionalni Park Plitvicka Jezera (Plitvice Lakes National Park), The Bernd Thies Foundation, EuroNatur, Bangor University, The UK Wolf Conservation Trust, The Coalbourn Charitable Trust, Ann Vernon Memorial Travel Fund and Sir Ian McKellen.",,87,3,3,2,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Crabs reaching a site of a recent predatory event may not only find the shell empty but also encounter a predator. The attendance at sites where gastropods are decomposing may be less risky, but the use of these shells will depend on the crab's ability to extract the flesh. We tested the responses of two coexisting species of hermit crabs to chemical cues of potential empty shells at different levels of predatory risk and constraints to occupy it. The crabs were exposed in a Y-maze to chemical odors simulating gastropods in decomposition vs. a control, freshly predated gastropods vs. control, and gastropods in decomposition vs. predated gastropods. We also tested the ability of each species to extract the flesh of a dead snail. Contrary to expectation, individuals of both species avoided the two odors of shells. When the crabs were presented with the two chemical cues, Calcinus californiensis approached more to odors from gastropods in decomposition, whereas Clibanarius albidigitus approached more to odors from predated snails. The behavioral response of C. californiensis agrees with its greater ability to extract the flesh, which may allow it to obtain a new shell at relatively low risk. The lower ability of C. albidigitus to remove the flesh matches its preference for cues of predated gastropods rather than decomposed gastropods. Our results show that the flesh of gastropods needs not to he an obstacle to the use of their shells. The exploitation strategy sets the resource partitioning in these hermit crabs. The ability to remove the flesh, feed on dead gastropods, and occupy the shell makes hermit crabs exceptional as they exploit a limited resource as refuge and food.","[Alcaraz, Guillermina; Kruesi, Karla] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico; [Burciaga, Luis M.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico","Alcaraz, G (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico.",alcaraz@ciencias.unam.mx,,,"Posgrado en Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia, UNAMUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)","We thank Sebastian Zuniga for his technical assistance.

In eastern deciduous forests of the United States, a single ant genus (Aphaenogaster) appears ecologically dominant with high abundance and opportunistic foraging. However, Aphaenogaster ants are not particularly behaviorally aggressive toward co-occurring ants, making it unclear as to how they might sustain dominance. We offered myrmecochorous seeds and termite carrion at bait stations and quantified ant aggression, food selection and recruitment. We conducted the experiments throughout the natural seed-release window to determine how the abundance of low- and high-quality food items impacted behavior. We found evidence that Aphaenogaster ants dominate the retrieval of both seeds and insect carrion (dead termites). Aphaenogaster foraging dominance did not appear driven by superior fighting or recruitment abilities but simply by having more foragers on the ground, essentially achieving control of different types of food resources through numerical dominance. Moreover, though they are the dominant effective seed dispersers in the system, A. picea exhibited a much greater affinity for termites than seeds, and the desirability of termites decreased in the presence of seeds. Overall, our results suggest that high numbers of foragers-as opposed to aggressive territoriality-can be an effective ecological strategy for sustaining ecological dominance through resource acquisition.","[Warren, R.

Despite evidence that population recovery after large-scale disturbances in terrestrial habitats varies substantially among species depending on species traits and types of disturbance, little is known about interspecific differences in population recovery in marine habitats. In this study, we evaluated the course and status of recovery of the vertical distribution of nine intertidal sessile species over 6 years following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. First, we characterized temporal changes in the vertical position of zonation as the spatial distribution, and total coverage as the local population size after the 2011 earthquake. Then, we evaluated the differences in successional status that explain interspecific differences in zonation recovery speed. Finally, we revealed that temporal changes in the vertical position and abundance after the earthquake differed according to species. The interspecific differences in the speed of recovery of zonation after 2014 were correlated with successional status, with later successional species having a delayed recovery rate. These results indicated that intertidal sessile assemblages continued to change 6 years after the large earthquake, suggesting that evaluations of the impacts of disturbances on assemblages and the course of community recovery require long periods of time.","[Kanamori, Yuki; Iwasaki, Aiko; Noda, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Kanamori, Yuki; Iwasaki, Aiko; Oda, Sayaka] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","Kanamori, Y (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Kita Ku, N10W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",kana.yuki@fra.affrc.go.jp,"Noda, Takashi/I-4895-2016","Noda, Takashi/0000-0001-9709-8945; Kanamori, Yuki/0000-0003-2784-4521",,,,57,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

In this study, to overcome this difficulty, we combine traditional correlation analysis with a novel framework of nonlinear time series analysis, empirical dynamic modeling (EDM). The EDM is an analytical framework to identify causal relationships and measure changing interaction strength from time series. We apply this approach to time series of sympatric foliage-feeding forest Lepidoptera species in the Slovak Republic and yearly mean temperature, precipitation and North Atlantic Oscillation Index. These Lepidoptera species include both free-feeding and leaf-roller larval life histories: the former are hypothesized to be more strongly affected by similar exogenous environments, while the latter are isolated from such pressures. Correlation analysis showed that interspecific synchrony is generally strongest between species within same feeding guild. In addition, the convergent cross mapping analysis detected causal effects of meteorological factors on most of the free-feeding species while such effects were not observed in the leaf-rolling species. However, there were fewer causal relationships among species. The multivariate S-map analysis showed that meteorological factors tend to affect similar free-feeding species that are synchronous with each other. These results indicate that shared meteorological factors are key drivers of interspecific synchrony among members of the free-feeding guild, but do not play the same role in synchronizing species within the leaf-roller guild.","[Kawatsu, Kazutaka] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Yamanaka, Takehiko] NARO NIAES, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Patoeka, Jan; Liebhold, Andrew M.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Liebhold, Andrew M.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Northeastern Res Stn, Morgantown, WV USA","Kawatsu, K (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",kazutakawatsu@gmail.com,"Kawtasu, Kazutaka/B-1066-2010","Kawtasu, Kazutaka/0000-0003-4447-4761","Operational Programme Research, Development and Education [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15H04613, 18K14797, 16K18625, 16H04846]","Operational Programme Research, Development and Education, Grant/Award Number: CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803; JSPS KAKENHI, Grant/Award Numbers: 15H04613, 18K14797, 16K18625, 16H04846",,35,1,1,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

Our aim was to reveal, whether the interactions between Populus purdomii Rehder and Salix rehderiana Schneider switch from positive to negative during the early stages of primary succession in the Gongga Mountain glacier retreat region. We also investigated, whether soil age is a major driving factor for the transformation of interactions between neighboring plants. We analyzed differences between intraspecific interactions and interspecific interactions of Populus and Salix under 20- and 40-year-old soil conditions, including plant biomass accumulation and allocation, nutrient absorption and utilization, relative competition intensity, non-structural carbohydrates, foliar carbon and nitrogen isotope composition, mesophyll cell ultrastructure, soil microbial biomass and community structure, extracellular enzyme activities, and soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), soil ammonium (NH4+-N), and soil nitrate (NO3--N) contents. We found that P. purdomii and S. rehderiana growing under interspecific interactions had greater contents of aboveground dry matter, belowground dry matter and total dry matter compared to intraspecific interactions in 20-year-old soil. Furthermore, in 40-year-old soil conditions, the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis showed that Populus and Salix exposed to interspecific interactions exhibited lower amounts of gram-positive bacteria, fungi (18,1 omega 9c) and actinomycetes, and lower levels of total PLFAs than those growing under intraspecific interactions. The redundancy analysis (RDA) results demonstrated that soil N was the most important parameter contributing to the composition of microbial communities. In addition, the N-15 stable isotope labeling method showed that Populus and Salix growing under interspecific interactions had higher foliage delta N-15 derived from NO3- (delta N-15-NO3-) than those growing under intraspecific interactions in 20-year-old soil. In summary, our results demonstrated that Populus-Salix interactions exhibited positive effects on survival in 20-year-old soil. Conversely, under 40-year-old soil conditions, Populus-Salix interactions presented negative effects in relation to nutrients and elimination by neighboring plants. Moreover, soil age is a major driving factor for plant-plant interactions that shift from positive to negative with an increasing soil age in the Gongga Mountain glacier forefield. In all, our results support the stress gradient hypothesis. Our findings improve understanding of plant-plant interactions and plant-soil feedbacks during the early stages of soil development, and of the construction of vegetation communities.","[Song, Mengya] Henan Univ, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Coll Environm & Planning, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Lei; Jiang, Yonglei; Li, Chunyang] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Korpelainen, Helena] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Viikki Plant Sci Ctr, POB 2Z, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Li, CY (corresponding author), Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",licy@hznu.edu.cn,"Song, Mengya/AAQ-3494-2020; Li, Chunyang/D-6254-2013","Song, Mengya/0000-0003-4272-6857; Korpelainen, Helena/0000-0002-7046-6995",Talent Program of the Hangzhou Normal University [2016QDL020],This work was supported by the Talent Program of the Hangzhou Normal University (2016QDL020).

To assess the link between prey availability and dental attrition, we documented dental fracture rates over decades among three well-studied populations of extant gray wolves that differed in prey:predator ratio and levels of carcass utilization. When prey:predator ratios declined, kills were more fully consumed, and rates of tooth fracture more than doubled. This supports tooth fracture frequency as a relative measure of the difficulty of acquiring prey, and reveals a rapid response to diminished food levels in large carnivores despite risks of infection and reduced fitness due to dental injuries. More broadly, large carnivore tooth fracture frequency likely reflects energetic stress, an aspect of predator success that is challenging to quantify in wild populations.","[Van Valkenburgh, Blaire] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Peterson, Rolf O.; Vucetich, John A.] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Smith, Douglas W.; Stahler, Daniel R.] Natl Pk Serv, Yellowstone Ctr Resources, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA","Van Valkenburgh, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",bvanval@ucla.edu,,"VanValkenburgh, Blaire/0000-0002-9935-4719","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SGP-1237928, P16AC00004, NIFA-1014575, DEB-1245373, DEB-1453041]","National Science Foundation SGP-1237928 Blaire Van Valkenburgh; Isle Royale National Park P16AC00004 John A Vucetich; U.S. Department of Agriculture NIFA-1014575 John A Vucetich; National Science Foundation DEB-1245373 Rolf O Peterson; National Science Foundation DEB-1453041 Douglas W Smith Daniel R Stahler John A Vucetich; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,33,7,7,1,12,ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,SEP 24,2019,8,,,,,,,,e48628,10.7554/eLife.48628,,,15,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,JA3RZ,WOS:000487744300001,31549963,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Such species are expected to display community drift dynamics analogous to neutral alleles undergoing genetic drift. While entire communities of species are not ecologically equivalent, recent field experiments have documented the existence of guilds of such neutral species embedded in real food webs. What demographic outcomes of the interactions within and between species in these guilds are expected to produce ecological drift versus coexistence remains unclear. To address this issue, and guide empirical testing, we consider models of a guild of ecologically equivalent competitors feeding on a single resource to explore when community drift should manifest. We show that community drift dynamics only emerge when the density-dependent effects of each species on itself are identical to its density-dependent effects on every other guild member. In contrast, if each guild member directly limits itself more than it limits the abundance of other guild members, all species in the guild are coexisting, even though they all are ecologically equivalent with respect to their interactions with species outside the guild (i.e. resources, predators, mutualists). Hence, considering only interspecific ecological differences generating density dependence, and not fully accounting for the preponderance of mechanisms causing intraspecific density dependence, will provide an incomplete picture for segregating between neutrality and coexistence. We also identify critical experiments necessary to disentangle guilds of ecologically equivalent species from those experiencing ecological drift, as well as provide an overview of ways of incorporating a mechanistic basis into studies of species coexistence and neutrality. Identifying these characteristics, and the mechanistic basis underlying community structure, is not merely an exercise in clarifying the semantics of coexistence and neutral theories, but rather reflects key differences that must exist among community members in order to determine how and why communities are structured.","[McPeek, Mark A.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",mark.mcpeek@dartmouth.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021","McPeek, Mark/0000-0001-7794-9466",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1748945],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1748945",,71,8,8,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Core processes operating at local scales, such as species-environment matching and species interactions, shape observed assemblages. Artificial habitats (simplified structure) are useful systems for assessing the main factors affecting community composition and disentangling their assembly rules. Drinking troughs (brickwork tanks for free-ranging cattle watering) are widespread in Italy and represent a suitable aquatic habitat for colonization by various aquatic organisms. Dragonflies larvae are usually found in drinking troughs and often exhibit strong species interactions and striking community assembly patterns. Our primary aim was to search for Odonata communities exhibiting non-random cooccurrence/segregation patterns in drinking troughs. We performed null-model analyses by measuring a co-occurrence index (C-score) on larval Odonata assemblages (13 species from 28 distinct troughs). Overall, we found a non-random structure for the studied dragonfly assemblages, which, given their fast generation time, must have been generated by short-term ecological processes (i.e. interspecific interactions). We thus analyzed potential competition/predation among and within ecological guilds. From the field data, we speculated that interactions within the sprawlers' guild is likely among the main drivers structuring the studied assemblages, especially the effect of intraguild predation between C. erythraea and Sympetrum spp larval stages. We then experimentally tested these interactions in laboratory and demonstrated that intraguild predation among larvae at different development stages may result in an effective exclusion/negative impact on density pattern, representing one of the processes to take into consideration when studying dragonfly assemblages.","[Cerini, Francesco; Bologna, Marco A.; Vignoli, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale G Marconi, Rome, Italy","Vignoli, L (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale G Marconi, Rome, Italy.",leonardo.vignoli@uniroma3.it,"Vignoli, Leonardo/F-2663-2011; Cerini, Francesco/AAO-8613-2020","Vignoli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1599-092X; Cerini, Francesco/0000-0002-1367-1239","Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza) [COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016]","The Grant to the Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza, ARTICOLO 1, COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016) is gratefully acknowledged.",,42,8,8,1,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 21,2019,14,6,,,,,,,e0214127,10.1371/journal.pone.0214127,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,IW3PT,WOS:000484894700003,31226119,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

These changes have been linked to environmental factors directly influencing annual recruitment and growth. The role of climate change in affecting the composition of plankton has also been suggested to explain declines in SPF, while other causes could be the recovery of predators, competition with other pelagic organisms that prey on early life phases of SPF (i.e. gelatinous zooplankton), interspecific competition for food, or impacts from fisheries harvest. To test the role of these potential pressures, we developed qualitative mathematical models of a NW Mediterranean pelagic food web. We used analyses of sign directed graphs and Bayesian belief networks to compare alternative hypotheses about how SPF species may have responded to combinations of different pressures. Data documenting changes in SPF populations were used to test predicted directions of change from signed digraph models. An increase in sea surface temperature (SST) that had either a positive impact on round sardinella or on gelatinous zooplankton abundance was the pressure that alone provided the most plausible insights into observed changes. A combination of various pressures, including an increase in SST, an increase of exploitation and changes to zooplankton also delivered results matching current observations. Predators of SPF were identified as the most informative monitoring variable to discern between likely causes of perturbations to populations of SPF.","[Coll, Marta; Albo-Puigserver, Marta; Navarro, Joan; Palomera, Isabel] CSIC, ICM, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Dambacher, Jeffrey M.] CSIRO, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia","Coll, M (corresponding author), CSIC, ICM, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",mcoll@icm.csic.es,"Puigserver, Marta Albo/AAP-5800-2020; Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009; Coll, Marta/A-9488-2012","Puigserver, Marta Albo/0000-0002-0477-5984; Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543; Coll, Marta/0000-0001-6235-5868",ECOTRANS (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity) [CTM2011-26333]; SafeNET (EU-DGMARE) project [MARE/2014/41]; PELWEB project [ES-PN-2017-CTM2017-88939-R]; Spanish governmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission; Spanish National Program Ramon y CajalGerman Research Foundation (DFG),"This study was funded by the ECOTRANS (CTM2011-26333; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity), SafeNET (EU-DGMARE MARE/2014/41) and PELWEB (ES-PN-2017-CTM2017-88939-R) projects.

Studies of these relationships, however, often assume static environmental conditions, and rarely consider effects of competition with ecologically similar species. In many parts of their shared ranges, grizzly bears Ursus arctos and American black bears U. americanus have nearly complete dietary overlap and share similar life history traits. We therefore tested the hypothesis that density patterns of both bear species would reflect seasonal variation in available resources, with areas of higher primary productivity supporting higher densities of both species. We also hypothesized that interspecific competition would influence seasonal density patterns. Specifically, we predicted that grizzly bear density would be locally reduced due to the ability of black bears to more efficiently exploit patchy food resources such as seasonally abundant fruits. To test our hypotheses, we used detections of 309 grizzly and 597 black bears from two independent genetic sampling methods in spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models. Our results suggest grizzly bear density was lower in areas of high black bear density during spring and summer, although intraspecific densities were also important, particularly during the breeding season. Black bears had lower densities in areas of high grizzly bear density in spring; however, density of black bears in early and late summer was best explained by primary productivity. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that smaller-bodied, more abundant black bears may influence the density patterns of behaviorally-dominant grizzly bears through exploitative competition. We also suggest that seasonal variation in resource availability be considered in efforts to relate environmental conditions to animal density.","[Stetz, Jeffrey B.] Sinopah Wildlife Res Associates, Missoula, MT 59802 USA; [Stetz, Jeffrey B.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Mitchell, Michael S.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Kendall, Katherine C.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, Glacier Field Stn, Glacier Natl Pk, West Glacier, MT USA","Stetz, JB (corresponding author), Sinopah Wildlife Res Associates, Missoula, MT 59802 USA.; Stetz, JB (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",jeff.stetz@gmail.com,,"Stetz, Jeff/0000-0003-2876-6895","United States Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; United States Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; U.S. Geological Survey - Park Oriented Biological Science Program; U.S. Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Montana Dept of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks","Principal funding for the grizzly and black bear data collection was provided by the United States Geological Survey and United States Forest Service via U.S. Congressional appropriations.

For sympatric species, convergence of head morphology can indicate similar prey or foraging strategies while divergence can suggest competition, resource partitioning or expansion into new habitats. Sexual dimorphism can further complicate the head morphology-diet relationship by potentially reducing intraspecific competition. To understand the relationship between head morphology and diet, we studied three sympatric species, the plain-bellied (Nerodia erythrogaster), diamondback (N. rhombifer), and northern (N. sipedon) watersnakes in western Kentucky. All three species inhabit similar wetlands and feed on amphibians and fishes. The anurophagous plain-bellied watersnakes had longer, narrower heads that likely allow snakes to capture anuran metamorphs and froglets while facilitating movement through dense vegetation. The piscivorous diamondback watersnake had a wider head, which would enhance contact with prey in this open-mouth forager, and smaller interocular distance, resulting in dorsally placed eyes that facilitate seeing fish prey from below. The mostly piscivorous northern watersnake had an intermediate, generalized head shape, which may reflect the typically wide diet range of this species. Head shape did not differ between snake sexes but diamondback and northern females had larger heads than males and fed more frequently on fishes. The relationship between head morphology and diet highlights potential interspecific and intersexual competition and aids in the understanding of species coexistence patterns.","[Perkins, Micah W.] Owensboro Community & Tech Coll, Owensboro, KY 42303 USA; [Eason, Perri K.] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA","Perkins, MW (corresponding author), Owensboro Community & Tech Coll, Owensboro, KY 42303 USA.",micah.perkins@kctcs.edu,,,University of Louisville; Watershed Studies Institute (Murray State University); Greater Cincinnati Herpetological Society; Chicago Herpetological Society; Kentucky Society of Natural History; Kentucky Chapter of The Wildlife Society,"This research was funded by University of Louisville, Watershed Studies Institute (Murray State University), Greater Cincinnati Herpetological Society, Chicago Herpetological Society, Kentucky Society of Natural History, and The Kentucky Chapter of The Wildlife Society.

Although frequently studied in the context of predator-prey interactions, refuges may also mediate interspecific competition between native and invasive taxa given the role of refuges as a valuable resource. Because interspecific interactions (e.g., competition and predation) can be modulated by temporal and biotic (e.g., trophic level) factors, we used a manipulative approach to investigate community-wide refuge-use patterns in the context of two important ecological factors: invasive species and seasonality. We surveyed refuge (artificial cover object) use of ants and vertebrates in a forest community for 2years, and we systematically suppressed an established invasive species (red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta) to examine its impact on community refuge use. Native Camponotus ants appeared to co-exist and share refuges with S. invicta, but we found evidence for a negative effect of S. invicta on vertebrate refuge use that was also influenced by season. Vertebrates were more abundant under refuges undergoing suppression of S. invicta, and they were less abundant under refuges during the fall (the season characterized by the highest occupancy of refuges by S. invicta). Thus, researchers must continue to examine the entire community and to incorporate the effects of season when assessing the impact of invasive species (e.g., at our site, a survey conducted only in the summer or only on native ants would have indicated a negligible effect of S. invicta on community refuge use).","[Stahlschmidt, Z.

Several hypotheses address the behavioral mechanisms driving the impacts of this mutualism, but relatively few studies have considered multiple ant species simultaneously as well as interspecific and intraspecific variation in ant behavior. In a series of field experiments that manipulated ant diet, this work examines the role of induced behaviors of forest ant species actively engaged in mutualism with Hemiptera. Based on other work in ant mutualisms, we predicted a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors towards prey and competitors by ants in the presence of honeydew-producing Hemiptera. We specifically compared Camponotus chromaoides and Formica neogagates (Formicidae), two abundant species in temperate forests of the northeastern U.S.A. After manipulating ant diet and interactions with sap-feeders experimentally, we observed 494 one-on-one interactions between ants and competitors, ladybird beetles and caterpillar prey. We found that C. chromaoides, exhibited behavioral dominance over F. neogagates, and C. chromaoides was more likely to attack ladybird beetles, competing ants, and caterpillar prey. However, contrary to other work in ant-Hemipteran mutualisms, we observed no evidence that food rewards provided by sap-feeders induced changes in ant behavior for either ant species examined. These results reveal the importance of considering interspecific differences in behavior as a mechanism underlying the ecological impacts of ant-Hemipteran protection mutualisms.","[Clark, Robert E.; Singer, Michael S.] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA","Clark, RE (corresponding author), Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",rclark@wesleyan.edu,,,NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1404177],"This work was supported by NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant DEB-1404177.

We demonstrate assemblages to be both phylogenetically and functionally under-dispersed, and thus conclude that the physical environment, not competition, may dominate in structuring deep-ocean communities. Further, we find temperature and bottom trawling intensity to be among the environmental factors significantly related to assemblage diversity. These results hint that deep-ocean communities are highly sensitive to their physical environment and vulnerable to environmental perturbation, including by direct disturbance through fishing, and indirectly through the changes brought about by climate change.","[Ashford, Oliver S.; Bonsall, Michael B.; Rogers, Alex D.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Ashford, Oliver S.; Kenny, Andrew J.] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Frojan, Christopher R.

Competitive niche partitioning is diagnosed from species co-occurrence, species abundance distributions (SADs), and body size distributions of species. For several decades, studies have explored these patterns for the relative significance of interspecific competition in shaping communities. We explored these patterns in a finite assemblage of insectivorous lizards in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, both at the level of archipelago and individual islands. Negative geographic co-occurrences occurred only between species pairs in islands separated by deep ocean channels. Ecologically similar species did not show positive co-occurrence in guild co-occurrence analyses, indicating that the negative geographical co-occurrences between species in islands were due to historical allopatry. Species abundance distribution was best explained by a Pareto distribution in both metacommunity and local communities. There was no predictable spacing of body sizes among co-existing species in local communities. The empirical data on insular lizard community on species co-occurrence, SADs, and body size ratios does not lend support to assortment of species in islands caused by niche subdivision. Such niche-dissociated assembly of species in islands might be an important factor in formation of biological communities, regardless of geographic scale.","[Harikrishnan, Surendran] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Vasudevan, Karthikeyan] CSIR Ctr Cellular & Mol Biol, Lab Conservat Endangered Species, Hyderabad 500048, Telangana, India","Vasudevan, K (corresponding author), CSIR Ctr Cellular & Mol Biol, Lab Conservat Endangered Species, Hyderabad 500048, Telangana, India.",karthik@ccmb.res.in,"Surendran, Harikrishnan/O-4184-2017","Surendran, Harikrishnan/0000-0002-2340-2120","Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [SR/SO/AS-08/2009]; Department of Forests and Wildlife, Andaman and Nicobar Islands [CWLW/WL/134/161]","This work was supported by Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India (Grant No. SR/SO/AS-08/2009).

The necrobiome is a unique microcosm in which various organisms interact and compete for access to an ephemeral resource, such as carrion, that ultimately determines the structure and composition of these assemblages. 2. Blowfly species exhibit different competitive abilities which, when associated with other types of behaviour, such as predation or cannibalism, influence coexistence. Knowledge of the effects of competition between native and invasive species on development and survival is essential to understanding the dynamics of insect communities and to assess biological invasions. 3. Laboratory experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of interspecific competition on the bionomics and survival of a native (Cochliomyia macellaria) and an invasive (Chrysomya rufifacies) blowfly species at different population densities. 4. The deleterious effect of competition on the larval parameters of C. macellaria increased proportionally with increases in the larval density of C. rufifacies. When exposed to increased densities of C. rufifacies, larvae of C. macellaria accelerated their development and, as a trade-off for this strategy, surviving adults were smaller and had reduced wing size, which were likely to reduce dispersal and reproductive capacity. 5. Larval competition-both as species-dependent and density-dependent phenomena-influences morphological and biological traits of surviving individuals. The impact of the invasive species has consequences at the population level, such as displacement or local population depletion of native species, a phenomenon likely to occur in other systems involving insects and ephemeral resources.","[Carmo, Rodrigo F.

We tested the hypothesis that five small characids coexist via resource partitioning. Samplings were performed quarterly between August 2013 and May 2014 at 14 sites in the Pelotas River basin, using gillnets of different mesh sizes, seines, cast nets and electrofishing. In this study, the contents of 1,253 stomachs were analysed from Astyanax dissensus, A. paris, A. saguazu, A. xiru and Bryconamericus patriciae. The main food resources consumed were aquatic insects, leaves, seeds and detritus. There were significant seasonal intra and interspecific variations in the use of food resources by the five species. Permutational analysis of multivariate dispersions results indicated significant differences in individual intraspecific variability between the sampled periods, with the highest values found in November and February because of an increase in allochthonous resources (leaves and seeds). Besides this, significant differences in the proportions of consumption of allochthonous and autochthonous were observed. The trophic niche breadth was significantly different among the species, such that in August, the species had narrower niche breadths. In the other periods, the highest niche breadth values were due to an increase in the consumption of allochthonous items. Diet overlap was low (< 0.4) between 62% of the species pairs. The small characid species showed pronounced changes in resource use and intra and interspecific variations indicating resource partitioning. These factors appear to be essential in species interactions and for coexistence.","[Neves, Mayara P.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Zool, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Da Silva, Jislaine C.] Univ Maringa, Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Baumgartner, Dirceu] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Ambientais, Cascavel, Parana, Brazil; [Baumgartner, Gilmar] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, Programa Posgrad Recursos Pesqueiros & Engn Pesca, Cascavel, Parana, Brazil; [Delariva, Rosilene L.] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, Ctr Ciencias Biol & Saude, Programa Posgrad Conservacao & Manejo Recursos Na, Rua Univ 2069, Cascavel, Parana, Brazil","Neves, MP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Dept Zool, Agron, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500,Predio 43435,Sala 111, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",mayara-nevesbio@hotmail.com,"da Silva, Jislaine Cristina/AAQ-6766-2021; Baumgartner, Dirceu/J-2332-2016; Neves, Mayara Pereira/AAD-4449-2019; Delariva, Rosilene L/L-2000-2016","da Silva, Jislaine Cristina/0000-0002-3081-6348; Neves, Mayara Pereira/0000-0003-2523-3874; Delariva, Rosilene L/0000-0002-6489-2437",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) provided a Master' scholarship.,,62,9,9,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

In the San Francisco Bay estuary, the encrusting bryozoan Conopeum chesapeakensis (Osburn, 1944; Banta et al., 1995) occurs in peak abundances in lower salinity hard substrate habitats, with lower abundances upstream and downstream; however, little is known about the factors that control its distribution. To investigate several hypotheses about what allows this broadly tolerant invader to be numerically dominant in this region, a field transplant experiment was conducted across three sites in upper San Francisco Bay estuary. Colonies settled on PVC plates in the peak abundance zone and transplanted to upstream and downstream treatment sites, or returned to the settlement site, which served as a control. Salinity, temperature, chlorophyll a levels, and the abundance of interspecific competitors varied at each site and were measured throughout the experiment. Mixed effects models incorporating these measurements compared net growth rate and zooid size observed across treatment sites. Colonies transplanted upstream experienced high barnacle settlement, a potential competitive threat, and decreased salinity, and exhibited an average net growth rate of 6.60 zooids/day. Colonies at the control site faced almost no potential interspecific competition, intermediate salinity, and had an average net growth rate of 4.96 zooids/day. At the downstream site, colonies grew an average of 4.62 zooids/day and experienced high potential competition from serpulid polychaete settlement and the highest salinity of all sites. The best-fit models indicated that overall abundance of potential competitors, especially the serpulid Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel, 1923), was negatively correlated with the net growth rate of C. chesapeakensis colonies. Zooid size was also negatively correlated with F. enigmaticus abundance and temperature, though the relationship weakened over time. Many colonies at both the upstream and downstream transplant sites experienced fast initial growth following transplantation, but then experienced partial colony loss corresponding with an increase in the abundance of potential competitors. In contrast, colonies at the control site showed slow but continuous growth throughout the study in absence of interspecific competitors. These results suggest that the numerical dominance of C. chesapeakensis in upper-estuary habitat may be partly explained by a lack of potential interspecific competitors. As San Francisco Bay and other estuaries face high invasion pressure in brackish upper-estuarine regions, understanding which factors influence the distribution of NIS can help predict impacts to resident communities.","[Newcomer, Katherine] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Marraffini, Michelle L.; Chang, Andrew L.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 3150 Paradise Dr, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA","Newcomer, K (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",newcomerk@si.edu; marraffinim@si.edu; changal@si.edu,"Chang, Andrew/J-8058-2016","Chang, Andrew/0000-0002-7870-285X; Lawson, Katherine/0000-0003-4062-0979",US Coast Guard [HSCG23-15-C-MM019]; California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Marine Invasive Species Program [P1675035],"This work was supported by grants from the US Coast Guard (Grant number: HSCG23-15-C-MM019) and from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Marine Invasive Species Program (Grant number: P1675035).

We tested the hypothesis that scrub-jays reduce their attendance in response to seed crop size on Quercus lobata, the species preferentially attended by acorn woodpeckers, and therefore reduce the risk of potential injury from aggression when community-level seed production enables them to forage on other trees (the Baggression-avoidance<^> hypothesis). Results indicated that scrub-jay attendance correlated positively with Q. lobata crops during the year when community-level seed production was low, resulting in high levels of aggression. In contrast, during the 2 years when acorns of other species were abundant in the landscape, scrub-jays reduced attendance at Q. lobata and experienced less aggression. Similarly, we found that the scrub-jays experienced equally low rates of aggression at Q. douglasii trees that were attended by fewer acorn woodpeckers. These results support the aggression-avoidance hypothesis and illustrate how resource and social dynamics may interact to determine the attendance of mutualistic seed dispersers at oak species competing for seed dispersal. Furthermore, they show that intra-and interspecific social interactions at the seed source, as well as at caching locations, affect the scatter-hoarding behavior of wild corvids.","[Pesendorfer, Mario B.; Koenig, Walter D.] Cornell Univ, Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Pesendorfer, Mario B.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Migratory Bird Ctr, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Pesendorfer, Mario B.; Koenig, Walter D.] Hastings Nat Hist Reservat, 38601 E Carmel Valley Rd, Carmel Valley, CA 93924 USA; [Koenig, Walter D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Pesendorfer, MB (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA.; Pesendorfer, MB (corresponding author), Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Migratory Bird Ctr, Washington, DC 20008 USA.; Pesendorfer, MB (corresponding author), Hastings Nat Hist Reservat, 38601 E Carmel Valley Rd, Carmel Valley, CA 93924 USA.",mbp67@cornell.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1256394],This research was funded by National Science Foundation grant DEB-1256394 to WDK.,,49,0,0,2,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

It can be due to the remarkable plasticity of roots in response to nutrients and neighbours, but most data on it come from pot or garden experiments. The roles of vertical differentiation and of plasticity in it in the field are thus not well known. We examined species-specific root vertical distribution in a montane grassland using quantitative real-time PCR. We asked whether individual species differ in their rooting depths, whether such differences are associated with above-ground functional traits (such as height or specific leaf area), and whether they respond to the presence of a competitor. This response was assessed by comparison of species-specific vertical profiles between control plots and plots where the dominant species, Festuca rubra, had been removed. Vertical profiles of individual species varied considerably, from species with most root biomass concentrated in the uppermost (<2cm) soil layer, through species with uniform vertical distribution, to a species with roots predominantly below 8cm (Nardus stricta). Species at the fast end of the plant economy spectrum were more likely to place their roots in the uppermost layers. Grassland species, thus, exploit different parts of the below-ground resources in spite of their short stature, minor differences in height above-ground and shallow soil. While below-ground and above-ground biomasses of most species were higher in the removal plots, species rooting patterns did not change in response to the removal. The interspecific differences in vertical profiles were thus due to species' innate differences, not to plastic responses to the presence of the dominant species.Synthesis. The findings imply that vertical root differentiation in the field is strong and can contribute to niche differentiation. However, the role of root plasticity in natural systems may be considerably weaker than in artificial systems with few species and strong nutrient gradients. This absence of the plastic response in the field is likely to be due to a fairly homogeneous distribution of nutrients in the soil and to the predominantly symmetric nature of below-ground competition.","[Herben, Tomas; Vozabova, Tereza; Hadincova, Vera; Krahulec, Frantisek; Mayerova, Hana; Pechackova, Sylvie; Skalova, Hana; Krak, Karol] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Herben, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Prague, Czech Republic; [Pechackova, Sylvie] West Bohemian Museum Pilsen, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Krak, Karol] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Mayerova, Hana] Adm Brdy Protected Landscape Reg, Jince 26223, Czech Republic","Herben, T (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, Pruhonice, Czech Republic.; Herben, T (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Prague, Czech Republic.",herben@site.cas.cz,"Hadincova, Veroslava/D-4572-2013; /H-1627-2014; /H-1601-2014","Hadincova, Veroslava/0000-0002-3825-1919; /0000-0002-1252-2952; /0000-0001-7706-1723; Krak, Karol/0000-0002-0340-2086","Grantova Agentura Ceske RepublikyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [13-17118S, 17-05506S]","Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky, Grant/Award Number: 13-17118S and 17-05506S",,81,13,14,2,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

In birds, however, the macroscopic aspects of plumage coloration are less well understood, as past studies typically described plumage colorations by using spectrophotometric analyses. To provide insight into the evolution of plumage patterns as sexual signals, we characterized interspecific and intersexual variations in the plumage patterns of estrildid finches and tested their associations with other courtship signals and life-history traits using a comparative phylogenetic approach. Our results support the idea that plumage patterns in estrildids are favored by sexual selection because large-sized conspicuous plumage patterns are possessed by species with an elaborate courtship dance. These plumage patterns may also play roles in social signaling because patterns are more conspicuous in species with intraspecific brood parasitism. We predict that pattern traits can be favored by mate choice or intrasexual competition when they can serve as honest indicators of individual condition. As our results are consistent between the sexes, we suggest that the same selective force is acting on the evolution of plumage patterns in males and females in parallel. Finally, we also found a trade-off between large size and vivid color patterns, suggesting that too conspicuous patterns are costly, presumably because of the risk of catching the eyes of potential predators. Therefore, plumage patterns are also shaped by natural selection.","[Soma, Masayo] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Kita Ku, N10 W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido N10 W8, Japan; [Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, C Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Plant Systemat Ecol & Theoret Biol, Theoret Biol & Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, MTA ELTE, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary","Soma, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Kita Ku, N10 W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido N10 W8, Japan.",masayo.soma@sci.hokudai.ac.jp,"Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015","Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183; Soma, Masayo/0000-0002-8596-1956","JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23680027, 16H06177]; Hokkaido University WinGS Global Networking Award; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain) [CGL2015-70639-P]; National Research, Development and Innovation Office (Hungary) [K-115970]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H06177] Funding Source: KAKEN","This study was supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (23680027 and 16H06177) and Hokkaido University WinGS Global Networking Award 2015 to Masayo Soma, and by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain) (CGL2015-70639-P) and the National Research, Development and Innovation Office (Hungary) (K-115970) to L.Z.G.",,81,9,10,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Most previous studies focused on local species assemblies that shared host plants. Few studies evaluated species pairs within a single taxon when investigating the effects of host plant sharing at the regional scale. Herein, we explore the effect of plant sharing on the geographical co-occurrence patterns of 232 butterflies distributed across the Japanese archipelago; we use two spatial scales (10 x 10 and 1 x 1 km grids) to this end. We considered that we might encounter one of two predictable patterns in terms of the relationship between co-occurrence and host sharing among butterflies. On the one hand, host sharing might promote distributional exclusivity attributable to interspecific resource competition. On the other hand, sharing of host plants may promote co-occurrence attributable to filtering by resource niche. At both grid scales, we found significant negative correlations between host use similarity and distributional exclusivity. Our results support the hypothesis that the butterfly co-occurrence pattern across the Japanese archipelago is better explained by filtering via resource niche rather than interspecific resource competition.","[Nakadai, Ryosuke; Hashimoto, Koya; Sato, Yasuhiro] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Hirano 2-509-3, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Nakadai, Ryosuke] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Senbaru 1, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Iwasaki, Takaya] Kanagawa Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Sci, Tsuchiya 2946, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa 2591293, Japan; [Sato, Yasuhiro] Ryukoku Univ, Dept Plant Life Sci, Fac Agr, Yokotani 1-5, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan","Nakadai, R (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Hirano 2-509-3, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.; Nakadai, R (corresponding author), Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Senbaru 1, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.",r.nakadai66@gmail.com,"Sato, Yasuhiro/N-7939-2013; Nakadai, Ryosuke/R-6927-2016","Sato, Yasuhiro/0000-0002-6466-723X; Nakadai, Ryosuke/0000-0002-9512-8511; Hashimoto, Koya/0000-0003-3510-1453; Iwasaki, Takaya/0000-0002-2194-4153", [15J00601],"We thank K.

We tested three hypotheses for how ungulate species select their habitats and how this changes with season: first, resources are distributed as a mosaic of patches so that ungulates are also distributed patchily; this distribution reflects habitat selection, which changes with season, the different ungulates behaving differently. Second, resources become scarcer in the dry season relative to those in the wet season. If interspecific competition prevails, then all species should show a contraction of habitats chosen. Third, if predation is limiting, competition will be minimal, and hence, habitat selection by herbivores will not differ between seasons. We used frequencies of occurrence in four common vegetation types in western Serengeti National Park to determine selection coefficients and utilization patterns and Chi-square analysis to test the hypotheses. The results showed that selection changes differently in each species, agreeing with the first hypothesis. Herbivores did not all become more selective, as predicted by the competition hypothesis, nor did selection remain the same across seasons, as predicted by the predation hypothesis. These results can be useful in constructing habitat suitability maps for ungulate species with special conservation needs.","[Bukombe, John; Mduma, Simon] Tanzania Wildlife Res Inst, POB 661, Arusha, Tanzania; [Kittle, Andrew; Fryxell, John] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Kittle, Andrew] Wilderness & Wildlife Conservat Trust, 130 Reid Ave, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Senzota, Ramadhan] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Zool & Wildlife Conservat, POB 35064, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Sinclair, Anthony R.

Such tradeoffs are commonly observed in plant communities, particularly in relation to traits associated with resistance to herbivory. Indeed, global experiments show that interspecific tradeoffs are common between plant defense and growth or competitive ability; however, the positive effects of herbivory on plant diversity predicted by theories with trait-based tradeoffs are far less commonly observed. Moreover, both the overall and relative importance of these tradeoffs in promoting plant diversity are not well known. To disentangle the relationships among growth, competition, and defense in relation to plant community evenness, we built a model that describes the effects of a shared herbivore on two plant species with the potential to differ in each of these traits. While tradeoffs between plant defense and growth or competitive ability can increase plant diversity via evenness, this is not always the case nor is it a requirement for increased diversity. Herbivores may increase plant diversity even in the absence of defensive tradeoffs, preferentially consuming apparently maladapted species, by limiting the negative effects of interspecific interactions. Therefore, the importance of defensive tradeoffs in increasing diversity may not be as important, or as straightforward, as previously hypothesized.","[Mortensen, Brent; Danielson, Brent] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Abbott, Karen C.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Mortensen, B (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",bdm@iastate.edu,"Mortensen, Brent/AAD-2092-2021","Mortensen, Brent/0000-0002-4873-6127; Abbott, Karen/0000-0001-5143-0690",,,,51,3,3,3,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2018,127,1,,,,,63,72,,10.1111/oik.04300,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR5JF,WOS:000419102100007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Local diversity (alpha) and regional diversity (gamma) are consistently lower in insular areas. The pattern of species turnover (beta diversity) and the influence of isolation on competitive interactions are less predictable. Differences in communities across microhabitats within an isolated patch could contribute to the variability in patterns related to isolation. Trees form characteristically dense and sparse patches (low vs. high isolation) in floating marshes in coastal Louisiana, and canopy and root areas around these trees could support distinct ant communities. Consequently, trees in floating marshes provide an ideal environment to study the effects of isolation on community assemblages in different microhabitats. We sampled ant communities in 120 trees during the summer of 2016. We found ant a diversity was not different between the canopy and roots, and the magnitude and directional effects of isolation on ants were inconsistent between the canopy and root areas. In the roots of sparse sites, ant diversity (alpha, beta, and gamma) was lower, species composition was changed, and the signature of interspecific competition was more prominent compared to dense sites. In the canopy, however, significant differences between dense and sparse sites were only detected in alpha and gamma diversity, and ant species co-occurrence was not significantly different from a random distribution. The inconsistent responses of ants in canopy and root areas to isolation may be due to the differences of species pool size, environmental harshness, and species interactions between strata. In addition, these findings indicate that communities in distinct microenvironments can respond differentially to habitat isolation. We suggest incorporating organisms from different microhabitats into future research to better understand the influence of isolation on the assembly of biological communities.","[Chen, Xuan; Layne, Michael; Hooper-Bui, Linda] Louisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Adams, Benjamin] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, 139 Life Sci Bldg, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Swarzenski, Christopher] US Geol Survey, Lower Mississippi Gulf Water Sci Ctr, 3535 S Sherwood Forest Blvd, Baton Rouge, LA 70816 USA; [Norris, David] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Hooper-Bui, L (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",lindabui@lsu.edu,"Bui, Dr. Linda/AAW-7252-2021",", Xuan/0000-0002-9499-0054; Adams, Benjamin/0000-0002-5857-175X",Garden Club of America; Coypu Foundation,"We thank Loretta Battaglia, Mark Deyrup, Kyle Harms, Charles Sasser, Alyssa Stark, and Stephen Yanoviak for providing comments on research design and manuscript writing.

The influence of interspecific interactions is particularly widespread within carnivore guilds, where species must balance the trade-off between resource acquisition and potentially costly encounters with intraguild competitors/predators. We tested whether intraguild species activity or resource availability had a stronger influence on the seasonal distributions of 10 carnivore species in northern Botswana. We deployed 132 camera stations across a 330km(2) area during the 2014 dry season and 2015 wet season. For each species and season, we developed occupancy models based on resource availability (i.e. prey, vegetation and water) and on intraguild species (i.e. photographic detection rates of intraguild competitors and predators). We then used k-fold cross-validation to assess the relative predictive ability of each model. Carnivore distributions were generally negatively associated with dense vegetation and contrary to expectations, positively associated with the detection rate of intraguild species. This suggests competitor/predator avoidance did not play a large role in influencing carnivore distributions in northern Botswana, a result that differs from other systems, and might be attributed to differences in habitat, carnivore densities, and prey availability. The predictive ability of our resource availability vs. intraguild species models differed between seasons and among species. Leopard distributions, for example, were best predicted by resource availability during the dry season and by the activity of intraguild species in the wet season. The majority of seasonal distributions were best predicted by intraguild species activity or a combination of both resource availability and intraguild species activity. As environments continually change, studies similar to ours are pertinent as they can be used to monitor distributions of wildlife communities and to better understand the relative importance of the diversity of ecological processes impacting wildlife communities.","[Rich, L.

We assessed the feeding niche overlap of two sympatric starfish, Astropecten marginatus and Luidia senegalensis, from the shallow subtidal zone in southeastern Brazil. During one year, we conducted monthly samples to compare diet composition, abundance and frequency of occurrence of each food item between species. With 24 of the 34 food items identified in this study consumed by both species, they exhibited generalist behaviors, with a more diverse diet during the warm periods, when the main prey items were abundant. However, A. marginatus showed more variation in abundance of prey consumed over time than L. senegalensis. The diet of A. marginatus consisted primarily of the bivalve Tivela mactroides and L senegalensis of the bivalve Mulinia cleryana. The size of T mactroides was positively correlated to the size of A. marginatus, while only small-sized individuals of L. senegalensis consumed this item, the most abundant prey in the area and an important food resource for local the community. The large quantity and variety of items consumed by both species support the structuring role of starfish in subtidal unconsolidated substrate communities, exerting a generalist top-down control, primarily on dominant bivalve populations. Temporal variation in the availability of the main prey may change how selective are both species. The differences in prey composition between species and the ontogenetic differences in prey selectivity by L senegalensis may attenuate interspecific competition, facilitating their coexistence.

An organism's investment in life-history traits is expected to change during range shifts or range expansion because populations encounter new ecological conditions. While simulation studies predict that dispersal and reproductive allocation should increase at the range edge, we suggest that reproductive allocation might decrease at the range edge due to energy allocation trade-offs. We studied the reproductive investment of an invasive amphibian, Xenopus laevis, and measured reproductive allocation in three clusters of populations distributed from the centre to the edge of the colonized range of X. laevis in France. Resource allocation was estimated with the scaled mass index of gonads of both sexes during the local period of reproduction of the species. The level of resources allocated to reproduction was lower at the periphery of the colonized range compared to the centre and may be the result of changes in trade-offs between life-history traits. Such a pattern could be explained by interspecific competition or enhanced investment in dispersal capacity.","[Courant, Julien; Bereiziat, Viviane; Herrel, Anthony] MNHN, CNRS, UMR 7179, Dept Ecol & Gest Biodiversite, 57 Rue Cuvier,Case Postale 55, F-75231 Paris, France; [Secondi, Jean] Univ Lyon 1, ENTPE, CNRS, UMR Ecol Hydrosyst Nat & Anthropises 5023, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Secondi, Jean] Univ Angers, LEESA, LETG, UMR 6554, 2 Blvd Lavoisier, F-49000 Angers, France; [Herrel, Anthony] Univ Ghent, Evolutionary Morphol Vertebrates, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Courant, J (corresponding author), MNHN, CNRS, UMR 7179, Dept Ecol & Gest Biodiversite, 57 Rue Cuvier,Case Postale 55, F-75231 Paris, France.",julien.courant@edu.mnhn.fr,"Herrel, Anthony/C-3712-2013","Herrel, Anthony/0000-0003-0991-4434; Courant, Julien/0000-0002-1946-5444","ERA-Net BiodivERsA; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR); DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission; BELSPOBelgian Federal Science Policy Office; FCT, as part of the BiodivERsA call; INVAXEN 'Invasive biology of Xenopus laevis in Europe: ecology, impact and predictive models' project [ANR-13-EBID-0008-01]","We gratefully thank the two anonymous reviewers of this study and Prof. John A.

In this study, we explored how competition, by means of pod infestation, affects the development of female and male individuals in the co-occurring bruchine beetles Merobruchus terani and Stator maculatopygus. We found differences between M. terani and S. maculatopygus in all morphometric traits, but no significant differences between males and females in either species. We also found, with an increasing degree of pod infestation, a positive trend in the pronotum, elytron and body weight of M. terani and a negative trend in morphological traits and body weight of S. maculatopygus. A negative allometry was maintained, suggesting that with increasing body weight, the body structures did not increase proportionally. On the other hand, we found that increasing the degree of pod infestation produced a wider variation in the individuals' body size than in low levels of infestation. Finally, we discuss how pod infestation can trigger competition between species, with both positive and negative impacts, even though the species function similarly in resource exploitation.

We compiled a new pan-continental tree-ring width database from sites where both dead and living trees were sampled (2970 dead and 4224 living trees from 190 sites, including 36 species), and compared early and recent growth rates between trees that died and those that survived a given mortality event. We observed a decrease in radial growth before death in ca. 84% of the mortality events. The extent and duration of these reductions were highly variable (1-100 years in 96% of events) due to the complex interactions among study species and the source(s) of mortality. Strong and long-lasting declines were found for gymnosperms, shade-and drought-tolerant species, and trees that died from competition. Angiosperms and trees that died due to biotic attacks (especially bark-beetles) typically showed relatively small and short-term growth reductions. Our analysis did not highlight any universal trade-off between early growth and tree longevity within a species, although this result may also reflect high variability in sampling design among sites. The intersite and interspecific variability in growth patterns before mortality provides valuable information on the nature of the mortality process, which is consistent with our understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to mortality. Abrupt changes in growth immediately before death can be associated with generalized hydraulic failure and/or bark-beetle attack, while long-term decrease in growth may be associated with a gradual decline in hydraulic performance coupled with depletion in carbon reserves. Our results imply that growth-based mortality algorithms may be a powerful tool for predicting gymnosperm mortality induced by chronic stress, but not necessarily so for angiosperms and in case of intense drought or bark-beetle outbreaks.","[Cailleret, Maxime; Bigler, Christof; Bugmann, Harald; Rohner, Brigitte] ETH, Forest Ecol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Jansen, Steven] Univ Ulm, Inst Systemat Bot & Ecol, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Robert, Elisabeth M.

Yet despite the importance of aggressive interactions in determining social dominance and conferring fitness benefits to successful individuals, we lack a general understanding of the conditions that influence the variation in agonistic behaviours among individuals and species. We conducted a global meta-analysis of published time-activity budgets, using a data set comprising 555 values from 88 studies, to determine variation in the time that waterbirds engaged in aggressive interactions. The mean +/- SD percentage of time devoted to aggression was 2.0 +/- 3.6%, with a range of 0.0-35.0%. We used our data set to test four predictions regarding avian aggression, based on the findings of earlier site-based studies. We predicted that the time spent on aggression would be influenced by four factors: (1) age class, (2) sex, (3) seasonal timing and (4) functional feeding group. A comparison of linear mixed-effects models using an information theoretic approach indicated that the proportion of time waterbirds spent engaged in aggressive interactions was best explained by the age class and sex of the focal waterbird species. More time was spent on aggression by males than females, and by adults than juveniles. We found no evidence that the time spent on aggressive behaviours varied across latitudes or body mass, with seasonal timing, sexual dimorphism, migration or breeding strategies, or between different functional feeding groups. Our findings highlight the high levels of variation in the time devoted to aggression across species, feeding groups, latitudes and seasons. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the utility of the numerous published time-activity budget studies that are available as a valuable source of data that can be used to answer broad-scale questions regarding animal behaviour.

At the community level, the ultimate outcome of resource partitioning determines how communities evolve in terms of their species composition, explaining the distribution and abundance of organisms within natural assemblages. Despite amphibians having attracted considerable attention from population biologists, niche partitioning patterns have never been explored with a systematic approach in tailed amphibians (order Urodela). To fill this gap we tested whether Urodela communities are assembled in a non-random fashion along the trophic niche and which determinants (environmental factors and interspecific interactions) explained the observed patterns. We used a suite of statistical tools, including Generalized Linear Models and Null Models with Monte Carlo simulations, in order: (1) to explore the occurrence of non-random assemblage structure among the Urodela communities, and (2) to test environmental features (habitat) and interspecific interactions (exemplified by the overlap in species' body size) as predictors of non-random assemblage composition. Our systematic review pointed out that: (1) the evolution of non-random structure in Urodela assemblages was determined by both biotic and abiotic factors, and (2) the food niche plays a key role in the coexistence of Urodela syntopic species. The considered assemblages showed a non-random structure influenced by diet, habitat and morphological features acting in an interactive fashion. Lawlor's RA2 algorithm was more effective than any other randomization algorithms to reveal community structure based on interspecific competition. The assemblage structure was influenced by the niche breadth of the species in the generalist-specialist nature of the resource utilization: the much higher the niche breadth similarity among species, the most likely was a non-random structure in the assemblage. In an aquatic habitat, where species can partition the space in three dimensions, assemblages composed by species overlapping in body size and generalist in feeding behaviour show non-random structure. Conversely, in terrestrial habitats, probably due to the lack of vertical stratification, differently sized species composed assemblages in a non-random fashion.

Here, we estimated moose (Alces alces cameloides) resource selection for habitat variables and the effect of interspecific interactions related to roe deer (Capreolus pygargus bedfordi) on its population distribution and environmental stress in the Khingan Mountain region of northeast China at local and regional scales. Different response patterns of moose resource selection, spatial distribution, and environmental stress to interspecific interaction-linked habitat factors were shown at the two scales. A general ecological chain, response of moose to interspecific interaction-linked habitat factors, was exhibited at the regional scale, and at the local scale, heterogeneous responses, linkages of habitat selection and environmental stress of moose population might be driven by different interspecific interaction patterns. Our study firstly suggested that moose resource selection, food availability, diet quality, population density and environmental stress indicators were impacted by interactions with the distribution of other sympatric herbivore species and showed differences in ecological response chains at various spatial scales. These findings are useful for sympatric herbivore assembly conservation, habitat quality monitoring and management.","[Bao, Heng; Liu, Hui; Dou, Hongliang; Ma, Yingjie; Jiang, Guangshun] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife Resources, Feline Res Ctr, Chinese State Forestry Adm, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Fryxell, John M.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Jiang, GS (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife Resources, Feline Res Ctr, Chinese State Forestry Adm, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",jgshun@126.com,,"Bao, Heng/0000-0003-0265-836X; Jiang, Guangshun/0000-0001-6321-9489","National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0503200]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572014EA06]; National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC 31272336, 31572285]; State Forestry Administration, Study on Tiger and Amur Leopard Population Resources Monitoring Technology; State Forestry Administration, Survey Standard Compiling and Information Summary of Amur Leopard and Tiger Population and Habitat","We thank the support of the National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology (2016YFC0503200), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572014EA06), National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC 31272336; 31572285) and two projects of the State Forestry Administration, entitled Study on Tiger and Amur Leopard Population Resources Monitoring Technology and Survey Standard Compiling and Information Summary of Amur Leopard and Tiger Population and Habitat.",,49,6,7,0,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JAN 27,2017,7,,,,,,,,41514,10.1038/srep41514,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,EJ4CN,WOS:000393163700001,28128311,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

One way to avoid competition while maintaining the benefits of living in a group is to form interspecific associations with species with relatively little dietary overlap. Here we report a stable association between a male golden-headed lion tamarin (GHLT), Leontopithecus chrysomelas, and a group of Wied's black-tufted-ear marmosets (WBTMs), Callithrix kuhlii. We collected ecological and behavioral data on a duo of GHLTs from May to August 2008, totaling 62 h of observations. On 19 August 2008, the radio-collared GHLT dispersed alone and was located on 28 August in association with WBTMs. To examine possible changes in GHLT ecology and behavior, we monitored the mixed-species group between September and December 2008, totaling 122 h of observations. We found that the GHLT's home range and daily path length decreased by about ten and three times, respectively, after joining the WBTM group, suggesting adaptations to the WBTMs' use of space. All non-agonistic behaviors recorded in the mixed group were directed from GHLT to the WBMTs, whereas all agonistic interactions were directed from the WBMTs to the GHLT, indicating a subordinate position of GHLT in the mixed group. In golden lion tamarins, reproductive success of subordinate adult males that remain in the group is higher than that of those that disperse and prospect for a breeding opportunity. If dispersing individuals are unable to find a mate and defend a territory, they will likely die within a year. The dispersing GHLT in this study assumed a subordinate role in a mixed-species group outside a GHLT territory. Apparently, the benefits of waiting for a dispersing female in a relatively safe situation may exceed the costs of prospecting elsewhere or being a subordinate.","[Oliveira, Leonardo de Carvalho] UERJ, Dept Ciencias, Fac Formacao Prof, Rua Dr Francisco Portela,1470 Patronato, BR-24435005 Sao Goncalo, RJ, Brazil; [Dietz, James] Univ Maryland, Program Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Oliveira, Leonardo de Carvalho; de Almeida Rocha, Juliana Monteiro; dos Reis, Paula Pedreira] Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidad, BR-45662900 Ilheus, BA, Brazil; [dos Reis, Paula Pedreira] Inst Estudos Socioambientais Sul Bahia IESB, Rua Araujo Pinho,72-3 Andar, BR-45653145 Ilheus, BA, Brazil; [Oliveira, Leonardo de Carvalho] Bicho Mato Inst Pesquisa, Ave Consul Antonio Cadar 600, BR-30360082 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Dietz, James] Save Golden Lion Tamarin, Silver Spring, MD USA","Oliveira, LD (corresponding author), UERJ, Dept Ciencias, Fac Formacao Prof, Rua Dr Francisco Portela,1470 Patronato, BR-24435005 Sao Goncalo, RJ, Brazil.; Oliveira, LD (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidad, BR-45662900 Ilheus, BA, Brazil.; Oliveira, LD (corresponding author), Bicho Mato Inst Pesquisa, Ave Consul Antonio Cadar 600, BR-30360082 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",leonardoco@gmail.com,"Oliveira, Leonardo C/G-1290-2012","Oliveira, Leonardo C/0000-0002-1774-0713",University of Maryland Biology Department; Seeds of Change; Lion Tamarins of Brazil Fund; Wildlife Conservation Society; International Foundation for ScienceInternational Foundation for Science; Rufford Small Grants Foundation; Idea Wild; University of Maryland (College of Chemical and Life Sciences Board of Visitors); University of Maryland (Ann G.

Among the different factors that affect parasite communities within a host individual or population, interspecific interactions are of fundamental significance. Dependence of parasite aggregation on interspecific competition in parasite communities has been documented for several host-parasite systems. In this study we tested the effect of community size on parasite aggregation in native and introduced fish populations of two species of grey mullets (Liza haematocheilus and Mugil cephalus). We investigated the relationships between community heterogeneity and parameters characterizing species richness and both similar and different patterns for invasive and native hosts were revealed. The degree of aggregation of parasites decreased with parasite community size, except for monogeneans from the invasive host, thereby supporting findings of previous studies. Monogenean parasites, which were introduced in the new area together with their host, showed a positive relationship between the degree of aggregation and parasite community size. This suggests unregulated interactions in the introduced host-monogeneans system. The absence in the new host range of at least two monogenean species from the native range may have disturbed the evolutionary interaction established among them, which could have resulted in decreased interspecific competition. Multiple regression analysis showed that both species-rich communities and host introduction have a negative effect on species aggregation in parasite communities. Differences in helminth species richness, abundance and aggregation between native and invasive hosts support the idea that interspecific interaction is predominantly mediated by the host defense system.","[Sarabeev, V.] Zaporizhzhia Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Zhukovskogo 66, UA-69063 Zhaporizhzhia, Ukraine; [Balbuena, J.

We posited that biotic interactions, particularly predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory assumed a primary top-down role in affecting small mammals and annual plants here. Using a multi factorial design we selectively excluded vertebrate predators (principally carnivores and raptors) and a large small mammal herbivore, the degu (Octodon degus), from replicated 0.56 ha exclosures located in a valley near the coast in Bosque Fray Jorge National Park. Evidence initially supported effects of predator exclusion on O. degus but not for other small mammals in the assemblage (e.g., Phyllotis darwini, Abrothrix olivaceus). Subsequent years of monitoring have documented that predation has temporary effects on degu numbers, but that populations of this and other small mammals are much more strongly influenced by environmental bottom-up factors (i.e., rainfall). Further, our experimental manipulation has provided no evidence for negative interspecific competition effects on numbers of any small mammal in this assemblage. Degu exclusions, however, have had negative indirect effects on exotic annuals; native annuals appear to outcompete exotics especially during drought years The effect is magnified in all-small mammal exclusions. Since about 2002, selective exclusions of lagomorphs and small mammals have resulted in changes in cover of some perennial shrubs. Also notable has been a fundamental shift in the small mammal composition following the last major El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event in 2000 2002; degus now comprise a majority of small mammal biomass in the assemblage, and their numbers have become more stable and less temporally variable. This appears to have been caused by a shift in rainfall periodicity from strong interannual fluctuations in response to periodic ENSOs, to a more equitable pattern with more consistent annual rainfall. This represents one of the first documented cases of system-wide biotic phase shifts to a relatively modest change in rainfall regime. This may be indicative of ongoing climate change in the Chilean semiarid region, and we expect that further changes in the community will occur if those trends continue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The largest consumers in many ecosystems have become either rare or extirpated, leading to worry over the loss of their ecosystem function. However, trophic downgrading is not a uniquely modern phenomenon. The extinction of 34 genera of megafauna from North America approximate to 13 000 yr ago must have led to widespread changes in terrestrial ecosystem function. Studies that have examined the event address impacts on vegetative structure, small mammal communities, nutrient cycling, and fire regimes. Relatively little attention has been paid to community changes at the top of the food chain. Here, we examine the response of carnivores in North America to the Pleistocene extinction. We employ fossil data to model the climatic niche of endemic canids, including the extinct dire wolf Canis dirus, over the last 20 000 yr. Quantifying the abiotic niche allows us to account for expected changes due to climate fluctuations over the Late Quaternary; deviations from expected responses likely reveal influences of competition and/or resource availability. We quantify the degree of niche conservatism and interspecific overlap to assess species and community responses among canids. We also include in our analyses a novel introduced predator, the domestic dog Canis lupus familiaris, which accompanied humans into the New World. We find that endemic canid species display low fidelity to their climatic niche through time, We find that survivors increasingly partition their climatic niche throughout the Holocene and, surprisingly, do not expand into niche space presumably vacated by the extinction of very large carnivores. These results suggest that loss of megaherbivores and competition with humans likely outweighed advantages conferred from the loss of very large predators. We also find that wolves and dogs decrease their niche overlap throughout the Holocene, suggesting a distinctive relationship between dogs and man.","[Pardi, Melissa I.; Smith, Felisa A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Pardi, MI (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",mpardi@unm.edu,"Pardi, Melissa I./AAY-8966-2020","Pardi, Melissa I./0000-0001-9766-7511; Smith, Felisa/0000-0001-6262-436X","Program in Interdisciplinary Biological and Biomedical Sciences at the University of New Mexico from the National Inst. of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [T32EB009414]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1555535, 1555525] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",This work was supported by a fellowship from the Program in Interdisciplinary Biological and Biomedical Sciences at the University of New Mexico (grant no.

There are many evidences of this effect manifestation in island biotas, but concerning mainland communities, the knowledge on its origin and spreading is still limited and contradictory. We estimated the intensity of DCE in species-poor plant communities of natural (semi-natural), anthropogenic, and fragmented habitats of the Western Caucasus. For this end, we compared species richness, relative density (biomass) of dominant species, and mean occurrence of accessory species in dense communities, as well as species richness and mean species occurrence in open communities. The results obtained show that in species-poor cenoses of different type both the level of dominance and mean species density (occurrence) may differ, which may be related to the model of cenoses organization and the regime of local disturbances. Among the studied plant communities, the increase in mean species occurrence at the background of species richness reduction was detected only in weed cenoses and in groupings on riverbed banks formed, mainly, by R-strategists. For species-poor grass and shrub communities where C-strategists predominate, high level of dominance and relatively low mean occurrence of accessory species seem to be typical. Species-poor cenoses of other types (forest stands, natural grass communities with S-strategists dominance, synanthropic ones, groupings on alpine screes) are characterized by noticeable variability in the level of dominance and mean species occurrence. An assumption is made that the main reason behind DCE effects in mainland plant communities is reduction of dominant species density (as a result of disturbances, accidental processes of resumption, etc.) coupled with limited size of their species pool.","[Akatov, V.

Both the slopes and intercepts of these relationships have been typically related to the energetic requirements of the focal animal, in relation to the amount of energy available in the environment. However, other explanations for these patterns are possible, including the ability of the focal animal to move about and/or defend a home range. To provide insight into this issue, we investigated the allometry of patch defence in convict cichlids, Amatitlania siquia, in a laboratory setting while controlling for energetic requirements. By manipulating the distance between two patches of food (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 95 cm), we estimated the maximum diameter of an ephemeral territory for 15 dominant fish that differed in body size by almost 40-fold. As expected, dominant fish were less able to defend and monopolize the food as the distance between the patches increased. Furthermore, larger fish were able to defend larger territories than smaller fish. The allometric slope of 1.18 in our study was remarkably similar to the interspecific slopes of home range or territory size in the literature for a broad range of vertebrate taxa. While there are likely multiple causes for the interspecific patterns of space use, our results suggest that the mobility of the defender is just as likely an explanation as energetic requirements.

European pine marten Martes martes and stone marten M. foina are syntopic medium-sized mustelids with very similar morphology and ecology for which resting sites are a key resource. To better understand how these species coexist, we investigated whether key features of their resting site pattern (number of resting sites, area over which they are distributed, main habitat type used for resting) differed. We used diurnal telemetry to identify resident individuals (e.g. spatially stable individuals over time) and to locate them during resting periods in a fragmented forested area in France. Stone marten used fewer resting sites distributed over a smaller surface area than pine marten. Most stone marten resting sites were located in open habitat (83%) in the proximity of human habitations, whereas pine martens rested almost exclusively in forest (98%). Sex, age, and season explained some variability in both the number of resting sites and the probability of resting within forested habitat for stone marten but not pine marten. The area covered by resting sites was larger in males than in females, but age modulated this difference in an opposite way for the two species. Such a pattern was expected given the intra-sexual territoriality and the reproductive phenology of these species. Overall, stone marten showed higher inter-individual variability in resting site pattern than pine marten. The particular pattern observed in subadult male stone martens during summer (increase in resting site surface area and in the probability to rest in forest) may reflect an attempt to settle in forests, and we discuss these implications in the context of interspecific competition.","[Larroque, Jeremy; Ruette, Sandrine; Vandel, Jean-Michel] CNERA PAD, Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, FR-01330 Birieux, France; [Larroque, Jeremy; Devillard, Sebastien] Univ Lyon, FR-69000 Lyon, France; [Larroque, Jeremy; Devillard, Sebastien] Univ Lyon 1, FR-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Larroque, Jeremy; Devillard, Sebastien] CNRS, UMR5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, FR-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Larroque, J (corresponding author), CNERA PAD, Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, FR-01330 Birieux, France.",sebastien.devillard@univ-lyon1.fr,"Larroque, Jeremy/J-2136-2019","Larroque, Jeremy/0000-0002-4371-6426",French Hunting and Wildlife Agency (ONCFS),"We are very grateful to all the hunters and trappers of Ain and Saone-et-Loire who helped us in fieldwork, especially Willy Genton, Leon Boully and Daniel Vivant.

We tested the stress gradient hypothesis, which predicts that resource use complementarity and facilitation are more important under water-limited conditions. We conducted a growth experiment with saplings of five temperate broad-leaved tree species that were grown in assemblages of variable diversity (1, 3, or 5 species) and species composition under ample and limited water supply to examine effects of species richness and species identity on stand- and tree-level productivity. Special attention was paid to effects of neighbor identity on the growth of target trees in mixture as compared to growth in monoculture. Stand productivity was strongly influenced by species identity while a net biodiversity effect (NE) was significant in the moist treatment (mostly assignable to CE) but of minor importance. The growth performance of some of the species in the mixtures was affected by tree neighborhood characteristics with neighbor size likely being more important than neighbor species identity. Diversity and neighbor identity effects visible in the moist treatment mostly disappeared in the dry treatment, disproving the stress-gradient hypothesis. The mixtures were similarly sensitive to drought-induced growth reduction as the monocultures, which may relate to the decreased CE on growth upon drought in the mixtures.","[Luebbe, Torben; Schuldt, Bernhard; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Lubbe, T (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",tluebbe@gwdg.de,"Schuldt, Bernhard/O-4172-2015","Schuldt, Bernhard/0000-0003-4738-5289",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (The role of biodiversity for biogeochemical cycles and biotic interactions in temperate deciduous forests) [GRK 1086]; Open Access Publication Funds of the University of Goettingen,"We thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for funding GRK 1086 (The role of biodiversity for biogeochemical cycles and biotic interactions in temperate deciduous forests), as well as Sebastian Fuchs, Eva Akomeah, and the gardener's team of the Experimental Botanical Garden in Gottingen for plant care and support with experimental procedures.

An important class of plastic responses is cohort splitting (Sunderland et al., 1976), in which groups of organisms beginning development at nearly the same time follow discrete developmental pathways or tracks differing in duration. We identify published studies on the topic and focus on three mechanisms predominant in those studies; we refer to the mechanisms as initiation asynchrony, in which differences in start-up timing can cause a split; mid-point cueing, a bifurcation at some seasonal time and intermediate developmental stage; and diversified tracking, in which individuals are assigned to developmental tracks probabilistically at the outset of development. We use optimization models to evaluate production of cohort splits by these mechanisms. We show that initiation asynchrony is generally a possible explanation but is highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Initiation asynchrony may result either from random variation in development or environment, with subsequent adaptive choices of life-cycle pathway-or from adjustments in developmental onset via diversified bet hedging. Mid-point cueing requires sufficiently high random variation in developmental rates. The adaptive response for Mid-point cueing results from matching the fitness-maximizing pathway to the stage of development at the bifurcation point. Diversified tracking can result from diversified bet hedging, but in this case, high random variation between pathways in reproductive success is essential for diversified tracking to prove adaptive. When diversified tracking results instead from frequency dependence of survival or reproductive success, this mechanism is potentially independent of environmental variation, but frequency dependence is challenging to demonstrate. Additional empirical analyses, especially experimental and comparative approaches, are high priorities for future work.

Then, I examine what implications for IPM can be outlined from knowledge about interspecific aggressive behaviour. Besides predator-pest aggressive interactions predicted by classic biological control, I focus on what IPM can learn from (i) interspecific aggression among pest species (with special reference to competitive displacement), (ii) defensive behaviour exhibited by prey against predaceous insects and (iii) conflicts among predaceous arthropods sharing the same trophic niche (with special reference to learning/sensitisation practices and artificial manipulation of chemically mediated interactions).

Knowledge about the ecology of A. rubens in these highly seasonal systems is largely limited to studies of interspecific competition for prey. Two experiments in an oscillatory wave tank were used to test the hypothesis that wave action and starvation modulate displacement, microhabitat selection, and ability to contact mussel (Mytilus edulis) prey in A. rubens from southeastern Newfoundland. Both experiments were carried out in two seasons (winter and summer) to quantify intra-annual variation in the effects of wave action (three wave velocities: null [0.0 m s(-1)], low [0.1 m s(-1)], and high [0.2 m s(-1)]) and starvation (two levels: fed and starved three weeks). Experiment 1, in which two sea stars were allowed to displace and make contact with six microhabitats typifying natural seabed heterogeneity, showed that A. rubens displaced up to 50% less with increasing wave velocity. Displacement was 120% higher in summer than winter and lower in starved than fed individuals in summer only. The sea star predominantly stayed on flat horizontal surfaces, did so more frequently in the presence than absence of waves, and spent more time in the two most uneven microhabitats in winter than summer regardless of wave velocity. Experiment 2, in which one sea star in the centre of a depression was allowed to move to the top of surrounding mounds, showed that more sea stars that left the centre of the depression reached the top of the mounds in summer than winter, in the absence than presence of waves, and when starved than fed. Sea stars that reached the top of mounds spent more time there in the presence than absence of mussels in summer only, when starved than fed in summer only, and in the presence than absence of mussels at null and low wave velocities. Measurements of wave height, sea temperature, and A. rubens abundance over six months at one subtidal site indicated that the sea star was >4 times more abundant at 8 m than at 2 m and 4 m. This difference was unrelated to temperature and likely mainly caused by the wave environment. Collectively, results demonstrate that wave action, and to a lesser extent starvation, are key modulators of the inclination and ability of A. rubens to explore its environment and localize prey.

We sampled tires in six sites at three times in 2012 across the state of Mississippi to understand the biotic and abiotic variables responsible for explaining patterns of larvae of common species, species richness, and total abundance of mosquitoes. From 498 tires sampled, we collected >58,000 immatures representing 16 species, with the most common species including Aedes albopictus (Skuse), Culex quinquefasciatus (L.), Orthopodomyia signifera (Coquillett), Aedes triseriatus (Say), Toxorhynchites rutilus septentrionalis (Coquillett), and Culex territans (Walker) accounting for similar to 97% of all larvae. We also documented 32 new county records for resident species and recent arrivals in the state, including Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald) and Culex coronator (Dyar & Knab). Cluster analysis, which was used to associate sites and time periods based on similar mosquito composition, did reveal patterns across the state; however, there also were more general patterns between species and genera and environmental factors. Broadly, Aedes was often associated with factors related to detritus, whereas Culex was frequently associated with habitat variables (e.g., tire size and water volume) and microorganisms. Some Culex did lack factors connecting variation in early and late instars, suggesting differences between environmental determinants of oviposition and survival. General patterns between the tire environment and mosquito larvae do appear to exist, especially at the generic level, and point to inherent differences between genera that may aid in predicting vector locations and populations.","[Yee, Donald A.; Abuzeineh, Alisa A.; Ezeakacha, Nnaemeka F.; Schelble, Stephanie S.; Glasgow, William C.; Flanagan, Stephen D.; Skiff, Jeffrey J.; Reeves, Ashton; Kuehn, Kevin] Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA","Yee, DA (corresponding author), Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.",donald.yee@usm.edu,,,Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Southern Mississippi; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R15[AI]-92404-01A1]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DB I0923063]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI092404] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank W.

We previously developed two conceptual models that described how one such strong interactor, the Australian bird the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala: (1) establishes resident high-density and hyperaggressive colonies and (2) in doing so, affects other biota and ecosystem processes. Here, we evaluate parts of those models relating to noisy miner habitat preferences and effects on bird assemblages using data from across the geographical range of the miner. LocationEastern Australia. MethodsAvian-assemblage data were compiled for 2128 survey transects (distributed over >1.3x10(6)km(2)) and were linked to variables reflecting productivity, local habitat structure and landscape context. Predictors were chosen based on the models, although detailed data for some variables were unavailable at such large scales. We used hierarchical Bayesian models that included observation models to account for different survey effort coupled with potentially nonlinear, spatially-explicit process models. ConclusionsNoisy miner densities increased with proximity to forest edges (higher densities on forest edges and open sites), in low rainfall areas, and in vegetation dominated by trees with blade-shaped rather than needle-shaped leaves. The presence of noisy miners at even relatively small densities (>0.6 individualsha(-1)) depressed both species richness and the abundances of smaller (<63g) bird species, by 50% on average. There were positive associations between densities of noisy miners and the abundance and richness of larger-bodied (>63g) bird species. In areas with higher mean rainfall, the associations between noisy miners and small- and large-bird species were more negative and less positive, respectively.","[Thomson, James R.; Mac Nally, Ralph] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia; [Maron, Martine] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Maron, Martine] Univ Queensland, Environm Decis Grp, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Grey, Merilyn J.; Clarke, Michael F.; Loyn, Richard H.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Evolut, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; [Catterall, Carla P.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Major, Richard E.] Australian Museum, Res Inst, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Oliver, Damon L.] NSW Off Environm & Heritage, Ecosyst & Threatened Species, South East Reg, Queanbeyan, NSW 2620, Australia; [Loyn, Richard H.] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; [Davidson, Ian] Regenerat Solut, Wangaratta, Vic 3677, Australia; [Ingwersen, Dean] BirdLife Australia, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Robinson, Doug] Trust Nat, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Kutt, Alex] Univ Melbourne, ARCUE, Sch Bot, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [MacDonald, Michael A.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Thomson, JR (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia.",jim.thomsson@gmail.com,"Maron, Martine/D-9699-2011; Thomson, Jim/W-2950-2019; Catterall, Carla P/K-7996-2017","Maron, Martine/0000-0002-5563-5789; Catterall, Carla P/0000-0002-1914-0455; Mac Nally, Ralph/0000-0002-4473-1636; Loyn, Richard/0000-0002-7337-0518",Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; ARCAustralian Research Council [DP120100797],"This paper is output no. 2 from workshops held by the Noisy Miner Working Group sponsored by the Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.

In melon, half of the 81 predicted NBS-LRR genes group in nine clusters, and a 1 Mb region on linkage group V contains the highest density of R-genes and presence/absence gene polymorphisms found in the melon genome. This region is known to contain the locus of Vat, an agronomically important gene that confers resistance to aphids. However, the presence of duplications makes the sequencing and annotation of R-gene clusters difficult, usually resulting in multi-gapped sequences with higher than average errors. Results: A 1-Mb sequence that contains the largest NBS-LRR gene cluster found in melon was improved using a strategy that combines Illumina paired-end mapping and PCR-based gap closing. Unknown sequence was decreased by 70% while about 3,000 SNPs and small indels were corrected. As a result, the annotations of 18 of a total of 23 NBS-LRR genes found in this region were modified, including additional coding sequences, amino acid changes, correction of splicing boundaries, or fussion of ORFs in common transcription units. A phylogeny analysis of the R-genes and their comparison with syntenic sequences in other cucurbits point to a pattern of local gene amplifications since the diversification of cucurbits from other families, and through speciation within the family. A candidate Vat gene is proposed based on the sequence similarity between a reported Vat gene from a Korean melon cultivar and a sequence fragment previously absent in the unrefined sequence. Conclusions: A sequence refinement strategy allowed substantial improvement of a 1 Mb fragment of the melon genome and the re-annotation of the largest cluster of NBS-LRR gene homologues found in melon. Analysis of the cluster revealed that resistance genes have been produced by sequence duplication in adjacent genome locations since the divergence of cucurbits from other close families, and through the process of speciation within the family a candidate Vat gene was also identified using sequence previously unavailable, which demonstrates the advantages of genome assembly refinements when analyzing complex regions such as those containing clusters of highly similar genes.","[Gonzalez, Victor M.; Aventin, Nuria; Puigdomenech, Pere] CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Ctr Res Agr Genom CRAG, Dept Mol Genet, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Centeno, Emilio] CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Ctr Res Agr Genom CRAG, Bioinformat Core Unit, Barcelona 08193, Spain","Puigdomenech, P (corresponding author), CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Ctr Res Agr Genom CRAG, Dept Mol Genet, Campus UAB,Edifici CRAG, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",pere.puigdomenech@cragenomica.es,"Centeno, Emilio/Q-4784-2019","Centeno, Emilio/0000-0003-2798-978X",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government [BIO2010-15620]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [AGL2013-43244-R]; Fundacion Genoma Espana (MELONOMICS project),"We thank Dr. Thomas D.

In this study we analysed 750 quantitative plant-pollinator networks from 28 studies representing diverse biomes worldwide. We show that the potential for one plant species to influence another indirectly via shared pollinators was greater for plants whose resources were more abundant (higher floral unit number and nectar sugar content) and more accessible. The potential indirect influence was also stronger between phylogenetically closer plant species and was independent of plant geographic origin (native vs. non-native). The positive effect of nectar sugar content and phylogenetic proximity was much more accentuated for bees than for other groups. Consequently, the impact of these factors depends on the pollination mode of plants, e.g. bee or fly pollinated. Our findings may help predict which plant species have the greatest importance in the functioning of plant-pollination networks.","[Carvalheiro, Luisa Gigante; Kunin, William E.] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Carvalheiro, Luisa Gigante; Biesmeijer, Jacobus Christiaan; Gomes, Sofia I.

Studies have focused on the relationship between male quality and the complexity of sexual ornaments; however, less is known of the communicative content of courtship displays, and whether they indicate the quality of resources males can provide to mates. Here, we used blue-black grassquits (Volatinia jacarina) to test the relationship between male display attributes and territory quality, measured as food availability. Our main hypothesis was that territory quality would be better predicted by dynamic displays than by static ornaments. During four breeding seasons in central Brazil, we quantified display song attributes (output and consistency) and the timing of nuptial molt. We measured territorial seed density, body condition, and ectoparasite infestation. We found a positive relationship between song output and territory seed density, suggesting this attribute provides a reliable indicator of territory quality. However, the timing of molt was unrelated to territory quality. Additionally, no other male attribute was associated with seed density.

Two congeneric floodplain antelope with broadly similar habitat use are puku (Kobus vardonii) and lechwe (K. leche). In Botswana, puku are restricted to a narrow band of floodplains along the Chobe River, whereas lechwe are far more abundant, with a distribution encompassing the Chobe Riveifiont, the Linyanti Swamps, Kwando River, and the Okavango Delta. We investigated factors to try to explain the contrasting distribution patterns of puku and lechwe, including seasonal diet composition and overlap, seasonal nutritional status as indicated by fecal nitrogen and phosphorus, and habitat selection. Dietary overlap ranged from 84% to 90% across seasons. Cynodon dactylon was the greatest contributor to the diets of both puku and lechwe, but there were differences in the relative contributions of particular grass species associated with uplands or floodplains. Fecal nitrogen and phosphorus did not differ between species and did not indicate nutritional deficiencies for either puku or lechwe. Habitat selection was broadly similar during the low-water season, but during the high-water season, puku moved from the floodplain into shrublands habitats, whereas lechwe remained on the floodplains. We hypothesize that increased predation risk during the high-water season, due to increased visual obstruction in shrublands, may limit abundance of puku in the study area.","[O'Shaughnessy, Ryan; Cain, James W., III; Owen-Smith, Norman] Univ Witwatersrand, Ctr African Ecol, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa","Cain, JW (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Ctr African Ecol, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",jwcain@nmsu.edu,"Owen-Smith, Norman/ABI-5113-2020","Owen-Smith, Norman/0000-0001-8429-1201",,,,52,10,11,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

The aim of the present work was to analyse the relationships between plant architecture and light partitioning within wheat-pea (Triticum aestivum-Pisum sativum) mixtures. An existing model for wheat was utilized and a new model for pea morphogenesis was developed. Both models were then used to assess the effects of architectural variations in light partitioning. Methods First, a deterministic model (L-Pea) was developed in order to obtain dynamic reconstructions of pea architecture. The L-Pea model is based on L-systems formalism and consists of modules for 'vegetative development' and 'organ extension'. A tripartite simulator was then built up from pea and wheat models interfaced with a radiative transfer model. Architectural parameters from both plant models, selected on the basis of their contribution to leaf area index (LAI), height and leaf geometry, were then modified in order to generate contrasting architectures of wheat and pea. Key results By scaling down the analysis to the organ level, it could be shown that the number of branches/tillers and length of internodes significantly determined the partitioning of light within mixtures. Temporal relationships between light partitioning and the LAI and height of the different species showed that light capture was mainly related to the architectural traits involved in plant LAI during the early stages of development, and in plant height during the onset of interspecific competition. Conclusions In silico experiments enabled the study of the intrinsic effects of architectural parameters on the partitioning of light in crop mixtures of wheat and pea. The findings show that plant architecture is an important criterion for the identification/breeding of plant ideotypes, particularly with respect to light partitioning.","[Barillot, Romain; Pierre Huynh] LUNAM Univ, Grp Ecole Super Agr, UPSP Legumineuses, F-49007 Angers 01, France; [Escobar-Gutierrez, Abraham J.; Combes, Didier] INRA, Equipe Ecophysiol Plantes Fourrageres, UR4 P3F, F-86600 Lusignan, France; [Fournier, Christian] INRA, UMR LEPSE 759, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Fournier, Christian] SupAgro, UMR LEPSE 759, F-34060 Montpellier, France","Combes, D (corresponding author), INRA, Equipe Ecophysiol Plantes Fourrageres, UR4 P3F, Le Chene RD 150,BP 6, F-86600 Lusignan, France.",didier.combes@lusignan.inra.fr,"Escobar-Gutierrez, Abraham/A-6613-2009; Barillot, Romain/G-2016-2012","Escobar-Gutierrez, Abraham/0000-0002-5111-9998; Barillot, Romain/0000-0002-9956-9103","'La Region Pays de la Loire', FranceRegion Pays de la Loire; 'La Region Poitou-Charentes', FranceRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine","This research is supported by 'La Region Pays de la Loire', France through a PhD fellowship to R.B.

Interaction outcomes are context-dependent when the sign and/or magnitude change as a function of the biotic or abiotic context. While context dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature is poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify variation in species interaction outcomes (competition, mutualism, or predation) for 247 published articles. Contrary to our expectations, variation in the magnitude of effect sizes did not differ among species interactions, and while mutualism was most likely to change sign across contexts (and predation least likely), mutualism did not strongly differ from competition. Both the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied the most along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a function of the presence/absence of a third species. However, the degree of context dependency across these context types was not consistent among mutualism, competition and predation studies. Surprisingly, study location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context dependency, with laboratory studies showing the highest variation in outcomes. We urge that studying context dependency per se, rather than focusing only on mean outcomes, can provide a general method for describing patterns of variation in nature.","[Chamberlain, Scott A.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX USA; [Bronstein, Judith L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA","Chamberlain, SA (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",myrmecocystus@gmail.com,,"Chamberlain, Scott/0000-0003-1444-9135","Wiess Career Development Chair at Rice University; NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1145588, 0949719]","For help in data collection, we thank Yosuke Akiyama, Neha Deshpande, Rohini Sigireddi and Prudence Sun.

In the last years, an increasing number of studies have investigated interspecific interactions under field and semi-field conditions although just a few number of works focused on egg parasitoids. In this work, we undertook a two-year study to investigate interspecific interactions between Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) and Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Vassiliev) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), two egg parasitoids of the pest Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) that co-occur in cultivated crops. Under semi-field (in out-door mesh cages) and field conditions, we investigated: 1) the seasonal occurrence of competing parasitoid species on sentinel egg masses; 2) the impact achieved by competing species on the shared host on naturally laid egg masses; 3) the outcome of intraguild interactions under controlled conditions. Results from sentinel egg masses showed that T. basalis occurs in May and successfully parasitizes hosts until the end of September/beginning of October, whereas O. telenomicida is mainly occurring in July-August. In both years, it was found that T. basalis is predominant. From naturally laid egg masses, results indicated that T. basalis achieves higher impact on the hosts, even in those egg masses which are parasitized by more than one female of different species (= multiparasitism). Results from manipulating intraguild interactions showed that T. basalis achieves higher impact on N. viridula when released alone, but it suffers from competition with O. telenomicida. The ecological factors that play a role in intraguild interactions in the context of biological control perspective are discussed.","[Peri, Ezio; Cusumano, Antonino; Amodeo, Valentina; Colazza, Stefano] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Agr & Forestali, Palermo, Italy; [Wajnberg, Eric] INRA, Sophia Antipolis, France","Cusumano, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Agr & Forestali, Palermo, Italy.",cusumanoantonino@unipa.it,"Wajnberg, Eric/A-4862-2009; Cusumano, Antonino/L-7375-2015","Wajnberg, Eric/0000-0002-6700-7114; Cusumano, Antonino/0000-0001-9663-9164; PERI, Ezio/0000-0002-1095-7258; colazza, stefano/0000-0001-8023-7814",Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme (IRSES)European Commission; project Better Understanding of Bugs for Improved Environment - BUGSIE [PIRSES-GA-2012-317981]; University of Palermo -Fondo Finalizzato alla Ricerca (FFR) bando,"This project was supported by the Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme (IRSES) with the project Better Understanding of Bugs for Improved Environment - BUGSIE (PIRSES-GA-2012-317981).

Rapid evolution of these proteins may underlie adaptive changes of sperm traits involved in different events leading to fertilization, although the selective forces underlying such rapid evolution are not well understood. A variety of selective forces may differentially affect several steps ending in fertilization, thus resulting in a compartmentalized adaptation of sperm proteins. Here we analyzed the evolution of genes associated to various events in the sperm's life, from sperm formation to sperm-egg interaction. Evolutionary analyses were performed on gene sequences from 17 mouse strains whose genomes have been sequenced. Four of these are derived from wild Mus musculus, M. domesticus, M. castaneus and M. spretus. We found a higher proportion of genes exhibiting a signature of positive selection among those related to sperm motility and sperm-egg interaction. Furthermore, sperm proteins involved in sperm-egg interaction exhibited accelerated evolution in comparison to those involved in other events. Thus, we identified a large set of candidate proteins for future comparative analyses of genotype-phenotype associations in spermatozoa of species subjected to different sexual selection pressures. Adaptive evolution of proteins involved in motility could be driven by sperm competition, since this selective force is known to increase the proportion of motile sperm and their swimming velocity. On the other hand, sperm proteins involved in gamete interaction could be coevolving with their egg partners through episodes of sexual selection or sexual conflict resulting in species-specific sperm-egg interactions and barriers preventing interspecies fertilization.","[Vicens, Alberto; Lueke, Lena; Roldan, Eduardo R.

However, biotic interactions may also be prominent in shaping geographical ranges, especially for parapatric species forming hybrid zones. Determining the relative effect of each factor and their interaction of the contact zone location has been difficult due to the lack of broad scale environmental data. Recent developments in species distribution modelling (SDM) now allow disentangling the relative contributions of climate and species' interactions in hybrid zones and their responses to future climate change. We investigated the moving hybrid zone between the breeding ranges of two parapatric passerines in Europe. We conducted SDMs representing the climatic conditions during the breeding season. Our results show a large mismatch between the realized and potential distributions of the two species, suggesting that interspecific interactions, not climate, account for the present location of the contact zone. The SDM scenarios show that the southerly distributed species, Hippolais polyglotta, might lose large parts of its southern distribution under climate change, but a similar gain of novel habitat along the hybrid zone seems unlikely, because interactions with the other species (H.icterina) constrain its range expansion. Thus, whenever biotic interactions limit range expansion, species may become trapped' if range loss due to climate change is faster than the movement of the contact zone. An increasing number of moving hybrid zones are being reported, but the proximate causes of movement often remain unclear. In a global context of climate change, we call for more interest in their interactions with climate change.","[Engler, J.

According to this idea, all species originally favored aquatic sites, and large, aggressive species displaced smaller ones to more terrestrial habitats, both ecologically and evolutionarily. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the role of a recently described, previously unsuspected member (D. folkertsi) of this assemblage. This species coexists in widespread sympatry with its larger, cryptic congener, D. quadramaculatus. The competition-predation hypothesis predicts that the smaller D. folkertsi is displaced to more terrestrial habitats by the larger, aggressive D. quadramaculatus. We did not find D. folkertsi farther from water than D. quadramaculatus. However, in streams where they are sympatric, D. folkertsi was more abundant in small tributaries while D. quadramaculatus predominated along the main stem. This pattern is consistent with niche compression associated with interspecific competition. In behavioral trials to test interactions between these two species, neither species from sympatric populations avoided other salamanders or their chemical cues. Salamander salamander aggression also appeared to be reduced. Each species from allopatric sites avoided other salamanders, regardless of species, and D. guadramaculatus significantly avoided chemical cues of other salamanders. While the general idea of the competition-predation hypothesis held, specific predictions failed. Therefore, we propose the competition-predation hypothesis be modified to account for each species of Desmognathus having a unique fundamental niche that then influences how they interact with sympatric congeners.","[Camp, Carlos D.; Mitchem, Joshua A.; Krieger, Thomas J.] Piedmont Coll, Dept Biol, Demorest, GA 30535 USA; [Wooten, Jessica A.; Corbet, Caitlin M.; Dulka, Eden A.] Univ Findlay, Dept Biol, Findlay, OH 45840 USA","Camp, CD (corresponding author), Piedmont Coll, Dept Biol, POB 10, Demorest, GA 30535 USA.",ccamp@piedmont.edu; wooten@findlay.edu; cmcorbet@tamu.edu; dulkae@findlay.edu; jmitchem1006@lions.piedmont.edu; tkrieger0622@lions.piedmon.edu,,,,,,38,8,8,0,11,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,SEP 27,2013,,3,,,,,499,506,,10.1643/CE-12-121,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,AG2WM,WOS:000335277800016,,,,,2021-09-21,

In the present study we examined the ecological impact of its arrival in the Mediterranean region. The spider mite and phytoseiid mite assemblages in various crop and non-crop plants in three areas of Valencia (Spain) were studied a few months before and 10 years after the invasion of T. evansi. According to rarefaction analyses, the invasion of T. evansi did not affect neither the total number of species in the mite community examined (spider mite and phytoseiid species) nor the number of species when the two communities were examined separately. However, after the invasion, the absolute and relative abundance of the native Tetranychus species was significantly reduced. Before the invasion, T. urticae and T. turkestani were the most abundant spider mites, accounting for 62.9 and 22.8 % of the specimens. After the invasion, T. evansi became the most abundant species, representing 60 % of the total spider mites recorded, whereas the abundance of T. urticae was significantly reduced (23 %). This reduction took place principally on non-crop plants, where native species were replaced by the invader. Null model analyses provided evidence for competition structuring the spider mite community on non-crop plants after the invasion of T. evansi. Resistance to acaricides, the absence of efficient native natural enemies, manipulation of the plant defenses and the web type produced by T. evansi are discussed as possible causes for the competitive displacement.","[Ferragut, Francisco; Pekas, Apostolos] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Valencia 46022, Spain","Ferragut, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",fjferrag@eaf.upv.es,"Pekas, Apostolos/J-8823-2017","Pekas, Apostolos/0000-0002-8209-3882; Ferragut, Francisco/0000-0003-1545-6011","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [AGL2003-0541, AGL2006-13232]",This work was supported by the projects AGL2003-0541 and AGL2006-13232 of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science.,,73,30,32,0,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

For example, altered predator-prey interactions may influence the dynamics of trophic cascades, affecting net primary production. In a three-year field experiment, we manipulated a plant-grasshopper-spider food chain in mesic tallgrass prairie to investigate the effects of temperature and food quality on grasshopper performance, and to understand the direct and indirect tritrophic interactions that contribute to trophic cascades. Because spiders are active at cooler temperatures than grasshoppers in our system, we hypothesized that predator effects would be strongest in cooled treatments, and weakest in warmed treatments. Grasshopper spider interactions were highly context-dependent and varied significantly with food quality, temperature treatment and year. Spiders most often reduced grasshopper survival in the cooled and ambient temperature treatments, but had little to no effect on grasshopper survival in the warmed treatments, as hypothesized. In some years, plants compensated for grasshopper herbivory and trophic cascades were not observed despite significant effects of predators on grasshopper survival. However, in the year they were observed, trophic cascades only occurred in cooled treatments where predator effects on grasshoppers were strongest. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change will require an understanding of how temperature influences species interactions. Our results demonstrate that changes in daily temperature regimes can alter predator-prey interactions among arthropods with consequences for ecosystem processes such as primary production and the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes.","[Laws, Angela Nardoni; Joern, Anthony] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Laws, AN (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",alaws@ksu.edu,,,NSF Kansas EPSCoR Ecological Forecasting Consortium; Kansas State Univ.

One fundamental pattern in macroecology is the interspecific relationship between local abundance and regional range size, which is generally considered to be positively linear. Here, we examine structural details of the relationship between abundance and range size in cyclic populations of small mammals and its long-term temporal variation. Location Finland. Methods We analysed 39years of trapping data of Rodentia and Soricomorpha collected in field and forest habitats across Finland. Abundance was measured as the mean population density of individuals, and range size as the number of grid cells occupied and sample occupancy. Data were analysed using linear mixed models. Results The relationship between mean local density and sample occupancy was generally linear, whereas the relationship between density and the number of grid cells occupied was generally curvilinear (U-shaped) for both habitats, being negative for species with small range sizes and positive for species with larger ranges. The curvilinearity was temporally consistent in both habitats. Main conclusions The interspecific relationship between abundance and range size varies depending on how range size is measured. Interestingly, the curvilinear relationship between density and range size was found in an assemblage in which many of the species have fluctuating (cyclic) populations. Future research on abundancerange size relationships should focus on long-term temporal variation to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop macroecological theory.","[Komonen, Atte] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Henttonen, Heikki] Finnish Forest Res Inst, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland; [Huitu, Otso] Finnish Forest Res Inst, FI-77600 Suonenjoki, Finland; [Nissinen, Kari] Univ Jyvaskyla, Finnish Inst Educ Res, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Komonen, A (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",atte.komonen@jyu.fi,,,,,,39,4,4,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

To prevent such critical transitions it is crucial to detect early warning signals. Increased patchiness' smaller and fewer vegetated patches is thought to be such a signal, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Facilitation between plants is known to be an important mechanism driving the patchiness of the vegetation, but we lack understanding of how interactions between plants change in response to combined effects of drought and consumer pressure the main stressors in many arid ecosystems. Over the last decade numerous experimental studies have tested how intensity of facilitation between plants changes with increasing stress. The most recent synthesis predicts a decline in facilitation intensity at the severe end of a drought stress gradient. Adding consumer pressure may result in even earlier and faster declines in facilitation intensity. So far, studies on critical transitions and plantplant interactions have developed separately. The relationship between stress and facilitation intensity has been overlooked in critical transition theory, while facilitation intensity may determine the position of a critical transition threshold. In this study, we incorporate experimental studies on the relation between stress and facilitation intensity into the critical transition framework, to improve our ability to predict critical transitions. Moreover, we propose that a decline in facilitation intensity at the severe end of a stress gradient may occur prior to a critical transition. Inclusion of consumer pressure will speed up this process, leading to earlier and faster degradation. In-field monitoring of seedlingfacilitator associations and declines in facilitator recruitment can indicate declines in facilitation intensity and may thus provide additional early warning signals for imminent critical transitions, besides increased patchiness.","[Verwijmeren, Mart; Rietkerk, Max; Wassen, Martin J.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Smit, Christian] Univ Groningen, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Community Ecol & Conservat Ecol Grp, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","Verwijmeren, M (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2,POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.verwijmeren@uu.nl,"smit, christian/B-9817-2008; Verwijmeren, Mart/L-5362-2013; Rietkerk, Max/H-6235-2011; Wassen, Martin J./L-9228-2013","smit, christian/0000-0002-4044-9473; Wassen, Martin J./0000-0002-9735-2103; Rietkerk, Max/0000-0002-2698-3848; Verwijmeren, Mart/0000-0002-8051-0697",NWO - ALW open competition grant (Netherlands Science Foundation - Earth and Life Sciences) [820.01.020]; ERA-Net on Complexity through the project RESINEE ('Resilience and interaction of networks in ecology and economics'); project CASCADE (Seventh Framework Programme) [283068],"We would like to thank Sonia Kefi and Jerry van Dijk for giving very useful feedback on previous versions of the manuscript.

Biotic influences could be especially important for relatively rare species. We investigated how rainfall, geology, land type and abundance of other ungulate species serving as competitors or prey for predators contributed to the patchy distribution of sable antelope herds within Kruger National Park. Data were provided by annual aerial surveys of ungulate populations conducted between 1978 and 1988. Sable herds were more commonly present on granitic and sandstone substrates than on more fertile basalt. They occurred both in the moist south-west and dry north of the park. They were most abundant in sour bushveld and mopane savanna woodland, and mostly absent from knob thorn-marula parkland. The presence of sable was negatively associated with high concentrations of impala and wildebeest, less consistently related to the abundance of zebra, and positively associated with the occurrence of buffalo herds. Best supported models included the separate effects of the most abundant grazers along with land type. Interspecific relationships seemed more consistent with vulnerability to predation as the underlying mechanism restricting the distribution of sable herds than with competitive displacement. Sable favoured land types distinct from those where wildebeest, the most preferred prey of lions, and impala, numerically the most important resident prey species, were most abundant. Hence the risk of predation, associated with habitat conditions where abundant prey species are most concentrated, can exert an overriding influence on the distribution of rarer species in terms of their home range occupation.","[Chirima, George J.; Owen-Smith, Norman; Erasmus, Barend F.

To gain a better understanding of how traits influence invasion, studies usually compare the invasive plant to a native congener, but there are few conspecific examples in the literature. In North America, the presence of native and introduced genetic lineages of the common reed, Phragmites australis, presents a unique example to evaluate how traits influence plant invasion. We reviewed the literature on functional traits of P. australis lineages in North America, specifically contrasting lineages present on the Atlantic Coast. We focused on differences in physiology between the lineage introduced from Eurasia and the lineage native to North America, specifically seeking to identify the causes underlying the recent expansion of the introduced lineage. Our goals were to better understand which traits may confer invasiveness, provide predictions of how these lineages may respond to interspecific competition or imminent global change, and provide guidance for future research. We reviewed published studies and articles in press, and conducted personal communications with appropriate researchers and managers to develop a comparative dataset. We compared the native and introduced lineages and focused on plant physiological ecology and functional traits. Under both stressful and favourable conditions, our review showed that introduced P. australis consistently exhibited greater ramet density, height and biomass, higher and more plastic relative growth rate, nitrogen productivity and specific leaf area, higher mass specific nitrogen uptake rates, as well as greater phenotypic plasticity compared with the native lineage. We suggest that eco-physiological and other plant functional traits elucidate potential-mechanisms for the introduced lineage's invasiveness under current and predicted global change conditions. However, our review identified a disconnect between field surveys, experiments, natural competition and plant ecophysiology that must be addressed in future field studies. Given the likelihood of hybridization between lineages, a better understanding of plant traits in native, non-native and hybrid lineages is needed to manage current invasions and to predict the outcome of interactions among novel genotypes. Comparative physiology and other plant functional traits may provide additional tools to predict the trajectory of current and potential future invasions.","[Mozdzer, Thomas J.] Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA; [Brisson, Jacques] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Hazelton, Eric L.

However, most studies have considered the influence of either niche breath or resource availability in isolation, while it is the interactive effects that are likely to influence local abundance. We examined geographic variation in the feeding ecology and distribution of coral-feeding butterflyfish to determine the influence of dietary specialization and dietary resource availability on their local abundance. Dietary composition and abundance of five butterflyfish and coral dietary resource availability were determined at 45 sites across five locations (Lizard Island and Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef; Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea; Noumea, New Caledonia; and Moorea, French Polynesia). Multiple regression models using variables representative of total dietary resource availability, availability of specific dietary resources, and interspecific competition were used to determine the best predictors of local abundance across all sites and locations for each species. Factors influencing local abundance varied between butterflyfish with specialized and generalized diets. Dietary resource availability had the strongest influence on the abundance of Chaetodon trifascialis-the most specialized species. Local abundance of C. trifascialis was best predicted by availability of the Acropora corals that it preferentially feeds on. In contrast, abundance of generalist butterflyfish was poorly described by variation in availability of specific resources. Rather, indices of total dietary resource availability best predicted their abundance. Overall, multiple regression models only explained a small proportion of the variation in local abundance for all five species. Despite their relatively specialized diets, dietary resource availability has limited influence on the local abundance of butterflyfish. Only the most specialized species appear to be consistently limited by prey availability. Local and total abundance of species are influenced by a wide range of different factors and there is definite need to conduct independent species assessments.","[Lawton, Rebecca J.; Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Lawton, RJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Rebecca.Lawton@my.jcu.edu.au,"Pratchett, Morgan S/A-9256-2010; Lawton, Rebecca/A-6149-2012; Lawton, Rebecca/E-5711-2014; Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020","Pratchett, Morgan S/0000-0002-1862-8459; Lawton, Rebecca/0000-0001-6296-6415; Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459",Queensland Government Smart State Ph.D. Scholarship; Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia; Australian Coral Reef Society,"Funded in part by a Queensland Government Smart State Ph.D. Scholarship and grants from the Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia, Project Aware, and the Australian Coral Reef Society to R.

Yet, very little is known how animals gather and integrate information about environmental factors to fine tune investment. Observing the decisions and success of other individuals, particularly when those individuals initiate breeding earlier, may provide a way for animals to quickly arrive at better breeding investment decisions. Here we show, with a field experiment using artificial nests appearing similar to resident tit nests with completed clutches, that a migratory bird can use the observed high and low clutch size of a resident competing bird species to increase and decrease clutch size and egg mass, accordingly. Our results demonstrate that songbirds can discriminate between high and low quantity of heterospecific eggs, and that social information can have long-term physiological consequences affecting reproductive strategies. Such behaviour may help animals to better adapt to changing environments and lead to convergent traits with competitors.","[Forsman, Jukka T.; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas; Nykanen, Inka L.] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Forsman, JT (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",jukka.forsman@oulu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [122665, 125720]",We acknowledge the financial support provided by the Academy of Finland (project nos. 122665 and 125720).

Sulfur, predatory mites, and powdery mildew have long been studied separately regarding their impacts on spider mites, but knowledge of their combined influence in that context is also needed to aid integrated pest and disease management. Therefore, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments to study the main and the interaction effects of sulfur, P. persimilis, P. aphanis, and T. urticae in strawberry leaf disc bioassays. The results showed that the predatory mite, powdery mildew, and sulfur had additive effects on reducing egg number and population growth of T. urticae. Compared to the control, populations of T. urticae on the leaf discs were decreased by 83%, 76%, and 61% after 5 days of treatment with sulfur + powdery mildew + predatory mites, mildew + predatory mites, and predatory mites alone, respectively. The survival and egg production of T. urticae females was affected to the greatest extent by P. persimilis, followed by powdery mildew. Residual sulfur had a short-term suppressive effect on T. urticae egg production but did not influence survival and reproduction of P. persimilis.

Such variation changes population dynamics via effects on the growth and reproduction of individuals. Also at the community level, theory predicts that animals can reduce competition for shared resources by changing diel activity in certain situations. However, the role of diel activity at the community-level has not been examined sufficiently. In this study, to examine whether the diel-scale temporal niche act as a competition-mitigating mechanism for stream fishes at the community level, we surveyed diel changes in microhabitat use and foraging, and the pattern of interspecific diet overlap in the middle reaches of a temperate stream where various fish species that seemed to be either nocturnal or diurnal coexisted. Our results suggest that the fishes forage during both daytime and night, but change their foraging mode at different times of the day, so that the foraging habits of these fish species cannot be divided simply into nocturnal and diurnal. Furthermore, fishes appeared to aggregate in the vicinity of common food resources during time zones with high availability of the resources, and therefore, inter-guild diet overlap was high during certain time zones. On the other hand, when inter-guild diet overlap was low, each fish species used foods or microhabitats that did not any have the potential to be used by species of another guild. Therefore, we conclude that variation in diel niche use is influenced by variation in the fundamental niche and food supply or availability rather than by competitive interaction between fishes in the stream fish community.","[Nakagawa, Hikaru; Yamane, Hideyuki; Yasugi, Masaki; Ashiwa, Hiroshi; Tominaga, Koji; Goto, Motoyasu] Kyoto Univ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Japan; [Fujita, Tomohiko] Civil Engn & Ecotechnol Consultants, Toyoshima Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Yokoi, Kenichi; Kitada, Naoki; Yamano, Hitomi; Ito, Takehiko] Kindai Univ, Nara 3327, Japan; [Takano, Hiroki] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Hikone, Shiga, Japan; [Suzuki, Noriyasu; Maruyama, Hiroaki; Hatakeyama, Emi] Mie Univ, Tsu, Mie 514, Japan; [Kishimoto, Junpei; Maeda, Hajime] Osaka Kyoiku Univ, Osaka 543, Japan; [Takahashi, Daisuke] Nagano Univ, Fac Tourism & Environm Studies, Nagano, Japan","Nakagawa, H (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Sakyo Ku, Oiwake Cho, Kyoto, Japan.",nakagawa@terra.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Yasugi, Masaki/0000-0001-7876-405X","Kansai Organization for Nature Conservation (KONC); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A06]","Katsutoshi Watanabe of Kyoto University provided valuable comments on the manuscript.

We used an artificial stream equipped with passive integrated transponder tag antenna arrays to monitor habitat use and movements of age-0 Atlantic salmon and age-0 smallmouth bass in sympatry and allopatry. We used additive and substitutive designs to test for changes in habitat use, diel movements, and diel activity patterns of prior-resident Atlantic salmon or smallmouth bass resulting from the addition of conspecifics or heterospecifics. Atlantic salmon prior residents did not change their habitat use in the presence of conspecific or heterospecific invaders. However, Atlantic salmon invaders did lessen riffle habitat use by smallmouth bass prior residents during daytime. Atlantic salmon and smallmouth bass displayed different diel activity patterns of movement (Atlantic salmon were more nocturnal; smallmouth bass were more diurnal), which were affected by heterospecific introductions. Because the two species tended to favor different habitat types and displayed different diel activity patterns, we suggest that under the conditions tested, the level of interspecific competition for habitat was low. Age-0 Atlantic salmon and smallmouth bass may be able to avoid intense interspecific competition through spatial and temporal habitat partitioning. These data do not, however, predict the potential for competition under different seasonal or ontogenetic circumstances.","[Wathen, Gus; Zydlewski, Joseph; Coghlan, Stephen M., Jr.] Univ Maine, Dept Wildlife Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Trial, Joan G.] Maine Dept Marine Resources, Bangor, ME 04401 USA","Zydlewski, J (corresponding author), Univ Maine, US Geol Survey, Maine Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",jzydlewski@usga.gov,,"Zydlewski, Joseph/0000-0002-2255-2303",University of Maine; Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station; U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; Maine Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Outdoor Heritage Fund; Maine Department of Marine Resources,"We thank Wes Ashe, James Osenton, Scott Ouellette, Megan Patridge, Janice Hubner, and Silas Ratten for their assistance in the laboratory.

Fossil records for mollusks, mammals, trees, and other taxa show that with rare exception, ecologically similar species have coexisted for a million years or more after interchange between formerly isolated realms. This coexistence suggests the possibility, termed the universal trade-off hypothesis, that ecologically similar species of different realms have been bound to the same interspecific trade-off surface despite millions of years of independent evolution. Such persistence fails to support the biogeographic superiority hypothesis, which posits that genetic drift, recombination, mutation, and selection would cause taxa of one realm to gain superiority over those of another realm during long periods of isolation. Analysis of the lengths of time that species have persisted once in contact suggests that the trade-off surfaces of realms differed by <0.1% at the time of interchange. This implies that macroevolutionary patterns of differentiation and speciation within and between realms were more likely the movement of traits on a common trade-off surface rather than directional selection achieved without compensatory trade-offs and costs. The existence of transrealm trade-offs, should further work support this possibility, has deep implications for ecology and evolution.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Tilman, D (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",tilman@umn.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"I thank B.

Amphibians often use ephemeral ponds and have been shown to experience priority effects from interspecific competition. Pesticide exposure can impact amphibian species interactions like competition, and has been linked to declines. We investigated whether insecticide exposure interacted with colonization history to impact priority effects in Bufo americanus and Rana pipiens. We predicted that exposure to the insecticide carbaryl and colonization history would affect tadpole metamorphosis independently and interactively. Our results indicated that Bufo time to metamorphosis experienced priority effects: Bufo introduced early reached metamorphosis sooner when Rana were absent, but Bufo introduced late reached metamorphosis sooner when Rana were also late. Insecticide exposure eliminated differences in Bufo time to metamorphosis due to Rana colonization history. Rana survival and mass at metamorphosis were affected by intraspecific colonization history. Bufo had significantly fewer survivors and Rana had more survivors in insecticide-exposed treatments. Bufo did better when reared without Rana, but Rana was unaffected by Bufo presence. The effects on anuran metamorphosis occurred without any effects on periphyton abundance. We suggest that the effects of insecticide exposure on amphibian metamorphosis are not related to colonization history, although each factor alone can have substantial impacts. These results preliminarily suggest that managing pesticide applications with sensitivity to amphibians may be less complex than implied by traditional food web theory, although more research is needed.","[Distel, Christopher A.] Schreiner Univ, Dept Biol, Kerrville, TX 78028 USA; [Distel, Christopher A.; Boone, Michelle D.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Distel, CA (corresponding author), Schreiner Univ, Dept Biol, 2100 Mem Blvd, Kerrville, TX 78028 USA.",cadistel@schreiner.edu,,,U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0717088]; Miami University,"We wish to thank Nick Webber, Sarah Distel, Jennifer Purrenhage, Holly Puglis, Tamara McPeek, Mark Mackey, and Rodney Kolb for their valuable help on the execution of this project.

Each species exhibited a unique suite of behavioral responses associated with species and competitor size. Ambystoma opacum displayed high levels of aggression, most often towards conspecifics, but these behaviors rarely resulted in predation. Conversely, A. jeffersonianum displayed aggression frequently and often consumed both con- and heterospecific larvae. Furthermore, this species did not reduce aggression even in the presence of larger larvae. Ambystoma maculatum displayed relatively low levels of aggression under most circumstances. We conclude that these characteristic responses are associated with species-specific morphological and developmental features and the temporally staggered pattern in which these species appear in ponds. These observations highlight the importance of these traits to behavioral divergence among ecologically similar taxa occurring in sympatry.","[Mott, Cy L.] Kentucky Wesleyan Coll, Dept Biol, Owensboro, KY 42301 USA; [Maret, Timothy J.] Shippensburg Univ, Dept Biol, Shippensburg, PA 17257 USA","Mott, CL (corresponding author), Kentucky Wesleyan Coll, Dept Biol, Owensboro, KY 42301 USA.",cy.mott@gmail.com; tjmare@ship.edu,,,,,,43,10,10,0,19,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS,CHARLESTON,"UNIV CHARLESTON, GRICE MARINE LABORATORY, 205 FORT JOHNSON RD, CHARLESTON, SC 29412 USA",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,MAR 14,2011,,1,,,,,9,17,,10.1643/CE-09-065,,,9,Zoology,Zoology,741UA,WOS:000288889400002,,,,,2021-09-21,

To parameterize this realized niche, species distribution models (SDMs) most often relate species occurrence data to abiotic variables, but few SDM studies include biotic predictors to help explain species distributions. Therefore, most predictions of species distributions under future climates assume implicitly that biotic interactions remain constant or exert only minor influence on large-scale spatial distributions, which is also largely expected for species with high competitive ability. We examined the extent to which variance explained by SDMs can be attributed to abiotic or biotic predictors and how this depends on species traits. We fit generalized linear models for 11 common tree species in Switzerland using three different sets of predictor variables: biotic, abiotic, and the combination of both sets. We used variance partitioning to estimate the proportion of the variance explained by biotic and abiotic predictors, jointly and independently. Inclusion of biotic predictors improved the SDMs substantially. The joint contribution of biotic and abiotic predictors to explained deviance was relatively small (similar to 9%) compared to the contribution of each predictor set individually (similar to 20% each), indicating that the additional information on the realized niche brought by adding other species as predictors was largely independent of the abiotic (topo-climatic) predictors. The influence of biotic predictors was relatively high for species preferably growing under low disturbance and low abiotic stress, species with long seed dispersal distances, species with high shade tolerance as juveniles and adults, and species that occur frequently and are dominant across the landscape. The influence of biotic variables on SDM performance indicates that community composition and other local biotic factors or abiotic processes not included in the abiotic predictors strongly influence prediction of species distributions. Improved prediction of species' potential distributions in future climates and communities may assist strategies for sustainable forest management.","[Meier, Eliane S.; Kienast, Felix; Pearman, Peter B.; Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, Dept Biol Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS UMR 5553, FR-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Araujo, Miguel B.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, ES-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Araujo, Miguel B.] Univ Evora, Rui Nabeiro Biodivers Chair, CIBIO, PT-7000 Evora, Portugal; [Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Inst Geol & Paleontol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Meier, ES (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",eliane.meier@wsl.ch,"Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Meier, Eliane S/D-5214-2012; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011; Araujo, Miguel/B-6117-2008; Kienast, Felix/L-3536-2013; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; Svenning, Jens-Christian/Y-3318-2019; Pearman, Peter B/C-6298-2011; Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/0000-0002-5107-7265; Meier, Eliane S/0000-0002-9545-1167; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815; Araujo, Miguel/0000-0002-5107-7265; Kienast, Felix/0000-0002-3812-3124; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Pearman, Peter B/0000-0002-0794-101X; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274",6th European Framework Programme (Ecochange)European Commission [GOCE-CT-2007-036866]; 7th European Framework Programme (MOTIVE) [ENV-CT-2009-226544]; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR 07 BDIV 014]; MCeI [CGL2008-01198-E/BOS]; Danish Natural Science Research CouncilDanish Natural Science Research Council [272-07-0242],"We thank all members of the Riederalp workshop 2008 (The utility of species distribution models as tools for assessing impacts of global change) for helpful discussions.

In this paper I use data on the PSA of two forest guenons, Campbell's (Cercopithecus campbelli) and lesser spot-nosed monkeys (C. petaurista), with Diana monkeys (C. diana) and other primates to clarify interspecific relationships during 17 months including a 3-month low-fruit period. I analyzed association in relation to fruit availability and measured forest strata use for C. campbelli and C. petaurista when alone and in associations with and without C. diana. I also measured predator risk and reactions to potential predators. C. campbelli and C. petaurista had high association rates with C. diana monkeys, and fruit availability did not influence association rates. C. campbelli and C. petaurista used higher strata when in association with C. diana than when alone, but they used even higher strata when associated with other primates without C. diana. This suggested that C. diana competitively exclude C. campbelli and C. petaurista from higher strata. There were relatively large numbers of potential predators, and C. diana were usually the first callers to threatening stimuli, suggesting that antipredator benefits of association with C. diana outweighed the competitive costs. C. campbelli spent more time in association with C. diana than C. petaurista did and appeared to be more reliant on C. diana for antipredator benefits. C. petaurista were less reliant on C. diana because of a cryptic strategy and may have associated less in some months because of high chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) presence.","[Buzzard, Paul J.] Columbia Univ, Dept Anthropol, NYCEP, New York, NY 10027 USA","Buzzard, PJ (corresponding author), CERS, Southmark Tower B 2707,11 Yip Hing St, Wong Chuk Hang, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",p_buzzard@yahoo.com,,,Leakey Foundation,"I would like to thank the minister of the environment and the forest, the minister of scientific research, the director of the Center for Ecological Research at Tai and the PACPNT of Cote d'Ivoire for giving me permission to work at Tai National Park.

Here, we explored near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict the proportion of woody fine roots in mixed samples and analyzed whether the prediction quality of NIRS models is related to the complexity of the fine-root mixture. For model calibration and validation purposes, 11 series of artificial mixed species samples containing known amounts of fine roots of up to four temperate tree species and non-woody plants were prepared. Three types of models with different calibration/validation approaches were developed and tested against external independent data for additional validation. With these models the proportion of each species in root mixtures was predicted accurately with low standard error of prediction (RMSECV/RMSEP < 6.5%) and high coefficient of determination (r(2) > 0.93) for all fine-root mixtures. In addition, NIRS models also provided satisfactory estimates for samples with low (< 15%) or no content of particular components. The predictive power of the NIRS models did not decrease substantially with increasing complexity of the root samples. The approach presented here is a promising alternative to hand sorting of fine roots, which may be influenced substantially by operator variation, and it will facilitate investigating belowground interactions between woody species.","[Lei, Pifeng; Bauhus, Juergen] Univ Freiburg, Inst Silviculture, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Lei, Pifeng] Cent S Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China","Lei, PF (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Silviculture, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",pifeng.lei@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de,"Lei, Pifeng/AAB-4847-2020; Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013","Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"We are grateful to Julia Sohn, Adam Benneter, Grit Techel and Zhanying Gu for assistance with sample collection.

Mosquitoes able to monopolize treeholes with optimal resources may be over-represented in the community. Aedes sierrensis, which is well adapted for the Mediterranean climate of California, has evolved in the absence of interspecific competition, so oviposition should reflect resource quality to a large extent. Artificial oviposition traps mounted at four canopy heights facing north or south on trees in a mixed-oak forest at four elevations of the Pacific Coastal Range were used to assess vertical ovipositional preferences by the western treehole mosquito. Natural dispersal of the ciliated protozoan parasite Lambornella clarki was similarly monitored. Gravid Ae. sierrensis showed no vertical stratification during egg laying in traps. Lambornella clarki were naturally dispersed at relatively low frequency into traps and persisted unless eliminated by larval predation. Aedes sierrensis is not currently constrained into occupying a subset of treeholes. However, invasion of its native range by competitive species may alter oviposition patterns.

Negative interspecific interactions, such as resource competition or reproductive interference, can lead to the displacement of species (species exclusion). 2. Here, we investigated the effect of life history, mating behaviour and adaptation to insecticides on species exclusion between cryptic whitefly species that make up the Bemisia tabaci species complex. We conducted population cage experiments independently in China, Australia, the United States and Israel to observe patterns of species exclusion between an invasive species commonly referred to as the B biotype and three other species commonly known as biotypes ZHJ1, AN and Q. 3. Although experimental conditions and species varied between regions, we were able to predict the observed patterns of exclusion in each region using a stochastic model that incorporated data on development time, mating behaviour and resistance to insecticides. 4. Between-species variation in mating behaviour was a more significant factor affecting species exclusion than variation in development time. Specifically, the ability of B to copulate more effectively than other species resulted in a faster rate of population increase for B, as well as a reduced rate of population growth for other species, leading to species exclusion. The greater ability of B to evolve resistance to insecticides also contributed to exclusion of other species in some cases. 5. Results indicate that an integrative analysis of the consequences of variation in life-history traits, mating behaviours and adaption to insecticides could provide a robust framework for predicting species exclusion following whitefly invasions.","[Crowder, David W.; Showalter, Ann M.; Carriere, Y.] Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Crowder, David W.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Horowitz, A.

The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of post-metamorphic green frogs (Rana clamitans) on post-metamorphic American toads (Bufo americanus) in the terrestrial environment as a model for understanding how interspecific differences in size at metamorphosis may influence terrestrial interactions. We examined if caged, uncaged or no green frogs affected survival, growth and hiding behavior of recently metamorphosed American toads in a replicated laboratory experiment. Green frogs did not appear to prey upon small American toads. However, by the end of the experiment American toad survival was lowest in treatments with uncaged green frogs; this result suggests that green frogs may outcompete American toads for food, but such impacts in nature may be limited or may have selected for spatial segregation in the terrestrial environment. Green frogs also increased hiding activity of toads at sonic times, which may in part explain the trend of reduced mass gained when toads were reared with green frogs. Thus study represents one of the first to examine interspecific interactions among anurans with complex life cycles in the terrestrial environment.","[Sams, Erin; Boone, Michelle D.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Boone, MD (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 212 Pearson Hall, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",boonemd@muohio.edu,,,Miami University,"We thank M.

This is surprising because based on the principle of competitive exclusion one would predict that the superior competitor would drive the other species to extinction; coexistence is only predicted if interspecific competition is weaker than intraspecific competition. Interspecific competition is frequently reduced by differential resource use, resulting in habitat segregation. In this paper, we use the closely related collared and pied flycatcher to assess the potential of habitat differences to affect interspecific competition through a different mechanism, namely by generating temporal differences in availability of similar food resources between the two species. We found that the tree species composition of the breeding territories of the two species differed, mainly by a higher abundance of coniferous species around nest-boxes occupied by pied flycatchers. The temporal availability of caterpillars was measured using frass traps under four deciduous and two coniferous tree species. Deciduous tree species showed an early and narrow peak in abundance, which contrasted with the steady increase in caterpillar abundance in the coniferous tree species through the season. We subsequently calculated the predicted total caterpillar biomass available in each flycatcher territory. This differed between the species, with biomass decreasing more slowly in pied flycatcher territories. Caterpillar biomass is strongly correlated with the reproductive success of collared flycatchers, but much less so with pied flycatchers. However, caterpillar availability can only partly explain the differences in seasonal decline of reproductive success between the two species; we discuss additional factors that may contribute to this species difference. Overall, our results are consistent with the suggestion that minor habitat differences between these two species may contribute to promoting their coexistence.","[Veen, Thor] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Sch Biosci, Penryn TR10 9EZ, England; [Veen, Thor; Weissing, Franz J.] Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, NL-9751 NN Haren, Netherlands; [Veen, Thor; Saetre, Glenn-Peter] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Sheldon, Ben C.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Visser, Marcel E.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; [Qvarnstrom, Anna] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Veen, T (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Sch Biosci, Cornwall Campus, Penryn TR10 9EZ, England.",t.veen@exeter.ac.uk,"Visser, Marcel E/A-9151-2009; Sheldon, Ben C/A-8056-2010","Visser, Marcel E/0000-0002-1456-1939; Sheldon, Ben C/0000-0002-5240-7828; Weissing, Franz J./0000-0003-3281-663X; Qvarnstrom, Anna/0000-0002-1178-4053",Netherlands Organization for Scientific ResearchNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [NWO-ALW 812.04.001]; Marie Curie ESTEuropean Commission [MEST-CT-2005-020932]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas; Royal Swedish Academy of Science,"We would like to thank Lars Gustafsson and Johan Tr V for granting access to work in their nest-box areas.

Species-specific shifts in reproductive phenology may alter the assemblages of plant species in flower at any given time during the growing season. Temporal overlap in the flowering periods (co-flowering) of animal-pollinated species may influence reproductive success if competitive or facilitative interactions between plant species affect pollinator services. We used a 33-year data set on flowering phenology in subalpine meadows ill Colorado, USA, to determine whether interannual variation in snowmelt date, which marks the start of the growing season, affected co-flowering patterns. For two of four species considered, we found a significant relationship between snowmelt timing and composition of the assemblage of co-flowering plants. In years of early snowmelt, Lathyrus lanszwertii var. leucanthus (Fabaceac), the Species we investigated in most detail, tended to overlap with earlier-flowering species and with fewer species overall. In particular, overlap with the flowering period of Lupinus polyphyllus var. prunophilus, with which Lathyrus leucanthus shares pollinators. was significantly reduced ill early-snowmelt years. The observed association between timing of snowmelt and patterns of flowering overlap could not have been predicted simply by examining temporal trends in the dates of peak flowering of the dominant species in the community, its peak flowering dates have largely shifted in parallel with respect to snowmelt date. However, Subtle interspecific differences in responsiveness of flowering time, duration, and intensity to interannual climate variation have likely contributed to the observed relationship. Although much of the year-to-year variation in flowering overlap remains unexplained by snowmelt date, our finding of a Measurable signal of climate variation Suggests that future climate change may lead to altered competitive environments for these wildflower species.","[Forrest, Jessica; Thomson, James D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; [Forrest, Jessica; Inouye, David W.; Thomson, James D.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Inouye, David W.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Forrest, J (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",jessica.forrest@utoronto.ca,"Inouye, David W./C-2997-2011; Forrest, Jessica/A-6290-2010","Inouye, David W./0000-0003-2076-7834; Forrest, Jessica/0000-0002-5273-9339","the National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 75-15422, DEB 78-07784, BSR 81-08387, DEB 94-08382, IBN-98-14509, DEB-0238331]; Sigma Xi; NDEA; University of Maryland's General Research Board; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council or CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les TechnologiesFQRNT","We are grateful to the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory for providing research facilities and access to study sites, to billy barr for collecting snowpack data, and to the many people who helped count flowers in the phenology plots.

We used negative binomial generalized linear mixed models with fixed effects to estimate seasonal population-level resource selection at two spatial resolutions for female brown bears (Ursus arctos) and female American black bears (U. americanus) in southcentral Alaska during May-September 2000. Black bears selected areas occupied by brown bears during spring which may be related to spatially restricted (i.e., restricted to low elevations) but dispersed or patchy availability of food. In contrast, black bears avoided areas occupied by brown bears during summer. Brown bears selected areas near salmon streams during summer, presumably to access spawning salmon. Use of areas with high berry production by black bears during summer appeared in response to avoidance of areas containing brown bears. Berries likely provided black bears a less nutritious, but adequate food source. We suggest that during summer, black bears were displaced by brown bears, which supports distribution theory in that black bears appeared to be partially constrained from areas containing salmon, resulting in their use of areas containing less nutritious forage. Spatial segregation of brown and American black bears apparently occurs when high-quality resources are spatially restricted and alternate resources are available to the subordinate species.

Between 19 June and 19 July 2003, we collected 71 recently metamorphosed Rana areolata (Crawfish Frogs) and 69 recently metamorphosed R. sphenocephala (Southern Leopard Frogs) from a single pond In northeastern Oklahoma and compared their morphology and diet. We found that recently metamorphosed R. areolata and R. sphenocephala are morphologically similar. Further, diets of both species were similar: hemipterans predominated, prey Items were similarly sized, and dietary niche breadths overlapped, but R. areolata had significantly lower volumes of prey in their stomachs. Because of the high risk of desiccation, especially in Great Plains populations, newly metamorphosed Rana are not expected to disperse far from their natal ponds. During this first season, Rana also experience rapid growth. Dietary restrictions directly Influence growth rate, which in turn are known to have major consequences during later life stages, ultimately affecting fitness. Rana areolata Is a species of conservation concern across Its range. Competitive Interactions with other species of Rana have been proposed to be contributing to declines in R. areolata.

Using bark beetles that colonize the same habitat as an example, we explore species interactions in a resource-based model system with positive feedback between insect abundance and resource availability. The net interspecies interaction was found to be highly dynamic and may alternate in time between competition and mutualism. When both bark beetle species were able to kill trees (aggressive), our simulations showed strong facilitations between beetle species. This may lead to escape from control by competition, and increase the frequency of outbreaks of tree-killing. The frequency of net positive interactions varied with interaction strengths and the relative aggressiveness of the species and was highest when both species were strongly aggressive; which predicts disastrous outbreaks if, e.g., the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus and the North American spruce beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis should become interacting species due to introductions. In imbalanced pairs, the relatively less aggressive species was facilitated more often than the aggressive species. Net positive interactions did not occur for strongly inferior species, but their survival was an increasing function of interaction strength with aggressive species and availability of resources. The benefits for the inferior species in the model are consistent with the structure of one aggressive and several less aggressive or non-aggressive species, which is common in bark beetle communities in many parts of the world.","[Okland, Bjorn; Kausrud, Kyrre] Norwegian Forest & Landscape Inst, NO-1431 As, Norway; [Skarpaas, Olav] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Kausrud, Kyrre] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway","Okland, B (corresponding author), Norwegian Forest & Landscape Inst, POB 115, NO-1431 As, Norway.",bjorn.okland@skogoglandskap.no; olav.skarpaas@nina.no; kyrre.kausrud@bio.uio.no,,"Skarpaas, Olav/0000-0001-9727-1672",Norwegian Research Council (FRIBIO)Research Council of Norway; Norwegian Food Safety Authority,"This study was financially supported by the Norwegian Research Council (FRIBIO) and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority.

We examined the partitioning of cavity resources by Red-and-green Macaws (Ara chloropterus), Blue-and-yellow Macaws (A. ararauna), and Scarlet Macaws (A. macao) in the lowland forest of southeast Peru. Red-and-green Macaws nested primarily in cavities in emergent Dipteryx trees, and Blue-and-yellow Macaws nested predominantly in palm snags. Scarlet Macaws had the broadest nesting niche, and their use of cavities overlapped that of the other two species. These differences in cavity use may be related to differences in size, with Red-and-green Macaws the largest of the three species (90 cm long, 1050-1320 g), followed by Scarlet Macaws (85 cm long, 1060-1123 g) and Blue-and-yellow Macaws (70 cm long, 1086 g). We did not observe interspecific conflicts between Blue-and-yellow Macaws and the other two species. However, Scarlet and Red-and-green macaws frequently compete for cavities, perhaps contributing to the use of a wider range of cavity resources by the smaller, less competitive Scarlet Macaws. For the three macaw species combined, 40 of 84 nests (48%) were successful, fledging either one or two young (mean = 1.4 +/- 0.43). The overall reproductive output (including failed nests) was 0.60 +/- 0.68 fledglings per nesting pair, with no difference between macaw species (P > 0.18). A lack of alternative nest substrates for large macaws may drive resource partitioning by sympatric species, with specialization on either emergent trees or palm snags, whereas less competitive species like Scarlet Macaws need to be flexible and use a variety of nest sites.","[Renton, Katherine] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Estac Biol Chamela, San Patricio 48980, Jalisco, Mexico; [Brightsmith, Donald J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Vet Pathol, Schubot Exot Bird Hlth Ctr, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Renton, K (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Estac Biol Chamela, Aptdo Postal 21, San Patricio 48980, Jalisco, Mexico.",krenton@ibiologia.unam.mx,,"Brightsmith, Donald/0000-0002-3306-6490","Wildlife Conservation Society (Manu); Earthwatch Institute, Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center; Rainforest Expeditions (Tambopata); Nacional de Recursos Naturales (INRENA) in Peru","The research was supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society (Manu), Earthwatch Institute, Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center, and Rainforest Expeditions (Tambopata).

However, predators can also reduce prey densities by forcing prey to adopt costly defensive strategies. Methodology/Principal Findings: We build on a simple Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model to provide a heuristic tool for distinguishing between the demographic effects of consumption (consumptive effects) and of anti-predator defenses (nonconsumptive effects), and for distinguishing among the multiple mechanisms by which anti-predator defenses might reduce prey population growth rates. We illustrate these alternative pathways for nonconsumptive effects with selected empirical examples, and use a meta-analysis of published literature to estimate the mean effect size of each pathway. Overall, predation risk tends to have a much larger impact on prey foraging behavior than measures of growth, survivorship, or fecundity. Conclusions/Significance: While our model provides a concise framework for understanding the many potential NCE pathways and their relationships to each other, our results confirm empirical research showing that prey are able to partially compensate for changes in energy income, mitigating the fitness effects of defensive changes in time budgets. Distinguishing the many facets of nonconsumptive effects raises some novel questions, and will help guide both empirical and theoretical studies of how predation risk affects prey dynamics.","[Preisser, Evan L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrative Biol, Austin, TX USA","Preisser, EL (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",preisser@uri.edu,"Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015; Preisser, Evan/C-3469-2013","Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296; Preisser, Evan/0000-0002-8737-5619","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0089716, DEB-0072909]; University of Texas at Austin; Center for Population Biology at the University of California at Davis; University of California, Santa Barbara CampusUniversity of California System","The authors were supported by NSF grant# DEB-0089716 to M.

We analysed a collection of rumen contents samples from sympatric populations of red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus and tested several theoretical predictions relating to the impact of intrinsic and environmental constraints on diet composition, diversity and similarity. Red deer consumed more slowly digestible, fibrous forage than roe deer and had a more diverse diet throughout the year, which supports predictions deriving from specific body size and morpho-physiological characteristics. In conformity with the optimal foraging theory, both species consumed more slowly digestible forage in times of low food availability (i.e. during winter) than during the rest of the year. An increase in diet similarity in winter, along with predictions from the theory on competitive interaction processes, led us to assume that food resources were not limiting and that exploitative competition between red and roe deer was unlikely in our study area. We underline the importance of studies of the use of food resources by sympatric herbivores in answering applied ecological questions at the local scale, and we suggest that the Euclidean geometrical approach we used is particularly well suited for the analysis of resource matrices, a common end-product of long-term field data gathering on the feeding habits of animals.","[Storms, David; Hamann, Jean-Luc; Said, Sonia; Saint-Andrieux, Christine; Klein, Francois] Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, Ctr Natl Etude & Rech Appl Cervides Sanglier, F-55000 Bar Le Duc, France; [Aubry, Philippe] Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, Direct Etud & Rech, F-78612 Le Perray En Yvelines, France; [Fritz, Herve] CNRS, UPR 1934, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France","Storms, D (corresponding author), Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, Ctr Natl Etude & Rech Appl Cervides Sanglier, 1 Pl Exelmans, F-55000 Bar Le Duc, France.",david.storms@oncfs.gouv.fr; philipe.aubry@oncfs.gouv.fr; petitepierre@oncfs.gouv.fr; sonia.said@oncfs.gouv.fr; fritz@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr; christine.saint-andrieux@oncfs.gouv.fr; francois.klein@oncfs.gouv.fr,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661; SAID, Sonia/0000-0003-1485-8297",,,,100,49,51,0,37,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,1903-220X,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,JUN,2008,14,2,,,,,237,250,,10.2981/0909-6396(2008)14[237:SVIDCA]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,331QK,WOS:000258027500008,,,,,2021-09-21,

The supply of a resource and a consumer's density response to it may in turn yield context-dependent use of other resources. Such consumer resource interactions occur not only for predator prey and competitive interactions, but for mutualistic ones as well. For example, consumer resource interactions between ants and extrafloral nectar (EFN) plants are often mutualistic, as EFN resources attract and reward ants which protect plants from herbivory. Yet, ants also commonly exploit floral resources, leading to antagonistic consumer resource interactions by disrupting pollination and plant reproduction. EFN resources associated with mutualistic ant-plant interactions may also mediate antagonistic ant flower interactions through the aggregative density response of ants on plants, which could either exacerbate ant-flower interactions or alternatively satiate and distract ants from floral resources. In this study, we examined how EFN resources mediate the density response of ants on senita cacti in the Sonoran Desert and their context-dependent use of floral resources. Removal of EFN resources reduced the aggregative density of ants on plants, both on hourly and daily time scales. Yet, the increased aggregative ant density on plants with EFN resources decreased rather than increased ant use of floral resources, including contacts with and time spent in flowers. Behavioral assays showed no confounding effect of floral deterrents on ant flower interactions. Thus, ant use of floral resources depends on the supply of EFN resources, which mediates the potential for both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions by increasing the aggregative density of ants protecting plants, while concurrently distracting ants from floral resources. Nevertheless, only certain years and populations of study showed an increase in plant reproduction through herbivore protection or ant distraction from floral resources. Despite pronounced effects of EFN resources mediating the aggregative density of ants on plants and their context-dependent use of floral resources, consumer resource interactions remained largely commensalistic.","[Chamberlain, Scott A.; Holland, J.

It also provides an opportunity to cite important earlier research, not readily available through electronic search engines, thus bringing it into current literature to avoid its disappearance into Internet obscurity. We comment on some papers in the literature to correct errors detected and to emphasize the importance of due care in all aspects of a research project, including its reporting. We show that both floristic and structural components have been reported as important to an understanding of habitat and microhabitat selection by R. lutreolus and conclude that it is vegetation density that is of paramount importance. Female R. lutreolus are clearly dominant in driving microhabitat selection, occupying the 'best' or densest habitats with male R. lutreolus occupying the next best and Pseudomys or other species, where present occupying the remainder. This demonstrates the important role that intraspecific and interspecific competition play in determining habitat selection. Direct predation and the perception of predation risk may also play a role in habitat selection, again perceived to be pushing individuals towards denser vegetation, representing 'better cover'. Whether these effects operate as bottom-up or top-down needs careful consideration. Climatic variables, such as ENSO-affecting productivity, and related variables such as temperature and humidity may also play important roles in habitat selection, as can disturbance effects such as wildfire. The relative importance of all of these potential determining factors may vary from place to place, particularly when climatic clines are involved.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; Australian Catholic Univ, Ctr Environm Restorat & Stewardship, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Fox, BJ (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",b.fox@unsw.edu.au,"Fox, Barry J/C-4491-2008; Monamy, Vaughan/G-1715-2011",,,,,114,15,16,2,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,DEC,2007,32,8,,,,,837,849,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01849.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,228VM,WOS:000250760700001,,,,,2021-09-21,

These studies provide a new theoretical framework for explaining resource partitioning patterns among African ungulates that coexist in spatially heterogeneous savanna grasslands. According to these studies, different-sized ungulates can coexist because larger species forage at a coarser scale but can tolerate lower quality food, whereas smaller species need higher quality food but forage at a finer scale. To test this hypothesis in an African savanna, we created an experimental mosaic with variation in grain ( spatial detail) and quality of short-grass patches and directly observed the visitation of naturally occurring grazers to this mosaic over a two-year period ( total of 903 observation hours). Of the seven species that visited our experiment, warthog, impala, zebra, and white rhino visited long enough to allow data analysis. We showed that warthog and impala avoided plots with a finer grain of short grass and that warthog preferred fertilized plots to unfertilized plots. Zebra and white rhino did not avoid the finer grain plots. Our results suggest that differences in grain and quality of a resource might indeed contribute to partitioning of this resource by savanna ungulates. Although four focal species is unusually high for an experimental study on resource partitioning among naturally occurring savanna ungulates, this number is too low to evaluate the allometric basis of our hypothesis. Our results, however, encourage wider experimental testing of the role of spatial heterogeneity in facilitating the coexistence of potentially competing savanna herbivores.","Univ Groningen, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Community & Conservat Ecol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Cromsigt, JPGM (corresponding author), Van Speykstr 40, NL-9726 BN Groningen, Netherlands.",jcromsigt@hotmail.com,"Olff, Han/A-8516-2008","Olff, Han/0000-0003-2154-3576; Cromsigt, Joris/0000-0002-8632-9469",,,,38,78,80,0,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2006,87,6,,,,,1532,1541,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1532:RPASGM]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,058IJ,WOS:000238658400022,16869429,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

However, in the case of introduced predators, prey populations might lack the behavioural traits to escape predation. We studied responses of native voles to removal of an alien predator, the American mink (Mustela vison), on small islands in the outer archipelago of the Baltic Sea, SW Finland. Voles were live-trapped on 10 manipulation and 10 control islands in a grid of 50 traps per island. Microhabitat characteristics around trap locations were classified to four types reflecting risks of mink predation and suitability for foraging: grassy patches, juniper bushes, berries and open habitats. Microhabitat use of voles was analysed in relation to microhabitat availability. Field voles (Microtus agrestis) responded to the presence of mink with a microhabitat shift from open grassy habitats to juniper bushes. Bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), however, avoided juniper in the presence of mink and were significantly more often captured in juniper in removal areas. Use of open habitats by bank voles was also affected by their own density on islands. These divergent results may reflect species-specific differences in the social system, diet selection and escape behaviour of voles, but provide novel evidence for a rnicrohabitat shift of native prey aninials induced by an alien predator.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Fey, K (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",karen.fey@utu.fi; p.banks@unsw.edu.au; erkki.korpimaki@utu.fi,,"Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495",,,,56,13,14,0,9,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,UNIV HELSINKI,"P O BOX 26, FI-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND",0003-455X,1797-2450,,ANN ZOOL FENN,Ann.

These reptiles exhibit four (nearly) constant ecological/life-history traits that may affect the role and the influence of interspecific competition: (i) low species richness, (ii) high longevity, (iii) herbivorous/omnivorous dietary habits, and (iv) low population density. Based on the expectations derived from these ecological characteristics, I predicted that interspecific competition should be of lesser relevance for these turtle communities than for other reptilian communities (lizards, snakes). After reviewing the international literature, I concluded that most of the turtle communities around the world appear currently uninfluenced by interspecific competition. Much of their species diversity reflects geographic replacement of one species by another. In the regions of the world where two or more species are sympatric, current interspecific competition is also of relatively low importance, because the sympatric species tend to partition very clearly the spatial axis or the food axis. By Monte Carlo simulations of niche overlap data versus current niche overlap data at a geographic region in tropical Africa where the community ecology of three sympatric species of terrestrial turtles, three of scincid lizards, four of chameleons, and nineteen of snakes, was accurately studied, I concluded that the interspecific competition among turtles was statistically lower than that among these other reptiles, with the spatial niche being the niche dimension most clearly partitioned by turtles in comparison with the other ectotherms. Hence, terrestrial turtles would be unusual among reptiles with respect to the un-influence of the competition process for their community ecology.","Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, I-00198 Rome, Italy; FIZV Ecol, I-00198 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,109,18,18,0,10,SOC NATL PROTECTION NATURE ACCLIMATATION FRANCE,PARIS 5,"57 RUE CUVIER, 75005 PARIS 5, FRANCE",0249-7395,,,REV ECOL-TERRE VIE,Rev.

The debate often hinges on issues of temporal and spatial scale. Resolution of the competing views depends on a detailed understanding of variation in the structure of local communities through time and space. Analyses of twelve years of data on a diverse assemblage of 13 boreal small mammal species revealed both deterministic and stochastic patterns. Stochastic membership in the overall community created unique assemblages of species in both time and space. But the relative abundances of the two codominant species were much less variable, and suggest a significant role for strong interactions that create temporal and spatial autocorrelation in abundance. As species wax and wane in abundance, they are nevertheless subject to probabilistic rules on local assembly. At the scales I report on here, poorly understood large scale processes influence the presence and absence of the majority of (sparse) species in the assembly. But the overall pool of species nevertheless obeys local rules on their ultimate stochastic assembly into groups of interacting species.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",,,,65,14,15,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2005,109,2,,,,,223,238,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13661.x,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,902XY,WOS:000227391200002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Scincid lizards use both chemosensory and visual cues in tasks such as mate location, shelter-site selection, and predator evasion. Published literature has focused primarily on the use of chemosensory information by these lizards, but our experiments reveal an alternative scenario. Water skinks (Eulamprus heatwolei) are sympatric with larger black rock skinks (Egernia saxatilis) in southeastern Australia, and use similar long-term retreat-sites. However, Eulamprus avoid shelter-sites occupied by Egernia because of the risk of attack and injury. We conducted laboratory trials to clarify the kinds of information used by Eulamprus to avoid already-occupied shelters. In the field, shelter-sites might provide three types of information about prior occupancy: either scent deposited by a previously present Egernia; evidence of the current presence of an Egernia, perhaps involving visual, chemical, and/or auditory information; or a direct behavioural interaction with a resident lizard (potentially involving an attack). In our trials, Eulamprus based their shelter-site avoidance only on direct interactions. Thus, Eulamprus reacted strongly to Egernia with which they were able to interact physically, but not to either Egernia scent deposits, or a (caged) Egernia with which they could not physically interact. The behaviour of the resident was critical, in that Eulamprus fled from the crevice in response to bites, movements, or open-mouth displays by the resident Egernia. We suggest that Eulamprus base their shelter-site choices on the presence of an actual resident animal rather than more indirect cues (such as scent), because only a direct encounter provides reliable information about the magnitude of threat associated with crevice occupancy.","Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Langkilde, T (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",langkild@bio.usyd.edu.au; rshine@mail.usyd.edu.au,"Langkilde, Tracy/L-8696-2017; Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008","Langkilde, Tracy/0000-0001-7014-2432; ",,,,34,13,14,0,12,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,FEB,2005,142,,2,,,,203,216,,10.1163/1568539053627659,,,14,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,925TE,WOS:000229075400005,,,,,2021-09-21,

We examined whether isolation creates differences in fish assemblages among reefs through changes in predation pressure. First, small artificial reefs were placed at increasing distances from a naturally continuous reef, over a sloping bottom. Species richness and density of each species increased with isolation. Next, artificial reefs were relocated, together with all their fish inhabitants, closer to the natural reef. Following relocation, resident fishes of the artificial reefs exhibited a sharp decline in numbers, while predatory fish density increased. Both video observations of the relocated artificial reefs and the correlation between piscivore aggregation and decline of the resident fishes revealed that the cause of decline was the strong predation around the artificial reefs. The decline was density-dependent, such that the per-capita rate of decline was higher on artificial reefs with higher fish density. This study shows that the impact of piscivores on resident fish is modified by small-scale isolation. The results suggest that the high density of fish on small, isolated reefs is enabled by low predation.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Evolut Syst & Ecol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Belmaker, J (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",belmakej@bgumail.ac.il,"Shashar, Nadav/Y-8552-2019; Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012; Belmaker, Jonathan/I-1004-2019; Belmaker, Jonathan/F-7166-2011","Belmaker, Jonathan/0000-0002-5618-7359; Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,58,23,24,0,25,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Conspecific sperm precedence and its mechanisms have been documented widely in terrestrial species, in which complex female behaviors or reproductive tract morphologies can allow many opportunities for female choice and sperm competition, however, the opportunity for conspecific sperm precedence in free spawning marine invertebrates has been largely ignored. Two sea urchin species, Echinometra oblonga and E. sp. C. have high levels of interspecific fertilization in no-choice lab crosses, but no natural hybrids have been found. We performed competitive fertilization assays to test for conspecific sperm precedence and found that eggs of both species showed a marked preference for conspecific sperm when fertilized with heterospecific sperm mixtures. Strong rejection of heterospecific sperm would not have been predicted from no-choice assays and helps explain the lack of natural hybrids. We also found significant variation in hybridization success among crosses. Conspecific sperm precedence in free spawning invertebrates shows that the simple surfaces of eggs and sperm provide ample opportunity for egg choice and sperm competition even in the absence of intricate behavior or complex reproductive morphologies.","Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Dept Biol Sci, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","Geyer, LB (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Igeyer@oeb.harvard.edu; spahanbi@stanford.edu,,"Geyer, Laura/0000-0002-1532-197X",,,,88,58,60,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JAN,2005,59,1,,,,,97,105,,,,,9,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,893RW,WOS:000226737900009,15792230,,,,2021-09-21,

This review explores the herbivore-induced indirect effects mediated by such plant responses following herbivory in terrestrial systems. Herbivore-induced indirect effects are ubiquitous in many plant-herbivore systems, and indirect interactions occur among temporally separated, spatially separated, and taxonomically distinct herbivore species. Unlike interspecific competition, herbivores can benefit each other through plant-mediated indirect effects. Herbivore-induced changes in plants occur at low levels of herbivory, which increases the likelihood of plant-mediated indirect interactions between herbivores. ne herbivore-induced indirect effects result in interaction linkages, which alter species richness and abundance in arthropod communities. Such interaction linkages should be depicted using indirect interaction webs, which incorporate nontrophic, indirect links. The idea of interaction linkages by herbivore-induced indirect effects that shape community organization and biodiversity is an important revision of the traditional view of plant-based terrestrial food webs.","Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Ohgushi, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",ohgushi@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"thorhallsdottir, anna gudrun/B-6037-2011","thorhallsdottir, anna gudrun/0000-0001-7201-6931",,,,106,302,322,5,223,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-592X,,978-0-8243-1436-1,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

In a tropical coastal terrestrial forest in Costa Rica, we investigated the relative importance of predation by land crabs, Gecarcinus quadratus, and hermit crabs, Coenobita compressus, on measured forest composition through a series of seed removal and seedling establishment experiments. We also used natural light-gaps and adjacent non-gap sites to test how canopy cover affects crab predation ( seed removal) and seedling establishment. We found fewer tree species (S = 18) and lower densities ( seedlings, saplings, and adults) in the coastal zone within 100 m of coastline, than in the inland zone (S = 59). Land crab densities were higher in the coastal zone (3.03 +/- 1.44 crabs m(-2)) than in the inland zone (0.76 +/- 0.78 crabs m(-2)), and hermit crabs were not present in the inland zone. Seed removal and seedling mortality also were higher in the coastal zone than in the inland zone, and in the open controls than in the crab exclosures. Mortality of seeds and seedlings was two to six times higher in the controls than exclosures for four of the five experiments. Crabs preferred seeds and younger seedlings over older seedlings but showed no species preferences in the seed (Anacardium excelsum, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Terminalia oblonga) and seedling (Pachira quinata and E. cyclocarpum) stages. We conclude that the observed differences in tree densities were caused by differential crab predation pressure along the coastal gradient, while the differences in species composition were due to predator escape ( satiation) by seed quantity. Canopy cover did not affect seed removal rates, but did affect seedling survival with higher mortality in the non-gap versus gap environments. In summary, crab predation of seeds and seedlings, and secondarily canopy cover, are important factors affecting tree establishment in terrestrial coastal forests.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Lindquist, ES (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Org Trop Studies, Box 90630, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",erin@ots.ac.cr,,,,,,50,46,53,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2004,141,4,,,,,661,671,,10.1007/s00442-004-1673-5,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,869QT,WOS:000224999800012,15349766,,,,2021-09-21,

However, surprisingly few tests of this idea exist, especially for metazoans feeding on a self-renewing resource. Here we examined the effect of density-independent mortality on the coexistence of four species of pond zooplankton (microcrustacean grazers) in a series of laboratory microcosms. Across the experimental mortality gradient, consumer biomass decreased and resource abundance increased with an increase in mortality. Thus, the treatments resulted in an increase in resource availability per consumer (one measure of reduced competitive intensity). There was no significant effect of mortality treatment on species relative abundances or species evenness, and the zooplankter Diaphanosoma dominated community biomass at all mortality levels. Mortality rate did have a marginally significant effect on species richness (p<0.07), but richness did not increase monotonically with mortality level. Instead, richness tended to be highest in the low- and no-mortality treatments.","Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI USA; Radford Univ, Dept Biol, Radford, VA 24142 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Mittelbach, GG (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",mittelbach@kbs.msu.edu,"Mittelbach, Gary/A-2470-2013; Garcia, Erica/B-4142-2012","Mittelbach, Gary/0000-0001-6971-9273; Garcia, Erica/0000-0002-1186-9700",,,,43,7,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2004,107,2,,,,,415,421,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13182.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,853XE,WOS:000223863100020,,,,,2021-09-21,

Most examples of this come from instances of aggression or communication within a species. We tested whether interspecific encounters between ants enhance the host location success of a parasitoid (Diptera: Phoridae) that attacks ants in the genus Linepithema. At food resources recruited to by Linepithema, parasitoid discovery rates were lower when Linepithema was alone than when other ant species were present. In experimentally controlled encounters, parasitoid discovery rates were elevated when Linepithema confronted an ant species that elicited use of chemicals, but not when it confronted an ant species that primarily elicited physical aggression. These results indicate that phorid parasitoids of Linepithema use the ant's chemicals as host location cues. Because Linepithema is known to abandon food resources in the presence of its phorid parasitoids, its use of chemicals during interspecific encounters may diminish its competitive success when phorids are nearby.

Without a temporal advantage, the survival of S. fonscolombii was higher than that of T. kirbyi , and S. fonscolombii had a larger size due to faster growth than T. kirbyi . Hence, it is assumed that survival depended on early oviposition as well as on larval growth. 4. To test the relevance of the laboratory results, observations at artificial ponds in the Namibian semi-desert were conducted. Trithemis kirbyi was the first species colonising these ponds while S. fonscolombii arrived 15 days later. In field samples, many more Trithemis larvae than Sympetrum larvae were found, a pattern similar to the laboratory experiments in which T. kirbyi enjoyed a temporal advantage.","Tech Univ Braunschweig, Inst Zool, D-38102 Braunschweig, Germany","Suhling, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Braunschweig, Inst Zool, Fasanenstr 3, D-38102 Braunschweig, Germany.",f.suhling@tu-bs.de,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261",,,,40,32,37,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Such complexity makes it difficult to discern the mechanisms generating community structure. In this paper we review concepts and issues related to linking functional and community studies while also including greater complexity into the experimental realm. These principles are primarily illustrated with case studies involving predation ecology in a freshwater snail-fish-crayfish model system. The system illustrates how predator impacts on prey are mediated by multiple prey traits, correlations between traits, functional trade-offs in predator defence, interactions between predators, and interactions with other community members. We argue for a pluralistic approach to investigating mechanisms of community structure; that is, an approach that integrates many subdisciplines of ecology and evolution. We discuss four main areas that when used together yield important insights on community structure. First, selection gradient analyses formally link functional and community ecology. This formalisation is shown to help identify targets of selection, estimate environment-specific mortality rates, and identify agents of selection in complex communities. Second, we encourage increased focus on emergent community properties (results not predicted based on pairwise species interactions). Third, we emphasise that a community, rather than a web of species interactions, may more profitably be viewed as a network of trait interactions. This trait-centred view makes clear how indirect community effects arise between species that do not interact physically. This perspective also leads to our fourth topic, the integration of phenotypes. Just as populations evolve co-adapted suites of traits, so too should individuals embody integrated trait correlations, termed 'trait integration', rather than randomly assembled collections of phenotypes. All the perspectives mentioned above suggest that investigations should focus on multiple traits and multiple environments simultaneously, rather than singular, atomised components of complex systems.

Resources vary critically in space and time so the ability of animals to utilize them necessarily does so in sympathy. For hermit crabs in coastal SW Madagascar, a critical resource is a suitable shell to habit, as is typical of the group. Quantification of resource status should therefore be as straightforward as counting shells on a beach. Only certain shells are exploitable, however, based on their condition, occupier status and attributes (such as size). 2. The total, total exploitable and empty shell densities (size classed) per unit area were measured from the shallow subtidal to landward range (100 m inland) of hermit crabs. The population density of resource exploiters (hermit crabs) was also measured (grouped by size classes) over a similar area, enabling calculation of the total number of exploitable shells per individual (based on appropriate match of resource and resource user) and the nested subset of empty exploitable shells per individual. 3. Resource bottlenecks and surpluses occurred at different (resource exploiter) life stages and at different positions on the shore. The proportion of available shell types used by hermit crabs was found to increase down shore despite the number of shell types availability showing the converse pattern. 4. Multiple regression models of shell use by hermit crabs were constructed that showed species and genus level trends. Five or more variables were almost equally significant in each of the models. Overall hermit crab size, site, habitat and local shell diversity were most important in determining the number of shell types used. 5. The proportion of interspecific vs intraspecific competition at each shore level was estimated using observed species-specific shell use patterns and population size class sizes. Observed competition followed the predicted sigmoidal pattern across the littoral zone but that of intensity of competition was different and bimodal. 6. Ordination (detrended correspondence analysis) showed that resource exploiter (species) specific shell suites heavily overlap in multidimensional niche space as is near universally described in the literature. When shell suites are ordinated by size class, however, species niches separate, even across sites, except at sizes where resources are not restricted. Niches are distinct but cryptic.","British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; Soc Environm Explorat, London EC2A 3QP, England; Univ Oxford, Museum Hist Nat, Oxford, England","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",,,"De Grave, Sammy/0000-0002-2437-2445",,,,34,8,8,0,6,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The static approach is based on censuses of population sizes among species at one point in time over many sites. The dynamic approach relies on a time series of species abundance data to examine whether per capita changes in one species are associated with the abundance of other species. We estimated competition interactions in a Negev rodent community consisting of 10 species using both approaches, basing on 8 years (16 half-year periods) of observations. The static approach revealed significant competitive interactions in four of 45 pairs of species, whereas the dynamic approach did so in the same four plus two more pairs. For each species pair, both approaches revealed significant negative interactions in only 1-4 of 16 seasons. The static approach provided nearly symmetric estimations of competition, whereas estimations of dynamic approach were asymmetric. Moreover, estimations of the two approaches did not coincide in time. Cases of negative interactions recorded by the static approach were more frequent at peak and increase phases of population density dynamics, whereas those recorded by the dynamic approach were more frequent at peak and decline phases. Results of field removal experiments with Mus musculus and Gerbillus dasyurus supported predictions of dynamic but not static approaches. We hypothesized that in harsh and fluctuating desert environments that disrupt equilibrium, the dynamic approach indicates true (exploitation) competition, whereas the static approach reflects negative interspecific spatial association (interference).","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ramon Sci Ctr, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mizpe Ramon,POB 194, IL-80600 Beer Sheva, Israel","Shenbrot, G (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ramon Sci Ctr, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mizpe Ramon,POB 194, IL-80600 Beer Sheva, Israel.",shenbrot@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"Krasnov, Boris R./F-2234-2012","Krasnov, Boris R./0000-0002-0382-3331",,,,74,27,27,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2002,99,1,,,,,47,58,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990105.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,609BQ,WOS:000178883100005,,,,,2021-09-21,

Two recent reviews have compared the performances of different measures of interaction strength using simulations. The goal of obtaining measures of interaction strength is based on the premise that such measures will achieve a closer connection between theory and experiment in community ecology. The present article disputes this premise. Because interactions are typically nonlinear, single numerical measures are generally poor characterizations. Typically, the functional dependencies of growth rates on population densities are unknown. Lacking more information about the form of these functions, the results of most population manipulations make very limited contributions to the construction of dynamic models of communities. Even if all effects of population, densities on per capita growth rates were linear, performing all possible removal experiments will frequently fail to identify the constants of proportionality. Many misconceptions about the meaning and measurement of interaction coefficient persist. More extensive natural history observations and use of more flexible short-term experiments are advocated as approaches that will aid in constructing mathematical models of interspecific interactions.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M6R 2V6, Canada","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M6R 2V6, Canada.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,45,96,98,3,57,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2001,94,2,,,,,209,218,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.940201.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,475PM,WOS:000171173200001,,,,,2021-09-21,

To these ends we reviewed a set of 227 comparisons from 52 studies designed to quantify the effect of density on the growth performance of larval anurans. We predicted that both design and outcome would be related to experimental venue (laboratory, mesocosm, and field). We found that, in contrast to our predictions, laboratory experiments did not include more factors or yield more precise estimates of responses compared with mesocosm and field manipulations. In partial support of our prediction, we found that laboratory experiments did utilize somewhat larger numbers of replicates and included more levels per factor compared to the alternative venues. In addition we found that, as predicted, raising tadpoles at higher densities of conspecifics, or in the presence of heterospecifics tended to decrease growth. This effect, consistent with competition, was strongly dependent on experimental venue. In particular. we found that interspecific effects were much stronger in mesocosm versus field manipulations. This result is particularly relevant because conceptions of amphibian assemblages have included interspecific competition as integral to natural patterns of amphibian distribution. We conclude that hypothesized tradeoffs among experimental venues have not acted in a particularly strong way in shaping the design of tadpole density manipulations. However, venue may mediate strong effects on the outcome of such experiments. Quantification of such methodology based biases will help ecologists more effectively match the goals of their experiments with decisions regarding venue.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Skelly, DK (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,"Skelly, David/D-3878-2013",,,,,90,80,84,1,24,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2001,94,1,,,,,198,208,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.t01-1-11105.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,463NE,WOS:000170481600020,,,,,2021-09-21,

Even if heterospecific pollen is capable of effecting fertilization it may perform poorly when conspecific pollen is also available on the stigma. We applied pollen mixtures to stigmas to determine how pollen interactions affect airing success and the frequency of hybrid formation between two species of Ipomopsis (Polemoniaceae) in Colorado. plants of both parental species and natural hybrids were pollinated with I. aggregata and I. tenuituba pollen in ratios of 100:0, 80:20, 50:50, 20:80, and 0:100 by mass. Plants were homozygous for different alleles at an isozyme marker, allowing us to distinguish the type of pollen parent for 2166 viable seeds from 273 fruits. In contrast to studies of many other hybridizing taxa, there was no evidence of an advantage to conspecific pollen, nor did composition of the stigmatic pollen load affect seed set. Instead, the frequency of seeds sired by a given species was proportional to its representation in the pollen load. In this hybrid zone, both the frequency of first-generation hybrid formation and the relative male fitness of the two parental species should be predictable from the rates of pollen transfer to stigmas.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Campbell, DR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",,"Campbell, Diane/A-1653-2012","Campbell, Diane/0000-0002-1147-846X",,,,30,21,21,0,7,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,COLUMBUS,"OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA",0002-9122,,,AM J BOT,Am.

Kin recognition is important in many social insects, but has also been found in several nonsocial insects such as parasitoids, where it plays an important role in oviposition behaviour. In nonparasitic arthropods, however, the fitness of ovipositing females also depends on the oviposition behaviour of related and unrelated females, especially when eggs are oviposited in clusters by several females. 2. In this paper, kin recognition in a predatory mite, Iphiseius degenerans, is studied. Mothers are capable of determining offspring sex ratio, and cannibalism on juvenile stages is a common phenomenon. Therefore, kin recognition is expected to occur in this predator. 3. Oviposition behaviour of this species is particularly interesting because it alternates foraging bouts in flowers with deposition of a single egg at a time on a leaf, where predation risk is lower. The eggs are not scattered but are deposited in clusters. After feeding in a flower, females therefore have to locate clusters of eggs. 4. Experiments on two-choice arenas showed that females prefer to oviposit close to conspecific eggs rather than close to heterospecific eggs. Females also showed a preference for ovipositing near closely related conspecific eggs rather than more distantly related eggs. 5. Females tended to displace eggs of heterospecifics more frequently than eggs of conspecifics. 6. These behavioural observations show that females can discriminate not only between conspecific and heterospecific eggs but also between eggs that vary in degree of relatedness. This enables females to oviposit in clusters containing related eggs and thus avoid cannibalism by non-kin and/or produce adaptive sex ratios despite the fact that the adults commute between flowers and leaves.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Systemat & Ecol, Sect Populat Biol, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Systemat & Populat Biol, Sect Populat Biol, Kruislaan 320, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Janssen@bio.uva.nl,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,40,47,48,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Under all conditions, the predicted number of degree-days (DDT0) to complete larval development was less, and the threshold temperature (T-0) for initiation of larval development was higher for Ae. albopictus than for Ae. triseriatus. The DDT0 for both species was food and density dependent. However, the per capita food ration appeared to exert a greater influence on the developmental times of Ae. triseriatus immatures, whereas for Ae. albopictus effects of density were not completely eliminated by an increase in the per capita food ration. The presence of heterospecific larvae did not prolong the DDT0 of either species. At the low food. ration, DDT0 for both species were significantly greater under conspecific conditions. The DDT0 for Ae. triseriatus increased directly as the proportion of conspecific larvae increased. However, when a higher per capita food ration was provided, conspecific effects on DDT0 were mitigated. For Ae. albopictus, estimated DDT0 values for larvae reared in pure culture were significantly higher than when were present, regardless of the per capita amount of food provided. Survivorship of immatures was density and food-dependent for both species. Ae. albopictus exhibited higher immature survivorship under all conditions relative to Ae. triseriatus. For both species, survival probabilities were lowest under conditions of high density and low food. Addition of food improved survival for both species. The presence of heterospecific larvae exerted. a differential effect on the survivorship response of Ae. albopictus immatures to temperature. Lowest probability of survival for Ae. albopictus was occurred at low temperature when the proportion of heterospecific larvae in containers was the highest. In contrast, at high temperatures, survivorship of immatures improved, but was lowest for pure species cultures. For Ae. triseriatus, survivorship of immatures was consistently lower for pure species cultures regardless of the temperature. Standing crop production of adults of both species was primarily food rather that density-dependent. Under field conditions, Ae. triseriatus were predicted to initiate development sooner and exhibit faster population growth early in the season than Ae. albopictus. However, because of the shorter DDT0 Ae. albopictus population growth was predicted to surpass that of Ae. triseriatus populations later in the season. Based on optimal DDT0 values from laboratory experiments, spring emergence dates of Ae. triseriatus females in western North Carolina for 1989 and 1990 were predicted from accumulated degree-days calculated from local air temperature records. Predicted emergence dates were congruent with results of a previous survey for the same locality, indicating that accumulated degree-days can be used to accurately predict the seasonal occurrence of Ae. triseriatus. The utility of the degree-day approach in predicting the phenology of Ae. albopictus remains to be established.","N Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Apperson, CS (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol, Campus Box 7647, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,,,,,,66,121,125,1,50,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0022-2585,,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Nestedness was quantified with an index, I-N, that measures the extent to which relatively species-poor assemblages are subsets of richer assemblages. I, was statistically evaluated with a delete-1 jackknife estimate of its standard error. Adults of obligate coral reef fishes, especially wrasses and damselfishes but not parrotfishes, were significantly nested. Juveniles were only weakly or not nested. Differences in nestedness and distribution and abundance of life stages across the reefs suggest that recruitment limitation largely determines community structure although predation and. perhaps, interspecific competition also contribute to community structure. As reef size and complexity were strongly correlated with species richness, a simple iterative model with density-independent colonization, stochastic and deterministic recruitment, and habitat-size dependent extinction was evaluated. The model showed that limited recruitment is sufficient to explain the observed extent of nested substructure. The model also showed that a high degree of nestedness can occur without intrinsic differences in the dispersal ability or extinction vulnerability of species. Thus, nested substructure should not be used to infer the specific processes impacting community composition.","Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA","McLain, DK (corresponding author), Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Landrum Box 8042, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",dk_mclain@gsvms2.cc.gasou.edu,,,,,,91,15,18,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,1999,85,1,,,,,53,67,,10.2307/3546791,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,192TD,WOS:000080094300006,,,,,2021-09-21,

In our model, colonists assessing potential breeding patches could select between high-quality source and low-quality sink patches. A proportion of the source patches were occupied by residents. Colonists could either directly sample the relative quality of the patches (termed samplers) or, alternatively, they could also use residents as a cue of patch quality (cue-users). Cue-users gained benefit from lowered costs when assessing occupied source patches. The cue-using strategy is an efficient way to choose the best possible patch not only when interspecific competition is intense, but also when benefits from social aggregation exceed the effects of competition. High relative cost of sampling empty patches increases the fitness of the cue-using strategy relative to samplers. The strongest attraction to heterospecifics was predicted when the benefit from aggregating with residents exceeded the effects of competition, and approximately half of the landscape consisted of occupied, high-quality source patches.","Oulu Univ, Dept Biol, FIN-90401 Oulu, Finland","Monkkonen, M (corresponding author), Oulu Univ, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FIN-90401 Oulu, Finland.",mmonkkon@cc.oulu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012; Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011","Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,33,85,87,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

The study was conducted in tall open forest near Melbourne, Australia, from April to August 1997. Microhabitat was investigated bq use of live trapping and fluorescent pigment tracking. The influence of light on spatial and temporal activity was investigated by comparing microhabitat use in the field at two extremes of moonlight intensity, full and new moon, and by manipulating light intensity in the field. Antechinus agilis were trapped in and tracked through dense microhabitats in a greater proportion than was available, although this pattern was evident only in the vegetation stratum below one metre from the ground. Furthermore, animals did not respond to the microhabitat at the Feint of capture, but responded to a larger microhabitat scale radiating 10 m from the trap. However, light intensity appears to have little influence on the spatial or temporal activity of A. agilis at this site. Therefore A. agilis appear not to differentially use denser microhabitats in relation to light intensity. Habitat complexity, prey availability, interspecific competition and predation are discussed as possible reasons why ii. agilis differentially use denser microhabitats.","Monash Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia","Predavec, M (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia.",martin.predavec@sci.monash.edu.au,"Sutherland, Duncan/E-7763-2011","Sutherland, Duncan/0000-0003-0893-4425",,,,85,22,28,0,21,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",0004-959X,1446-5698,,AUST J ZOOL,Aust.

Previous studies suggest that predation risk varies within the tree and is higher for tits using outer parts of branches and low positions in trees. This is the first study of the use of foraging sites in the tree by Willow Tits Parus montanus that actually manipulates the perceived likelihood of a predator attack. Captive Willow Tits were subject to simulated attacks using scuffed predators. After spotting an avian predator the tits shifted to forage to a larger extent in sheltered parts of the tree than before the attack. The result shows that niche use in Willow Tits is directly linked to the perceived predation risk and that the birds assess the predation risk to be lower on the inner parts of the branches than further out.,"Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Kullberg, C (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,39,19,19,0,10,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0908-8857,,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

However, microhabitat niche breadth was not related to food abundance. Overlaps in diet, microhabitat, and feeding-method niches were positively related to food abundance, which is consistent with niche partitioning between potentially competing species. Divergence in foraging niches with declining food abundance was related primarily to behavioral differences between Gadwalls and coots. Both species fed predominantly at the surface in areas dominated by Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) in early winter when food was abundant. Most of the Gadwalls left the reservoir when food abundance declined in late winter.

One possible explanation for this puzzle is that conditions in hybrid populations may favor selfing, even in otherwise outcrossing species. For example, in self-incompatible plants, mixtures of self and interspecific pollen often induce selfing. Here, we examine patterns of mating in three hybrid zones and four pure populations of Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris, wild, self-incompatible sunflower species that are thought to have parented three homoploid hybrid species. Fourteen to 16 maternal families from each pure population and 44-46 maternal families from each hybrid zone were analyzed for seven polymorphic isozyme loci. Maximum-likelihood (ML) methods were used to estimate multilocus outcrossing rates (T-m) and hybridization frequencies for each maternal family, each phenotypic group within each hybrid zone (annuus-like, hybrid, and petiolaris-like), and each population. As predicted for self-incompatible species, all four parental populations have outcrossing rate ML estimates of 1.0. Within the hybrid zones, outcrossing rates were lowest in the H. annuus-like fraction of the population (0.73, 0.72, and 0.74 in the three hybrid zones, respectively), largely intermediate in the H. petiolaris-like group (0.94, 0.90, and 0.94), and highest in the hybrid group (0.97, 0.93, and 0.97). Although outcrossing rates are lower in hybrid zones than in pure populations, it is unlikely that the observed decrease facilitates hybrid speciation because outcrossing rates in the critical hybrid fraction of the population do not differ significantly from 1.0. Dividing the outcrossed pollen pool into intraspecific and interspecific components revealed that maternal plants are largely fertilized by conspecific pollen, confirming an important role for pollen competition as a reproductive barrier. Highly sterile hybrid plants do not appear to discriminate between parental species pollen, but hybrids with higher fertility tend to be fertilized by pollen from the parental group they resemble genetically. Thus, gametic selection leads to substantial assortative mating in these hybrid zones.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Butler Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46208 USA","Rieseberg, LH (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",lriesebe@bio.indiana.edu,"Rieseberg, Loren H/B-3591-2013; Baird, Stuart J.

However, difficulties identifying and estimating the abundance of small species has meant that they are often ignored or undersampled in community level studies. We use studies that sampled whole assemblages in order to examine size/diversity and size/abundance patterns within coral-reef fish assemblages. We then examine body size in relation to patterns of habitat use, species interactions (competition and predation) and life histories of coral-reef fishes. Species diversity typically peaks in small size classes (<100 mm) and there are many low diversity larger size classes. In some assemblages, diversity also declines among the smallest species (<50 mm). The high diversity of small coral-reef fishes may partly be attributed to the complex structure of coral reefs. However, we find no evidence that diversity/size distributions are controlled by increased availability of niches or greater living space for small fishes. Regional-scale processes also influence local diversity of coral-reef fishes. In particular, high rates of speciation among small species might contribute to the observed diversity/size distributions. Declines in abundance with increasing body size have been attributed to equal partitioning of energy among species of different body sizes (energetic equivalence rule). We find no support for the energetic equivalence rule in assemblages of coral-reef fishes. Although body size was generally a poor predictor of abundance for coral-reef fishes, the upper bound of the size/abundance distribution was very uniform among the assemblages we examined. This upper bound may prove useful for selecting species most likely to be resource-limited. Small species of coral-reef fishes are more closely associated with the reef matrix than their larger counterparts. We propose that this is largely the result of high predation risk for small species. It is generally believed that smaller species and smaller size classes within species are subject to higher mortality rates. However, further studies are required to test this assumption. The diversity and abundance of small reef fishes, and their restriction to specialized habitats may increase the likelihood of competitive interactions. There is ample evidence of intraspecific competition among individuals of similar size in small coral-reef fishes. There is less evidence of interspecific competition among coral-reef fishes. However, the outcome of interspecific interactions will, in part, depend on the relative size of species. Because body size can influence the intensity with which predation and competition act, consideration of population size-structure may help develop multifactorial models of population dynamics of coral-reef fishes.","[Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ North Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Munday, PL (corresponding author), James Cook Univ North Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",,"Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011; Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010","Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498; Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245",,,,257,163,166,0,52,ABERDEEN UNIV PRESS,ABERDEEN,"FARMERS HALL, ABERDEEN AB9 2XT, SCOTLAND",0078-3218,,,OCEANOGR MAR BIOL<D>,Oceanogr.

Resident numbers were increased by winter feeding and decreased by removals using mist nets. The heterospecific attraction hypothesis states that migrants use residents as a cue to identify the best sites for breeding in a heterogeneous landscape because residents have already selected higher quality sites. The hypothesis predicts that there will be a higher overall density of migrants associated with increased resident density. Results showed that there was a consistent change in migrant bird community structure (i.e., in the relative abundance of species) in response to manipulation. This change resulted mainly from an increased density of arboreal insectivores, i.e., species that belong to the same foraging guild as residents, suggesting that food is an important factor contributing to heterospecific attraction. The red-eyed vireo, Vireo olivaceus, and black-and-white warbler, Mniotilta varia, showed the strongest positive response. No migrant species responded negatively to augmented resident density, suggesting that interspecific competition may be less important in structuring breeding bird communities in northern forests. Our results support the view that positive interactions should be considered when studying community structure.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90571 Oulu, Finland; Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, Meltaus Game Res Stn, FIN-97340 Meltaus, Finland; Univ Minnesota, Nat Resources Res Inst, Duluth, MN 55811 USA","Monkkonen, M (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 333, FIN-90571 Oulu, Finland.",mmonkkon@cc.oulu.fi,"Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011","Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,60,62,64,0,33,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

For salal, the shape parameter included an adjustment for burning treatments that delayed maximum cover by several years as compared with unburned treatments. The rate parameter in the thimbleberry model was adjusted for burning treatments; maximum cover occurred about 2 years earlier in burned than in unburned treatments. Both rate and shape parameters in the salmonberry model were adjusted for burning treatments; delayed establishment but increased growth rate and less salmonbeny cover are characteristic of burned treatments as compared with the unburned treatments. The rate and shape parameters in the model for the shrub group included adjustments for burning treatments. Overstory removal fostered shrub development, whereas site preparation treatments slowed and curtailed it. The final cover-projection models accounted for 68-92% of the total variation in cover, with the adjustments for burning accounting for 1.5-3.3% of the variation.

I compiled examples of nest usurpation from the literature to examine patterns regarding the species and nest sites that tend to be usurped, those species likely to be usurpers, and the habitats in which usurpation occurs. Cavities and enclosed nests are more likely to be usurped than cup nests. Species that excavate or build these types of nests, like the Picidae and the Furnariidae, are likely to be the hosts of usurpers. Particular groups are prone to usurping nests, including introduced species like the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Cavity usurpations were more likely to be observed in temperate than tropical/subtropical zones, and about equally likely to be observed in closed and open habitats, while enclosed nest usurpations were observed more frequently in open than closed habitats, and more often in tropical/subtropical than temperate zones. Usurpation of all nest types is more likely to occur in tropical/subtropical zones than expected, based on the number of studies in the literature conducted in these zones. Usurpation of all nest types is less likely to occur in open, and more likely to occur in moderately open habitats than expected, based on the number of studies in the literature conducted in these habitats. Instances of cavity usurpation, recorded primarily in temperate zones, across a variety of habitats, do not contribute to these general patterns. Nest-site convergence through nest usurpation may be more likely to occur in moderately open tropical habitats because of: 1) the availability of enclosed nests, 2) the limited structural heterogeneity of the vegetation, which limits the possibility of nest-niche partitioning, and 3) the high diversity of potential nest competitors and predators. In such environments, interspecific nesting associations may be a more effective generalized nest defense strategy than using a nest site that is difficult to find.","HARVARD UNIV,BIOL LABS,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02138",,,,,,,,84,55,60,0,16,COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897",0010-5422,,,CONDOR,Condor,AUG,1996,98,3,,,,,464,473,,10.2307/1369560,,,10,Ornithology,Zoology,VG525,WOS:A1996VG52500002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Two examples (one simulated, using a cellular automaton model, and one from a removal experiment in grasslands) are used to demonstrate that this use is not straightforward, since (1) radically different underlying mechanisms (symmetric founder control with little competitive replacement vs. asymmetric dominance control strongly structured by competition) may produce very similar spatio-temporal patterns; and (2) topology of species replacements in space may be very different from the competitive hierarchy as determined by the removal experiment. Permanent plot data can be used to study interspecific interactions in the following ways: (1) if there is additional information to decide which of the potential underlying models is acceptable, permanent plot data may enable further articulation of the model, such as estimation of the model parameters; this approach is similar to that used in many other plant ecology fields (fine scale patterns, chronosequences, plant size distribution and dynamics); (2) data from permanent plots constrain the number of feasible underlying models; (3) permanent plot data provide verification of predictions of experimental studies; in this respect, they are much superior to non-repeated studies of pattern.",,"Herben, T (corresponding author), ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBL,INST BOT,CR-25243 PRAGUE,CZECH REPUBLIC.",,/G-1804-2014,/0000-0002-6636-0012,,,,34,20,20,1,11,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,KNIVSTA,"APELSINVAGEN 47, S 741 00 KNIVSTA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

The introduced North American crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is currently replacing the native crayfish Astacus astacus in a Swedish lake. Using field data from co-occurring populations on life-history traits and population size structure of the two species, this study evaluated possible mechanisms behind the replacement. 2. Pacifastacus showed a higher capacity for population increase; the species had a higher individual growth rate, reached sexual maturity at a smaller size and lower age, and had a higher per capita egg production than Astacus. 3. A higher frequency of non-lethal injuries in Astacus suggested the predominance of Pacifastacus in interference interactions. These results support a competitive exclusion hypothesis. 4. A dramatic change in relative abundance of the two species in recent years was the result of an almost complete cessation in recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) in Astacus.

I addressed an aspect of this model by investigating whether very similar species of stream fishes co-occurred less frequently than more dissimilar species. I sampled 219 assemblages from the Red River basin in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas; calculated an index of co-occurrence between all possible pairs of cyprinid (minnow) species; and estimated their morphological similarity and phylogenetic relatedness. Only sympatric or parapatric pairs were analyzed to allow for the possibility of ecological interactions and to make the analysis independent of the size of the area sampled, Randomization tests demonstrated a significantly low degree of co-occurrence between morphologically very similar pairs compared with less similar pairs of species. However, there was no significant difference in co-occurrence between the species most related phylogenetically and more distantly related species.

This indirect interaction is further complicated because M. balthica facultatively switches between suspension- and deposit-feeding in response to the availability of suspended food particles. Laboratory experiments showed that the proportion of clams deposit feeding with exposed siphons increased with decreasing food concentrations in the water column and this resulted in shallower burial depths in the sediment. The clams showed similar responses in feeding mode and burial depth to the concentrations of suspended food indirectly manipulated by the presence and/or density of either interspecific (suspension-feeding soft-shelled clam Mya arenarin L.) or intraspecific competitors.","SMITHSONIAN ENVIRONM RES CTR,EDGEWATER,MD 21037",,,,,,,,55,64,64,0,19,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1994,69,1,,,,,28,36,,10.2307/3545280,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MR887,WOS:A1994MR88700003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Pellets (birds) and feces (foxes) collected monthly contained identifiable remains of small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, large insects, other arthropods, and (in some fox feces) fruits. For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation. In contrast, availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ''lean'' times and converging opportunistically during ''fat'' times, predators at Auco responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ''diet hyperspace'' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously in the study area throughout the period, and their occurrence was particularly sporadic late in our study even for falconiform species that were not particularly mammalivorous. The lack of clearcut patterns among Auco predators in response to resource-''lean'' and resource-''fat'' times may result from one or more of the following: (a) from predators' viewpoints, food classes at Auco may be quite discrete, inhibiting gradual diet shifts by owls and foxes at least; (b) truly opportunistic immigrants that might have increased overall diet overlap during ''fat'' times, as sometimes occurs in other consumer assemblages, do not exist in the Auco landscape; and (c) despite the pronounced decline in small mammal densities. the predator assemblage may have remained above the threshold of food limitation through part or all of the study.","UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT WILDLIFE & RANGE SCI, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA; UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT ZOOL, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA","JAKSIC, FM (corresponding author), CATHOLIC UNIV CHILE, DEPT ECOL, CASILLA 114-D, SANTIAGO, CHILE.",,"Jaksic, Fabian M/G-1705-2014; Jimenez, Jaime E./AAO-7531-2020","Jaksic, Fabian M/0000-0003-0098-0291; ",,,,45,57,59,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1993,67,1,,,,,87,96,,10.2307/3545099,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KZ779,WOS:A1993KZ77900011,,,,,2021-09-21,

The gall's position on H. spinosa is verv specific, reflected in the fact that the gall maker attaches principally to the basal floral buds of the inflorescence, and in the lower sector of the plant. We labelled inflorescences with and without galls in order to (quantify goat herbivory and gall predation. The goat feeds both on plants and infructescences with or without galls, resulting in gall destruction and larval death (phenotypic selection). The browsing behaviour of goat was influenced by the general stunted growth of the plant, as well as by the abundance of spiny stems. This fact allows chalcids to escape goat herbivory on a very fine spatial scale. Gall survival strongly depends on gall position in the inflorescence, being greater in the lower position. Furthermore, galls situated in the lower sector of the plant have a greater survival chance than galls situated in the upper sector. The goat acted as a true predator of the gall maker wasp, becoming a potential selective agent conditioning the reproductive success of Systasis. The relationship between goat and gall-maker is an asymmetrical hierarchy mediated by size differences, the bigger one conditions the smaller one, but the reverse does not occur. We propose that under low herbivore pressure, the gall makers (and similar invertebrate sessile forms) will show a spatial oviposition preference which is less selective that under strong herbivore pressure.",,"ZAMORA, R (corresponding author), UNIV GRANADA,FAC CIENCIAS,DEPT BIOL ANIM & ECOL,E-18001 GRANADA,SPAIN.",,"Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017; Zamora, Renato/ABE-6898-2020; Zamora, Regino/B-3179-2010","Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664; Zamora, Renato/0000-0002-2223-3361; Zamora, Regino/0000-0002-5049-9968",,,,33,25,26,0,11,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1993,66,2,,,,,223,228,,10.2307/3544808,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KJ535,WOS:A1993KJ53500006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Arthropods, spiders in particular, were most abundant in upper tree parts and in the outer sections of branches. There was a high correlation between food abundance and bird density, based on proportional use of foraging sites over eight sections of spruce suggesting that food distribution is a major factor influencing the segregative distribution of the four bird species. However, the distribution of the bird species cannot be explained solely by food abundance. In outer tree parts there were fewer birds than expected from arthropod biomass. A possible explanation is that the risk of predation by Pygmy Owls Glaucidium passerinum is higher there, reducing the net benefit of foraging in the tree parts with highest food abundance. A further support for the impact of predation comes from the fact that it is the socially least dominant species, the Goldcrest and the Coal Tit P. ater, that use the outer tree parts. Crested Tits P. cristatus are highest in dominance rank, but they mainly forage in the inner tree parts. Willow Tits P. montanus are second in the dominance, but have the lowest food abundance in their foraging sites. Both interspecific competition over food, and the site-dependent risk of predation, seem to govern the ways in which the four bird species select their foraging sites in spruce in winter.","SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DEPT WILDLIFE ECOL,S-75007 UPPSALA,SWEDEN; UNIV UPPSALA,DEPT ZOOL,S-75122 UPPSALA,SWEDEN","SUHONEN, J (corresponding author), UNIV JYVASKYLA,DEPT BIOL,KONNEVESI RES STN,YLIOPISTONKATU 9,SF-40100 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND.",,,"Hoglund, Jacob/0000-0002-5840-779X",,,,44,38,39,0,23,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-5693,,,ORNIS SCAND,,OCT-DEC,1992,23,4,,,,,467,474,,10.2307/3676678,,,8,Ornithology,Zoology,KA562,WOS:A1992KA56200006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Furthermore, our view of phytophagous insect populations is probably biased by the more frequent attention given to economic pests whose dynamics might be expected to be somewhat exceptional. Herein, we report on the population dynamics and community-level features in a diverse, native fauna of phytophagous insects associated with goldenrod (Solidago altissima), a native perennial plant that forms a dominant, long-persisting element in old-field succession. The data consist of censuses taken in six consecutive years at 16 old fields in the Finger Lakes Region of New York; five additional stands were followed for four consecutive years. Our analyses address two questions: (a) to what extent is the functional structure of the community (as reflected in such attributes to the herbivore load, guild spectrum, and dominance hierarchy) maintained by compensatory changes in the densities of the member species and (b) are certain traits associated with a species' tendency to fluctuate in density or to dominate the community? In general, populations of goldenrod insects fluctuated less than those of insects reported in the literature. Few were abundant; only 7 of the 138 species in the goldenrod fauna ever reached densities at which their biomass exceeded 0. 1% of the leaf biomass. The functional structure of the community, as reflected in the total herbivore load and the proportions of that load contributed by various guilds, varied widely in space and time. A small subset of the fauna remained dominant throughout the study; these species, whose populations occasionally irrupted, retained their high rank in relative abundance even during those periods when their populations were waning. There was no evidence for compensatory changes in the densities of species within guilds, as would be expected if a relatively distinct set of limiting resources were available to insects with different feeding styles. Species were no more likely to exhibit negative correlations with their guild mates than they were with members of other guilds. There was also little evidence of sporadic or diffuse competition within the fauna as a whole; even during population outbreaks, the dominant species rarely engendered decreases in the biomass or diversity of the remaining species, and increases in the total herbivore load were seldom associated with losses of species from the community. Several species were positively associated with one another on the basis of similar habitat requirements or the use by one species of conditions created by the presence of another. The community was predictable only in the sense that dominant species remained dominant and rare species rare. The abundance and population variability of species were not correlated with such traits as body size, generation time, or host range. Taxon-related trends, on the other hand, stood out; coleopterans tended to be abundant whereas lepidopterans were rare, and hemipterans tended to fluctuate widely whereas dipterans remained relatively constant. Furthermore, species that were clumped in space (onto stems within fields) tended to be abundant and variable. The boom and bust dynamics of these aggregating species may be related to the ability of colonies to survive the inroads of generalist predators. The low degree of regional synchrony in the performance of populations at different sites suggests that large-scale, weather-driven fluctuations are uncommon. Our analysis of this well-developed, native insect fauna reveals a community that has a somewhat predictable structure that reflects the idiosyncracies of the component species. These species do not fluctuate in an integrated community-structuring manner, but as an outcome of each species performing at its individualistic' level, the community displays a characteristic dominance hierarchy. The members of this diverse fauna rarely achieve densities at which they compete with one another. Our results are consistent with Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin's hypothesis (1960) which predicts that terrestrial herbivores rarely deplete plant resources to levels at which there is widespread interspecific competition.",,"ROOT, RB (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, CORSON LAB, ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,93,138,139,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Its literature is classically scientific in the sense that it combines pattern discovery, theory, and empirical testing. It is, implicitly, one of the significant demonstrations that general ecological principles exist and can be discovered by hypothetico-deductive methodologies. I outline the development of the topic in the context of two questions, both of which take it as an assumption that habitat selection is an optimal-foraging process. How does habitat selection alter (or reinforce) the dynamics of population interactions? How do those interactions alter the optimal behavior? Competition within a single species forces the use of a wide variety of habitats. This has been shown in many taxa, and Fretwell's theory gives it a sound basis in evolutionary ecology. In other words, we ecologists know that the pattern exists, and we know why it exists. Ecologists are capitalizing on their understanding of single-species habitat selection to design methods for comparing fitnesses (and components of fitnesses) in different habitats. It has been known for 40 yr that a second, competing species can reverse the effects of competition within a species, producing habitat selection where it would not otherwise exist. For the past decade, however, we have been discovering that this effect is really a cluster of effects. Whether competition restores selectivity depends on the kind of competition at work and on the information-gathering abilities of foragers. So does the extent to which it is restored. Generally, the strongest separation of species by habitat selection results from distinct-preference competition between species whose individuals have very limited abilities to assess the density of food in a patch. (This model yields the ghost of competition past.) But if individuals have much ability to assess food density, there is little or no increase likely in their selectivity compared with the single-species case. Other sorts of competition produce intermediate results. The effects of interspecific competition on habitat selection have been investigated with theory and experiment working closely together. The by-products of the combination have been that new sorts of competitive relationship have been suggested and that it has been possible to compare these relationships with those suggested from other areas of investigation such as plant-herbivore interactions, succession, and plant specializations. Habitat selection may stabilize predation as well as competition. Sih has shown that the conditions required for stabilization closely resemble those predicted by optimal-foraging theory: Victims need to prefer the safer habitat most when their populations are lowest or when their chance of being killed in the riskier habitat is highest. Numerous experiments show that foragers behave appropriately to protect themselves from predation. Multispecies studies emphasize the potential for differential susceptibility and optimal habitat selection to maintain diverse communities. Despite, or perhaps because of, the rich understanding that the study of habitat selection has already engendered, many new and exciting topics are emerging. Perhaps the most challenging is the combination of time scales that allows pheotypes to change morphologically and physiologically as well as behaviorally. It seems probable that investigators interested in these topics will continue to receive substantial payoffs for their efforts.","UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,,,,,,57,407,410,2,141,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

This biodiversity loss is generally facilitated by human activities such as land cover change and hydrological alternation. Recent advances in stable isotope analysis (SIA) have been highlighted in many studies addressing fundamental issues in invasion ecology, especially in quantifying competition for resources between native and exotic species. However, how anthropogenic disturbance influences trophic relationships among invasive and native species remains poorly understood. Location Middle-lower Yangtze River Region, China. Methods To investigate the effects of human disturbance on interspecific trophic interactions, this study compared isotopic niche space and overlap of the introduced red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and the native oriental river shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) and freshwater snail (Bellamya aeruginosa) in natural and modified wetlands. Results Based on carbon and nitrogen SIA, we found ubiquitous niche shifts in macroinvertebrates with increased competition, which might lead to significant niche contraction in modified habitats at both community and population scales. Moreover, the isotopic niche width of the exotic crayfish was twice as larger as that of natives at both habitats, suggesting that the exotic P. clarkii had great competitive superiority over the native species. However, the effects of habitat modification on niche overlap were inconsistent. While the niche overlap between crayfish and shrimp was significantly higher in modified habitats than in natural open waters, niche overlap between crayfish and the snail was significantly reduced. Main conclusions Collectively, our findings highlight that the competitive outcomes of interspecific trophic interactions can be dependent on the prey availability and diversity, which embraces both the classic optimal foraging theory and competition theory to understand how environmental change, such as habitat alternation, affects the biological invasion processes.","[Wang, Yuyu; Tan, Wenzhuo; Li, Bin; Wen, Li; Lei, Guangchun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuyu; Tan, Wenzhuo; Li, Bin; Lei, Guangchun] Natl Field Sci Observat & Res Stn Dongting Lake W, Hanshou, Peoples R China; [Wen, Li] NSW Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Sci Div, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Lei, GC (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",guangchun.lei@foxmail.com,,"WEN, LI/0000-0003-3783-3826; Wang, Yuyu/0000-0003-2081-5277",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017ZY15]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0405303],"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2017ZY15; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFC0405303",,80,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Differences in body shape (relative area of the dorsal fin, length of head, height of the caudal peduncle, the aspect ratio of the pectoral and pelvic fin) favored divergent swimming performances (more maneuverability in S. notomelas and continuous swimming to Serrapinnus sp.1). We also observed divergences in trophic apparatus traits and correlations with different diets. In this context, it is highlighted that understanding the relationship between morphology and diet can assist in elucidating the processes that permeate the coexistence between sympatric species, and between ontogenetic periods. Besides, the relevant contribution of the measures of the trophic apparatus (gill raker length, the number of teeth cuspids, and intestinal coefficient) in trophic segregation seems to be a strong evidence in favor of the proposed discriminatory and predictive capacities of these traits.","[Kotz Kliemann, Bruna Caroline] Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Inst Biociencias, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol Zool,Lab Ecol Peix, Campus Botucatu,Rua Moncao 226, BR-15385000 Ilha Solteira, SP, Brazil; [Galdioli, Eliana Maria; Bialetzki, Andrea] Univ Estadual Marina UEM, Lab Ictioplancton Nucleo Pesquisas Limnol Ictiol, Ctr Ciencias Biol CCB, Ave Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Bialetzki, Andrea] Univ Estadual Maringa, CCB, Dept Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Ave Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Delariva, Rosilene Luciana] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, Lieb Lab Ictiol Ecol & Biomoniloramento, Programa Posgrad Conservacao & Manejo Recursos Na, Rua Univ 2069, BR-85819110 Cascavel, PR, Brazil","Kliemann, BCK (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Inst Biociencias, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol Zool,Lab Ecol Peix, Campus Botucatu,Rua Moncao 226, BR-15385000 Ilha Solteira, SP, Brazil.",bruna.kliemann@unesp.br; bialetzki@nupelia.uem.br; emgaldioli@uem.br; rosilene.delariva@unioeste.br,,"Kliemann, Bruna Caroline Kotz/0000-0002-7972-2043",programs PIE/PELD/CNPq [558118/2009-7]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [480804/2010-9]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001],"this work was supported by programs PIE/PELD/CNPq (Process number 558118/2009-7) and CNPq (Process number 480804/2010-9), and was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) Finance Code 001.

However, it is challenging to track the varying bacterial interactions using pairwise correlation analysis, which fails to explore their potential effects on the behavior of microbes. Here, we utilized a regularized sequential locally weighted global linear map (S-map) to capture the varying interspecific interactions from the time series data of a bacterial community under exposure to nitrite. Our results show that bacterial interactions are highly variable and that asymmetric interactions dominate the interaction pattern in a community. Furthermore, we propose a Jacobian coefficient-based statistical method to predict the harmony level of a bacterial community at each successive ecosystem state. The results show that the bacterial community exhibits a higher harmony level in nitrite-treated samples than in the control group. We show that the community harmony level is positively associated with the specific endogenous respiration rates and biofilm formation of the culture. In addition, the community tends to process lower diversity and structural stability under zero- and high-nitrite stresses. We demonstrate that the harmony level, rather than structural stability, is a useful index for unveiling the underlying mechanism of bacterial performance. Overall, the regularized S-map can help us to understand bacterial interactions in ecosystems more accurately than previous approaches. IMPORTANCE It has long been acknowledged that bacterial interactions play important roles in community structure and function. Revealing the interaction variability can allow an understanding of how bacteria respond to perturbation and why bacterial community performance changes. Such information should improve our skills in engineering bacterial communities (e.g., in a wastewater treatment plant) and achieve better removal performance and lower energy consumption.","[Yu, Zhong; Gan, Zhihao; Huang, Hao; Zhu, Yuelan; Meng, Fangang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhong; Gan, Zhihao; Huang, Hao; Zhu, Yuelan; Meng, Fangang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Environm Pollut Control &, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Meng, FG (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.; Meng, FG (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Environm Pollut Control &, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",mengfg@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51622813, 51808564]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China [2018B020202, 2017B020216006, 2015A020215014]; Key Research & Developmental Program of Shandong Province [2019JZZY020308]","We acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 51622813 and 51808564), the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China (grants 2018B020202, 2017B020216006, and 2015A020215014), and the Key Research & Developmental Program of Shandong Province (grant 2019JZZY020308).

Diversity in MSG composition ranges from two to 70 species of very similar or completely different phenotypes. Yet consistency in organization is also observable in that one or a few species usually have disproportionate importance for MSG formation and/or maintenance. We propose a two-dimensional framework for understanding this diversity and consistency, concentrating on the types of interactions possible between two individuals, usually of different species. One axis represents the similarity of benefit types traded between the individuals, while the second axis expresses asymmetry in the relative amount of benefits/costs accrued. Considering benefit types, one extreme represents the case of single-species groups wherein all individuals obtain the same supplementary, group-size-related benefits, and the other extreme comprises associations of very different, but complementary species (e.g. one partner creates access to food while the other provides vigilance). The relevance of social information and the matching of activities (e.g. speed of movement) are highest for relationships on the supplementary side of this axis, but so is competition; relationships between species will occur at points along this gradient where the benefits outweigh the costs. Considering benefit amounts given or received, extreme asymmetry occurs when one species is exclusively a benefit provider and the other a benefit user. Within this parameter space, some MSG systems are constrained to one kind of interaction, such as shoals of fish of similar species or leader-follower interactions in fish and other taxa. Other MSGs, such as terrestrial bird flocks, can simultaneously include a variety of supplementary and complementary interactions. We review the benefits that species obtain across the diversity of MSG types, and argue that the degree and nature of asymmetry between benefit providers and users should be measured and not just assumed. We then discuss evolutionary shifts in MSG types, focusing on drivers towards similarity in group composition, and selection on benefit providers to enhance the benefits they can receive from other species. Finally, we conclude by considering how individual and collective behaviour in MSGs may influence both the structure and processes of communities.","[Goodale, Eben] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Guangxi Key Lab Forest Ecol & Conservat, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Sridhar, Hari; Bangal, Priti; Theo, Anne; Shanker, Kartik] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru 560012, Karnataka, India; [Sridhar, Hari] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Sieving, Kathryn E.; Montano-Centellas, Flavia] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Colorado Z., Gabriel J.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Medellin 050034, Colombia; [Farine, Damien R.] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Univ Str 10, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Farine, Damien R.] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Farine, Damien R.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Heymann, Eckhard W.] Leibniz Inst Primatenforsch, Deutsch Primatenzentrum, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Jones, Harrison H.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Jones, Harrison H.] Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Krams, Indrikis] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51410 Tartu, Estonia; [Krams, Indrikis] Univ Latvia, Fac Biol, Det Zool & Anim Ecol, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia; [Martinez, Ari E.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Munoz, Jenny] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1ZA, Canada; [Munoz, Jenny] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1ZA, Canada; [Srinivasan, Umesh] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Shanker, Kartik] Dakshin Fdn, Bengaluru 560092, India","Shanker, K (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru 560012, Karnataka, India.; Sieving, KE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Shanker, K (corresponding author), Dakshin Fdn, Bengaluru 560092, India.",chucao@ufl.edu; kshanker@gmail.com,"Farine, Damien R./Y-2454-2019; Montano-Centellas, Flavia/K-8046-2019; Goodale, Eben/AAM-7436-2020; Sieving, Kathryn/I-6058-2013","Farine, Damien R./0000-0003-2208-7613; Montano-Centellas, Flavia/0000-0003-3115-3950; Goodale, Eben/0000-0003-3403-2847; Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108; Jones, Harrison/0000-0003-1402-4778; Colorado, Gabriel/0000-0003-3807-3646; Sridhar, Hari/0000-0003-3286-0120; Shanker, Kartik/0000-0003-4856-0093; Sieving, Kathryn/0000-0002-0849-8101; Munoz Z, Jenny/0000-0001-8602-4350","National Science Foundation (National Science Foundation, Division of Environmental Biology)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1640489]; Special Talents Recruitment of Guangxi University; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31560119, 31770424]; Indian National Science Academy; Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence StrategyGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [EXC 2117-422037984]; Estonian Research CouncilEstonian Research Council [PUT1223]; Latvian Council of ScienceLatvian Ministry of Education and Science [lzp-2018/1-0393]; DBT-IISc Partnership ProgrammeNewton-Al-Farabi Partnership Programme; Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change","We thank the National Science Foundation (National Science Foundation, Division of Environmental Biology, grant 1640489 to K.

In this context, we described the floral biology of 48 species from a seasonally flooded community with the aim of exploring the relationship between floral traits, examining the diversity of pollination syndromes and evaluating the effectiveness of this concept to predict pollinator classes. The overlap of flowering periods of species with the same pollination syndromes and/or pollinator classes was also explored in order to look for a pattern that could reflect the adverse effects of the pollinators overlap. Methods: The sexual system, dichogamy and/or hercogamy, type of pollination unit, dimensions, form, symmetry and spatial orientation of the flower, floral attractants and rewards, time of anthesis, floral longevity, pollination syndromes and pollinator classes were described for each species. Interspecific overlap was estimated using Pianka's index, and then contrasted with randomly generated values. Key results: Most species were hermaphrodite, adichogamous and not hercogamous; showed individual pollination units, with small dimensions, open forms, radial symmetry, horizontal orientation, white color, and nectar as the principal reward. Flowers showed mainly diurnal anthesis and short longevity, generally of one day. Melittophily was the predominant pollination syndrome and bees were the principal class of pollinators, even though some species were pollinated by more than one type of agent. Temporal distribution of flowering periods did not differ from what it expected from a random arrangement. Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that beyond predictions from floral syndromes, in the community prevails an allophilic system that possibly results in greater pollination opportunities for plant species.","[Barrios, Yeni] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Jardin Bot Merida, Apdo 52, Merida 5212, Venezuela; [Barrios, Yeni] Ctr Invest Cient Yucatan, Unidad Recursos Nat, AC Calle 43,130 X 32 & 34, Merida 97205, Yucatan, Mexico; [Ramirez, Nelson] Univ Cent Venezuela, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Bot Trop, Inst Biol Expt, Apdo 48312, Caracas 1041A, Venezuela","Barrios, Y (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Jardin Bot Merida, Apdo 52, Merida 5212, Venezuela.; Barrios, Y (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Cient Yucatan, Unidad Recursos Nat, AC Calle 43,130 X 32 & 34, Merida 97205, Yucatan, Mexico.",yeniceleste@gmail.com,,,,,,58,0,0,0,2,INST ECOLOGIA AC,PATZCUARO,"CENTRO REGIONAL DEL BAJIO, APARTADO POSTAL 386, PATZCUARO, MICHOACAN 61600, MEXICO",0187-7151,,,ACTA BOT MEX,Acta.

We implemented an innovative trophic interaction framework for novel communities and quantified the interaction strength and impact potential of a truly novel species (marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis) with a resident non-native counterpart (spiny-cheek crayfish Faxonius limosus). As prey, we used Dreissena mussels, which are non-native as well and now hold a key position in many European and North American aquatic ecosystems. For both crayfish species, we predicted functional responses based on a mechanistic model that we parameterised with a set of experimental observations of foraging behaviour and satiation. We compared these predicted functional responses to empirically observed responses. In addition, we incorporated behavioural traits such as aggression, activity, and boldness in the comparisons between the species and individuals to determine their influence on functional responses. We tested individuals from aquarium stocks as well as naturalised individuals from invaded water bodies. Altogether, we performed 1,095 experiments with 26 individual crayfish. We found that per capita predation of spiny-cheek crayfish exceeded that of marbled crayfish from aquaria and naturalised individuals. Functional responses differed between species and were mostly higher for spiny-cheek crayfish males. Marbled crayfish, however, were more voracious and reached satiation more slowly. Consumption rates correlated with aggression for marbled crayfish and with an aggressive threat response for spiny-cheek crayfish. We conclude that spiny-cheek crayfish can reach higher short-term consumption rates than marbled crayfish, but both species probably do not substantially affect Dreissena mussel populations in the field. For marbled crayfish, high long-term consumption, interspecific aggression, and reproduction rates can promote their establishment and spread. Risk assessments of these invaders should be improved by considering numerical responses, and different prey organisms and predators.","[Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Chem Pharm, Berlin, Germany; [Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany","Linzmaier, SM (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.",stefan.linzmaier@gmail.com,"Jeschke, Jonathan M/A-2707-2008","Jeschke, Jonathan M/0000-0003-3328-4217","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [JE 288/9-1, JE 288/9-2]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: JE 288/9-1 and JE 288/9-2",,132,3,3,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The effects of interspecific competition on stress in wildlife remain largely unexplored. In Australia, remnant woodlands are often dominated by aggressive honeyeaters, especially the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). Harassment of smaller birds by miners may result in their exclusion from suitable woodland habitat. We tested whether the presence of noisy miners is also associated with elevated stress in a model species of small passerine bird, the superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus). We sampled wrens from six sites, three remnant woodlands with noisy miners and three larger fragments of reserved habitat without noisy miners. Differential white blood cell counts were used to infer levels of chronic stress. We also assessed variation in body condition and the prevalence of blood parasites (Haemoproteus spp.) to test for associations between stress and parasitemia. The mean heterophil-to-lymphocyte (H:L) ratio was 1.8 x higher among superb fairy-wrens living in miner-dominated woodlands, suggesting higher levels of chronic stress. Individuals with higher stress appeared to be in poorer condition, as indicated by fat scores and residual body mass. Prevalence of blood parasites was generally high and was highest in reserved habitat (59%) where miners were absent. Birds with blood parasites living in these habitats had higher H:L ratios but the intensity of infection and H:L ratio was inversely related. Our results suggest that birds persisting in the presence of noisy miners might experience chronic stress, but further study is necessary to separate the relative importance of noisy miner aggression from other potential stressors in small patches of degraded woodland. Stress induced by interspecific aggression should be considered in future studies of wildlife living in remnant vegetation.","[Bain, Glen C.; Johnson, Chris N.; Jones, Menna E.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Bain, GC (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",glen.bain@utas.edu.au,"Bain, Glen/AAA-2647-2020; Johnson, Chris/J-7894-2014","Bain, Glen/0000-0003-1760-6706; Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022; Johnson, Chris/0000-0002-9719-3771",,,,75,1,1,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,NOV,2019,44,7,,,,,1139,1149,,10.1111/aec.12785,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JF6IA,WOS:000491490300003,,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

In the present study we evaluated the contact and distant effects of P. canaliculata in its native range on exotic (Melanoides tuberculata and Physa acuta) and native snails (Heleobia parchappii, Biomphalaria peregrina, and Chilina parchappii). Habitat use was affected in P. acuta, H. parchappii, and B. peregrina by contact effects of P. canaliculata, whereas survival was only affected in P. acuta through combined contact and distant effects. Fecundity was reduced in P. acuta and B. peregrina by combined contact and distant effects; evidence of egg mass predation was also observed in both species. Melanoides tuberculata was not affected at all by P. canaliculata. The snail species with higher withdrawal responses to contacts with P. canaliculata were those that suffered less mortality by corporal contact, whereas snails with high crawling away responses suffered from higher mortality. The effects of P. canaliculata seem to be highly negative to small nonoperculate snails that lay gelatinous egg masses, whereas large operculate ovoviviparous snails are not affected in their survival and reproduction. This apple snail may exert biotic resistance against P. acuta but could favor the establishment of M. tuberculata and other functionally similar species in new habitats in South America.","[Maldonado, Mara A.; Martin, Pablo R.] Univ Nacl Sur, CONICET, INBIOSUR, Lab Ecol DBByF, San Juan 670, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Martin, PR (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Sur, CONICET, INBIOSUR, Lab Ecol DBByF, San Juan 670, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",pablorafaelmartin@gmail.com,,,"UNS (Universidad Nacional del Sur) [PGI 24/B185, 24/B232]; ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica)ANPCyT [PICT 2012-1956]","This work was funded with grants from UNS (Universidad Nacional del Sur, PGI 24/B185 and 24/B232) and ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, PICT 2012-1956).

Compared to monoculture, soil water balance of intercropped maize was significantly reduced by 115%, while that of alfalfa was dramatically enhanced by 469%. Thus, intercropped maize had pronouncedly reduced root growth by 17-36%, phosphorus uptake by 24%, and yield by 12%, but the associated alfalfa had significantly increased root growth by 26%-175%, phosphorus uptake by 208%, and yield by 137%, leading to significantly improved phosphorus uptake and yield of the composite population. Among root morphological and distribution traits, crown root surface area and lateral root volume were the best predictors of maize and alfalfa phosphorus uptake, respectively.ConclusionsLegume-dominated maize/alfalfa intercropping can significantly improve phosphorus acquisition and yield production through modifications in soil water balance and root morphology and distribution, and the system overyielding was performed via alfalfa rather than maize.","[Sun, Baoru; Gao, Yingzhi; Li, Zhijian] Northeast Normal Univ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Baoru] IBCAS, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yingzhi; Yang, Haijun; Zhang, Wei] Yili Normal Univ, Sch Biol & Geog Sci, Yining 835000, Xinjiang, Peoples R China","Gao, YZ; Li, ZJ (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China.; Gao, YZ (corresponding author), Yili Normal Univ, Sch Biol & Geog Sci, Yining 835000, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",gaoyz108@nenu.edu.cn; Lizj004@nenu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2016YFC0500703]; Human Resources and Social Security Department of Jilin Province [2016-28]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31670446, 31270444]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [Y821RE1001]; Major State Basic Research Development Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB150801]","This work was financially supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2016YFC0500703), Human Resources and Social Security Department of Jilin Province (2016-28), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670446, 31270444), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Y821RE1001), and the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (2015CB150801).",,61,12,13,9,78,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2019,439,1-2,,,SI,,145,161,,10.1007/s11104-018-3888-y,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,IH3YP,WOS:000474429100011,,,,,2021-09-21,

Matsum. & Nakai] grown in plasticulture. Transplant types included 'Exclamation' seedless watermelon as the nongrafted control as well as Exclamation grafted onto two interspecific hybrid squash (ISH) rootstocks, 'Carnivor' and 'Kazako'. To simulate weed emergence throughout the season, establishment treatments (EST) consisted of two seedlings each of common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), large crabgrass [Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.], and yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) transplanted in a 15 by 15 cm square centered on watermelon plants at 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6 wk after watermelon transplanting (WATr) and remained until the final watermelon harvest at 11 WATr. To simulate weed control at different times in the season, removal treatments (REM) consisted of two seedlings of the same weed species transplanted in a 15 by 15 cm square centered on watermelon plants on the same day of watermelon transplanting and allowed to remain until 2, 3, 4, 6, and 11 WATr, at which time they were removed. Season-long weedy and weed-free controls were included for both EST and REM studies in both years. For all transplant types, aboveground biomass of weeds decreased as weed establishment was delayed and increased as weed removal was delayed. The predicted CPWC for nongrafted Exclamation and Carnivor required only a single weed removal between 2.3 and 2.5 WATr and 1.9 and 2.6 WATr, respectively, while predicted CPWC for Kazako rootstock occurred from 0.3 to 2.6 WATr. Our study results suggest that weed control for this mixed population of weeds would be similar between nongrafted Exclamation and Exclamation grafted onto Carnivor. But the observed CPWC of Exclamation grafted onto Kazako suggests that CPWC may vary with specific rootstock-scion combinations.","[Bertucci, Matthew B.; Jennings, Katherine M.; Schultheis, Jonathan R.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Hort Sci, 2721 Founders, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [Bertucci, Matthew B.] Turf Pasture & Specialty Crop Weed Management, Dept Crop Soli & Environm Sci, Raleigh, NC USA; [Monks, David W.] North Carolina Agr Res Serv, Raleigh, NC USA; [Louws, Frank J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [Louws, Frank J.] North Carolina State Univ, Natl Sci Fdn, Ctr Integrated Pest Management, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [Jordan, David L.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [Brownie, Cavell] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA","Bertucci, MB (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Hort Sci, 2721 Founders, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA.",mbbertuc@ncsu.edu,,"Jennings, Katherine/0000-0003-3708-3973; Louws, Frank/0000-0002-6700-5581; Bertucci, Matthew/0000-0002-0661-8990", [USDA-NIFA-2011-51181-30963],"The authors express appreciation to the following individuals for their assistance with conducting this research: Sushila Chaudhari, David Suchoff, Brad Thompson, Keith Starke, Nicholas Basinger, Stephen Smith, Sam McGowen, Shawn Beam, Matt Waldschmidt, Wesley Hairr, and the station crew at the Horticultural Crops Research Station in Clinton, NC.

However, the interspecific interactions that result in the negative impacts on native species tend to be poorly understood. One contributing factor to this knowledge gap may be that the vulnerability of native species can vary between different life-history stages. For example, the parental care phase is often risky both for the developing offspring and care-giving parents. Accordingly, we investigated the interactions between invasive mud crabs, Rhithropanopeus harrissii, and native nest-building littoral fish, with a special focus on the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus. Firstly, our field survey demonstrated that while the recently established mud crab and native nest-building fish have different habitat and depth optima, their distributions also have a considerable overlap, with a high potential for interactions between them. Secondly, our laboratory experiments indicate that the crabs are likely to impact the fish negatively, especially by taking over occupied nests, as well as pre-occupying nesting resources that are of very limited supply in the studied population. We did not find evidence for successful predation on eggs guarded by male sand gobies naive to the mud crabs. Collectively, the results suggest that the invasive crabs have high potential to negatively impact native fish. Furthermore, the results support the scenario that the parental phase can be a particularly vulnerable life-history stage in face of novel selection pressures, such as species invasions.","[Lehtonen, Topi K.; Vesakoski, Outi; Yli-Rosti, Juho] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Lehtonen, Topi K.; Saarinen, Anniina] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 25 Rainforest Walk, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Vesakoski, Outi] Univ Turku, Archipelago Res Inst, Turku 20014, Finland; [Saarinen, Anniina; Lindstrom, Kai] Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Tykistokatu 6, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland","Lehtonen, TK (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 25 Rainforest Walk, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",topilehtonen@gmail.com,"Lindstrom, Kai/ABG-4353-2020; Lehtonen, Topi/A-6679-2010; /B-5479-2008","Lindstrom, Kai/0000-0002-8356-5538; Lehtonen, Topi/0000-0002-1372-9509; /0000-0002-8356-5538; Vesakoski, Outi/0000-0002-7220-3347",Finnish Foundation for Nature Conservation; University of Turku; VIPU,"We thank the Finnish Foundation for Nature Conservation and the University of Turku for funding (to T.K.L.), and the Tvarminne Zoological Station staff for logistic support.

Furthermore, herbivory mediates the effects of warming on plant community composition in many systems. Thus, determining the importance of direct and indirect effects of warming, while considering the role of herbivory, can help predict long-term plant community dynamics. We conducted a field experiment in the coastal wetlands of western Alaska to investigate how warming and herbivory influence the interactions and abundances of two common plant species, a sedge, Carex ramenskii, and a dwarf shrub, Salix ovalifolia. We used results from the experiment to model the equilibrium abundances of the species under different warming and grazing scenarios and to determine the contribution of direct and indirect effects to predict population changes. Consistent with the current composition of the landscape, model predictions suggest that Carex is more abundant than Salix under ambient temperatures with grazing (53% and 27% cover, respectively). However, with warming and grazing, Salix becomes more abundant than Carex (57% and 41% cover, respectively), reflecting both a negative response of Carex and a positive response of Salix to warming. While grazing reduced the cover of both species, herbivory did not prevent a shift in dominance from sedges to the dwarf shrub. Direct effects of climate change explained about 97% of the total predicted change in species cover, whereas indirect effects explained only 3% of the predicted change. Thus, indirect effects, mediated by interactions between Carex and Salix, were negligible, likely due to use of different niches and weak interspecific interactions. Results suggest that a 2 degrees C increase could cause a shift in dominance from sedges to woody plants on the coast of western Alaska over decadal timescales, and this shift was largely a result of the direct effects of warming. Models predict this shift with or without goose herbivory. Our results are consistent with other studies showing an increase in woody plant abundance in the Arctic and suggest that shifts in plant-plant interactions are not driving this change.","[Beard, Karen H.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Beard, Karen H.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Beard, KH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.; Beard, KH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",karen.beard@usu.edu,"Carlson, Lindsay Gray/AAE-3484-2020; Beard, Karen/B-7177-2011; Carlson, Lindsay Gray/AAC-4302-2019","Beard, Karen/0000-0003-4997-2495; Carlson, Lindsay Gray/0000-0003-1592-6458","Utah Agricultural Experiment Station; Utah State University; National Science Foundation (NSF) Arctic System Science ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1304523, 1304879]; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1304523] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Utah Agricultural Experiment Station; Utah State University; National Science Foundation (NSF) Arctic System Science Program awards 1304523 and 1304879,,58,7,7,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, few studies have simultaneously considered both types of effects and assessed the relative importance of these factors. In this study, we used data collected over nine months (August 2012-May 2013) from a typical subtropical reservoir in southeast China to analyze the temporal variation of its phytoplankton community structure and develop a quantitative understanding of the extrinsic and intrinsic effects on phytoplankton community dynamics. Significant temporal variations were observed in environmental variables as well as the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities, whereas their variational trajectories and directions were entirely different. Variance partitioning analysis showed that extrinsic factors significantly explained only 31% of the variation in the phytoplankton community, thus suggesting that these factors were incomplete predictors of the community structure. Random forest-based models showed that 48% of qualified responsible phytoplankton species were more accurately predicted by phytoplankton-only models, which revealed clear effects of interspecific species-to-species interactions. Furthermore, we used association networks to model the interactions among phytoplankton, zooplankton and the environment. Network comparisons indicated that interspecific interactions were widely present in the phytoplankton community and dominated the network rather than those between phytoplankton and extrinsic factors. These findings expand the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern phytoplankton community dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The survival probability of: white/Engelmann spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss/Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) was modeled using tree size (dbh), competition estimates (basal area of the larger trees by species group), climate normal, tagging limits and the time elapsed between consecutive measurements. Survival increased nonlinearly with tree size and the effect of competition on tree survival was related to the shade-tolerance of the species and to stand composition, with shade intolerant conifer species (i.e. lodgepole and jack pine) being more negatively affected by competition compared to shade intolerant deciduous species (trembling aspen and balsam poplar) and shade tolerant spruce species (white and black spruce). Competition from larger spruce (Picea spp.), fir (Abies spp.) and deciduous species (e.g. Populus spp. and Betula spp.) had stronger influences on survival than pine species (Pinus spp.). Intraspecific competition also had significant effects on survival of the majority of the species. Climate Moisture Index provided better results than other climate variables for most species and survival probability increased with increasing values of CMI (i.e. relatively cooler and wetter climate), while for pine species survival probability decreased with increasing CMI and showed higher levels of survival on warmer and drier sites for the range of conditions included in our data. The predictive equations developed in this study could be used to improve the predictive ability of existing growth and yield models such as the Mixedwood Growth Model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The distribution of the introduced calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE) shifted from brackish to fresh water in 1993 following the introductions of 2 brackish-water copepods, the small but numerically dominant Limnoithona tetraspina (Cyclo poida) and the predatory Acartiella sinensis (Calanoida). The nearly simultaneous timing of these introductions complicated interpretation of the temporal change in distribution of P. forbesi. Although P. forbesi is now uncommon at salinity >similar to 2, which might be interpreted as the result of salinity stress, short-term experiments showed high survival of adults up to salinity similar to 8 and of nauplii to salinity of at least 14, and reproduction was highest at salinity 5. Feeding experiments showed some overlap in diets of P. forbesi and L. tetraspina, but P. forbesi consumed a broader range of prey than L. tetraspina. Furthermore, feeding rates of the L. tetraspina population appeared insufficient to reduce prey availability to P. forbesi. Previous reports of high consumption of nauplii by A. sinensis and the clam Potamocorbula amurensis suggest that these interspecific interactions are important in constraining the distribution of P. forbesi in the upper SFE. Thus, we interpret the temporal shift in distribution of P. forbesi as due mainly to the introduction of the predatory copepod, whose high abundance may have been facilitated by the availability of a common alternative prey, L. tetraspina.","[Kayfetz, Karen] Delta Stewardship Council, Delta Sci Program, 980 9th St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Kimmerer, Wim] San Francisco State Univ, Romberg Tiburon Ctr Environm Studies, 3152 Paradise Dr, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA","Kayfetz, K (corresponding author), Delta Stewardship Council, Delta Sci Program, 980 9th St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA.",karen.kayfetz@deltacouncil.ca.gov,,"Kayfetz, Karen/0000-0003-3236-4469",U.S. Dept. of Interior agreement [R10AC20074],"We thank A.

In this paper we analysed the behavioural relationships between two species of crayfish, the native Astacus leptodactylus and the invasive Orconectes limosus in an ongoing invasion process in the Lower Danube, in Eastern Europe. We tested the species' ability to acquire shelter and food in laboratory experiments in both intra- and interspecific confrontations. The dominant behaviour of the invasive species is obvious even towards its own congeners, while the native species display a more tolerant conspecific behaviour. With respect to interspecific confrontation, the invasive crayfish males and females were inclined to sex-specific dominance regarding shelters. A roughly balanced behaviour was noted for intersexual confrontations. The results of this study also highlight that the occupancy of a shelter is more disputed than food resources, which appear to be opportunistically acquired. In the context of the current invasion process, we hypothesised that the effect caused by interference competition might lead to a decline of the native species. Further investigations may reveal if there is any hope for recovery of the native species.","[Lele, Sandra-Florina; Parvulescu, Lucian] West Univ Timisoara, Dept Biol Chem, Fac Chem Biol Geog, Timisoara 300115, Romania","Lele, SF (corresponding author), West Univ Timisoara, Dept Biol Chem, Fac Chem Biol Geog, Timisoara 300115, Romania.",sandra.lele@e-uvt.ro,"Lele, Sandra/M-1275-2015; Parvulescu, Lucian/A-1278-2012","Parvulescu, Lucian/0000-0002-1528-1429",Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation; CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0785],"This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0785.

Here, we identified mechanisms that facilitate partitioning of resources between 2 congeneric tropical seabirds, Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) and Lesser Frigatebirds (F. ariel), for which traditional research methods have documented high levels of resource overlap. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) indicated that throughout the breeding cycle, male and female Great Frigatebirds consumed prey with higher delta N-15 compared to male Lesser Frigatebirds. This trend was not significant when comparing delta N-15 values of male and female Great Frigatebirds to female Lesser Frigatebirds. During the breeding period, GPS tracking and SIA indicated considerable spatial overlap among species and sexes. This contrasted with SIA of samples that provide insight into nonbreeding resource acquisition because these indicated that male Great Frigatebirds and male Lesser Frigatebirds had lower delta C-13 values than females of each species, signifying greater use of offshore foraging grounds by males of both species. Together these results suggest that body size differences influence trophic position of the prey consumed. Furthermore, central-place foraging constraints, and spatially unpredictable resource distribution, limit potential for spatial differences in foraging strategies when breeding. By contrast, spatial distribution of foraging differs during the nonbreeding period as the requirement for central-place foraging is lifted.","[Mott, Rowan; Herrod, Ashley; Clarke, Rohan H.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia","Mott, R (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",rowan.mott@monash.edu,,"Mott, Rowan/0000-0002-3508-6479",BirdLife Australia's Stuart Leslie Bird Research Award; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Paddy Pallin Foundation,"This work was supported by funding from BirdLife Australia's Stuart Leslie Bird Research Award, the Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment, and the Paddy Pallin Foundation.",,113,9,9,0,54,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,APR,2017,134,1,,,,,153,167,,10.1642/AUK-16-184.1,,,15,Ornithology,Zoology,EI1AB,WOS:000392206100015,,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

We hypothesized that environmental stress leads to filtering (increasing the proportional abundance of tolerant species) and taxonomic dispersion (decreasing the number of species within genera and families). Environmental filtering would cause a decline in S by eliminating some stress-sensitive species and a reduction of J by allowing only tolerant species to maintain large populations. Taxonomic relatedness may influence both S and J by controlling the nature of interspecific interactions-positive under taxonomic dispersion versus negative under taxonomic clustering. Therefore, the S-J relationship may be a product of environmental filtering and taxonomic relatedness. We tested this framework with redundancy analyses and structural equation models using continental stream diatom and fish data. We confirmed that (i) environmental stress, defined by watershed forest cover, slope, and temperature, caused filtering (lower sensitive: tolerant species abundance ratios) and taxonomic dispersion (elevated genus: species richness and family: species richness ratios); (ii) S and J, which declined with filtering and taxonomic dispersion, exhibited a positive relationship; and (iii) the role of filtering on J was pronounced only under stressful conditions, while taxonomic dispersion remained an important predictor of J across stressful and favorable environments.","[Passy, Sophia I.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Box 19498, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Bottin, Marius] Univ Bordeaux, UMR INRA BioGeCo 1202, F-33400 Talence, France; [Soininen, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, POB 64, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Hillebrand, Helmut] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm ICBM, Schleusenstr 1, D-26382 Wilhemshaven, Germany","Passy, SI (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Box 19498, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",sophia.passy@uta.edu; marius.bottin@u-bordeaux.fr; janne.soininen@helsinki.fi; hillebrand@icbm.de,"Bottin, Marius/M-7986-2017; Passy, Sophia I./I-1449-2019; Soininen, Janne/A-4205-2008; Hillebrand, Helmut/I-1717-2014","Bottin, Marius/0000-0002-5102-3857; Hillebrand, Helmut/0000-0001-7449-1613; Soininen, Janne/0000-0002-8583-3137",,,,59,3,3,3,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,FEB,2017,787,1,,,,,243,253,,10.1007/s10750-016-2968-3,,,11,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,EF2FD,WOS:000390139200017,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

Furthermore, as abiotic conditions become more extreme, and intra-interspecific relationships intensify, the risk of local species extinction increases. The Parana River in South America is a river with an extensive floodplain with many shallow lakes. In these environments, freshwater prawns and many fish species coexist. The aim of the work was to study the interaction between two species of prawns (Palaemonetes argentinus and Macrobrachium borellii) and fishes during 'La Nina' phenomenon. Density variations of prawns and fishes were examined in three shallow lakes at Parana River. The samples were collected monthly at several points of each aquatic environment with a trawl net. Abiotic and biotic factors were measured. Density and population structure varied in both prawns, and fishes, and the changes have not been simultaneous. These variations might be associated with predation, aggressive behaviour of the prawns and internal micro-migrations. The effect of La Nina creates additional stress on prawn populations when water inflow is delayed. This fact could promote the decrease or the complete disappearance of one or both prawn species in the environments, and modify the trophic web in the next phase of the shallow lakes.","[Victoria Torres, Maria; Giri, Federico; Agustin Collins, Pablo] Inst Nacl Limnol CONICET UNL, Ciudad Univ Paraje El Pozo S-N, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Giri, Federico; Agustin Collins, Pablo] Fac Humanidades & Ciencias UNL, Ciudad Univ Paraje El Pozo S-N, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Agustin Collins, Pablo] Fac Bioquim & Ciencias Biol UNL, Ciudad Univ Paraje El Pozo S-N, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina","Torres, MV (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Limnol CONICET UNL, Ciudad Univ Paraje El Pozo S-N, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina.",mavictoriatorres@gmail.com,"Collins, Pablo/Q-7376-2017","Collins, Pablo/0000-0001-9611-9089",CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PICT-2014-1996]; PIP [11220110100998CO];  [CAI+D PI 501 201101 00501 LI],"This work was supported by grants from the Projects CAI+D PI 501 201101 00501 LI, CONICET 2012-2014, PIP number 11220110100998CO; PICT-2014-1996.",,84,2,2,0,3,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

To determine the effects of potential competitive and behavioral interactions between native predators and invasive lionfish, we experimentally altered the presence of lionfish and red grouper Epinephelus morio in karst solution holes in Florida Bay, USA, and then tracked subsequent changes in the juvenile reef fish and motile macroinvertebrate communities for 6 wk. Relative to solution holes where we excluded both predators, mean juvenile reef fish abundance declined 83.7% in solution holes with a lionfish but increased by 154% in solution holes with a red grouper. There was no difference in juvenile reef fish abundance in solution holes with both lionfish and red grouper compared to holes where we excluded both predators. The composition of lionfish stomach contents shifted from mostly teleost fishes when lionfish were present in solution holes alone, to mostly crustaceans when in the presence of a red grouper. Concurrently, the abundance of 2 species of cleaner shrimp (Ancylomenes pedersoni and Periclimenes yucatanicus) decreased by 14.7% when lionfish were present but increased by 56.2% at holes where lionfish were excluded. We suggest that these results are due to altered lionfish predatory behavior in the presence of red grouper and highlight the importance of maintaining intact native predator communities for ameliorating the negative effects of the lionfish invasion.","[Ellis, Robert D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Faletti, Meaghan E.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Div Marine Fisheries Management, 2950 Execut Ctr Circle East, Tallahassee, FL 32301 USA; [Ellis, Robert D.] Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",robert.ellis@myfwc.com,,"Ellis, Robert/0000-0001-7178-8980",PADI Foundation; Florida Sea Grant; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute (GCFI),"This project was conducted with permissions from the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (permit #FKNMS-2012-078), the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (SAL #11-1330-SR), and the FSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC Protocol #1106).

Improved SDMs, which account for biotic factors and do not require a priori knowledge on species interactions, are needed to fully understand species distributions. Here, we model the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on species distribution patterns and explore the robustness of distributions under future climate change. We fit hierarchical spatial models using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) for lagomorph species throughout Europe and test the predictive ability of models containing only abiotic factors against models containing abiotic and biotic factors. We account for residual spatial autocorrelation using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. Model outputs are used to estimate areas in which abiotic and biotic factors determine species' ranges. INLA models containing both abiotic and biotic factors had substantially better predictive ability than models containing abiotic factors only, for all but one of the four species. In models containing abiotic and biotic factors, both appeared equally important as determinants of lagomorph ranges, but the influences were spatially heterogeneous. Parts of widespread lagomorph ranges highly influenced by biotic factors will be less robust to future changes in climate, whereas parts of more localised species ranges highly influenced by the environment may be less robust to future climate. SDMs that do not explicitly include biotic factors are potentially misleading and omit a very important source of variation. For the field of species distribution modelling to advance, biotic factors must be taken into account in order to improve the reliability of predicting species distribution patterns both presently and under future climate change.

Species occurrence is influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of other species. Current approaches for multispecies occupancy modelling are practically limited to two interacting species and often require the assumption of asymmetric interactions. We propose amultispecies occupancymodel that can accommodate two ormore interacting species. 2. We generalize the single-species occupancy model to two or more interacting species by assuming the latent occupancy state is a multivariate Bernoulli random variable. We propose modelling the probability of each potential latent occupancy state with both a multinomial logit and a multinomial probit model and present details of aGibbs sampler for the latter. 3. As an example, we model co-occurrence probabilities of bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a function of human disturbance variables throughout 6 Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. We found evidence for pairwise interactions among most species, and the probability of some pairs of species occupying the same site varied along environmental gradients; for example, occupancy probabilities of coyote and grey fox were independent at sites with little human disturbance, but these two species were more likely to occur together at sites with high human disturbance. 4. Ecological communities are composed of multiple interacting species. Our proposed method improves our ability to draw inference from such communities by permitting modelling of detection/non-detection data from an arbitrary number of species, without assuming asymmetric interactions. Additionally, our proposed method permits modelling the probability two or more species occur together as a function of environmental variables. These advancements represent an important improvement in our ability to draw community-level inference from multiple interacting species that are subject to imperfect detection.","[Rota, Christopher T.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Rota, Christopher T.; Millspaugh, Joshua J.] Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlidfe Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Ferreira, Marco A.

In plants, interspecific pollen flow is common between co-occurring close relatives and may serve as the key mechanism of reproductive interference. Agamic complexes, systems in which some populations reproduce through asexual seeds (apomixis), while others reproduce sexually, provide an opportunity to examine effects of reproductive interference in limiting coexistence. Apomictic populations experience little or no reproductive interference, because apomictic ovules cannot receive pollen from nearby sexuals. Oppositely, apomicts produce some viable pollen and can exert reproductive interference on sexuals by siring hybrids. In the Crepis agamic complex, sexuals co-occur less often with other members of the complex, but apomicts appear to freely co-occur with one another. We identified a mixed population and conducted a crossing experiment between sexual diploid C.atribarba and apomictic polyploid C.barbigera using pollen from sexual diploids and apomictic polyploids. Seed set was high for all treatments, and as predicted, diploid-diploid crosses produced all diploid offspring. Diploid-polyploid crosses, however, produced mainly polyploidy offspring, suggesting that non-diploid hybrids can be formed when the two taxa meet. Furthermore, a small proportion of seeds produced in open-pollinated flowers was also polyploid, indicating that polyploid hybrids are produced under natural conditions. Our results provide evidence for asymmetric reproductive interference, with pollen from polyploid apomicts contributing to reduce the recruitment of sexual diploids in subsequent generations.

That transition represents a crucial period of an individual's life as their inexperience in simultaneously searching for food and avoiding predators' means that the risks of mortality are higher than during other periods of their life. Unfortunately, our understanding of the transition to independence has lagged behind other life history stages due to the logistical challenges associated with tracking individuals after they have left the relatively safe confines of the nest. However, recent technological advances that have enabled individuals to be tracked remotely have dramatically increased our understanding of the process by which offspring acquire independence. First, interspecific studies of birds have demonstrated that the offspring of species that suffer both high levels of nest predation and ectoparasite-induced nestling mortality leave the nest comparatively sooner than the offspring of species that suffer lower levels of nest predation and ectoparasite-induced nestling mortality. Second, intraspecific studies have become much more prevalent in recent years as new technologies have been used to show that between-brood or litter variation in the timing of independence is influenced by predation risk, ectoparasite-induced nestling mortality and parent-offspring conflict over the provision of care. Further studies have shown that within-brood variation in the timing of independence also occurs as a result of both genetic effects such as parentage and offspring sex, and parental effects such as hatching asynchrony, that result in inequalities between siblings. In summary, there is considerable variation in the process by which avian offspring acquire independence at the interspecific and intraspecific levels. However, whilst we have a reasonable understanding of the causes of such variation, our understanding of the consequences of such variation is less developed and deserves further research.","[Mainwaring, Mark C.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England","Mainwaring, MC (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",m.mainwaring@lancaster.ac.uk,,,Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish,,,137,8,9,0,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

For a decade, functional approaches have been applied to investigate the processes that govern weed community assembly. In most previous studies, trait values have been generally averaged over multiple populations and habitats. Consequently, conspecifics display similar trait values while neglecting the considerable influence of intraspecific variability to detect changes in functional diversity in response to environmental drivers. However, this influence has been shown to be critical, especially, at local scales. Here, we studied changes in weed functional diversity at the field scale in four crop sequences. We focused on intra- and interspecific variability of four key functional traits involved in response to resource acquisition processes, the latter being modified by climate, management and competition. The relative influence of intra- and interspecific variability among the crop sequence types was highlighted using a diversity partitioning approach. It provides evidence for substantial amount of intraspecific variability in the weed community and underlines its essential role in response to fine-scale environmental drivers. In addition, we investigated the response of the three most abundant species to competition with the crop, the growing season and the crop sequence type. We highlighted that these species showed a wide range of combinations of trait values, suggesting the co-existence of several successful strategies. Based on these results, we emphasise that neglecting intraspecific variability can lead to substantial underestimations of the functional weed response to management and crop-weed competition at the field scale.","[Borgy, B.; Perronne, R.; Gaba, S.] INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, 17 rue Sully, F-21065 Dijon, France; [Kohler, C.; Grison, A-L; Amiaud, B.] Univ Lorraine, Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestiere, UMR 1137, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Kohler, C.] UCBN, UMR Ecophysiol Vegetale Agron & Nutr NCS 950, Caen, France; [Kohler, C.] INRA, UMR EVA 950, Caen, France; [Amiaud, B.] INRA, Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestiere, UMR 1137, Champenoux, France","Gaba, S (corresponding author), INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, 17 rue Sully, F-21065 Dijon, France.",sabrina.gaba@dijon.inra.fr,"Gaba, Sabrina/H-5240-2018","Gaba, Sabrina/0000-0002-7145-6713; Perronne, Remi/0000-0002-5089-0510",ANR 'STRA-08-02 Advherb'French National Research Agency (ANR); INRA,"Benjamin Borgy and Remi Perronne contributed equally to this work, which was funded by ANR 'STRA-08-02 Advherb' and INRA.

Here, we investigate the relative importance of mean July air temperature, nitrogen (N) availability and direct plant interactions in determining the millennial-scale population dynamics through the Holocene (10700-5200cal.yearsbp) for four temperate tree taxa in the Scottish Highlands. A variety of dynamic population models were fitted to our palaeoecological time-series data to determine the mechanism(s) by which each driver affected the population biomass dynamics of Betula (birch), Pinus (pine), Alnus (alder) and Quercus (oak). Akaike information criterion weights identified the best model(s) for describing the relationship between each population and driver. The relative importance of these drivers was then assessed by the ability of each model to predict the observed population biomass dynamics. We also measured the change in goodness-of-fit of each model over time. We found that models of intra- and interspecific plant interactions described the plant population dynamics better than temperature- or N-dependent population growth models over the 5000-year study period. The best-fitting models were constant over time for pine, alder and oak. However, the plant-N availability and plant-temperature models provided a progressively better fit to the birch data when temperatures rose and N availability declined, suggesting increasing importance of these abiotic factors coincident with changing conditions.Synthesis. Multiple mechanistic models were applied to palaeoecological data to infer the most likely processes driving millennial-scale plant biomass dynamics in a woodland ecosystem. Direct plant interactions provided a better explanation for population biomass dynamics than growing season temperature or N availability over the full study period. The relative importance of all drivers we assessed here varied by species and - in the case of birch - over time in response to warming and reduced N availability.","[Jeffers, Elizabeth S.; Froyd, Cynthia A.; Willis, Katherine J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Biodivers Inst, Long Term Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Bonsall, Michael B.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Math Ecol Res Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Froyd, Cynthia A.] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Brooks, Stephen J.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Willis, Katherine J.] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5007 Bergen, Norway","Jeffers, ES (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Biodivers Inst, Long Term Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",elizabeth.jeffers@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Froyd, Cynthia/A-8488-2012","Froyd, Cynthia/0000-0001-5291-9156; Willis, Katherine/0000-0002-6763-2489; Jeffers, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9679-5909",,,,87,20,20,0,101,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

This has been attributed either to resources, predators, abiotic conditions or disturbances, but whether such factors may simultaneously shape arthropod assemblage structure is little known. We used cockroaches to test for multiple environmental controls on assemblage structure in 25km2 of Amazonian forest. We performed nocturnal, direct searches for cockroaches in 30 plots (250mx2m) during two seasons, and gathered data on biotic and abiotic factors from previous studies. Cockroach abundance increased with dry litter mass, a measure of resource amount, while species richness increased with litter phosphorus content, a measure of resource availability. Cockroach abundance and species richness decreased with ant relative abundance. Cockroach species composition changed along the gradient of: (1) soil clay content, which correlates with a broad differentiation between flood-prone and non-flooded forest; (2) soil relative moisture, consistent with known interspecific variation in desiccation tolerance; and (3) according to the abundance of ants, a potential predator. Turnover in species composition was correlated with abiotic conditionssorting species according to physiological requirements and to disturbance-related life history traitsand to ants' selective pressure. Cockroach abundance, diversity, and composition seem to be controlled by distinct sets of environmental factors, but predators which were represented by ants, emerged as a common factor underlying cockroach distribution. Such patterns of community structure may have been previously overlooked by undue focus on single or a few factors, and may be common to tropical forest arthropods.","[Tarli, Vitor D.; Pequeno, Pedro A.

Determining the generality of this relationship, and discovering the mechanisms that underlie it, are vitally important for ecosystem management. Here, we investigate how species richness affects the temporal stability of biomass production by reanalyzing 27 recent biodiversity experiments conducted with primary producers. We find that, in grasslands, increasing species richness stabilizes whole-community biomass but destabilizes the dynamics of constituent populations. Community biomass is stabilized because species richness impacts mean biomass more strongly than its variance. In algal communities, species richness has a minimal effect on community stability because richness affects the mean and variance of biomass nearly equally. Using a new measure of synchrony among species, we find that for both grasslands and algae, temporal correlations in species biomass are lower when species are grown together in polyculture than when grown alone in monoculture. These results suggest that interspecific interactions tend to stabilize community biomass in diverse communities. Contrary to prevailing theory, we found no evidence that species'' responses to environmental variation in monoculture predicted the strength of diversity''s stabilizing effect. Together, these results deepen our understanding of when and why increasing species richness stabilizes community biomass.","[Gross, Kevin] N Carolina State Univ, Biomath Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fox, Jeremy W.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Gonzalez, Andrew] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Expt Ecol Stn, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Polley, H.

One potential indicator of invasiveness is the phylogenetic distance between a nonnative species and species in the recipient community. However, predicting invasiveness using phylogenetic information relies on an untested assumption: that both biotic resistance and facilitation weaken with increasing phylogenetic distance. We test the validity of this key assumption using a mathematical model in which a novel species is introduced into communities with varying ecological and phylogenetic relationships. Contrary to what is generally assumed, we find that biotic resistance and facilitation can either weaken or intensify with phylogenetic distance, depending on the mode of interspecific interactions (phenotype matching or phenotype differences) and the resulting evolutionary trajectory of the recipient community. Thus, we demonstrate that considering the mechanisms that drive phenotypic divergence between native and nonnative species can provide critical insight into the relationship between phylogenetic distance and invasibility.","[Jones, Emily I.; Gomulkiewicz, Richard] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Jones, Emily I.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Jones, Emily I.] Wissensch Kolleg Berlin, Inst Adv Study, D-14193 Berlin, Germany; [Jones, Emily I.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Nuismer, Scott L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Jones, EI (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",eijones@rice.edu,"Jones, Emily/B-7895-2010","Jones, Emily/0000-0002-0605-884X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-0540524, DMS 0540392, DEB 1118947]",We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments on the manuscript.

Milne-Edwards, 1861), is a relatively recent invader (approx. 10 years) to northeastern New Zealand, and its large size and aggressive nature makes it a potentially formidable competitor with native species. The only endemic, similarly sized, New Zealand paddle crab, Ovalipes catharus (White and Doubleday, 1843), overlaps frequently with C. japonica in both habitat and diet. To understand their probable interactions in the field, we performed a series of experimental behavioral trials in a closed laboratory system to determine whether the crabs interact antagonistically over a shared prey resource (Perna canaliculus (Gmelin, 1791) - green-lipped mussel). In interspecific trials, C. japonica frequently displaced both sexes of O. catharus from the prey, while O. catharus usually failed to acquire prey from feeding C. japonica. In addition, male C. japonica dominated both male and female O. catharus in one-on-one competition for food, regardless of which crab possessed the food initially. Overall, male C. japonica behaved aggressively towards O. catharus and conspecifics of equal size when competing for a prey item; O. catharus showed low levels of aggression throughout all trials and increased time spent evading C. japonica as compared to C. japonica's high levels of aggression.

Understanding why and how grazing pressure changes species diversity is essential for the preservation and restoration of biodiversity in grasslands. We use heavily grazed subalpine meadows in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to test the hypothesis that grazer exclusion alters plant diversity by changing inter- and intraspecific species distributions. Using recently developed spatial analyses combined with detailed ramet mapping of entire plant communities (91 species), we show striking differences between grazed and fenced areas that emerged at scales of just one meter. Species richness was similar at very small scales (0.0625m(2)), but at larger scales diversity in grazed areas fell below 75% of corresponding fenced areas. These differences were explained by differences in spatial distributions; intra- and interspecific associations changed from aggregated at small scales to overdispersed in the fenced plots, but were consistently aggregated in the grazed ones. We conclude that grazing enhanced inter- and intraspecific aggregations and maintained high diversity at small scales, but caused decreased turnover in species at larger scales, resulting in lower species richness. Our study provides strong support to the theoretical prediction that inter- and intraspecific aggregation produces local spatial patterns that scale-up to affect species diversity in a community. It also demonstrates that the impacts of grazing can manifest through this mechanism, lowering diversity by reducing spatial turnover in species. Finally, it highlights the ecological and physiological plant processes that are likely responding to grazing and thereby altering aggregation patterns, providing new insights for monitoring, and mediating the impacts of grazing.","[Zhang, Hui; Wang, Wenbin; Liu, Junjie] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Gilbert, Benjamin] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; [Zhou, Shurong] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","Zhou, SR (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, 220 Handan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhshrong@fudan.edu.cn,"Gilbert, Benjamin/E-6616-2010","Gilbert, Benjamin/0000-0002-4947-6822; Zhou, Shurong/0000-0002-7093-1703",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31170355],This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31170355).,,46,11,14,3,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Genome-wide transcriptome analyses allow detailed insight into plant reactions to environmental cues. A root interaction trial was set up to explore both morphological and whole genome transcriptional responses in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana in the presence or absence of an inferior competitor, Hieracium pilosella. Neighbor perception was indicated by Arabidopsis roots predominantly growing away from the neighbor (segregation), while solitary plants placed more roots toward the middle of the pot. Total biomass remained unaffected. Database comparisons in transcriptome analysis revealed considerable similarity between Arabidopsis root reactions to neighbors and reactions to pathogens. Detailed analyses of the functional category biotic stress using MapMan tools found the sub-category pathogenesis-related proteins highly significantly induced. A comparison to a study on intraspecific competition brought forward a core of genes consistently involved in reactions to neighbor roots. We conclude that beyond resource depletion roots perceive neighboring roots or their associated microorganisms by a relatively uniform mechanism that involves the strong induction of pathogenesis-related proteins. In an ecological context the findings reveal that belowground neighbor detection may occur independently of resource depletion, allowing for a time advantage for the root to prepare for potential interactions.","[Schmid, Christoph; Bauer, Sibylle; Mueller, Benedikt; Bartelheimer, Maik] Univ Regensburg, Fac Biol & Preclin Med, Inst Bot, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Mueller, Benedikt] Univ Regensburg, Fac Biol & Preclin Med, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany","Bartelheimer, M (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Fac Biol & Preclin Med, Inst Bot, Univ Str 31, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",maik.bartelheimer@biologie.uni-regensburg.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) within the funding programme Open Access PublishingGerman Research Foundation (DFG),We gratefully acknowledge the help of Iris Finkemeier (Ludwig-Maximilian-University of Munich) with transcriptome analysis and her helpful comments on the manuscript.

We hypothesised that, for weed biological control, using species that feed as both adults and larvae would be advantageous. Here, we test the impacts of adult and larval feeding of Larinus minutus (Col.: Curculionidae), a successful biological control agent of diffuse knapweed, Centaurea diffusa (Asteraceae), in British Columbia, Canada. 2. At one site, the observations of the present study showed that the intensity of adult weevil feeding did not predict the level of larval attack. Experiments found no evidence for plant-mediated competition between the life-history stages. 3. At two sites and in two years, experimental manipulations of adult and/or larval feeding damage were conducted and plant performance measured. Neither antagonistic nor synergistic interactions occurred, but at each of the two sites a different life-history stage was responsible for reduction in the number of seeds produced by the plants. 4. Although one of the two different feeding modes was redundant at each site, the ability of adults and larvae to reduce plant performance in different areas makes the species effective in a wider range of environments.","[Stephens, Andrea E.

Theory and case studies suggest that indirect effects associated with species interactions may alter these direct responses. How can we tractably predict in which cases indirect effects are likely to be important and appropriately model the interaction of abiotic and biotic drivers? One viable strategy is to characterize partitioning between species along thermal, temporal, and spatial niche axes. The partitioning can be informed by assessing functional traits. Mechanistic models can then be applied to predict how climate change will alter niche partitioning. I illustrate this approach by asking whether competition has altered the responses of Caribbean Anolis lizards to recent warming and find that forested habitat has become more suitable for a warm-adapted, open species, and less suitable for a cool-adapted forest inhabitant. Competition may result in competitive displacement of the cool-adapted species as the warm-adapted species moves into the forest. Species interactions may accentuate abundance and distribution shifts predicted in response to climate change along the elevation gradient.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Buckley, LB (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",buckley@bio.unc.edu,,"Buckley, Lauren/0000-0003-1315-3818",Emerging FrontiersNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1065856] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,,,74,20,20,0,75,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2013,1297,,,,,,126,138,,10.1111/nyas.12175,,,13,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BHB00,WOS:000324840700010,23796014,,,,2021-09-21,

Disentangling the social interactions between strains and species is central to understanding microbes and how they respond to perturbations. However, the study of social evolution in microbes tends to focus on single species. Here, we broaden this perspective and review evolutionary and ecological theory relevant to microbial interactions across all phylogenetic scales. Despite increased complexity, we reduce the theory to a simple null model that we call the genotypic view. This states that cooperation will occur when cells are surrounded by identical genotypes at the loci that drive interactions, with genetic identity coming from recent clonal growth or horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In contrast, because cooperation is only expected to evolve between different genotypes under restrictive ecological conditions, different genotypes will typically compete. Competition between two genotypes includes mutual harm but, importantly, also many interactions that are beneficial to one of the two genotypes, such as predation. The literature offers support for the genotypic view with relatively few examples of cooperation between genotypes. However, the study of microbial interactions is still at an early stage. We outline the logic and methods that help to better evaluate our perspective and move us toward rationally engineering microbial communities to our own advantage.","[Mitri, Sara; Foster, Kevin Richard] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Mitri, Sara; Foster, Kevin Richard] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Integrat Syst Biol, Oxford OX1 3QU, England","Mitri, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",sara.mitri@zoo.ox.ac.uk; kevin.foster@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,"Mitri, Sara/0000-0003-3930-5357; Foster, Kevin/0000-0003-4687-6633",,,,161,133,137,5,132,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0066-4197,1545-2948,978-0-8243-1247-3,ANNU REV GENET,Annu.

We tested some prominent theoretical concepts using observed differences in seasonal habitat use amongst the savanna browser guild (elephant, giraffe, impala, kudu and nyala) in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. Herbivore locations (n = 3108) were recorded over 2 y using repeated road transects and, for elephant, GPS collars (187 254 downloads). Densities were calculated using a novel GIS approach designed to be a cost-effective method for annual censuses, but also able to cope with abrupt changes in visibility. Selectivity for (Manly's a) vegetation types, and overlap (Schoener's index) in vegetation type usage were calculated. Resource depletion in the dry season resulted in all members of the guild increasing selectivity for vegetation types (sum of absolute values away from the neutral value for Manly's alpha for the guild: dry seasons 3.97, 5.16; corresponding wet seasons 3.12, 3.68), but decreasing interspecific overlap (80% of Schoener's indices lower in dry season versus wet season). These effects were more marked over the second, more severe, dry season. We found support for the niche overlap hypothesis and the niche compression hypothesis. The Jarman-Bell principle was generally supported, although unexpectedly during the severe dry season elephant showed the most selectivity for vegetation type. The greater the resource depletion, the more relevant interspecific differences in habitat usage become in relation to the differential impacts of guild members.","[O'Kane, Christopher A.

Using logistic regression, we assessed how habitat variables, prey detection patterns, and presence of intraguild predators affect the occurrence of these felids across 13 protected areas within Thailand. Our analysis is based on data from 1108 camera-trap locations (47,613 trap-nights). Clouded Leopard and Leopard are associated with habitat where Red Muntjac and Eurasian Wild Pig were most likely to be present. Tiger are associated with habitat with a higher likelihood for the presence of Gaur, Eurasian Wild Pig, and Sambar. Clouded Leopard and Tiger were both weakly associated with areas with mature evergreen forest. Besides availability of prey, associations with potential competitors also appear to influence the distribution of these felids, although the strength of these effects requires further investigation. Occurrence rates for Clouded Leopard were no different in protected areas with Leopard versus without Leopards. Leopard had similar occurrence rates regardless of the presence of Tiger, but Leopards were less likely to be detected at the same camera-trap points with the larger felid. Our results suggest that the two most commonly photographed prey species in the study areas serve as key prey species, Eurasian Wild Pig for all three carnivores and Red Muntjac for Leopard and Clouded Leopard.","[Lynam, Antony J.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Global Conservat Program, Bronx, NY 10540 USA; [Ngoprasert, Dusit; Tantipisanuh, Naruemon; Chutipong, Wanlop; Gale, George A.] King Mongkuts Univ Technol, Conservat Ecol Program, Bangkok 10140, Thailand; [Sukmasuang, Ronglarp] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Biol, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; [Steinmetz, Robert; Cutter, Peter] World Wide Fund Nat Thailand, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; [Jenks, Kate E.] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Grassman, Lon I., Jr.] Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Feline Res Ctr, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Kitamura, Shumpei] Museum Nat & Human Activ, Sanda, Hyogo 6691546, Japan; [Howard, JoGayle; Leimgruber, Peter; Songsasen, Nucharin] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Ctr Species Survival, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA; [Cutter, Passanan] Univ Minnesota, Conservat Biol Program, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reed, David H.] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA","Lynam, AJ (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, Global Conservat Program, 2300 So Blvd, Bronx, NY 10540 USA.",tlynam@wcs.org,"Lynam, Antony/H-3036-2015; sukmasuang, ronglarp/AAD-3624-2020; Leimgruber, Peter/O-1304-2015; KITAMURA, Shumpei/I-9923-2019; Sukmasuang, Ronglarp/AAZ-6975-2020","Lynam, Antony/0000-0002-8395-7902; Leimgruber, Peter/0000-0002-3682-0153; KITAMURA, Shumpei/0000-0001-6253-2545; Tantipisanuh, Naruemon/0000-0001-6245-7725; sukmasuang, ronglarp/0000-0003-4787-8526","Clouded Leopard Project; TRF/BIOTEC Special Program for Biodiversity Research and Training ThailandThailand Research Fund (TRF); Kasetsart University; Smithsonian Conservation Biology InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; Mahidol University Government Research Grant; National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology; Hornbill Research Foundation; JSPS Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Wildlife Conservation Society Thailand; World Wide Fund for Nature-Thailand; WildAid Thailand; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [22770029] Funding Source: KAKEN","This study is dedicated to the memory of JoGayle Howard and David Reed.

The industry expanded into export markets after 1940 by providing an alternative use for land and expertise abandoned by declining sugar plantations, adopting a cultivar capable of tolerating long-distance shipping, developing postharvest technology to overcome fruit fly quarantine restrictions, capitalizing on a growing tourism industry for marketing and air freight logistics, and forming an organization to support industry growth.

La Crosse virus (LACV) is historically transmitted by the native mosquito Aedes triseriatus (Say) in the upper Midwestern US, but the invasive congeners Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and A. japonicus (Theobald), which co-occur with A. triseriatus in water-holding containers, may be important accessory vectors in the Appalachian region where La Crosse encephalitis is an emerging disease. This review focuses on evidence for how climate, land use, and biological invasions may have direct abiotic and indirect community-level impacts on immature developmental stages (eggs and larvae) of Aedes mosquitoes. Because vector-borne diseases usually vary in space and time and are related to the ecology of the vector species, we propose that the ecology of its mosquito vectors, particularly at their immature stages, has played an important role in the emergence of La Crosse encephalitis in the Appalachian region and represents a model for investigating the effects of environmental changes on other vector-borne diseases. We summarize the health effects of LACV and associated socioeconomic costs that make it the most important native mosquito-borne disease in the US. We review of the transmission of LACV, and present evidence for the impacts of climate, land use, and biological invasions on Aedes mosquito communities.

Genetic evidence suggests that the Atlantic Canadian populations originated from two separate introductions with differences in time of establishment among regions and possible population-level behavioural differences. In this study, we examine intraspecific foraging behaviour among crabs from different populations, and interspecific foraging behaviour between genetically similar crabs and juvenile lobsters. Both sets of foraging experiments involved competition for a limited food source over a 1-h period. In intraspecific match-ups, recent invaders from Newfoundland (NL) were significantly superior foragers than long-established invaders from Nova Scotia (NS) and New Brunswick (NB) populations; however, we found no differences between NL and Prince Edward Island (PE) invaders. Crabs from PE were better competitors than those from NS and NB, but these differences were not significant. Interspecific competition experiments indicated that the feeding behaviour of recent invaders (NL) and genetically similar, but long-established invaders (NS), differed in the presence of juvenile lobsters. Our study documents striking behavioural differences among populations of green crab from a small geographic region, which may reflect a combination of both genetic differences and time since establishment. These differences may result in varying impacts on newly invaded habitats.","[Rossong, Melanie A.; Snelgrove, Paul V.

This phyloecological study integrates data on fungiid distribution patterns along environmental gradients on the Spermonde Shelf, SW Sulawesi, with a recently published phylogeny reconstruction of the Fungiidae. A mushroom coral fauna of 34 species was used to compare their distributions by use of 50-m(2) belt quadrats in transects (1) from the mainland to the shelf edge, (2) around reefs with regard to predominant wind directions, and (3) over bathymetrical reef zones. Species association ordinations were made for each of the four shelf zones using both abundance and incidence data to examine whether closely related species co-occurred. Some closely related species or even sister species appeared to show very similar distribution patterns and to coexist in high abundances. These results indicate that there may not be community saturation and competitive exclusion among mushroom corals species, most of which are free-living. In reconstructions of fungiid habitat evolution, offshore reef slopes appear to be original (ancestral), whereas onshore habitats, shallow reef flats, and deep sandy reef bases seem to be derived. The latter is in contrast with an earlier hypothesis, in which deep sandy substrates were considered ancestral mushroom coral habitats.","Nat Biodivers Ctr, Dept Marine Zool, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Hoeksema, BW (corresponding author), Nat Biodivers Ctr, Dept Marine Zool, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",bert.hoeksema@naturalis.nl,"Hoeksema, Bert W/B-2973-2010; Hoeksema, Bert W./U-8530-2019","Hoeksema, Bert W/0000-0001-8259-3783; Hoeksema, Bert W./0000-0001-8259-3783",Netherlands Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO) [W77-96]; Research Centre for Oceanography (PPO-LIPI) at Jakarta; Hasanuddin University at Makassar,"The research was financed by the Netherlands Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO, grant W77-96) as part of a PhD project, for which the fieldwork (as part of the Buginesia Programme) was supervised by Dr. M.R.R.B.

In that environmental context, it is ecologically correct to assume that members of a species will be distributed in direct relation to the suitability of the habitat, that is, according to the so-called habitat matching rule. This paper examines whether it is possible to maintain the assumption of the habitat matching rule in the following circumstances: (1) when habitats are connected and organisms can move between them, (2) when there are disturbances and seasonal cycles that generate instability, and (3) when there is interspecific and intra-specific competition. Here I argue that it is possible as long as the following aspects are taken into account. In open habitats at equilibrium, in which habitat selection and competition operate, the habitat matching rule can be applied in some conditions, while competition tends to homogenize the species distribution in other environmental contexts. In the latter case, two methods can be used to incorporate these effects into SDMs: new parameters can be incorporated into the response functions, or the occurrence of proportions of categories of individuals (adult/young, male/female, or dominant/subordinate species in guilds) can be used instead of the occurrence of organisms. The habitat matching rule is not fulfilled in non-equilibrium environments. The solution to this problem lies in the design of SDMs with two strategies that depend on scale. Locally, the disequilibrium can be encapsulated using average environmental conditions, with sufficiently large cells (in the case of metapopulations) and/or long enough sampling periods (in the case of seasonal cycles). At coarse scales, the use of presence-only models can in some cases avoid the destabilizing effect of catastrophic historical processes. The matching law is a strong assumption of SDMs because it is based on population ecology theory and the principle of evolution by natural selection.","[Cassini, Marcelo H.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Lab Biol Comportamiento IBYME, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Cassini, Marcelo H.] Univ Nacl Lujan, GEMA, DCB, RA-6700 Lujan, Argentina","Cassini, MH (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Lab Biol Comportamiento IBYME, Obligado 2490, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mcassini@mail.unlu.edu.ar,,,CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [11420090100367]; University of Lujan,This work was supported by grants from CONICET (PIP No. 11420090100367) and the University of Lujan (Fondos Finalidad 3.5).,,74,26,27,2,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

In parallel, there is growing evidence of the importance of cooperative phenotypes for the growth and behavior of microbial groups. Here we ask: How does the presence of multiple species affect the evolution of cooperative secretions? We use a computer simulation of spatially structured cellular groups that captures key features of their biology and physical environment. When nutrient competition is strong, we find that the addition of new species can inhibit cooperation by eradicating secreting strains before they can become established. When nutrients are abundant and many species mix in one environment, however, our model predicts that secretor strains of any one species will be surrounded by other species. This social insulation protects secretors from competition with nonsecretors of the same species and can improve the prospects of within-species cooperation. We also observe constraints on the evolution of mutualistic interactions among species, because it is difficult to find conditions that simultaneously favor both within- and among-species cooperation. Although relatively simple, our model reveals the richness of interactions between the ecology and social evolution of multispecies microbial groups, which can be critical for the evolution of cooperation.","[Mitri, Sara; Foster, Kevin R.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Mitri, Sara; Foster, Kevin R.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Integrat Syst Biol, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Xavier, Joao B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Computat Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Mitri, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",sara.mitri@zoo.ox.ac.uk; kevin.foster@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Xavier, Joao B/H-5471-2011","Foster, Kevin/0000-0003-4687-6633; Xavier, Joao/0000-0003-3592-1689; Mitri, Sara/0000-0003-3930-5357","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission; Lucille Castori Center for Microbes, Inflammation, and Cancer; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [242670]","We thank Angus Buckling, Dan Cronforth, Laurent Keller, Wook Kim, Jan-Ulrich Kreft, Daniel Marbach, Carey Nadell, Nuno Oliveira, Jonas Schluter, and two anonymous reviewers for useful discussions and comments on the manuscript.

In the Great Lakes, the exotic round goby (Apollonia melanostoma) is very abundant in littoral areas used by the native yellow perch (Perca flavencens). We examined yellow perch-round goby interactions using multiple approaches. Field surveys analyzing dietary overlap among three size classes of yellow perch and round goby detected significant overlap only between juvenile perch (< 95 mm TL) and gobies (< 60 mm TL). laboratory experiments using juvenile stages tested for habitat preference differences (open sand, macrophytes and dreissenids) in solitary, intraspecific (2 perch) and interspecific (1 perch, 1 goby) treatments. In macrophyte and dreissenid habitats, we tested for treatment differences in fish behavior (intraspecific vs. interspecific) and yellow perch growth (solitary, intraspecific and interspecific). Round goby consistently preferred complex habitats. Yellow perch showed diurnal preference of complex habitats, but increased nocturnal use of sand in the solitary and interspecific treatments. Activity was greater in dreissenid than macrophyte habitat, but prey attacks showed the opposite trend. Activity and prey attacks were greater in the intraspecific than interspecific treatments. The trend was due to lower prey attacks executed by round goby. In macrophytes, individual yellow perch growth was lower in the intraspecific than in the solitary and interspecific treatments. In dreissenids, intraspecific and interspecific competitors equally decreased yellow perch growth. Our results suggest differences in diet, habitat preference and behavior between juvenile round goby and yellow perch may allow their coexistence in nearshore areas.

Corophium volutator (Pallas), a burrowing amphipod abundant in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, frequently interacts with the eastern mudsnail, Ilyanassa obsoleta (Say), as both species utilize similar habitats and food resources. Typically these interactions result in negative effects on C. volutator. There is evidence that Corophium species exhibit avoidance behaviour when interacting with other species, but whether such a response occurs in the presence of I. obsoleta is unknown. To investigate C. volutator response to I. obsoleta. total C. volutator abundance and vertical distribution within the sediment was examined in a field experiment involving I. obsoleta enclosures and exclosures at two mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy. I. obsoleta densities were manipulated between June and August 2008 and their effects on C. volutator abundance and vertical distribution observed. Results varied between mudflats and C volutator size classes. At Peck's Cove, total C volutator abundance was largely unaffected by I. obsoleta. No size class exhibited a distribution shift in response to I. obsoleta, though both mid-sized individuals and adults occupied deeper layers of sediment late in the summer. Abundance of C. volutator in all size classes at Grande Anse was reduced in July in direct proportion to exposure to I. obsoleta, and adults occupied higher sediment layers in July when L obsoleta were excluded, suggesting that I. obsoleta curtailed use of these upper layers. juvenile abundance rebounded in August, possibly due to the mass dispersal of a newly produced juvenile cohort. Adults were reduced in all treatments in August, probably as a result of normal seasonal mortality. Differences in C. volutator responses between mudflats highlight the site-specific nature of such interactions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

During this time, Arctic Skuas Stercorarius parasiticus experienced a rapid decline in the UK and the species has subsequently been placed on the Red List of birds of conservation concern. Although shortage of Lesser Sandeels is likely to be an influential factor, the Arctic Skua's breeding range overlaps with that of the Great Skua Stercorarius skua, a larger bird with a more varied diet, and interspecific interactions for nesting habitat may exert an additional pressure on Arctic Skua breeding populations. Results from four censuses, spanning 21 years, were used to model habitat use and analyse distributional change in nesting Arctic Skuas at a major colony located on Fetlar, Shetland, Scotland. The decline in Arctic Skuas was not uniform across the island and competition with Great Skuas for nest-sites appears to have influenced localized breeding distribution. By 2006, Arctic Skuas had been almost entirely excluded from shrub heath, blanket bog and coastal heath habitats, which were identified as preferred habitat in 1986. In 2006, Arctic Skua breeding territories were mainly restricted to one core area of preferred habitat where over 90% nested in high density as this habitat became increasingly occupied by Great Skuas. The more generalist foraging habit of the Great Skua allowed the population to grow rapidly as numbers of the more specialist Arctic Skua decreased during times of low sandeel availability. Our model suggests that both interspecific competition for territories with Great Skuas and food limitation have played important roles in the decline of Arctic Skuas on Fetlar.","[Dawson, Neil M.; Macleod, Colin D.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Smith, Malcolm] RSPB Scotland, Fetlar ZE2 9DJ, Shetland, Scotland; [Ratcliffe, Norman] RSPB Scotland, Aberdeen AB10 1YP, Scotland","Dawson, NM (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Zoology Bldg,Tillydrone Ave, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.",neilm_dawson@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,35,8,8,0,27,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0019-1019,,,IBIS,Ibis,JAN,2011,153,1,,,,,143,153,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2010.01065.x,,,11,Ornithology,Zoology,690MH,WOS:000285008400015,,,,,2021-09-21,

This study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP. Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk assessment.","[Langer-Jaesrich, Miriam; Kienle, Cornelia; Koehler, Heinz-R.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Anim Physiol Ecol, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany; [Gerhardt, Almut] LimCo Int, D-49477 Ibbenburen, Germany","Langer-Jaesrich, M (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Anim Physiol Ecol, Konrad Adenauer Str 20, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany.",langermiriam@gmx.de; cornelia.kienle@gmx.de; Heinz-R.Koehler@uni-tuebingen.de; Almutg@web.de,"Kienle, Cornelia/ABG-5199-2020; Kohler, Heinz-R./AAL-1350-2021","Kienle, Cornelia/0000-0002-7695-6549; ",,,,53,15,16,0,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,OCT,2010,19,7,,,,,1294,1301,,10.1007/s10646-010-0516-x,,,8,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,666HN,WOS:000283105500014,20628814,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-21,

We have identified 5446 lncRNA genes in the human genome from; 24,000 full-length cDNAs, using our new ORF-prediction pipeline. We combined them nonredundantly with lncRNAs from four published sources to derive 6736 lncRNA genes. In an effort to distinguish standalone and antisense lncRNA genes from database artifacts, we stratified our catalog of lncRNAs according to the distance between each lncRNA gene candidate and its nearest known protein-coding gene. We concurrently examined the protein-coding capacity of known genes overlapping with lncRNAs. Remarkably, 62% of known genes with hypothetical protein names actually lacked protein-coding capacity. This study has greatly expanded the known human lncRNA catalog, increased its accuracy through manual annotation of cDNA-to-genome alignments, and revealed that a large set of hypothetical protein genes in GenBank lacks protein-coding capacity.

The spermatophore comprises a large spermatophylax and a sperm-containing ampulla which is consumed by the female while the ejaculate transfers into her. Spermatophores are costly to produce and investment trade-offs are expected to occur between the ejaculate, sperm and spermatophylax. While models of ejaculate allocation predict strategic allocation between current and potential reproductive rates, no comparative studies to date have analysed interspecific spermatophore component variation between bush-cricket species over the entire mating season. Here we compare field data from two bush-cricket species (Poecilimon) that differ in spermatophore investment. While Poecilimon thessalicus invests heavily in spermatophore production and was variable in body mass and spermatophylax size over the season, they consistently produced similar-sized ampullae and transferred constant numbers of sperm. In contrast, the ampulla size of the less investing species, P. veluchianus minor, varied considerably over the season, yet the body, spermatophylax mass and sperm number remained constant. Differences between the two species reflect within-species adjustments that male bush-crickets make to specific spermatophore components as conditional strategies in order to maximize reproductive output.","[McCartney, Jay; Lehmann, Arne W.; Lehmann, Gerlind U.

Most research has of necessity been field based and has involved the search for patterns in Population and community dynamics that are repeatable in space and time. Mathematical models predict that under certain conditions host and parasite populations can attain equilibrial levels through operation of regulatory factors. Such factors have been identified in several host-parasite systems and some parasite populations have been shown to persist over long time-periods. However, there is no convincing evidence that fish parasite populations are stable and regulated since in all cases alternative explanations are equally acceptable and it appears that they are non-equilibrial systems. It has proved particularly difficult to detect replicable patterns in parasite communities. Inter-specific competition, evidenced by functional and numerical responses, has been detected in several communities but its occurrence is erratic and its significance unclear. Some studies have failed to find any nested patterns in parasite community structure and richness, whereas others have identified Such patterns although they are seldom constant over space and time. Departures from randomness appear to be the exception and then only temporary. It appears that parasite communities are non-equilibrial, stochastic assemblages rather than structured and organized.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Hatherly Labs, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England","Kennedy, CR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Hatherly Labs, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",C.R.Kennedy@exeter.ac.uk,,,,,,88,29,30,1,41,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,OCT,2009,136,12,,,SI,,1653,1662,,10.1017/S0031182009005794,,,10,Parasitology,Parasitology,499HC,WOS:000270207900026,19366479,,,,2021-09-21,

Animals exploiting different resources may nevertheless interact if one species indirectly alters the abundance and distribution of the food of the other. To analyse this indirect effect, we conducted experiments in artificial pools and in the field to investigate the influence of the algivorous fish Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis (known as the ayu) on two species of insectivorous benthic fish, Pseudogobio esocinus esocinus and the goby Gymnogobius petschiliensis. 2. In the pool experiments, algal biomass was not correlated with the number of ayu, but the percentage of blue-green bacteria rose as the number increased. The number of aquatic macroinvertebrates on the upper surface of ceramic tiles placed in the pool bed decreased as the number of ayu increased. 3. Although ayu and the benthic species did not interact directly, the reduction in invertebrate abundance on the upper surface of tiles in the pool reduced the growth rate of the benthic insectivores. 4. In field experiments, the introduction of ayu into habitats with P. esocinus esocinus or G. petschiliensis reduced the growth rate of these benthic fish. In the field experiment that was carried out over 5 years in the G. petschiliensis habitat, the population density of the goby decreased when ayu were stocked. 5. The ayu is a strong interactor or bioengineer in streams, affecting not only benthic algae but also aquatic invertebrates and fishes. We conclude that to predict the outcome of interspecific interactions amongst fishes in streams with high algal production, possible indirect effects must be considered alongside better known direct effects.","[Katano, Osamu; Nakamura, Tomoyuki; Abe, Shin-Ichiro] Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Ueda, Nagano 3860031, Japan","Katano, O (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Ueda, Nagano 3860031, Japan.",katano@fra.affrc.go.jp,,,,,,49,4,4,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

These studies have found that increasing enemy diversity can strengthen, weaken, and not affect prey suppression, demonstrating that multi-enemy effects on prey are context-dependent. Here we ask how one factor, plant species identity, influences multi-enemy effects on prey. We focused on two plant species of agricultural importance, potato (Solanum tuberosum), and collards (Brassica oleracea L.). These species share a common herbivorous pest, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), but vary in structural and chemical traits that affect aphid reproductive rates and which may also influence inter-enemy interactions. In a large-scale field experiment, overall prey exploitation varied dramatically among the plant species, with enemies reducing aphid populations by similar to 94% on potatoes and similar to 62% on collards. Increasing enemy diversity similarly strengthened aphid suppression on both plants, however, and there was no evidence that plant species identity significantly altered the relationship between enemy diversity and prey suppression. Microcosm experiments suggested that, on both collards and potatoes, intraspecific competition among natural enemies exceeded interspecific competition. Enemy species showed consistent and significant differences in where they foraged on the plants, and enemies in the low-diversity treatment tended to spend less time foraging than enemies in the high-diversity treatment. These data suggest that increasing enemy diversity may strengthen aphid suppression because interspecific differences in where enemies forage on the plant allow for greater resource partitioning. Further, these functional benefits of diversity appear to be robust to changes in plant species identity.","[Straub, Cory S.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99163 USA","Straub, CS (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",straub@entomology.wisc.edu,,"Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102",,,,49,80,82,2,94,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2008,89,6,,,,,1605,1615,,10.1890/07-0657.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,310OZ,WOS:000256540300014,18589525,,,,2021-09-21,

However, many pathogens exhibit cyclic abundance patterns (e. g., seasonality), and temporal asynchrony between interacting pathogens could reduce the impact of those interactions. Here we use an extension of our previously published model to investigate the effects of cycles on pathogen interaction. We demonstrate that host immune memory can maintain the impact of an interaction, even when the effector pathogen abundance is low or the pathogen is absent. Paradoxically, immune memory can result in pathogens interacting more strongly when temporally out of phase. We find that interactions between species can result in changes to the temporal pattern of the affected species. We further demonstrate that this may be observed in a natural host-pathogen system. Given the continuing debate regarding the relevance of pathogen interactions in natural systems and increasing concern about treatment strategies for coinfections, both the discovery of a shift in cycle in empirical data and the mechanism by which we identified it are important. Finally, because the model structure used here is analogous to models of a simple predator-prey system, we also consider the consequences of these findings in the context of that system.","[Lello, Joanne] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, Wales; [Norman, Rachel A.] Univ Stirling, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Boag, Brian] Birch Brae, Perth, WA PH14 9SW, Australia; [Hudson, Peter J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fenton, Andrew] Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England; [Boag, Brian] Birch Brae, Kinross PH14 9SW, Scotland","Lello, J (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, Wales.",lelloj@cardiff.ac.uk; ran@cs.stir.ac.uk; bboag@scri.ac.uk; pjh18@psu.edu; a.fenton@liv.ac.uk,"Hudson, Peter/AAB-8080-2020; Fenton, Andy/B-5972-2009; Norman, Rachel A/A-2930-2009; Lello, Joanne/AAG-7838-2021; Norman, R/AAI-8164-2021; Lello, Joanne/A-5261-2010","Hudson, Peter/0000-0003-0468-3403; Fenton, Andy/0000-0002-7676-917X; Norman, Rachel A/0000-0002-7398-6064; Norman, R/0000-0002-7398-6064; Lello, Joanne/0000-0002-2640-1027",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/B500482/2] Funding Source: researchfish,,,22,20,21,0,36,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

The relative importance of direct and indirect effects is not at all well known. We used an experimental approach to quantifying direct and indirect effects of fungicide on the composition of a plant community. To separate the direct and indirect impacts of fungicide we grew plant species in monoculture and mixed communities, and with and without the systemic fungicide benomyl. We predicted that direct effects of fungicide would be important at low but not high nutrient availability, while indirect effects would be more important at high nutrient availability. After 3 years there was little impact of fungicide on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization, and on soil microbial community composition assessed as the relative abundance of different phospholipid fatty acids. Like fertilizer, fungicide increased plant biomass. However, in contrast to fertilizer, this did not result in a decline in species evenness. Although not significant, the direct effects of fungicide tended to oppose the indirect effects of both fungicide and interspecific interactions on plant community composition. Experiments relying on fungicide treatments must be interpreted extremely cautiously, because the impact of fungicide is potentially the integrated response of plants to multiple factors, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, pathogenic and saprophytic fungi, and nutrient inputs.","Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Allison, VJ (corresponding author), Landcare Res, POB 40, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",allisonv@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Zak, Donald R/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337; Rajaniemi, Tara/0000-0003-2861-3901",,,,46,18,20,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAY,2007,190,1,,,,,53,69,,10.1007/s11258-006-9190-8,,,17,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,152LJ,WOS:000245363200005,,,,,2021-09-21,

Conceptual models of the effects of wind disturbance have traditionally focused on the impacts of catastrophic disturbances and have painted a simple picture of how disturbance acts to maintain tree species diversity. These models ignore variation among species characteristics that could have important consequences for both resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 2 We integrated an empirically parameterized, mechanistic model of windstorm mortality (WINDSTORM) and a seed-mass-based dispersal and recruitment model into a spatially explicit, individual tree model of forest dynamics (SORTIE) in order to create simulated long-term 'experiments' designed to explore the sensitivity of forest composition and structure to species-specific resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 3 We found that species-specific variation in resistance to wind mortality interacted strongly with: (i) shade tolerance characteristics, (ii) the medium-term history of disturbances, (iii) the long-term average severity of the disturbance regime and (iv) seedbed substrate dynamics to influence tree population dynamics and successional trajectories. 4 We also examined how local and long-distance dispersal affect response to wind disturbance. Ignoring differences among local dispersal characteristics overestimates the importance of dispersal-limited species. Our results show that long-distance immigration maintains species coexistence only if the immigration rate is very high relative to local dispersal. Despite this, stand-scale models that ignore long-distance dispersal can underestimate population dynamics of dispersal-limited species. 5 Our results indicate that landscape-scale heterogeneity in structure and species composition in these forests is facilitated by synergisms between the stochastic nature of wind disturbance and complex interactions between species traits that govern: (i) resistance to disturbance, (ii) local dispersal and seedling establishment and (iii) competitive (i.e. growth/survival) traits that do not adhere to strict tradeoffs. 6 We conclude that wind disturbance has much more complex and variable effects on long-term dynamics of forest structure and composition than suggested by previous models. In particular, non-catastrophic disturbances can generate important variation in forest dynamics that can either lead to dominance by a single or small number of species, or facilitate species coexistence.","Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Papaik, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, CP 8888 Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",papaikm@ecostudies.org,"Canham, Charles D/F-6161-2011","Canham, Charles D/0000-0001-8361-9148",,,,56,62,67,2,74,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

We examined mechanisms of coexistence between two congeneric species of frugivorous primates, the blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis) and the red-tailed monkey (C. ascanius). 2. We used giving-up densities (the amount of food which animals leave in a patch) in fruit trees to measure foraging efficiency and to evaluate possible mechanisms of coexistence. Animals with higher giving-up densities are less likely to persist in the company of those with lower giving-up densities because the former are not able to exploit food patches used previously by the latter. We climbed trees to estimate giving-up densities by counting the fruit which primates left behind. 3. We tested five possible mechanisms of coexistence. Three mechanisms proposed that each frugivorous species has a lower giving-up density than the other in at least one of the following: (1) different tree species, (2) within-tree foraging zones or (3) seasons. The fourth mechanism predicted that the socially dominant species exploits resources first and that the subordinate species has lower giving-up densities. The final mechanism predicted that one species would find resources more quickly than the other, which would in turn have a lower giving-up density. 4.

The neutral theory of biodiversity provides a simple yet elegant explanation of species diversity patterns. By specifying speciation rates, dispersal and community size, and assuming that all individuals in a community are ecologically identical, the theory generates species abundance distributions that are remarkably similar to those observed in nature. 2. Here we show that incorporation of the Allee effect in a neutral community results in considerable decrease in species richness and radically different dominance-diversity curves, with an excess of both very abundant and very rare species but a shortage of intermediate species, than predicted by the current neutral model. 3. We also find that even a small Allee effect can cause a considerable decline in the time of species coexistence. However, dispersal limitation within a community indeed enhances coexistence as presumed by Hubbell's theory, but its effect is limited and is probably insufficient to negate the ubiquitous small-population disadvantages caused by the Allee effect and other agents alike. 4. The remarkably good fit between the predictions of neutral theory and certain observations implies that either the Allee effect is not important, which seems unlikely, or that other stabilizing mechanisms (i.e. rare species advantages, perhaps resulting from interspecific niche differentiation) oppose the Allee effect.","Beijing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; Lanzhou Univ, Lab Arid Agroecol, Sch Life Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","Zhang, DY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhangdy@bnu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Da-Yong/B-3078-2011","Zhang, Da-Yong/0000-0003-1056-8735; Zhou, Shurong/0000-0002-7093-1703",,,,35,15,19,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

It has been predicted that net positive interactions are likely to occur in environments characterized by high abiotic stress. Although empirical field studies have started to support these predictions, little theoretical work has been carried out on the dynamic nature of these effects and their consequences for community structure. We use a simple patch-occupancy model to simulate the dynamics of a pair of species living on an environmental gradient. Each of the species can exist as either a mutualist or a cheater. The results confirm the prediction: a band of mutualists tends to occur in environmental conditions beyond the limits of the cheaters. The region between mutualists and cheaters is interesting: population density here is low. Mutualists periodically occupy this area, but are displaced by cheaters, who themselves go extinct in the absence of the mutualists. Furthermore, the existence of mutualists extends the area occupied by the cheaters, essentially increasing their realized niche. Our approach has considerable potential for improving our understanding of the balance between positive and negative interspecific interactions and for predicting the probable impacts of habitat loss and, climate change on communities dominated by positive interspecific interactions.","NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4PW, Kincardine, Scotland; York Univ, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Travis, JMJ (corresponding author), NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4PW, Kincardine, Scotland.",jmjt@ceh.ac.uk,"Brooker, Rob W/F-9569-2012; Travis, Justin/B-8571-2014","Brooker, Rob W/0000-0002-7014-0071; Travis, Justin/0000-0002-5785-4272",,,,19,88,94,0,60,ROYAL SOCIETY,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,,,BIOL LETT-UK,Biol.

At both sites, a wide range of productivity levels was available resulting from different long-term fertilisation. In order to identify underlying mechanisms of the species richness-productivity relationship we included the seasonal dynamics and the number of individuals of each species in our analysis. We sampled 10 and 21 plots, respectively, at the two sites in May, June and July by harvesting all aboveground parts of vascular plants in 0.25 m(2) subplots. Species richness, number of individuals of each species and community biomass as a surrogate of productivity were recorded in each sample. At one site, the relationship between species richness and biomass was significantly positive in the May and June harvest. This relationship disappeared in the July harvest due to a reduction in species richness at high productivity levels. The relations between species richness and number of individuals and between number of individuals and biomass paralleled the species richness-productivity relation but the individual number-biomass relationship remained positive until the last harvest. Between-species differences in individual number-community biomass relationships and their seasonal dynamics revealed interspecific competitive exclusion even though the species richness-biomass relationships were not negative or hump-shaped. At the second site, species richness was not related to productivity or to number of individuals. Our study demonstrated the importance of temporal dynamics and regional processes in understanding species richness-productivity patterns. (c) 2005 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

The WH is most likely to be found in scrub, whereas the BC is more of a woodland species. However, how much do these two species, which are supposed to be so different, have in common when they encounter in a transitional landscape (ecotone), which offers suitable vegetation structures for both species on a small scale? The study area is characterised by a habitat mosaic of orchards, small woods, hedgerows and shrub in different successional stages. This study quantifies how much ecotone-like biotopes allow interspecific approaches with respect to both the choice of vegetation structures and the vicinity of the territories. Over three breeding periods the vegetation structures of 162 territories of the BC and 93 territories of the WH were subjected to a discriminant analysis. Wrong classifications of species membership by the discriminant models reflect interspecific similarities of the selected vegetation structures. If the complete study period is analysed, the species membership of 26.3 % of territories is classified incorrectly by a discriminant analysis of their structural features. The single year analysis resulted in proportions of misclassified territories between 22.8 % and 35.4 %. The Garden Warbler (S. borin ) was additionally investigated because of its habitat preferences for woodland edge and tall scrub, which lie intermediately between the preferences of the BC and the WH. This interspecific constellation of habitat preferences was quantitatively confirmed by the model. This is a strong argument in favour of the conclusion that the postulated partial similarities between the BC and the WH are real and not merely the result of low discriminating qualities of the model owing to inadequate structural variables. Furthermore the validity of the model is supported by a considerable interspecific spatial overlap of the territories. To summarise the complete study period, 23 % of the area that is selected at least in one year by either the BC or the WH is used commonly by both species. Thus interspecific structural similarities in habitat choice also result in propinquity of territories. In contrast, 46 % of the area is used exclusively by the BC and 31 % by the WH. These parts of the ecotone are considered strictly BC-habitat and WH-habitat. Probably the interspecific encounter happens predominantly in vegetation structures that are sub-optimal for one of the two species. Clear boundaries and sudden transitions between different, homogeneous biotopes are characteristic of vast parts of our man-made landscape, which results in a polarisation of the avifauna (i. e. wood species/shrub species). The lack of ecotones impedes interspecific encounters of bird species from different biotopes in the landscape and increases the observers' impression of interspecific habitat segregation. Negative population trends of the WH in recent decades and concurrent positive trends of the BC may have reinforced the pressure of the BC to occupy suboptimal habitats which coincide with WH-habitats. Possibly this increased the probability of syntopic occurrences.","Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany","Elle, O (corresponding author), Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",,,,,,,38,6,6,0,9,BLACKWELL VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-8375,,,J ORNITHOL,J.

A primary prediction of this hypothesis is that the strength of competition for pollination, mediated by variation in plant abundance, should directly influence the strength of selection on floral traits. To test this prediction., I examined the relationships between multiple components of plant abundance and pollination, reproductive success. and phenotypic selection via female fitness on four floral traits in artificial and natural populations of the hummingbird-pollinated Ipomoposis aggregata. In the artificial arrays, I manipulated the absolute density and interspersion of neighboring I. aggregata and a competitor for pollination (Castilleja linariaefolia). I also measured natural variation in the absolute and relative density of these two species within a 2.5-m radius of focal L aggregata plants in three natural populations. The strength of competition for pollination in the L aggregata-C. linariaefolia system was only weakly influenced by local plant abundance. Both the absolute density and interspersion of plants in the arrays significantly influenced at least one component of L aggregata's pollination and reproductive Success. but the effects were not consistent across these components. For example, the treatment groups that received more conspecific pollen were not the same ones that set more seeds/fruit. Within the natural populations. variation in relative and absolute plant density influenced two components of I. aggregata's pollination and reproductive success, but only in one to two populations per component. As would be expected from these inconsistent effects of plant abundance on pollination and reproduction, the strength of selection on floral traits of L aggregata in both the arrays and natural populations was also only weakly dependent on abundance. Previous studies have indicated (1) that self-incompatible species such as I. aggregata should experience strong, abundance-dependent effects on pollination, and (2) that variation in plant abundance at a local scale should have a stronger effect on pollination than variation at a larger spatial scale. In contrast, my results suggest that the effect of plant abundance on pollination cannot be easily predicted from simple diagnostic traits such as breeding system or spatial scale.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Caruso, CM (corresponding author), Grinnell Coll, Dept Biol, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.",,,"Caruso, Christina/0000-0001-7069-9572",,,,64,31,31,1,25,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2002,83,1,,,,,241,254,,10.2307/2680135,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,508YQ,WOS:000173117700021,,,,,2021-09-21,

There have been two different approaches to the study of species interactions in helminths. The first one consists of treasuring the responses of helminth species in concomitant infections, preferably in laboratory experiments. Ang change in numbers of parasite individuals or in their use of niche space, compared with what is observed in single infections, provides solid evidence that the species are interacting. The second approach can only provide indirect, circumstantial evidence. It consists in contrasting observed patterns either in the distribution of species richness of infracommunities from wild hosts, in their species composition, or in pairwise associations between helminth species among infracommunities, with the random patterns predicted by appropriate null models. In many cases, observed patterns do not depart from predicted ones; when they do, alternative explanations are usually as plausible as invoking the effect of interactions among helminth species. The present evidence suggests that the role of species interactions in helminth community structure is often negligible, but that it must always be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Poulin, R (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",robert.poulin@stonebow.otago.ac.nz,"Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008","Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206",,,,64,157,165,2,53,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,,2001,122,,,S,,,S3,S11,,10.1017/S0031182000016991,,,9,Parasitology,Parasitology,451TX,WOS:000169818300002,11442194,,,,2021-09-21,

Such uncertainty hampers prudent decision making about where and when to invest most intensively in species conservation programmes. Demystifying ecosystem responses to biodiversity alterations may he best achieved through the study of the interactions allowing biotic communities to compensate internally for population changes in terms of contributing to ecosystem function, or their intrinsic functional redundancy. Because individual organisms are the biologically discrete working components of ecosystems and because environmental changes are perceived at the scale of the individual, a mechanistic understanding of functional redundancy will hinge upon understanding how individuals' behaviours influence population dynamics in the complex community setting. Here, I use analytical and graphical modelling to construct a conceptual framework for predicting the conditions under which varying degrees of interspecific functional redundancy can be found in dynamic ecosystems. The framework is founded on principles related to food web successional theory, which provides some evolutionary insights for mechanistically linking functional roles of discrete, interacting organisms with the dynamics of ecosystems because energy is the currency both for ecological fitness and for food web commerce. Net productivity is considered the most contextually relevant ecosystem process variable because of its socioeconomic significance and because it ultimately subsumes all biological processes and interactions. Redundancy relative to productivity is suggested to manifest most directly as compensatory niche shifts among adaptive foragers in exploitation ecosystems, facilitating coexistence and enhancing ecosystem recovery after disturbances which alter species' relative abundances, such as extinctions. The framework further explicates how resource scarcity and environmental stochasticity ma!: constitute 'ecosystem legacies' influencing the emergence of redundancy by shaping the background conditions for foraging behaviour evolution and, consequently, the prevalence of compensator!: interactions. Because it generates experimentally testable predictions for a priori hypothesis testing about when and where varying degrees of functional redundancy ale likely to be found in food webs, the framework may be useful for advancing toward the reliable knowledge of biodiversity and ecosystem function relations necessary for prudent prioritization of conservation programmes. The theory presented here introduces explanation of how increasing diversity can have a negative influence on ecosystem sustainability by altering the environment for biotic inter actions and thereby changing functional compensability among biota - under particular conditions.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Johnson, KH (corresponding author), Univ Toledo, Dept Biol, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",khjohnson@netscape.net,,,,,,149,31,31,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

The seed bank declined at a rate of c. 50% per year when fresh seed rain was excluded, 3. The fate of 2863 seedlings was followed for a variety of treatments. 4. Seedling survival depended on disturbance: none survived their first summer in undisturbed plots; more than 40% survived their first summer and c. 14% survived to flowering age in plots that were initially cultivated. 5. Seedlings flowered first in their fourth year, although only c, 10% set seed. 6. Neither inter- nor intraspecific competition was found to affect significantly seedling survival on cultivated plots.

Applications of insecticide, molluscicide or fungicide did not affect significantly seedling survival, growth or minimum age of reproduction on cultivated plots. 8. It is concluded that management strategies should minimize disturbance to competing vegetation, which can inhibit germination and smother emerging seedlings. In many circumstances strategies that target the seed bank, such as burning, are not expected to work. 9. Herbivores and pathogens may prevent stand re-establishment indirectly, by reducing the size, vigour and density of broom plants so that competing vegetation can persist and smother emergent seedlings following the death of the parent stand.","CSIRO, European Lab, CABI Biosci, F-34980 Montferrier sur Lez, France; CABI B, Ascot SL5 7TA, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Populat Biol, CABI B, Leverhulme Unit, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; CSIRO, Div Entomol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Paynter, Q (corresponding author), CSIRO, Trop Ecosyst Res Ctr, PMB 44, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia.",Paynter@terc.csiro.au,"Fowler, Simon V/E-5391-2011; Sheppard, Andy W/C-1045-2009","Fowler, Simon V/0000-0001-8356-0836; Sheppard, Andy W/0000-0002-6188-7122",,,,38,62,65,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Several alternative models for species replacement among pelagic fishes are presented and analyzed: (A) environmental fluctuation, (B) strong density-dependent reproduction rate, (C) a two-species system with phase variation (density-dependent change of life history traits), (D) a two-species competition system with environmental fluctuation, (E) cyclic advantage relationship among three competitive species, and (F) a two-prey, one-predator system. Different model requires different number of species for the occurrence of species replacement. Three criteria to test each hypothesis from qualitative properties of species replacement are proposed. Possible management policies to decrease the amplitude of stock fluctuations are discussed. As a result, if the catching effort to mackerels which is rare now is large, or if the catching effort to the sardine is still large when it begins to decline in stock abundance, fisheries may be strong destabilizing effect on the stock abundance.","HOKKAIDO NATL FISHERIES RES INST,KUSHIRO 085,JAPAN; SHIZUOKA UNIV,FAC ENGN,DEPT APPL MATH,HAMAMATSU,SHIZUOKA 432,JAPAN; MIE UNIV,FAC BIORESOURCES,TSU,MIE 514,JAPAN","MATSUDA, H (corresponding author), NATL RES INST FISHERIES SCI,MATH BIOECOL SECT,CHUO KU,5-5-1,TOKYO 104,JAPAN.",,,,,,,28,22,24,0,1,SOC POPULATION ECOLOGY,KYOTO,"SHIMOTACHIURI OGAWA-HIGASHI KAMIKYO-KU, KYOTO 602, JAPAN",0034-5466,,,RES POPUL ECOL,Res.

Spartina alterniflora monocultures dominate low marsh habitats while the seaward border of high marsh habitats is generally dominated by Spartina patens. In this paper I examine the role of interspecific competition in maintaining this zonation pattern. Spartina patens turfs and tillers transplanted into the low marsh were severely stunted with or without S. alterniflora neighbors, and low marsh bare patches bordering S. patens monocultures were not significantly colonized by S. patens in three growing seasons. The limited ability of S. patens to oxygenate its rhizosphere in anoxic soils appears to limit S. patens to high marsh habitats. In contrast, S. alterniflora transplants grew vigorously in the high and low marsh when buffered from neighbors, but were excluded from the high marsh in 2-3 yr when S. patens was present. S. alterniflora also rapidly invaded the high marsh in the absence of S. patens. These results support the hypothesis that S. alterniflora is restricted to low marsh habitats by competitive displacement. S. alterniflora thrives in anoxic low marsh habitats due to its ability to oxygenate its roots and rhizosphere. Rhizosphere oxidation by S. alterniflora, however, is not evident in seedlings and small colonizing patches and both seedlings and small colonizing patches of S. alterniflora are stunted in anoxic low marsh substrates. This suggests that the success of S. alterniflora in anoxic habitats is size dependent and may be driven by group benefits of rhizosphere oxidation. These results suggest that the maintenance of intertidal zonation in rocky beach and marsh plant communities is very similar. In both assemblages, competitive dominants monopolize physically benign habitats and displace competitive subordinates to physically stressful habitats.",,"BERTNESS, MD (corresponding author), BROWN UNIV, GRAD PROGRAM ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, PROVIDENCE, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,38,348,362,1,157,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,1991,72,1,,,,,138,148,,10.2307/1938909,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EU723,WOS:A1991EU72300015,,,,,2021-09-21,

We used laboratory manipulation and field surveys to test for invader-induced parasite dilution via two specific mechanisms: host-host competition and encounter reduction. In the laboratory, single Aedes triseriatus larvae were exposed to one of eight combinations of: parasitic Ascogregarina barretti, +/-1 cohabiting Aedes albopictus larva during parasite exposure, and +/-1 cohabiting A. albopictus larva after infectious parasite removal. Larval infection intensity (predicted to decrease via dilution by encounter reduction) was not significantly affected by A. albopictus. Adult infection prevalence and intensity (predicted to decrease via dilution by host-host competition) were significantly greater with A. albopictus, suggesting parasite amplification by interspecific competition, an effect potentially mediated by competition increasing A. triseriatus development time. In the field, we tested for effects of potential dilution host abundances on prevalence and abundance of A. barretti in A. triseriatus larvae. Piecewise path analysis yielded no evidence of host-host competition impacting parasitism in the field, but instead indicated a significant direct negative effect of Aedes spp. abundance on parasite abundance in A. triseriatus, which is consistent with dilution via encounter reduction in the field, but only in tree holes, not in man-made containers. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a noncompetent invader can alter the native host-parasite relationship, but our laboratory and field data yield differing results. This difference is likely due to laboratory experiment testing for per capita effects of dilution hosts on parasitism, but field analysis testing for effects of dilution host abundance on parasitism. Individually, host-host competition with the invader amplifies, rather than dilutes, parasite success. In contrast, our path analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that dilution of parasitism results from increased abundance of noncompetent hosts in the field.","[McIntire, Kristina M.; Chappell, Kasie M.; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","McIntire, KM (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",kris.m.mcintire@gmail.com,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553; McIntire, Kristina/0000-0002-1387-5637; Chappell, Kasie/0000-0001-6528-2190","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseaseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [1R15AI094322-01A1, 1R15AI124005-01]; Beta Lambda chapter of Phi Sigma Biological Honor Society; Dr. Robert H.

We examined the interplay within a carnivore community consisting of cougars, coyotes, black bears, and bobcats using contemporaneous Global Positioning System telemetry data from 51 individuals; diet analysis from 972 DNA-metabarcoded scats; and data from 128 physical investigations of cougar kill sites, 28 of which were monitored with remote cameras. Resource provisioning from competitively dominant cougars to coyotes through scavenging was so prolific as to be an overwhelming determinant of coyote behavior, space use, and resource acquisition. This was evident via the strong attraction of coyotes to cougar kill sites, frequent scavenging of cougar-killed prey, and coyote diets that nearly matched cougars in the magnitude of ungulate consumption. Yet coyotes were often killed by cougars and used space to minimize encounters, complicating the fitness benefits gained from scavenging. We estimated that 23% (95% CI: 8 to 55%) of the coyote population in our study area was killed by cougars annually, suggesting that coyote interactions with cougars are a complex behavioral game of risk and reward. In contrast, we found no indication that bobcat space use or diet was influenced by cougars. Black bears avoided cougars, but there was no evidence of attraction to cougar kill sites and much lower levels of ungulate consumption and carcass visitation than for coyotes. Interspecific interactions among carnivores are multifaceted, encompassing both suppression and facilitation.","[Ruprecht, Joel; Eriksson, Charlotte E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Forrester, Tavis D.; Clark, Darren A.; Bianco, Marcus; Smith, Joshua B.; Johnson, Bruce K.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; [Spitz, Derek B.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Wisdom, Michael J.; Rowland, Mary M.] US Dept Agr Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, La Grande, OR 97850 USA","Ruprecht, J (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",ruprechtjoel@gmail.com,,"Rowland, Mary/0000-0001-5766-8683","Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife; US Department of Agriculture Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University; Wildlife Restoration Act","We are grateful to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and the Wildlife Restoration Act for funding and/or logistical support.

However, the potential contributions of active Anammox species to carbon utilization in a mixotrophic Anammox-denitrification process are less well understood. In this study, we combined genome-resolved metagenomics and DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) to characterize an Anammox process fed with acetate under COD/TN ratios of around 0.30-0.40 and low nitrogen-loading rates. A draft genome of Candidatus Jettenia caeni and a novel species that was phylogenetically close to Candidatus Brocadia sinica were recovered. Essential genes encoding the key enzymes for acetate metabolism and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium were identified in the two Anammox draft genomes. The DNA-SIP revealed that Ignavibacterium, Candidatus Jettenia caeni, Theurer degrees, Denitralisoma, and Calorithrix predominantly contributed to organic carbon utilization in the acetate-fed Anammox process. In particular, the Candidatus Jettenia caeni accounted fora higher proportion of C-13-DNA communities than Candidatus Brocadia sinica. This result well confirmed the theory of maintenance energy between the interspecies competition of the two Anammox species under low nitrogen-loading rates.

Here we develop a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary framework which features more detailed species interactions, integrating evolution and dispersal. We include species interactions within and between trophic levels, and additionally, we incorporate the feature that species' interspecific competition might change due to increasing temperatures and affect the impact of climate change on ecological communities. Our modeling framework captures previously reported ecological responses to climate change, and also reveals two key results. First, interactions between trophic levels as well as temperature-dependent competition within a trophic level mitigate the negative impact of climate change on biodiversity, emphasizing the importance of understanding biotic interactions in shaping climate change impact. Second, our trait-based perspective reveals a strong positive relationship between the within-community variation in preferred temperatures and the capacity to respond to climate change. Temperature-dependent competition consistently results both in higher trait variation and more responsive communities to altered climatic conditions. Our study demonstrates the importance of species interactions in an eco-evolutionary setting, further expanding our knowledge of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes. Understanding the dynamics of species interactions can help predict community responses to climate change. A spatially explicit model finds that species interactions and competition mitigate the harmful impacts of climate change, and that temperature-dependent competition makes communities more variable and responsive to changing climates.","[Akesson, Anna; Ekloef, Anna; Ebenman, Bo; Barabas, Gyoergy] Linkoping Univ, Dept IFM, Div Theoret Biol, Linkoping, Sweden; [Curtsdotter, Alva] Univ New England, Zool, Insect Ecol Lab, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Norberg, Jon] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Barabas, Gyoergy] MTA ELTE Theoret Biol & Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Budapest, Hungary","Barabas, G (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept IFM, Div Theoret Biol, Linkoping, Sweden.; Barabas, G (corresponding author), MTA ELTE Theoret Biol & Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Budapest, Hungary.",gyorgy.barabas@liu.se,,"Curtsdotter, Alva/0000-0001-6870-7924; Eklof, Anna/0000-0003-2721-0051; Norberg, Jon/0000-0003-1861-5030","Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [FORMAS 2015-01262, VR 2017-05245]","We thank Priyanga Amarasekare and Peter Munger for discussions.

In both events, the chimpanzees significantly outnumbered the gorillas and victims were infant gorillas. We discuss these observations in light of the two most widely accepted theoretical explanations for interspecific lethal violence, predation and competition, and combinations of the two-intraguild predation and interspecific killing. Given these events meet conditions proposed to trigger coalitional killing of neighbours in chimpanzees, we also discuss them in light of chimpanzees' intraspecific interactions and territorial nature.

For environmentally transmitted parasites, host community composition can alter host density, the density of parasites that hosts encounter in the environment, and the dose to which hosts are subsequently exposed. While some multi-host theory incorporates some of these factors (e.g., competition among hosts), it does not currently consider the nonlinear relationships between parasite exposure dose and per-propagule infectivity (dose-infectivity relationships), between exposure dose and infected host mortality (dose-mortality relationships), and between exposure dose and parasite propagule excretion (dose-excretion relationships). This makes it difficult to predict the impact of host species on one another's likelihood of infection. To understand the implications of these nonlinear dose relationships for multi-host communities, we first performed a meta-analysis on published dose-infectivity experiments to quantify the proportion of accelerating, linear, or decelerating dose-infectivity relationships; we found that most experiments demonstrated decelerating dose-infectivity relationships. We then explored how dose-infectivity, dose-mortality, and dose-excretion relationships might alter the impact of heterospecific host density on infectious propagule density, infection prevalence, and density of a focal host using two-host, one-parasite models. We found that dose relationships either decreased the magnitude of the impact of heterospecific host density on propagule density and infection prevalence via negative feedback loops (decelerating dose-infectivity relationships, positive dose-mortality relationships, and negative dose-excretion relationships), or increased the magnitude of the impact of heterospecific host density on infection prevalence via positive feedback loops (accelerating dose-infectivity relationships and positive dose-excretion relationships). Further, positive dose-mortality relationships resulted in hosts that traditionally decrease disease (e.g., low competence, strong competitors) increasing infection prevalence, and vice versa. Finally, we found that dose relationships can create positive feedback loops that facilitate friendly competition (i.e., increased heterospecific density has a positive effect on focal host density because the reduction in disease outweighs the negative effects of interspecific competition). This suggests that without taking dose relationships into account, we may incorrectly predict the effect of heterospecific host interactions, and thus host community composition, on environmentally transmitted parasites.","[Clay, Patrick A.; Duffy, Meghan A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cortez, Michael H.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Clay, PA (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",pclay@umich.edu,,"Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-2015280, DEB-1748729]","This work was funded by NSF grants DEB-2015280 and DEB-1748729.

When aggressive, physically dominant species are displaced by anthropogenic disturbance, physically weaker species exploit competitor and predator downtimes to forage in previously risky places. Birds feeding at outdoor restaurants and cafes in association with humans are exposed to fluctuating levels of perceived danger caused by frequently changing densities of human diners. Consequently, birds must make decisions about which dining tables to visit based on trade-offs between foraging gain and perceived danger from avian competitors and humans. We tested the hypothesis that interspecific differences in response to perceived danger, combined with varying densities of human diners, dynamically alter which bird species predominates at dining tables. We found that house sparrows (Passer domesticus) tolerated higher human diner-densities than larger-sized, more physically dominant Eurasian jackdaws (Coloeus monedula). Sparrows were usually the first birds to visit diner-occupied tables and spent more time there than jackdaws. However, at diner-abandoned tables, this pattern changed: During low diner-densities at surrounding tables, jackdaws were usually the predominant species in first visits and minutes spent visiting, while at high diner-densities sparrows usually predominated. Moreover, along a gradient of increasing human diner-density, sparrows gradually replaced jackdaws as the predominant species in first visits and time at abandoned tables. However, at diner-occupied tables, once a sparrow chose which table to visit, factors other than diner-density influenced its choice of where to forage there (table-top or ground). To our knowledge, our research is the first scientific study of table-visiting behavior by birds at outdoor restaurants and cafes, and the first to reveal interspecific differences in table-visiting behavior by birds there.","[Haemig, Paul D.; Blank, Henrick] Govt Jonkoping Prov, Nat Div, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Haemig, Paul D.] Linneaus Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Kalmar, Sweden; [Sjostedt de Luna, Sara] Umea Univ, Dept Math & Math Stat, Umea, Sweden","de Luna, SS (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Math & Math Stat, Umea, Sweden.",sara.sjostedt.de.luna@umu.se,,,,,,47,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,JUL,2021,127,7,,,,,505,516,,10.1111/eth.13145,,MAY 2021,12,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,SO8LT,WOS:000645937300001,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2021-09-21,

How interspecific interactions among biocrust-forming mosses, lichens, algae and cyanobacteria change along the successional gradient is largely unknown. According to the stress gradient hypothesis (SGH), the frequency or intensity of facilitative and competitive interactions within the community will vary along an environmental stress gradient, with an increasing role of competition relative to facilitation under more benign environmental conditions. In the process of biocrust succession, decreasing soil stress also occurs because of slow soil amelioration, which meets the assumption of the SGH. Therefore, we hypothesize that the changes in facilitative and competitive interactions within biocrust communities will follow the prediction of the SGH and that the nature of biocrust interactions will also change. Location Sand-binding vegetation belts for the Baotou-Lanzhou railway at the southeast fringe of the Tengger Desert in the Shapotou region of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, western China. Methods We conducted a field evaluation at five adjacent sand-binding vegetation belts built in chronosequence to study the successional gradient. Small-scale patterns of co-occurrence and null models were used to evaluate the community-level interspecific interactions among the biocrust-forming mosses, lichens, algae and cyanobacteria. In addition, an accessory method of species-pair co-occurrence based on null models was also applied to potentially identify the nature of the interspecific interactions within the biocrusts and for the causal investigation of these patterns. Results A strong spatial segregation of co-occurrence patterns occurred between cyanobacteria and algae and species of mosses and lichens at early succession, and occurred among species of mosses and lichens at late succession, while the weak spatial aggregation between lichen species only occurred at middle succession. Conclusions Negative interspecific interactions were prevalent within biocrusts throughout succession. The co-occurrence patterns at both the community and species-pair levels are consistent, supporting the unimodal version of the SGH that species interactions shift toward competition under extremely stressed conditions. Given the lack of research on interspecific interactions in biocrusts, our study is important for obtaining a deeper understanding of biocrust succession.","[Sun, Jingyao; Li, Xinrong; Jia, Rongliang; Zhang, Tian] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Shapotou Desert Res & Expt Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jingyao; Zhang, Tian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ning] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Peoples R China","Li, XR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Shapotou Desert Res & Expt Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",xinrongli13@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41621001, 32061123006]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 41621001 and 32061123006).,,53,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Here, we predict that limiting similarity should result in the spatial segregation of functionally similar species, while functionally similar species will be more likely to co-occur either due to environmental filtering or due to competitive exclusion of inferior competitors (hereafter hierarchical competition). We used a fully mapped 50-ha subtropical forest plot in southern China to explore how pairwise spatial associations between saplings and between adult trees were influenced by trait dissimilarity and hierarchy in order to gain insight into assembly mechanisms. We assessed pairwise spatial associations using two summary statistics of spatial point patterns at different spatial scales and compared the effects of trait dissimilarity and trait hierarchy of different functional traits on the interspecific spatial associations. These comparisons allow us to disentangle the effects of limiting similarity, environmental filtering, and hierarchical competition on species co-occurrence. We found that trait dissimilarity was generally negatively related to interspecific spatial associations for both saplings and adult trees across spatial scales, meaning that species with similar trait values were more likely to co-occur and thus supporting environmental filtering or hierarchical competition. We further found that trait hierarchy outweighed trait dissimilarity in structuring pairwise spatial associations, suggesting that hierarchical competition played a more important role in structuring our forest community than environmental filtering across life stages. This study employed a novel method, by offering the integration of pairwise spatial association and trait dissimilarity as well as trait hierarchy, to disentangle the relative importance of multiple assembly mechanisms in structuring co-occurrence patterns, especially the mechanisms of environmental filtering and hierarchical competition, which lead to indistinguishable co-occurrence patterns. This study also reinforced the importance of trait hierarchy rather than trait dissimilarity in driving neighborhood competition.","[Yin, Deyi; Ye, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Bot, South China Bot Garden, Xingke Rd 723, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Yin, Deyi; Ye, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Plant Ecol, Core Bot Garden, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yin, Deyi; Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Liu, Yu; He, Fangliang] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, ECNU Alberta Joint Lab Biodivers Study, Tiantong Forest Ecosyst Natl Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [He, Fangliang] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Ye, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Bot, South China Bot Garden, Xingke Rd 723, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China.; Liu, Y (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, ECNU Alberta Joint Lab Biodivers Study, Tiantong Forest Ecosyst Natl Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",yuliu@des.ecnu.edu.cn; qye@scbg.ac.cn,,"Yin, Deyi/0000-0003-3371-7932; Liu, Yu/0000-0001-9869-2735; Cadotte, Marc/0000-0002-5816-7693",China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31901107]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030310384]; Mitacs Globalink Early Career Fellowship-China; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"China Scholarship Council; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: Grant NO. 31901107; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, Grant/Award Number: Grant NO. 2018A030310384; Mitacs Globalink Early Career Fellowship-China; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada",,60,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The relationships between the activity time and frequency, biological factors (perceived predation risk, food resources, and species composition), and abiotic factors (temperature, air moisture, wind speed) were analysed using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Our results showed that: (1) relative humidity mainly affected activities in the springtime; temperature, relative humidity and interspecific competition mainly affected activities in the summertime; relative humidity and perceived predation risk mainly influenced activities in the autumn. (2) The activity pattern of the Siberian jerboa altered depending on the season. The activity of the Siberian jerboa was found to be bimodal in spring and summer, and was trimodal in autumn. The activity time and frequency in autumn were significantly lower than the spring. (3) Animals possess the ability to integrate disparate sources of information about danger to optimize energy gain.

Identifying new modes of treating infections is of increasing importance, as antibiotic resistance has escalated. Streptococcus mutans is an important opportunistic pathogen that is an agent of dental caries and is capable of systemic diseases such as endocarditis. As such, understanding how it regulates virulence and competes in the oral niche is a priority in developing strategies to defend from these pathogens. We determined that S. mutans UA159 possesses a bona fide short hydrophobic peptide (SHP)/Rgg quorum-sensing system that regulates a specialized biosynthetic operon featuring a radical-SAM (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) (RaS) enzyme and produces a ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP). The pairing of SHP/Rgg regulatory systems with RaS biosynthetic operons is conserved across streptococci, and a locus similar to that in S. mutans is found in Streptococcus ferus, an oral streptococcus isolated from wild rats. We identified the RaS-RiPP product from this operon and solved its structure using a combination of analytical methods; we term these RiPPs tryglysin A and B for the unusual Trp-Gly-Lys linkage. We report that tryglysins specifically inhibit the growth of other streptococci, but not other Gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis or Lactococcus lactis. We predict that tryglysin is produced by S. mutans in its oral niche, thus inhibiting the growth of competing species, including several medically relevant streptococci. IMPORTANCE Bacteria interact and compete with a large community of organisms in their natural environment. Streptococcus mutans is one such organism, and it is an important member of the oral microbiota. We found that S. mutans uses a quorum sensing system to regulate production of a novel posttranslationally modified peptide capable of inhibiting growth of several streptococcal species. We find inhibitory properties of a similar peptide produced by S. ferus and predict that these peptides play a role in interspecies competition in the oral niche.","[Rued, Britta E.; Szewczyk, Gabriella; Laczkovich, Irina; Federle, Michael J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Covington, Brett C.; Bushin, Leah B.; Seyedsayamdost, Mohammad R.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Szewczyk, Gabriella] Univ Illinois, Coll Dent, Chicago, IL USA","Federle, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.; Seyedsayamdost, MR (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mrseyed@princeton.edu; mfederle@uic.edu,,"Federle, Michael/0000-0002-4554-543X; Rued, Britta/0000-0003-3178-4269",Burroughs Wellcome Fund PATH Investigator Award; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AI091779]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF),"This study was supported by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund PATH Investigator Award (to M.J.F. and M.R.S.), the National Institutes of Health (AI091779 to M.J.F.), and the National Science Foundation (NSF GRFP to L.B.B. and NSF Career Award to M.R.S.).",,88,1,1,8,8,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",2150-7511,,,MBIO,mBio,MAR-APR,2021,12,2,,,,,,,e02688-20,10.1128/mBio.02688-20,,,25,Microbiology,Microbiology,RS2TO,WOS:000643634500001,33727351,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

The growth of individual trees depends on complex interactions of biotic and environmental drivers. Controlling the influence of biotic drivers (e.g. interspecific competition and bark beetles) is the main concern of forest management. However, large uncertainties emerge from environmental drivers and their impacts on tree growth. The aim of this study is to quantify the relative importance of environmental drivers (climate, soil, and terrain attributes) on the growth of Norway spruce trees (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). For that purpose, the relative basal area increment of individual spruce trees was modelled with a Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) approach. The approach is particularly suitable, since BRT quantify the relative predictor importance, taking nonlinearities and predictor variable interactions into consideration. We assume distinct differences in the growth responses to environmental drivers on three main soil unit classes (cambisol, podzol and waterlogged soils) in Saxony and Thuringia, Germany. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the importance of soil properties (available water capacity and sand content of the soil) on the growth of Norway spruce trees. Terrain attributes and water availability are crucial for Norway spruce growth on cambisol, podzol and waterlogged soils. Moreover, interactions among environmental drivers are more relevant on sites with cambisol as compared to podzol or waterlogged soils. Considering interactions between environmental drivers in the model led to significant differences in the identification of important environmental drivers. This observation was consistent among soil unit classes, especially for environmental drivers associated with water availability. Thus, the implementation of the results in growth models of high spatial resolution will support decision making in forest management, e.g. through identifying proper regions for spruce development and risk control.","[Seltmann, C.

Understanding how these two stressors interactively affect the organisms is critical to predict the food web dynamics. Here, we investigated the responses of the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus to predation risk from zooplankton (Daphnia magna) and to allelopathy from four macrophytes (Cabomba furcate, Nymphoides hydrophylla, Lemna minor and Chara sp.) separately and jointly. Neither the Daphnia-derived cues nor the four macrophyte exudates affected the algal growth rate compared with those in control. Nonetheless, both the two stressors induced the multi-celled colony formation in S. obliquus, which was, however, much more strongly induced by the Daphnia cues. In addition, the four macrophytes differentially altered the anti-grazer morphological defense in algae: exudates from Nymphoides and Chara markedly promoted the enhancing effect of Daphnia cues on the eight-celled colonies formation, resulting in the increased number of cells per particle of the algal population. Nonetheless, more four-celled colonies but fewer eight-celled colonies were formed under Lemna exudates exposure, in contrast to the unchanged multicelled colonies growing in Cabomba exudates under Daphnia cues exposure. The results revealed that macrophytes allelopathically disturbed the anti-grazer morphological defense in phytoplankton even though they had no direct impact on algal growth, and this interference was species-specific in macrophyte. As a result, the predator-prey interactions between herbivores and phytoplankton can be potentially changed differently in different macrophyte-dominated freshwaters, contributing to the new cognition of the important role of macrophytes in ecosystem functioning. It suggests that the algal morphology can function as a useful indicator of phytoplankton response to simultaneous stresses from predation and competition.","[Zhu, Xuexia] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xuexia; Wang, Zeshuang; Zhou, Qiming; Sun, Yunfei; Zhang, Lu; Wang, Jun; Yang, Zhou; Huang, Yuan] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Jiangsu Key Lab Biodivers & Biotechnol, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yuan] Coinnovat Ctr Marine Bioind Technol Jiangsu Prov, Lianyungang 222005, Peoples R China","Huang, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Jiangsu Key Lab Biodivers & Biotechnol, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",huangyuan@njnu.edu.cn,"Yang, Zhou/H-3407-2011","Yang, Zhou/0000-0001-9664-7105; Huang, Yuan/0000-0003-1751-9039","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31470508, 31500373]; Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470508, 31500373), Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province, and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,58,0,0,4,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

To further investigate this interaction, we undertook a study in McMurdo Sound during 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 using telemetry and biologging of whales and penguins, shore-based observations and quantification of the preyscape. The 3D distribution and density of prey were assessed using a remotely operated vehicle deployed along and to the interior of the fast-ice edge where AMWs and ADPEs focused their foraging. Acoustic surveys of prey and foraging behaviour of predators indicate that prey remained abundant under the fast ice, becoming successively available to air-breathing predators only as the fast ice retreated. Over both seasons, the ADPE diet included less krill and more Antarctic silverfish once AMWs became abundant, but the penguins' foraging behaviour (i.e. time spent foraging, dive depth, distance from colony) did not change. In addition, over time, krill abundance decreased in the upper water column near the ice edge, consistent with the hypothesis (and previously gathered information) that AMW and ADPE foraging contributed to an alteration of prey availability.","[Ainley, David G.] HT Harvey & Associates, 983 Univ Ave, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA; [Joyce, Trevor W.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Marine Mammal & Turtle Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Joyce, Trevor W.] Natl Acad Sci Engn & Med, 500 Fifth St, Washington, DC USA; [Saenz, Ben] Resource Management Associates, 756 Picasso Ave G, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Pitman, Robert L.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Pitman, Robert L.] Oregon State Univ, Marine Mammal Inst, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Durban, John W.] Southhall Environm Associates, 9099 Soquel Dr, Aptos, CA 95003 USA; [Ballard, Grant] Point Blue Conservat Sci, 3820 Cypress Dr,Suite 11, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA; [Daly, Kendra] Univ S Florida, 140 7th Ave S, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Kim, Stacy] Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA","Ainley, DG (corresponding author), HT Harvey & Associates, 983 Univ Ave, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA.",dainley@penguinscience.com,,"Ballard, Grant/0000-0002-8604-7066; Daly, Kendra/0000-0001-8669-3458; Pitman, Robert/0000-0002-8713-1219","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ANT-0944511, ANT-0944694, ANT-0944747, OPP-0338428]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; US Marine Mammal Commission; NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center; H.T.

Comparisons of cortisol levels during ontogeny can reveal physiological plasticity to species or population specific socioecological factors and in turn how these factors might ameliorate or exaggerate mother-offspring and sibling conflict. Here, we examine developmental patterns of cortisol levels in two wild chimpanzee populations (Budongo and Tai), with two and three communities each, and one wild bonobo population (LuiKotale), with two communities. Both species have similar juvenile life histories. Nonetheless, we predicted that key differences in socio-ecological factors, such as feeding competition, would lead to interspecific variation in mother-offspring and sibling conflict and thus variation in ontogenetic cortisol patterns. We measured urinary cortisol levels in 1394 samples collected from 37 bonobos and 100 chimpanzees aged up to 12 years. The significant differences in age-related variation in cortisol levels appeared population specific rather than species specific. Both bonobos and Tai chimpanzees had comparatively stable and gradually increasing cortisol levels throughout development; Budongo chimpanzees experienced declining cortisol levels before increases in later ontogeny. These age-related population differences in cortisol patterns were not explained by mother-offspring or sibling conflict specifically; instead, the comparatively stable cortisol patterns of bonobos and Tai chimpanzees likely reflect a consistency in experience of competition and the social environment compared with Budongo chimpanzees, where mothers may adopt more variable strategies related to infanticide risk and resource availability. The clear population-level differences within chimpanzees highlight potential intraspecific flexibility in developmental processes in apes, suggesting the flexibility and diversity in rearing strategies seen in humans may have a deep evolutionary history.

Because of its importance, complex societies may engage a set of defensive specialists, with physical and/or neurological attributes tuned for defense against specific invaders. These strategies must be balanced, however, with the need to flexibly respond to different threat levels and sources. Insect societies rely heavily on olfaction for detecting and communicating in the context of defense. We therefore asked whether threat detection via olfaction is specialized towards invader-specific cues and how this may be integrated into defense task specialization. Colonies of the stingless bee,Tetragonisca angustula, deploy a morphologically distinct sub-caste of larger-bodied workers (soldiers) for colony defense. These soldiers transition between two different guarding tasks as they age, progressing from guarding in a hovering position near the nest entrance to guarding in a standing position on the nest entrance tube. Hovering and standing guards intercept different types of invaders: primarily heterospecific versus conspecific, respectively. We asked whether hovering and standing guarding behaviors were modulated by differential sensitivity to invader-associated olfactory stimuli; then we compared their responses to these cues to those of smaller workers that perform predominantly non-defense tasks. We exposed bees under both field and lab conditions to citral, a kairomone produced by an obligate heterospecific nest robber, primarily intercepted by hovering guards. Consistent with their roles, hovering guards were more likely to move towards citral than were either standing guards or small-bodied bees within a Y-maze. We also presented guards at field nests with dummies of conspecific versus heterospecific invader types, varying whether they included citral odors. Standing guards were more responsive to conspecific intruder scenarios than hovering guards, but heterospecific response differed by presence of citral. Standing and hovering guards responded in similar proportions when citral was absent, but the addition of citral produced a marginally non-significant reduction in standing guard participation. Our results potentially demonstrate differentiated cue-specific responses that correspond to morphological task specialization and age polyethism in these eusocial societies. Significance statement Group defense is a ubiquitous function of any society, but threats are often diverse. Though defense versus non-defense task specialization has been well studied, when and how individuals sub-specialize on particular threats is less understood. We asked how age-differentiated soldier sub-types in a stingless bee differ in their innate responsiveness to olfactory cues associated with nest invader type. Consistent with behavioral roles, younger soldiers were more innately reactive to odors of an obligate heterospecific parasite, and older soldiers were more reactive to odors of conspecific intruders. This suggests that either transitions in learning or discrete cue sensitivity mediate defensive sub-specialization. This is the first study to compare behavioral responsiveness to olfactory stimuli across age-specialized soldier sub-types. Results suggest benefits of flexible allocation and prompt further studies exploring the topic of defensive sub-specialization.","[Baudier, Kaitlin M.; Bennett, Meghan M.; Ostwald, Madeleine M.; Hart, Sarah; Pavlic, Theodore P.; Fewell, Jennifer H.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Social Insect Res Grp, 427 E Tyler Mall, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Pavlic, Theodore P.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ USA; [Pavlic, Theodore P.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA","Baudier, KM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Social Insect Res Grp, 427 E Tyler Mall, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",kmbaudier@gmail.com,"Baudier, Kaitlin/I-4138-2019","Baudier, Kaitlin/0000-0001-8450-3788",Arizona State University School of Life Sciences Innovative Postdoctoral Research Award; United States Air Force/Eglin AFB/FL [FA8651-17-F-1013]; United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [W31P4Q18-C-0054],"Funding was provided by the Arizona State University School of Life Sciences Innovative Postdoctoral Research Award to MMB and KMB, contract number FA8651-17-F-1013 from the United States Air Force/Eglin AFB/FL and contract number W31P4Q18-C-0054 from the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).",,55,1,1,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

To assess the ecological impacts of the introduced icefish (Neosalanx taihuensisChen), three reservoirs in a cascade, including the Shuibuya Reservoir (SBYR), which is devoid of icefish, and the Geheyan Reservoir (GHYR) and the Gaobazhou Reservoir (GBZR), which have large and small icefish populations, respectively, were selected for this study. Three mass-balance trophic models were established using the Ecopath approach. The results indicated that (1) the three ecosystems tended to depend more on the grazing food chain, possibly because the dominant fish species in three reservoirs were mainly filter feeders or planktivores; (2) the large icefish population in the GHYR decreased the overall energy transfer efficiency; (3) the ecosystem indices suggested that the GHYR ecosystem appeared to be a moderately mature system with a simple and vulnerable food web structure, and the lack of complexity was largely attributed to the large population of introduced icefish; and (4) the mixed trophic impacts (MTI) and niche overlap analysis indicated that the ecological impacts of icefish mainly came from predation and interspecific competition. This study demonstrates the consequence of icefish introduction to aquatic ecosystems and suggests that appropriate control of exotic fish is worth considering.","[Huang, Geng; Wang, Qidong; Feng, Kai; Ye, Shaowen; Yuan, Jing; Liu, Jiashou; Li, Zhongjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, 7 South Donghu Rd, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Huang, Geng] Minist Water Resources, Inst Hydroecol, Key Lab Ecol Impacts Hydraul Projects & Restorat, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Huang, Geng] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qidong; Ye, Shaowen; Yuan, Jing; Liu, Jiashou; Li, Zhongjie] Natl Res Ctr Freshwater Fisheries Engn, 7 South Donghu Rd, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Du, Xue] Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, Heilongjiang River Fishery Res Inst, Harbin 150010, Peoples R China; [De Silva, Sena S.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia","Wang, QD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, 7 South Donghu Rd, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",wangqd@ihb.ac.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFD0900605]; Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System [CARS-45]; Special Fund for Technical Innovation of Hubei Province [2017ABA061]; CASChinese Academy of Sciences,"This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2019YFD0900605), Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System (No. CARS-45), and Special Fund for Technical Innovation of Hubei Province (No. 2017ABA061).

Although theoretical models have explored the factors affecting kinship within social groups, few have analyzed the causes of contrasts in kinship among related species. Here, we describe interspecific differences in average kinship between group members among social mammals and show that a simple mathematical model that includes the number of breeding females, male reproductive skew, and litter size successfully predicts similar to 95% of observed variation in average kinship between group members across a sample of mammals. Our model shows that a wide range of conditions can generate groups with low average relatedness but only a small and rather specific set of conditions are likely to generate high average levels of relatedness between their members, providing insight into the relative rarity of advanced forms of cooperation in mammalian societies.","[Dyble, Mark; Clutton-Brock, Tim H.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Dyble, Mark] UCL, Dept Anthropol, 14 Taviton St, London WC1H 0BW, England","Dyble, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.; Dyble, M (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Anthropol, 14 Taviton St, London WC1H 0BW, England.",m.dyble@ucl.ac.uk,,"Dyble, Mark/0000-0001-6861-1631","Jesus College, University of Cambridge; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [294494, 742808]","M.D. was supported by Jesus College, University of Cambridge.

Interspecific competition for high-quality nesting habitat may force some individuals into suboptimal habitat and lead to reduced reproductive success, eventually leading to changes in distribution or abundance. Large climate-mediated shifts in vegetation, including the rapid expansion of shrubs onto tundra, are occurring in the Arctic across important breeding grounds of many shorebird species of conservation concern. We investigated effects of vegetation structure and composition on nest-site selection and nest success of sympatrically breeding American Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis dominica) and Pacific Golden-Plovers (P. fulva), which nest along an elevational gradient ranging from coastal tundra meadows to alpine tundra. Both species strongly selected nest sites with less cover of tall shrubs and other tall vegetation than available at random sites within their territories. American Golden-Plovers selected territories and nest sites that were higher in elevation and had more rocky substrates and less graminoid vegetation than those selected by Pacific Golden-Plovers. The daily nest survival rate was equivalent in the 2 species (0.966, 95% CI: 0.955, 0.975) and similar to that found in other Arctic-breeding shorebirds; however, contrary to predictions, nest survival was not associated with habitat features selected for nest sites for either species. Strong selection of open habitat for nest sites suggests that continued climate-related shrub expansion may reduce the amount of suitable breeding habitat for both species, but partitioning along the elevational gradient and differences in body size suggest that impacts may be more severe for Pacific Golden-Plovers. Additional research is needed to determine if differential selection of nesting habitat is related to survival of the adults or their young.","[Overduijn, Kelly S.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Overduijn, Kelly S.; Handel, Colleen M.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Powell, Abby N.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Overduijn, Kelly S.] 185 Chimney Creek Rd, Soquel, CA USA; [Powell, Abby N.] US Geol Survey, Florida Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Gainesville, FL USA","Handel, CM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",cmhandel@usgs.gov,,"Powell, Abby/0000-0002-9783-134X; Handel, Colleen/0000-0002-0267-7408",Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative of the U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Science Center; Arctic Audubon Society; University of Alaska Fairbanks Global Change Grant; University of Alaska Fairbanks Institute of Arctic Biology; Betty A.

The evolutionary drivers of this diversity, however, remain unclear. Here, we investigate three major factors that might predict interspecific variation in parental care strategies: climate, intrasexual selection and social environment. We hypothesize that some forms of care evolved to cope with harsh conditions, such as dry or unpredictable habitats. We contrast this prediction with the hypothesis that parental roles have co-evolved with the social environment and mating systems. Location Global. Major taxa studied Frogs and toads (Amphibia: Anura). Time period Extant taxa that represent c. 220 Myr of evolutionary history. Methods Using geographical and behavioural data for 971 species of frogs and toads that represent 45 anuran families, we quantified the global distribution of four forms of parenting separately for males and females: nest building, nest and/or tadpole attendance, carrying and nourishment. We used phylogenetic comparative analyses to investigate whether climate, social environment and mating systems predicted interspecific variation in parental care. Results Our results showed that climatic effects contribute to parental care diversity: in cool and humid climates the males provide offspring attendance, whereas in predictable temperatures endotrophy occurs, whereby the female provides all nutrients for the offspring until metamorphosis. In addition, we found other associations between mating systems and forms of parental care: uniparental clutch attendance by males is present in species with territorial defence, whereas cooperative nest building co-occurs with sperm competition. The type of parental care is not associated with adult sex ratios. Main conclusions No specific form of care is associated with hostile environments; in fact, some forms of care occur in beneficial conditions, whereas others are used independently from the climate. Instead, parenting diversity has co-evolved closely with mating systems in frogs.","[Vagi, Balazs; Szekely, Tamas] Univ Debrecen, Dept Evolutionary Zool & Human Biol, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Vegvari, Zsolt] Danube Res Inst, Ctr Ecol Res, Budapest, Hungary; [Vegvari, Zsolt] Senckenberg Deutsch Entomol Inst, Muncheberg, Germany; [Liker, Andras] Univ Pannonia, Dept Limnol, MTA PE Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Veszprem, Hungary; [Freckleton, Robert P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Szekely, Tamas] Univ Bath, Milner Ctr Evolut, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath, Avon, England; [Szekely, Tamas] Maio Biodivers Fdn, Maio, Cape Verde; [Szekely, Tamas] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Szekely, Tamas] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Vagi, B (corresponding author), Univ Debrecen, Dept Evolutionary Zool & Human Biol, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",bi.vagi@gmail.com,"Freckleton, Rob P/B-6455-2013; Szekely, Tamas/I-7089-2016","Liker, Andras/0000-0001-8545-4869; Szekely, Tamas/0000-0003-2093-0056","Hungarian Ministry of Human Capacities [20385-3/2018/FEKUSTRAT]; National Research, Development and Innovation Office of Hungary (NKFIH) [K116310, KKP-126949, PD 132819]; Office of the Royal Society [APEX APX\R1\191045, WM170050]","Hungarian Ministry of Human Capacities, Grant/Award Number: 20385-3/2018/FEKUSTRAT; National Research, Development and Innovation Office of Hungary (NKFIH), Grant/Award Number: K116310, KKP-126949 and PD 132819; Office of the Royal Society, Grant/Award Number: APEX APX\R1\191045 and Wolfson Merit Award WM170050",,88,3,3,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Changes in this key functional trait can therefore have important implications for populations as well. For example, among invertebrates, there is typically a positive correlation between female body size and reproductive output. Increasing body size can consequently trigger changes in population density, population structure (e.g. adult to juvenile ratio) and the strength of intraspecific competition. Body size changes have been documented in several species in the Arctic, a region that is warming rapidly. In particular, wolf spiders, one of the most abundant arctic invertebrate predators, are becoming larger and therefore more fecund. Whether these changes are affecting their populations and role within food webs is currently unclear. We investigated the population structure and feeding ecology of the dominant wolf spider species Pardosa lapponica at two tundra sites where adult spiders naturally differ in mean body size. Additionally, we performed a mesocosm experiment to investigate how variation in wolf spider density, which is likely to change as a function of body size, influences feeding ecology and its sensitivity to warming. We found that juvenile abundance is negatively associated with female size and that wolf spiders occupied higher trophic positions where adult females were larger. Because female body size is positively related to fecundity in P. lapponica, the unexpected finding of fewer juveniles with larger females suggests an increase in density-dependent cannibalism as a result of increased intraspecific competition for resources. Higher rates of density-dependent cannibalism are further supported by the results from our mesocosm experiment, in which individuals occupied higher trophic positions in plots with higher wolf spider densities. We observed no changes in wolf spider feeding ecology in association with short-term experimental warming. Our results suggest that body size variation in wolf spiders is associated with variation in intraspecific competition, feeding ecology and population structure. Given the widespread distribution of wolf spiders in arctic ecosystems, body size shifts in these predators as a result of climate change could have implications for lower trophic levels and for ecosystem functioning.","[Koltz, Amanda M.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Wright, Justin P.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA","Koltz, AM (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",akoltz@wustl.edu,,"Wright, Justin/0000-0002-9102-5347","Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International; Lewis and Clark Fund; Arctic Institute of North America; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1210704]; Alaska Geographic; Discover Denali Research Fellowship; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; Kappa Delta Foundation","\Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International; Lewis and Clark Fund; Arctic Institute of North America; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1210704; Alaska Geographic; Discover Denali Research Fellowship; National Geographic Society; Kappa Delta Foundation",,85,4,4,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Here, we show that hygromycin A from Streptomyces sp. strain 2AW. induces Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 31532 to produce the purple antibiotic violacein. Sublethal doses of other antibiotics that similarly target the polypeptide elongation step of translation likewise induced violacein production, unlike antibiotics with different targets. C. violaceum biofilm formation and virulence against Drosophila melanogaster were also induced by translation-inhibiting antibiotics, and we identified an antibiotic-induced response (air) two-component regulatory system that is required for these responses. Genetic analyses indicated a connection between the Air system, quorum-dependent signaling, and the negative regulator VioS, leading us to propose a model for induction of violacein production. This work suggests a novel mechanism of interspecies interaction in which a bacterium produces an antibiotic in response to inhibition by another bacterium and supports the role of antibiotics as signal molecules. IMPORTANCE Secondary metabolites play important roles in microbial communities, but their natural functions are often unknown and may be more complex than appreciated. While compounds with antibiotic activity are often assumed to underlie microbial competition, they may alternatively act as signal molecules. In either scenario, microorganisms might evolve responses to sublethal concentrations of these metabolites, either to protect themselves from inhibition or to change certain behaviors in response to the local abundance of another species. Here, we report that violacein production by C violaceum ATCC 31532 is induced in response to hygromycin A from Streptomyces sp. 2AW, and we show that this response is dependent on inhibition of translational polypeptide elongation and a previously uncharacterized two-component regulatory system. The breadth of the transcriptional response beyond violacein induction suggests a surprisingly complex metabolite-mediated microbemicrobe interaction and supports the hypothesis that antibiotics evolved as signal molecules. These novel insights will inform predictive models of soil community dynamics and the unintended effects of clinical antibiotic administration.","[Lozano, Gabriel L.; Handelsman, Jo] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Inst Discovery, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Lozano, Gabriel L.; Handelsman, Jo] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Plant Pathol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Lozano, Gabriel L.; Guan, Changhui; Cao, Yanzhuan; Handelsman, Jo] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Borlee, Bradley R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Broderick, Nichole A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Stabb, Eric, V] Univ Georgia, Dept Microbiol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Handelsman, J (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Inst Discovery, Madison, WI 53706 USA.; Handelsman, J (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Plant Pathol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.; Handelsman, J (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",jo.handelsman@wisc.edu,,"Broderick, Nichole/0000-0002-6830-9456; Lozano, Gabriel L/0000-0001-9327-4470; Handelsman, Jo/0000-0003-3488-5030",Office of the Provost at Yale University; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1716232]; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation through the University of Wisconsin-Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education,This research was supported by the Office of the Provost at Yale University and by funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation through the University of Wisconsin-Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education.

The wolverine (Gulo gulo) is a facultative predator that occupies environments of low productivity. As an adaptation to fluctuating food availability, wolverines cache perishable food in snow, boulders, and bogs for short- and long-term storage. We studied caching behavior of 38 GPS-collared wolverines in four study areas in Scandinavia. By investigating clusters of GPS locations, we identified a total of 303 food caches from 17 male and 21 female wolverines. Wolverines cached food all year around, from both scavenging and predation events, and spaced their caches widely within their home range. Wolverines cached food items on average 1.1 km from the food source and made between 1 and 6 caches per source. Wolverines cached closer to the source when scavenging carcasses killed by other large carnivores; this might be a strategy to optimize food gain when under pressure of interspecific competition. When caching, wolverines selected for steep and rugged terrain in unproductive habitat types or in forest, indicating a preference for less-exposed sites that can provide cold storage and/or protection against pilferage. The observed year-round investment in caching by wolverines underlines the importance of food predictability for survival and reproductive success in this species. Increasing temperatures as a consequence of climate change may provide new challenges for wolverines by negatively affecting the preservation of cached food and by increasing competition from pilferers that benefit from a warmer climate. It is however still not fully understood which consequences this may have for the demography and behavior of the wolverine.","[van der Veen, Bert; Zimmermann, Barbara] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci INN, Fac Appl Ecol Agr Sci & Biotechnol, NO-2480 Koppang, Norway; [van der Veen, Bert] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, NO-7031 Trondheim, Norway; [Mattisson, Jenny] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Odden, John] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Persson, Jens] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden","Mattisson, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway.",jenny.mattisson@nina.no,,"Mattisson, Jenny/0000-0001-6032-5307; Zimmermann, Barbara/0000-0001-5133-9379","Norwegian institute for nature researchBioforsk; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Environment Agency; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [212919]; European Association for Zoo and Aquaria; World Wide Fund for Nature (Sweden); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)Swedish Research Council Formas; Olle och Signhild Engkvists Stiftelser; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Stiftelse; Reindeer Development Fund in Norway; Carnivore Management Boards in region 6; Carnivore Management Boards in region 8; County administration in Nord-Trondelag; County administration in Troms; County administration in Finnmark","Open Access funding provided by Norwegian institute for nature research.

Across natural landscapes, the distribution and abundance of wild herbivores are affected by interspecific competition for foraging resources, hunting and the development of infrastructure among other factors. In Argentine Patagonia, the abundance of domestic sheep grazing on native vegetation outnumbers the widely distributed guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and sheep ranching monopolizes the most productive lands. In this work, we aimed to assess the spatial variation in the abundance of guanacos in Peninsula Valdes, a representative landscape of Patagonia, investigating the incidence of natural and human-related factors. We conducted ground surveys during the austral autumn in 2017 totaling 383.4 km along areas with and without sheep ranching. We built density surface models to account for the variation in guanaco abundance and obtained a map of guanaco density at a resolution of 4 km(2). We estimated an overall density of 11.71 guanacos.km(-2) for a prediction area of 3,196 km(2), although the density of guanacos tripled in areas where sheep ranching was terminated (in around 20% of the surface of Peninsula Valdes) compared to areas with sheep. Guanacos were more abundant at lower values of primary productivity and sheep stocking rates and further from inhabited ranch buildings, suggesting competition with sheep and conflict with humans. Although guanacos selected open, grass-dominated habitats across sheep-free sites, fences dividing properties and paddocks played a significant role in the spatial structure of their population in Peninsula Valdes affecting negatively the abundance of guanacos. Our results indicate that actions to improve habitat connectivity for guanacos, favor the coexistence among guanacos and sheep ranching, and promote responsible human activities and attitudes towards wildlife are needed.","[Antun, Milagros; Baldi, Ricardo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IPEEC, Grp Estudio Mamiferos Terr, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Antun, Milagros] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Fac Ciencias Nat & Ciencias Salud, Dept Biol & Ambiente, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Baldi, Ricardo] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Programa Maestria Conservac Biodiversidad, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Antun, M (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IPEEC, Grp Estudio Mamiferos Terr, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.; Antun, M (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Fac Ciencias Nat & Ciencias Salud, Dept Biol & Ambiente, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",antun@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar,,,Wildlife Conservation Society; Instituto Patagonico para el Estudio de los Ecosistemas Continentales (IPEEC)-CONICET [P-UE 44/2016]; Administracion de Parques Nacionales,"The fieldwork was funded by the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Instituto Patagonico para el Estudio de los Ecosistemas Continentales (IPEEC)-CONICET (P-UE 44/2016) and the Administracion de Parques Nacionales.

In particular, we need improved means of quantifying the ecological impacts of new invasive species under different contexts. Here, we develop a suite of metrics based upon the novel Relative Impact Potential (RIP) metric, combining the functional response (consumer per capita effect), with proxies for the numerical response (consumer population response), providing quantification of invasive species ecological impact. These metrics are comparative in relation to the eco-evolutionary baseline of trophically analogous natives, as well as other invasive species and across multiple populations. Crucially, the metrics also reveal how impacts of invasive species change under abiotic and biotic contexts. While studies focused solely on functional responses have been successful in predictive invasion ecology, RIP retains these advantages while adding vital other predictive elements, principally consumer abundance. RIP can also be combined with propagule pressure to quantify overall invasion risk. By highlighting functional response and numerical response proxies, we outline a user-friendly method for assessing the impacts of invaders of all trophic levels and taxonomic groups. We apply the metric to impact assessment in the face of climate change by taking account of both changing predator consumption rates and prey reproduction rates. We proceed to outline the application of RIP to assess biotic resistance against incoming invasive species, the effect of evolution on invasive species impacts, application to interspecific competition, changing spatio-temporal patterns of invasion, and how RIP can inform biological control. We propose that RIP provides scientists and practitioners with a user-friendly, customisable and, crucially, powerful technique to inform invasive species policy and management.","[Dickey, James W.

Previous studies have mainly focused on the separate effects of different environmental changes, but plant communities are influenced by the changes in multiple environmental factors, and it is still unclear whether native and exotic species respond similar to the combined effects of these factors. We hypothesized that differences in interspecific trade-offs between native and exotic species can lead to the dominance of exotic species when the species are simultaneously subjected to multiple environmental changes. Using coastal saltmarsh plant communities as the study system, we experimentally manipulated flooding and nutrient enrichment, examined the interspecific trade-offs between competitiveness and stress tolerance for two native and one exotic species, and explored the combined effect of the two environmental changes on both native-native and native-exotic species interactions. We found that flooding and nutrient enrichment oppositely affected native-native species interactions but additively affected native-exotic species interactions. The two factors together resulted in no net change in the relative advantages between the two native species but enhanced the dominance of the exotic species over the native species. This disparity occurred because the exotic species was not subject to the interspecific trade-off between competitiveness and stress tolerance that constrained the native species. Synthesis. Our results suggest that changes in multiple environmental factors favour exotic species because of evolutionary novel trade-off patterns. Mechanisms underlying species coexistence in the invaded community such as interspecific trade-offs need to be considered when future attempts are made to predict the effects of global changes on biological invasions.","[Qiu, Shiyun; Liu, Shuangshuang; Wei, Shujuan; Nie, Ming; He, Qiang; Ju, Rui-Ting; Li, Bo] Fudan Univ, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ,Inst Biodivers Sci,Sch Life Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xinhong] Shanghai Acad Landscape Architecture Sci & Plann, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xinhong] Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Landscaping Challenging Urb, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jingxin] Yunnan Normal Univ, Sch Energy & Environm Sci, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Ju, RT; Li, B (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ,Inst Biodivers Sci,Sch Life Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",jurt@fudan.edu.cn; bool@fudan.edu.cn,"Li, Bo/B-8016-2010; Ju, Rui-Ting/E-7538-2016; Nie, Ming/F-1880-2010","Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666; Nie, Ming/0000-0003-0702-8009; Qiu, Shiyun/0000-0002-0697-3757","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1200100]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41630528, 31961133028, 31901228, 31670491, 31670544]","National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFC1200100; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41630528, 31961133028, 31901228, 31670491 and 31670544",,53,3,4,2,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, to date, their interactive effects on interspecific interactions have not been closely examined for salt-marsh plant species. Methods Juvenile plants of Suaeda salsa L. (Chenopodiaceae) and Scirpus planiculmis Fr. (Cyperaceae) were grown in rinsed river sand to conduct a greenhouse experiment with three treatment categories: interspecific interaction (mixed culture or monoculture), three salinity levels (1, 50 and 100 mmol L-1) and three nitrate levels (0.5, 5 and 10 mmol L-1). First, height and biomass of all plants were measured. Then, the growth data, relative interaction index and competitive important index of the two species were analyzed. Important Findings The interspecific interactions between S. salsa and S. planiculmis were facilitation across the salinity gradients. The promotion of S. salsa growth with high nitrate supply did not enhance the facilitative effect of the species, especially at low salinity. However, high nitrate supply significantly shifted the interspecific interactions of S. planiculmis from facilitation to competition at high salinity. Our results suggest that excessive nitrate application changes the prediction of the stress-gradient hypothesis along a salinity gradient, leading to collapse of the two species coexistence in the salt-marshes. These findings make a contribution to the understanding of how S. salsa and S. planiculmis, as well as salt-marsh communities, respond to the human modification of estuarine nutritional levels.","[Ma, Hua; Cui, Li-Juan; Pan, Xu; Li, Wei; Ning, Yu] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Wetland Res, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Ma, Hua; Cui, Li-Juan; Pan, Xu; Li, Wei; Ning, Yu] Beijing Key Lab Wetland Serv & Restorat, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Cui, Li-Juan; Pan, Xu; Li, Wei] Beijing Hanshiqiao Natl Wetland Ecosyst Res Stn, Beijing 101309, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jian] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Cui, LJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Wetland Res, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.; Cui, LJ (corresponding author), Beijing Key Lab Wetland Serv & Restorat, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.; Cui, LJ (corresponding author), Beijing Hanshiqiao Natl Wetland Ecosyst Res Stn, Beijing 101309, Peoples R China.",lkyclj@126.com,"Pan, Xu/W-1607-2017","Pan, Xu/0000-0003-3733-1981; Niu, Shuli/0000-0002-2394-2864",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0506200],This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0506200).,,47,0,0,10,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Bass Strait, south-eastern Australia, is a key region for seabirds, with little penguins Eudyptula minor, short-tailed shearwaters Ardenna tenuirostris, fairy prions Pachyptila turtur and common diving-petrels Pelecanoides urinatrix being particularly abundant in the region. The trophic niches of these species were investigated using isotopic values in whole blood and by identifying prey remains in stomach contents. The four species occupied different isotopic niches that varied among years, seasons and regions. Little penguins consumed mainly fish whereas the three procellariforms primarily consumed coastal krill Nyctiphanes australis. The dietary similarities between the procellariforms suggest that food resources are segregated in other ways, with interspecific differences in isotope niches possibly reflecting differential consumption of key prey, divergent foraging locations and depth, and differences in breeding phenology. Because oceanographic changes predicted to occur due to climate change may result in reduced coastal krill availability, adversely affecting these seabird predators, further information on foraging zones and feeding behaviour of small procellariform species is needed to elucidate more fully the segregation of foraging niches, the capacity of seabirds to adapt to climate change and the potential for interspecific competition in the region.","[Fromant, Aymeric; Schumann, Nicole; Arnould, John P.

In birds, subordinates with restricted access to resources may respond to intragroup contests by acquiring extra body reserves to avoid periods of food shortage. In turn, higher body mass reduces agility and increases predation and mortality risk to subordinates. Birds often live in hierarchically organized mixed-species groups, in which heterospecific individuals are considered to substitute for conspecifics as protection against predators at a significantly reduced competition cost. Crested tits (Lophophanes cristatus) and willow tits (Poecile montanus) form mixed-species groups during the non-reproductive season that typically exhibit a nearly linear dominance hierarchy ('despotic' social structure) in which the highest ranking male willow tit is fourth in the overall hierarchy after the dominant male, female and subordinate juvenile crested tit, respectively. Much less frequently, 'egalitarian' dominance structures occur in which the adult willow tits rank second and the hierarchy is less steep, or linear. We present a rare long-term data set in which egalitarian flocks are common enough to assess the consequences of this simple change in hierarchy structure as well as a potential driver of the pattern. A comparison of individuals in the despotic mixed-species groups revealed a strong negative correlation between subcutaneous fat stores and dominance rank in the interspecific dominance hierarchy, whereas in egalitarian groups, subordinate willow tits had significantly lower fat reserves and they foraged in safer parts of the canopy than willow tits in despotic groups. Moreover, egalitarian groups exhibited markedly less within-group aggression, higher group cohesion and improved winter survival in both tit species. However, winter survival of birds in egalitarian groups was impaired relative to despotic groups in forests recently affected by industrial forestry. This suggests that the more egalitarian bird societies may best be adapted to less-disturbed environments.","[Krams, Indrikis A.; Krama, Tatjana] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Krams, Indrikis A.] Latvian Biomed Res & Study Ctr, LV-1067 Riga, Latvia; [Krams, Indrikis A.] Univ Latvia, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Fac Biol, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia; [Luoto, Severi] Univ Auckland, English Drama & Writing Studies, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Luoto, Severi] Univ Auckland, Sch Psychol, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Krams, Ronalds] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Dept Plant Hlth, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Sieving, Kathryn] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Trakimas, Giedrius] Vilnius Univ, Inst Biosci, LT-10257 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Elferts, Didzis] Univ Latvia, Dept Bot & Ecol, Fac Biol, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia; [Rantala, Markus J.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Rantala, Markus J.] Univ Turku, Turku Brain & Mind Ctr, Turku 20014, Finland; [Goodale, Eben] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Guangxi Key Lab Forest Ecol & Conservat, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Krams, IA (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.; Krams, IA (corresponding author), Latvian Biomed Res & Study Ctr, LV-1067 Riga, Latvia.; Krams, IA (corresponding author), Univ Latvia, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Fac Biol, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia.",indrikis.krams@ut.ee,"Goodale, Eben/AAM-7436-2020; Elferts, Didzis/M-8533-2015; Luoto, Severi/I-8548-2019; Trakimas, Giedrius/B-8462-2008; Sieving, Kathryn/I-6058-2013","Goodale, Eben/0000-0003-3403-2847; Elferts, Didzis/0000-0002-9401-1231; Luoto, Severi/0000-0002-3904-3994; Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108; Krams, Ronalds/0000-0003-4445-746X; Trakimas, Giedrius/0000-0001-6294-0194; Sieving, Kathryn/0000-0002-0849-8101","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Latvian Council of ScienceLatvian Ministry of Education and Science [290/2012, lzp-2018/1-0393]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [PUT1223]; Emil Aaltonen Foundation Young Researcher Grant","We thank Dr. Jolanta Vrublevska, Dr. Inese Kivleniece and Aleksejs Osipovs for their help in the field.

We selected a reservoir with a large population of exclusively wintering great cormorants and seasonal changes in stored water volume to test the relative influence of abiotic and biotic factors on otter foraging ecology. DNA metabarcoding of otter spraints revealed a dietary change from autumn to winter. Otters had a diet dominated by the exotic goldfish in autumn, but predated intensively on the native northern straight-mouth nase in winter. This change was likely caused by predation of cormorants on goldfish and to fish biology. Secondly, macroscopic analysis of spraints revealed that otters shifted from a diet dominated by fish (in terms of biomass) to a diet dominated by red swamp crayfish during spring-summer, when the latter became overabundant. As revealed by modelling, this second shift was most likely influenced by the sudden increase in stored water volume in spring, but also by the cumulative effect of cormorant predation on fish during autumn-winter. Macroscopic analyses of otter spraints collected in a second reservoir with no cormorants revealed a lack of seasonality. Hence, the combined influence of both biotic and abiotic factors explained otter diet seasonality in a lentic-water novel ecosystem.","[Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro; Veloy, Carlos; Amboage, Moraima; Guitian-Caamano, Amanda; Vila, Marta] Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Campus Zapateira, La Coruna 15008, Spain; [Mari-Mena, Neus; Vizcaino, Anton; Vierna, Joaquin] AllGenet & Biol SL, Edificio CICA,Campus Elvina, La Coruna 15008, Spain; [Key, Charlie] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales","Vila, M (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Campus Zapateira, La Coruna 15008, Spain.",mvila@udc.es,"Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/G-4522-2016; Vila, Marta/F-6118-2016","Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/0000-0001-8009-4331; Vila, Marta/0000-0002-8803-9174","Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission [GRC2014/050, ED431C 2018/57]; Universidade da Coruna","Fish samples to be used as positive controls for molecular analysis were kindly provided by Carlos Antunes, except for O. mykiss and Atlantic salmon S. salar that were purchased at a local fish market.

Understanding these interactions is thus essential for correctly predicting species' responses to climate change. We focussed on an avian forest guild of four hole-nesting species with differing sensitivities to climate that show a range of well-understood reciprocal interactions, including facilitation, competition and predation. We modelled the potential distributions of black woodpecker and boreal, tawny and Ural owl, and tested whether the spatial patterns of the more widespread species (excluding Ural owl) were shaped by interspecific interactions. We then modelled the potential future distributions of all four species, evaluating how the predicted changes will alter the overlap between the species' ranges, and hence the spatial outcomes of interactions. Forest cover/type and climate were important determinants of habitat suitability for all species. Field data analysed with N-mixture models revealed effects of interspecific interactions on current species abundance, especially in boreal owl (positive effects of black woodpecker, negative effects of tawny owl). Climate change will impact the assemblage both at species and guild levels, as the potential area of range overlap, relevant for species interactions, will change in both proportion and extent in the future. Boreal owl, the most climate-sensitive species in the guild, will retreat, and the range overlap with its main predator, tawny owl, will increase in the remaining suitable area: climate change will thus impact on boreal owl both directly and indirectly. Climate change will cause the geographical alteration or disruption of species interaction networks, with different consequences for the species belonging to the guild and a likely spatial increase of competition and/or intraguild predation. Our work shows significant interactions and important potential changes in the overlap of areas suitable for the interacting species, which reinforce the importance of including relevant biotic interactions in predictive climate change models for increasing forecast accuracy.","[Brambilla, Mattia; Scridel, Davide; Iemma, Aaron; Pedrini, Paolo; Assandri, Giacomo] Museo Sci, Sez Zool Vertebrati, Trento, Italy; [Brambilla, Mattia; Bazzi, Gaia; Ilahiane, Luca] Fdn Lombardia Ambiente, Settore Biodiversita & Aree Protette, Seveso, MB, Italy; [Scridel, Davide; Bogliani, Giuseppe; Assandri, Giacomo] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Terra & Ambiente, Pavia, Italy; [Bassi, Enrico] Parco Nazl Stelvio, Bormio, SO, Italy; [Bionda, Radames] Parco Nat Alpe Veglia & Devero Alta Valle Antrona, Varzo, Italy; [Genero, Fulvio] Riserva Nat Reg Lago Cornino, Cornino, UD, Italy; [Teufelbauer, Norbert] BirdLife Austria, Vienna, Austria; [Vrezec, Al] Natl Inst Biol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kmecl, Primoz; Mihelic, Tomaz] DOPPS BirdLife Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Schmid, Hans] Schweiz Vogelwarte, Sempach, Switzerland; [Pontarini, Renato] Progetto Lince Italia, Tarvisio, UD, Italy; [Braunisch, Veronika; Arlettaz, Raphael] Univ Bern, Div Conservat Biol, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Bern, Switzerland; [Chamberlain, Dan] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Biol Sistemi, Turin, Italy","Brambilla, M (corresponding author), Museo Sci, Sez Zool Vertebrati, Trento, Italy.",brambilla.mattia@gmail.com,"Scridel, Davide/Q-9430-2019; Assandri, Giacomo/H-6962-2019; Bazzi, Gaia/AAP-9154-2020; Braunisch, Veronika/AAH-8260-2020; Chamberlain, Dan/K-1809-2015","Scridel, Davide/0000-0003-3849-1178; Assandri, Giacomo/0000-0001-5161-5353; Braunisch, Veronika/0000-0001-7035-4662; Brambilla, Mattia/0000-0002-7643-4652; Chamberlain, Dan/0000-0002-5381-2024; BAZZI, GAIA/0000-0002-7220-6054",RDP Trento province; Parco Naturale Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino; Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P1-0255],"RDP Trento province; Parco Naturale Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino; Slovenian Research Agency, Grant/Award Number: P1-0255",,94,7,8,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In tropical rain forests, environmental conditions including resource availability vary over a vertical gradient. Consequently, nitrogen is predicted to become more limiting than carbohydrates toward the canopy as food webs shift to become more reliant on plant-based resources. We used a bait-choice experiment in a tropical rain forest to examine differences in protein and carbohydrate use with height and determined whether there were differences in response between common (numerically dominant) and rare species. Additionally, we investigated the nutrient use at the species level. Using species co-occurrence analysis, we examined interspecific competition by testing the co-occurrence of ant species at the tree level. Over the 12 trees investigated, 124 morphospecies were identified with eight species comprising 90% of total ant abundance. Species richness and protein use increased with height of bait for all species pooled and for common species but not rare species. Correspondingly, relative carbohydrate use decreased with height. We found greater species richness of rare species on carbohydrate baits compared with protein baits. Ant species were randomly distributed among trees when all species were included in co-occurrence analysis. However, when only common species were considered, segregation between species was evident among trees providing evidence for the presence of ant mosaics. Our results suggest that nitrogen limitation in the canopy may not be true for the whole ant assemblage but rather for the few common species.","[Law, Stephanie J.; Parr, Catherine] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Parr, Catherine] Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Pretoria, South Africa; [Parr, Catherine] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa","Law, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",stephaniejanelaw@gmail.com,,"Law, Stephanie Jane/0000-0002-8362-4702; Parr, Catherine/0000-0003-1627-763X",UK NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L000016/1]; South-East Asian Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP); University of Liverpool,"This publication is a contribution from the UK NERC-funded Biodiversity and Land-use Impacts on Tropical Ecosystem Function (BALI) consortium (http://bali.hmtf.info) (NERC grant no.

With a global population estimate of < 120,000, Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) is considered one of the Nearctic-Neotropical migrants at greatest risk of extinction. This range-restricted songbird breeds in high-elevation fir (Abies balsamea) forests of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, and primarily overwinters in forests of the Dominican Republic. The Conservation Action Plan for Bicknell's Thrush identifies numerous actions that may help stem population declines and promote recovery of the species, yet the empirical data needed to prioritize among these actions are lacking. We fit Cormack-Jolly-Seber models with mark-recapture data to test a series of hypotheses about the factors that limit apparent survival in 178 adult Bicknells Thrush (50 females and 128 males) captured on the breeding grounds in Vermont (June-July, 2001-2015). We focused on putatively important factors from throughout their annual cycle: cyclical population dynamics of nest predators, and weather effects on food abundance on the breeding and wintering grounds. Apparent survival of Bicknell's Thrush was relatively stable (mean Phi = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.68) over our 15-year study, and most strongly associated with fir mast production. Apparent survival was higher following years during which fir trees produced large mast crops (mean Phi = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.79), compared to following nonmast years (Phi = 0.56 +/- 0.06, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.68). These results are likely driven by the reduced red squirrel density and increased nesting success and site fidelity of adult thrushes following nonmast years. Apparent survival of Bicknell's Thrush was also associated with relatively wet conditions on the wintering grounds in Hispaniola as assessed via the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) precipitation index (ESPI). These relatively wet December-March periods are likely linked to greater primary productivity and the local availability of fruits and arthropods consumed by Bicknell's Thrush. Our research provides the most comprehensive examination of potentially limiting factors on Bicknell's Thrush populations to date and suggests future avenues of research exploring the relationship between food availability, survival, and climate change induced reductions in rainfall for the Greater Antilles.","[Hill, Jason M.; Lloyd, John D.; McFarland, Kent P.; Rimmer, Christopher C.] Vermont Ctr Ecostudies, White River Jct, VT USA","Hill, JM (corresponding author), POB 420, Norwich, VT 05055 USA.",jhill@vtecostudies.org,,,ESRI Conservation GIS Program; Thomas Marshall Foundation; USDA Forest Service Northeast Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Forest Ecosystem Monitoring Cooperative; Vermont Institute of Natural Science,"We extend sincere thanks to the many banders and net checkers who assisted us on Mt.

If the conditions in that habitat are highly variable, core microbes may also be considered to be ecological generalists. However, little is known about whether metabolic competition and microbial interactions influence the ability of some microbes to persist in the core micro-biome while others cannot. We investigated microbial communities at three sites in the guts of European seabass under four dietary conditions. We identified generalist core microbial populations in each gut site that are shared across fish, present under multiple diets and persistent over time. We found that core microbes tend to show synergistic growth in co-culture, and low levels of predicted and validated metabolic competition. Within core microbial species, we found high levels of intraspecific variability and strain-specific habitat specialization. Thus, both intraspecific variability and interspecific facilitation may contribute to the ecological stability of the animal core microbiome.","[Kokou, Fotini; Sasson, Goor; Eyal, Stav; Ovadia, Ofer; Mizrahi, Itzhak] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Marcus Family Campus, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Kokou, Fotini; Sasson, Goor; Eyal, Stav; Ovadia, Ofer; Mizrahi, Itzhak] Natl Inst Biotechnol Negev, Marcus Family Campus, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Kokou, Fotini; Harpaz, Sheenan; Cnaani, Avner] Agr Res Org, Dept Poultry & Aquaculture, Inst Anim Sci, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel; [Friedman, Jonathan] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Agr Food & Environm, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Rehovot, Israel","Mizrahi, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Marcus Family Campus, Beer Sheva, Israel.; Mizrahi, I (corresponding author), Natl Inst Biotechnol Negev, Marcus Family Campus, Beer Sheva, Israel.",imizrahi@bgu.ac.il,,"Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947; Kokou, Fotini/0000-0002-3675-3835; Friedman, Jonathan/0000-0001-8476-8030",European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [640384]; Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1947/19]; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development [356-0665-14],"The research described here was supported by grants from the European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant no. 640384), the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 1947/19) and the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (grant no. 356-0665-14).",,61,27,28,14,66,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2058-5276,,,NAT MICROBIOL,NAT.
