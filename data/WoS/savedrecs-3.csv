This paradigm was formulated based on wire mesh cage exclusion experiments, which have well-known artifacts such as altering hydrodynamics and excluding non-target, but potentially important, consumer species. Recent research highlights the potential importance of multiple consumers that are often subtle and transient, as well as the modifications of consumer pressure by spatial and temporal environmental variability and bottom-up processes. Manipulative experiments that target individual taxa will be essential to more clearly identify their roles in complex ecological communities. The predatory gastropod Nucella lapillus has long been considered an important consumer controlling the structure and dynamics of intertidal communities in the Gulf of Maine. To test the role of N. lapillus in shaping community structure, we manually reduced its densities for 2.33 years. Species composition, stable stage community composition (based on a Markov model), and transition probabilities (as measures of ecological pathway strength) were compared between treatments (control vs. density reductions), and among seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter). In contrast to previous studies, exclusions had no effect on community composition or long-term Markov model predictions of stable stage community structure. Reducing N. lapillus abundance increased the persistence and reduced the mortality of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides in the model, but did not affect blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, in a similar way. Reducing N. lapillus abundance had additional indirect effects of increasing Ralfsia spp. mortality and increasing hydroid persistence. Despite differences in transition probabilities among treatments, compensatory changes in direct and indirect pathways led to communities that converged over the long-term. Our results contrast previous estimates of the role of N. lapillus in intertidal communities and might reflect low mussel recruitment, predation by alternate consumers (e.g., C. maenas, C. borealis, Tautogolabrus adspersus, birds), or spatial and/or temporal environmental variation that influenced the role of N. lapillus in structuring these communities. The role of N. lapillus may be more limited, or variable, than often assumed in the Gulf of Maine, and the methods manipulating broad functional groups such as consumers, though useful in developing basic conceptual models, blur the effects of individual species in community assembly and dynamics.","[Morello, Scott L.; Etter, Ron J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Morello, Scott L.] Downeast Inst, POB 83, Beals, ME 04611 USA","Morello, SL (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",Scott.Morello@umb.edu; ron.etter@umb.edu,,,University of Massachusetts Boston Research Trust Funds; Nancy Goranson Endowment Fund; Herbert Lipke Memorial Endowment Fund; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE - 1334022],"Funding was provided by University of Massachusetts Boston Research Trust Funds, the Nancy Goranson Endowment Fund, and the Herbert Lipke Memorial Endowment Fund.

The impact of waders Charadrii on mud-dwelling invertebrates in central Europe was studied by comparing the rates of prey change over 13 days in 10 exclosures and control sites. 2. The most common invertebrates in the mud were chironomid larvae, which accounted for 90.5% of all invertebrates. Chironomid larval density in the exclosures averaging 11075 individuals m-2, which is comparable to the high densities of Corophium volutator Pallas (9687 ind. m-2) found in a British estuary (Goss-Custard 1977a). 3. Ten species of waders, black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus L. and mallards Anas platyrhynchos L. either fed or roosted in the study sites during the experiment. However, the most numerous birds were black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa L. spotted redshanks Tringa erythropus Pallas and ruffs Philomachus pugnax L., which comprised 39.5%, 33.6%, 25.1% of the total counted, respectively. 4. At the end of the experiment, the invertebrate density was significantly lower in the control sites (1594 ind. m-2) compared with exclosures (11938 ind. m-2) . Thus birds, particularly black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and ruffs, removed 86.6% of the prey stock. Prey biomass was also significantly lower in the control (1.3 g m-2) than in the exclosures (9.5 g m-2). However, the mean length of the chironomid larvae was not significantly different between the control (7.87 mm) and exclosures (9.95 mm). 5. The impact of waders on the density of prey was also estimated from observations of the birds' feeding rates. The number of prey estimated to be taken daily by black-tailed godwit was 5765 prey m-2 for 13 days of the experiment while the estimates for spotted redshank and ruff were 1258 and 575 prey m-2 respectively. The total removed by black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and ruffs was therefore 7598 prey m-2. This compares with the 10344 ind. m-2 estimated to be removed by birds in the exclosure sites. The difference between the two methods is probably due to predation by other birds, such as other waders or ducks, and to the high variances of both estimates. 6. More small snails - Gyraulus sp. - were found in the control sites than in the exclosures, possibly because they were avoided by waders. 7. The total numbers of feeding birds, and the number of feeding black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and of ruffs declined during the experiment. The rate of food intake of black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and of ruffs also declined as the food stock was depleted. However, the number of roosting birds increased, although non-significantly, during the experiment.",,"SZEKELY, T (corresponding author), LAJOS KOSSUTH UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,H-4010 DEBRECEN,HUNGARY.",,"Szekely, Tamas/I-7089-2016","Szekely, Tamas/0000-0003-2093-0056",,,,29,49,49,0,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We used observational and experimental field studies together with an individual-based simulation model to demonstrate that behaviours of mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) were broadly consistent with the expectations of Giving-Up Density theory and an Ideal Pre-emptive Distribution habitat selection model. 2. Specifically we found that: (i) adult mottled sculpin established territories within patches characterised by significantly higher prey densities and prey renewal rates than patches occupied by juveniles or randomly selected patches; (ii) patches abandoned by adult sculpin possessed significantly lower prey densities than newly occupied patches, although this was not true for juveniles; (iii) the observed giving-up density (GUD) for adult sculpin (i.e. average prey density in patches recently abandoned) increased linearly with increasing fish size up to the average prey density measured in randomly selected patches (i.e. 350 prey items per 0.1 m(2)) and decreased with increasing sculpin density and (iv) juveniles rapidly shifted their distribution towards the highest quality patches following removal of competitively dominant adult sculpin. 3. These results provide the first evidence of the applicability of GUD theory to a stream-dwelling organism, and they elucidate the underlying factors influencing juvenile and adult sculpin habitat selection and movement behaviours. Furthermore, optimal patch use, ideal pre-emptive habitat selection and juvenile 'floating' provide behavioural mechanisms linking environmental heterogeneity in the stream benthos to density-dependent regulation of mottled sculpin populations in this system.","[Petty, J.

In the presence of Chaoborus, total rotifer abundance increased, while total cladoceran abundance decreased. Patterns of migratory behavior varied among rotifer species. Kellicottia longispina and Polyarthra sp. showed vertical migration, while K. cochlearis did not. Kellicottia longispina mean depth was deeper during the day than during the night. The presence of Chaoborus had no significant effect on its vertical distribution. Polyarthra mean depth was significantly shallower during the day than during the night, but a marginally significant interaction suggests that day-night differences occurred only in the absence of Chaoborus. No vertical migration was observed in any Daphnia species in the absence of Chaoborus. D. pulicaria mean depth was significantly shallower in the presence of Chaoborus, and a marginally significant Chaoborusxtime interaction suggests that D. pulicaria migrate upward during the night. The spatial overlap of K. longispina with each Daphnia species was not affected by Chaoborus. Keratella cochlearis was spatially segregated from D. pulicaria in the absence of Chaoborus, but the spatial overlap between these two species significantly increased in the Chaoborus treatment. Spatial segregation occurred between Polyarthra and D. pulicaria in absence of Chaoborus, however a significant Chaoborusxtime interaction indicated that the spatial segregation occurred only during the day. These results suggest that Chaoborus could have complex indirect effects on rotifer-Daphnia interactions. Rotifer populations could be released from competition due to Chaoborus predation on Daphnia. Chaoborus presence, however, could intensify rotifer-Daphnia competitive interactions by increasing their spatial overlap.","Wright State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA","Gonzalez, MJ (corresponding author), Wright State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.",maria.gonzalez@wright.edu,,,,,,54,14,15,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,,1998,387,,,,,,427,436,,10.1023/A:1017050812730,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,195DR,WOS:000080234300057,,,,,2021-09-27,

With DMAC, natural and anthropogenic disturbances that increase the abundance of deciduous-browsing cervids (e.g., moose [Alces alces], deer [Odocoileus spp.]) are thought to promote predator (especially wolf [Canis lupus]) numbers, which heightens predation risk to caribou. We know most about the effects of DMAC on caribou where the species is under threat by anthropogenic activities in relatively productive southern boreal and mountain systems. Yet, >60% of extant boreal caribou range in North America consists of northern shield and taiga ecoregions of low productivity where caribou may compete with only 1 ungulate species (moose) in the context of DMAC. In this environment, we know very little of how DMAC acts as a limiting factor to caribou. In Saskatchewan, Canada, from 2014-2018, using a combination of vegetation sampling, aerial surveys, and telemetry data (n = 38 wolves), we searched for evidence of DMAC (trends in data consistent with the hypothesis) in an 87,193-km(2) section of the Western Boreal Shield, a poorly productive but pristine region (0.18% of land cover classed as an anthropogenic feature) with a historically high fire-return interval (47% of stands aged <40 years). Despite the high levels of disturbance, moose density was relatively low (47 moose/1,000 km(2)), likely because of the scarcity of deciduous or mixed-wood stands and low abundance of deciduous browse in the young conifer stands that dominated the landscape. In contrast, boreal caribou density was relatively high for the species (37 caribou/1,000 km(2)). Wolf density (3.1 wolves/1,000 km(2)) and pack sizes (x over bar = 4.0 wolves/pack) were low and resident (established) territories were large (x over bar = 4,360 km(2); 100% minimum convex polygon). The low density of wolves mirrored the low (standardized) ungulate biomass index (UBI; moose + boreal caribou) of the study area (0.36 UBI/km(2)). We conclude that wolf and hence caribou populations were not responding in accordance with the outcomes generally predicted by DMAC in our study area because the requisite strong, positive response to fire of deciduous-browse and alternate-prey abundance was lacking. As a limiting factor to caribou, DMAC is likely modulated at a macroecological scale by factors such as net primary productivity, a corollary to the general hypothesis that we advance here (i.e., primary productivity hypothesis of DMAC). We caution against managing for caribou based on the presumption of DMAC where the mechanism does not apply, which may include much of boreal caribou range in the north.

Theory posits that at mean fecundity, recruitment of highly fecund small-seeded plants should be primarily microsite limited, which is indicated by a saturating recruitment function. In contrast, species that produce fewer large seeds are more likely to be seed-limited, which is characterized by a linear recruitment function. If these patterns hold in nature, seed predation that disproportionately affects larger-seeded species can limit their establishment. We tested these predictions by comparing recruitment functions among 16 co-occurring perennial forb species that vary by over two orders of magnitude in seed size. We also assessed how postdispersal seed predation by mice influenced recruitment. We added seeds at densities from zero to three times natural fecundity of each species to undisturbed plots and examined spatial variation in recruitment by conducting experiments across 10 grassland sites that varied in productivity and resource availability. Consistent across two replicated years, most species had linear recruitment functions across the range of added seed densities, indicative of seed-limited recruitment. Depending on year, the recruitment functions of only 19-37% of target species saturated near their average fecundity, and this was not associated with seed size. Recruitment was strongly inhibited by rodent seed predation for large-seeded species but not for smaller-seeded species. Proportional recruitment was more sensitive to spatial variation in recruitment conditions across sites for some small-seeded species than for large-seeded species. These results contradict the common belief that highly fecund small-seeded species suffer from microsite-limited recruitment. Rather, they imply that, at least episodically, recruitment can be strongly correlated to plant fecundity. However, proportional recruitment of small-seeded species was inhibited at productive sites to a greater extent than large-seeded species. Results also show that in a system where the dominant granivore prefers larger seeds, low-fecundity large-seeded species can suffer from even greater seed-limited recruitment than would occur in the absence of predators.","[Maron, John L.; Hajek, Karyn L.; Hahn, Philip G.; Pearson, Dean E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, ARS, Missoula, MT 59801 USA","Maron, JL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,"Hahn, Philip/0000-0001-9717-9489",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518],"We gratefully acknowledge the field assistance we received from J.

Acomys cahirinus is nocturnal and A. russatus is diurnal. although it becomes nocturnal if its congener is experimentally removed, suggesting that the temporal partitioning is driven by interspecific competition. Such extreme temporal partitioning within the diel cycle has not previously been recorded elsewhere among mammals. Using artificial food patches. we studied microhabitat use and foraging efficiencies under seasonally variable predator regimes and physiological pressures to assess the roles that habitat structure and foraging behavior might play in coexistence. The two species showed trade-offs in foraging efficiency leading to different strategies of microhabitat use that may help promote coexistence. A. cahirinus is a cream skimmer, a relatively inefficient forager that gives up at relatively high giving-up densities, and a habitat generalist: whereas A. russatus is a habitat specialist, perhaps compensating for this restricted niche by foraging very efficiently to low giving-up densities. Seasonal shifts in foraging microhabitat suggest that the response to predation risk from snakes in summer overrides and opposes the effects of physiological costs and risk from owls and diurnal raptors, leading to increased predatory risk and foraging microhabitat overlap in summer. Temporal partitioning of the food resource may compensate for decreased partitioning of the habitat resource in summer. Provision of cover was more important than escape distance in determining habitat and microhabitat use. Boulder fields in rocky deserts provide a physical structure that is more complex and provides more continuous cover than is available in open deserts, where most research on community structure of desert rodents has been carried out. We propose that this physical structure of rocky deserts, in conjunction with the desert adaptations of A. russatus, may enable the extreme temporal partitioning to opposite parts of the diel cycle and, therefore, contributes to coexistence in this community.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Jones, M (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Div Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Jones, Menna E/J-7975-2012","Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022",,,,70,84,88,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2001,82,8,,,,,2164,2176,,10.2307/2680223,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,462ZP,WOS:000170452600006,,,,,2021-09-27,

The African large predator guild represents one of the few remaining functionally intact large predator assemblages on Earth, and as such, represents a unique study system to understand competitive interactions. Yet, relatively little is known of the coexistence mechanisms between some of its intermediately sized members, particularly leopards (Panthera pardus). Here, we use overlapping spatio-temporal activity and GPS data on lions (Panthera leo), leopards, African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) to examine spatial interactions and temporal partitioning between leopards and other guild members in northern Botswana. We found that at the population level, male leopard space use and activity patterns were largely unaffected by intraguild competitors. Leopards showed minimal movement coherence with competitors (avoidance or attraction) when moving through areas of home ranges shared with intraguild species. Moreover, we found evidence to support the hypothesis that guild species' activity patterns are primarily driven by light availability rather than predator avoidance. Our results suggest predator avoidance has a limited impact on broad-scale leopard spatio-temporal niches, with aspects of the leopards' ecology and life history likely facilitating its ability to thrive in close proximity to competitors. Considered alongside other studies, our results suggest that landscape-level approaches to conservation may be suitable for aiding leopard conservation.","[Rafiq, K.; Meloro, C.; Wich, S.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in amphibian skin are an important innate immune defense against fungal, viral and bacterial pathogens. Their release is tightly coupled with release of the stress hormone noradrenaline (norepinephrine). During metamorphosis, AMPs may constitute the primary immune response in the skin of some species because acquired immune functions are temporarily suppressed in order to prevent autoimmunity against new adult antigens. Suppression of AMPs during this transitional stage may impact disease rates. We exposed leopard frog tadpoles (Lithobates pipiens) to a factorial combination of competitor and caged-predator environments and measured their development, growth and production of hydrophobic skin peptides after metamorphosis. In the absence of predator cues, or if the exposure to predator cues was late in ontogeny, competition caused more than a 250% increase in mass-standardized hydrophobic skin peptides. Predator cues caused a decrease in mass-standardized hydrophobic skin peptides when the exposure was late in ontogeny under low competition, but otherwise had no effect. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of the skin peptides showed that they include six AMPs in the brevinin and temporin families and at least three of these peptides are previously uncharacterized. Both of these peptide families have previously been shown to inhibit harmful microbes including Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the fungal pathogen associated with global amphibian declines. Our study shows that amphibians may be able to adjust their skin peptide defenses in response to stressors that are experienced early in ontogeny and that these effects extend through an important life-history transition.","[Groner, Maya L.] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Atlantic Vet Coll, Dept Hlth Management, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada; [Rollins-Smith, Louise A.; Reinert, Laura K.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Rollins-Smith, Louise A.; Reinert, Laura K.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Rollins-Smith, Louise A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Hempel, John; Relyea, Rick A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Bier, Mark E.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, Ctr Mol Anal, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Groner, ML (corresponding author), Univ Prince Edward Isl, Atlantic Vet Coll, Dept Hlth Management, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada.",mgroner@upei.ca,"Groner, Maya L/J-4261-2014","Groner, Maya L/0000-0002-3381-6415","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0843207, 1121758, 0518250, 9808188, 9729351]","Funding for M.

Whereas laboratory studies with leaf litter of this species have found detrimental effects on detritivorous species, field studies did not support a strong negative effect. Hence, we compared taxon richness, density and biomass of macroinvertebrate assemblages inhabiting streams flowing through eucalypt plantations with those flowing through native oak forest. Moreover, we compared traits of leaf eating macroinvertebrates (shredders) between the two types of streams. Streams flowing through eucalypt plantations had lower taxon richness, density and biomass of total invertebrates (and particularly of shredders) compared to those flowing through native forests. Large shredder taxa, such as Echinogammarus spp. & Limnephilidae, showed a significant negative response (in terms of abundance and biomass) to eucalypt cover whereas smaller taxa displayed similar distribution patterns in both habitat types. The grazer Habroleptoides sp. was the only taxon displaying higher densities in eucalypt sites, which might be explained by the reduction of competition/predation by other large shredders. Shredders at eucalypt sites showed the following traits: small maximum body size, short life cycles, few reproduction cycles per year, active dispersal, and ability to feed on food of lower quality. The shredder assemblages in the eucalypt sites shared similarities with those typical of locations where production is limited due to acidity or oligotrophy of the waters. One stream drained both native and eucalypt forest, but the density and biomass of shredders in the eucalypt (downstream) site was very similar to those found in native streams. This result supports the idea that transport of native organic matter from upstream parts of the basin can maintain native invertebrate assemblages in downstream parts where the land use has been changed.","[Larranaga, A.; Basaguren, A.; Elosegi, A.; Pozo, J.] Univ Basque Country, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Lab Stream Ecol, Bilbao 48080, Spain","Larranaga, A (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Lab Stream Ecol, POB 644, Bilbao 48080, Spain.",aitor.larranagaa@ehu.es,"Larranaga, Aitor/A-6185-2009; Elosegi, Arturo/B-7796-2009; Basaguren, Ana/AAD-3732-2019; Pozo, Jesus/B-4719-2013; Basaguren, Ana/K-8435-2014","Elosegi, Arturo/0000-0001-8809-8484; Basaguren, Ana/0000-0001-9691-2554; Pozo, Jesus/0000-0003-3104-5423; Basaguren, Ana/0000-0002-2790-7388; LARRANAGA ARRIZABALAGA, AITOR/0000-0002-0185-9154",The European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [EVK1-CT-2001-00088]; The Ministry of Education and Culture of the Government,The European Commission financed the RivFunction project (EVK1-CT-2001-00088) from which the data of this paper were obtained.

Results indicated that mixed assemblages of seven distinct genotypes (representing clonal lineages of D. pulex, D. pulicaria and interspecific hybrids) showed rapid loss of genetic diversity in all treatments (2 x 2 factorial design, high vs. low quantity, and high vs. low quality). However, the erosion of diversity (measured as the effective number of clones) was slowest under the poorest food conditions (i.e., low quantity, low quality) and by the conclusion of the experiment (90 days) had resulted in the (low, low) treatment having significantly greater genetic diversity than the other three treatments. In addition, significant genotype (clone) x (food) environment interactions were observed, with a different predominant species/clone found under low food quality versus high food quality (no significant differences were detected for the two food quantities). A clone of D. pulex displaced the other clones under low food quality conditions, while a clone of D. pulicaria displaced the other clones in the high food quality treatments. Subsequent life-history experiments were not sufficient to predict the outcome of competitive interactions among members of this clonal assemblage. Our results suggest that genetic diversity among herbivore species such as Daphnia may be impacted not only by differences in food quantity but also by those in food quality and could be important in the overall maintenance of genetic diversity in natural populations.","[Weider, Lawrence J.; Jeyasingh, Punidan D.; Looper, Karen G.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Grad Program EEB, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Weider, Lawrence J.; Jeyasingh, Punidan D.; Looper, Karen G.] Univ Oklahoma, Biol Stn, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Weider, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Grad Program EEB, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",ljweider@ou.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [9977047],This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (U.S. Grant no. 9977047).

Although a concise definition of grasslands cannot be given using a physiognomic or structural approach, grasslands can be described as vegetation communities experiencing periodical droughts and with canopies dominated by grasses and grass-like plants. Grasslands have a cosmopolitan distribution except for the Antarctic region. Fungal interactions with grasses can be pathogenic or symbiotic. Herbivorous mammals, insects, other grassland animals, and fungal pathogens are known to play important roles in maintaining the biomass and biodiversity of grasslands. Although most pathogenicity studies on the members of Poaceae have been focused on economically important crops, the plant-fungal pathogenic interactions involved can extend to the full range of ecological circumstances that exist in nature. Hence, it is important to delineate the fungal pathogen communities and their interactions in man-made monoculture systems and highly diverse natural ecosystems. A better understanding of the key fungal players can be achieved by combining modern techniques such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) together with studies involving classic phytopathology, taxonomy, and phylogeny. It is of utmost importance to develop experimental designs that account for the ecological complexity of the relationships between grasses and fungi, both above and below ground. In grasslands, loss in species diversity increases interactions such as herbivory, mutualism, predation or infectious disease transmission. Host species density and the presence of heterospecific host species, also affect the disease dynamics in grasslands. Many studies have shown that lower species diversity increases the severity as well as the transmission rate of fungal diseases. Moreover, communities that were once highly diverse but have experienced decreased species richness and dominancy have also shown higher pathogenicity load due to the relaxed competition, although this effect is lower in natural communities. This review addresses the taxonomy, phylogeny, and ecology of grassland fungal pathogens and their interactions in grassland ecosystems.","[Karunarathna, Anuruddha; Tibpromma, Saowaluck; Xu, Jianchu; Karunarathna, Samantha C.] Kunming Inst Bot, Ctr Mt Futures, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Karunarathna, Anuruddha] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Karunarathna, Anuruddha; Jayawardena, Ruvishika S.] Mae Fah Luang Univ, Ctr Excellence Fungal Res, Chiang Rai, Thailand; [Tibpromma, Saowaluck; Xu, Jianchu; Karunarathna, Samantha C.] World Agroforestry ICRAF, CIFOR ICRAF China Program, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Jayawardena, Ruvishika S.] Mae Fah Luang Univ, Sch Sci, Chiang Rai, Thailand; [Nanayakkara, Chandrika] Univ Colombo, Dept Plant Sci, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Asad, Suhail] Yunnan Agr Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bio Resources, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Hyde, Kevin D.; Stephenson, Steven L.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Lumyong, Saisamorn; Kumla, Jaturong] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Sci, Res Ctr Microbial Div & Sustainable Utilizat, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Lumyong, Saisamorn; Kumla, Jaturong] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Lumyong, Saisamorn] Royal Soc Thailand, Acad Sci, Bangkok, Thailand","Karunarathna, SC (corresponding author), Kunming Inst Bot, Ctr Mt Futures, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Karunarathna, SC (corresponding author), World Agroforestry ICRAF, CIFOR ICRAF China Program, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",samanthakarunarathna@gmail.com,"Tibpromma, Saowaluck/AAY-9436-2021",,"International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program [Y9180822S1]; CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) [2020PC0009]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31850410488, 31851110759]; Yunnan Human Resources, and Security Department Foundation; Thailand Research FundsThailand Research Fund (TRF) [RDG6130001]; Chiang Mai University;  [2020FYC0002]","International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program(number Y9180822S1), CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) number 2020PC0009 and young staff under the grant number: 2020FYC0002, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under the project codes 31850410488 and 31851110759, the Yunnan Human Resources, and Security Department Foundation and Thailand Research Funds for the grant Impact of climate change on fungal diversity and biogeography in the Greater Mekong Subregion (RDG6130001) are thanked for funding.

The relative abundances of small crustaceans were compared between two sites at the same tidal height on concrete structures where the species composition of sessile organisms was different. In addition, the species composition of small crustaceans was studied as a function of three experimental substrates. Finally, by manipulating settlement plates, the influences of some environmental factors on the sessile organisms as well as on species interactions were studied. The field investigation and experiment showed that the secondary substrate created by sessile organisms caused the spatial and temporal changes in the most abundant species of small crustaceans. Moreover, some environmental factors and earlier colonists have inhibitory and/or facilitative effects on the colonizations of barnacles and oysters which produced site differences of secondary substrate. In addition, oyster growth over barnacles indicated the competitive superiority of the oyster over barnacles after their colonization. These results indicate that the secondary substrate, especially its physical structure, is an important factor which directly determines the species composition of associated small crustaceans. Environmental factors and interactions among sessile species have an indirect effect on species composition of small crustaceans, because they produce changes in the secondary substrate.","TOHOKU UNIV,FAC SCI,INST BIOL,SENDAI,MIYAGI 980,JAPAN",,,"Matsumasa, Masatoshi/Q-6052-2019",,,,,31,11,11,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Competition and predation are important components of biotic resistance, which helps define the invasibility of an ecosystem. 2. To search for evidence of biotic resistance to the European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio Fabricius, in North America, cages were used to experimentally exclude the community of associates (natural enemies and competitors) from infested logs. Specifically, the study assessed S. noctilio brood production in pine forests in Ontario and New York, where there was a rich existing community of associates (other wood borers, bark beetles and associated fungi, and parasitoids), and in South Africa, where siricid wasps and pines are not native and a similar associate community is not present. In addition, in Ontario, associates were excluded by size, and for different periods of time to identify important associates and their temporal dynamics. 3. Evidence was found that biotic factors limit S. noctilio in North America, whereby exclusion of natural enemies and competitors had a positive influence on the abundance or presence of S. noctilio brood in Ontario and New York.

Although a concise definition of grasslands cannot be given using a physiognomic or structural approach, grasslands can be described as vegetation communities experiencing periodical droughts and with canopies dominated by grasses and grass-like plants. Grasslands have a cosmopolitan distribution except for the Antarctic region. Fungal interactions with grasses can be pathogenic or symbiotic. Herbivorous mammals, insects, other grassland animals, and fungal pathogens are known to play important roles in maintaining the biomass and biodiversity of grasslands. Although most pathogenicity studies on the members of Poaceae have been focused on economically important crops, the plant-fungal pathogenic interactions involved can extend to the full range of ecological circumstances that exist in nature. Hence, it is important to delineate the fungal pathogen communities and their interactions in man-made monoculture systems and highly diverse natural ecosystems. A better understanding of the key fungal players can be achieved by combining modern techniques such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) together with studies involving classic phytopathology, taxonomy, and phylogeny. It is of utmost importance to develop experimental designs that account for the ecological complexity of the relationships between grasses and fungi, both above and below ground. In grasslands, loss in species diversity increases interactions such as herbivory, mutualism, predation or infectious disease transmission. Host species density and the presence of heterospecific host species, also affect the disease dynamics in grasslands. Many studies have shown that lower species diversity increases the severity as well as the transmission rate of fungal diseases. Moreover, communities that were once highly diverse but have experienced decreased species richness and dominancy have also shown higher pathogenicity load due to the relaxed competition, although this effect is lower in natural communities. This review addresses the taxonomy, phylogeny, and ecology of grassland fungal pathogens and their interactions in grassland ecosystems.","[Karunarathna, Anuruddha; Tibpromma, Saowaluck; Xu, Jianchu; Karunarathna, Samantha C.] Kunming Inst Bot, Ctr Mt Futures, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Karunarathna, Anuruddha] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Karunarathna, Anuruddha; Jayawardena, Ruvishika S.; Hyde, Kevin D.] Mae Fah Luang Univ, Ctr Excellence Fungal Res, Chiang Rai, Thailand; [Tibpromma, Saowaluck; Xu, Jianchu; Karunarathna, Samantha C.] World Agroforestry ICRAF, CIFOR ICRAF China Program, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Jayawardena, Ruvishika S.] Mae Fah Luang Univ, Sch Sci, Chiang Rai, Thailand; [Nanayakkara, Chandrika] Univ Colombo, Dept Plant Sci, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Asad, Suhail] Yunnan Agr Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bioresources Y, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Stephenson, Steven L.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Lumyong, Saisamorn; Kumla, Jaturong] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Sci, Res Ctr Microbial Divers & Sustainable Utilizat, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Lumyong, Saisamorn; Kumla, Jaturong] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Lumyong, Saisamorn] Royal Soc Thailand, Acad Sci, Bangkok, Thailand","Karunarathna, SC (corresponding author), Kunming Inst Bot, Ctr Mt Futures, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Karunarathna, SC (corresponding author), World Agroforestry ICRAF, CIFOR ICRAF China Program, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",samanthakarunarathna@gmail.com,"Tibpromma, Saowaluck/AAY-9436-2021",,"International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program [Y9180822S1]; CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) [2020PC0009, 2020FYC0002]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31850410488, 31851110759]; Yunnan Human Resources, and Security Department Foundation; Thailand Research FundsThailand Research Fund (TRF) [RDG6130001]; Chiang Mai University","International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program (number Y9180822S1), CAS President & rsquo;s International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) number 2020PC0009 and young staff under the grant number: 2020FYC0002, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under the project codes 31850410488 and 31851110759, the Yunnan Human Resources, and Security Department Foundation and Thailand Research Funds for the grant & ldquo;Impact of climate change on fungal diversity and biogeography in the Greater Mekong Subregion (RDG6130001)& rdquo;are thanked for funding.

Mice are numerically dominant at our study sites and were shown to be strong predators in other predator-prey interactions, such as those involving gypsy moths. Therefore, we hypothesized that removal of mice would result in decreased levels of nest predation relative to control treatments with a complete predator assemblage, but that the removal of chipmunks would not result in decreased nest predation. Both hypotheses were supported. Mice depredated > 60% of artificial nests in control plots (mouse populations intact), whereas chipmunks depreciated similar to 20%. Daily nest mortality rates in mouse removal treatments were less than half the rates in controls but were virtually identical between chipmunk removal and control treatments. Nonetheless, when we examined predation rates across plots in which the density of mice varied naturally, total daily mortality rates declined as the density of mice increased. This pattern occurred because mortality from non-mouse predators decreased as the density of mice increased and overwhelmed increasing mortality from mice to drive the overall dynamics of the system. Analysis of the relationships between the density of mice and predation rates by mice as a function of the abundance of natural food in their environment revealed probable reasons for these conflicting results. We suggest that high local densities of mice deplete resources for larger, non-mouse predators, which preferentially occupy areas of few mice and high local food abundance. In these areas, songbirds may be faced with higher overall nest predation dominated by non-mouse predators. Mice thus influence nest predation rates through both direct and indirect pathways.","Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Schmidt, KA (corresponding author), Williams Coll, Dept Biol, 56 Lab Campus Dr, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",,"Schauber, Eric/K-4043-2019","Schauber, Eric/0000-0002-0667-2604; Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301",,,,42,48,49,0,30,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2001,82,10,,,,,2927,2936,,10.2307/2679971,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,487FN,WOS:000171863100020,,,,,2021-09-27,

I tested predictions from the shelter bottleneck hypothesis, which proposes that shelter (or refuge) limitation can control population size structure and density by acting strongly on only one size class. I manipulated shelter for stone crabs in four haphazardly chosen bays in the northeast Gulf of Mexico to examine the shelter bottleneck hypothesis in a mixed-model design. I also examined four biotic factors (habitat structure, food, predation, and interspecific competition) that may contribute to population-level differences among bays. I found differences among bays in stone crab size structure and density and in crab responses to size-specific shelter supplementation. These differences in stone crabs among bays included: (1) natural median crab size differed by 5.5-fold, (2) size at maturity changed by 33%, (3) adult density varied 10-fold, (4) the density response of molting individuals and gravid females to supplemental shelter differed by more than 7-fold, and (5) the shelter preferred by crabs changed from 25 to 100 mm diameter pipes. The shelter bottleneck hypothesis and differences in habitat structure best account for these differences in stone crabs among bays. There appeared to be bottlenecks in three of the four bays, and the location of the bottleneck was predictable from measures of habitat structure. There were demographic consequences of shelter limitation on stone crab growth and fecundity at the individual level, and these effects appeared to explain population-level differences among bays. However, the bottleneck effects may be mediated by differences in food quantity and competition among bays. The experiments suggest that shelter bottlenecks have important effects on stone crabs across a wide region in the northeast Gulf of Mexico, and illustrate the benefits of using random factors in experimental designs to examine the generality of ecological effects.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA",,,"Beck, Michael W./AAB-2844-2019","Beck, Michael W./0000-0002-5107-9973",,,,107,59,59,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1997,78,8,,,,,2487,2503,,,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YK726,WOS:A1997YK72600017,,,,,2021-09-27,

The results were analysed by a suite of mathematical techniques, together with data on bacteria, fungi, nematodes, microarthropods, and the composition of forest litter and field layer, available from parallel research. The population levels ranged between 4.02 and 795 x 101, 28 and 1010, 35 and 1170 g(-1) litter dry wt for flagellates, ciliates and amoebae, respectively. Temporal changes in the microbiota appeared to be affected by progressive winter cooling followed by a spring increase in temperature, and influenced by habitat characteristics and a complex multivariate interplay among ecosystem components. The population abundance in winter (January-mid March) was higher than in spring (late March-April) for all protozoa. Amoebae showed minimum values in March, followed by considerable recovery in April. However, ciliate values dropped slightly between March and April, whilst flagellate values steadily decreased throughout the whole research period, suggesting that the spring growth of ciliates and flagellates might have been arrested by increased predation and/or competition. Statistical analysis revealed a number of significant relationships between the protozoa studied and other ecosystem components. These relationships were indicative of the conditions studied and may, therefore, be useful for future reference. The results highlighted the complexity of transient multivariate interactions of protobiota in forest litter, suggesting that any interpretations of the population dynamics must take account of a full range of both temporal and spatial factors.","Univ Abertay Dundee, Sch Sci & Engn, SIMBIOS, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland; Royal Bot Gardens, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; Scottish Crop Res Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland","Krivtsov, V (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Southampton SO17 1BS, Hants, England.",,"Krivtsov, Vladimir/G-7219-2015; Krivtsov, Vladimir/AAO-6018-2020; Griffiths, Bryan S/B-2998-2010","Krivtsov, Vladimir/0000-0003-0844-5007; Krivtsov, Vladimir/0000-0003-0844-5007; Griffiths, Bryan S/0000-0001-8721-4797",,,,55,9,12,0,12,URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"BRANCH OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, D-07705 JENA, GERMANY",0932-4739,,,EUR J PROTISTOL,Eur.

We assessed fish resource use at a naturally restoring marsh (Liberty Island, California, USA) by comparing diet composition, stomach fullness, normalized stomach weight, and diet overlap across a vegetation gradient. Fish were collected using gill nets and fyke nets at six sites during spring 2010, summer 2011 and winter 2012. We analyzed 392 stomachs from the eleven most abundant species collected. Prey composition and biomass varied seasonally for all fish species, but there were no notable differences across sites or seasons for stomach fullness or normalized stomach weight for most fish species. Results from non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and two-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) indicated minimal diet overlap between species (R = 0.633, p = 0.001) and seasons (R = 0.413, p = 0.001). Seasonal habitat and resource use across the vegetation gradient was species-specific. Small but significant spatial diet differences were detected for inland silverside, striped bass and bigscale logperch. Delta smelt exhibited seasonal diet differences by shifting from chironomids and zooplankton during spring, to amphipods and zooplankton during winter. More generally, fish maintained stomach fullness across all sites and seasons while maintaining minimal dietary overlap. Our study emphasizes the importance of tidal marshes as feeding habitat for several fish species, including the endangered delta smelt.","[Whitley, Sarah N.; Bollens, Stephen M.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA","Whitley, SN (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, 14204 NE Salmon Creek Ave, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA.",sarah.bayer@email.wsu.edu,,,U.

Six sites were selected to receive experimental units. Each site consisted of two 8-m2 plots. One plot at each site was inaccessible to fish predators, the other plot was freely accessible to fish. Fifty-four artificial substrates which simulated natural vegetation were placed in each plot to provide homogeneity in habitat structure and allow quantitative sampling of macrophyte-dwelling invertebrates. Total macroarthropod density in predator-exclusion plots exceeded densities in control plots on 10 of 12 dates examined, but this difference was significant on only 3 dates. Chironomids, the most abundant taxon in samples, were unaffected by predator manipulation. Abundances of two common species, Orthotrichia sp. (Trichoptera) and Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda), were generally enhanced by predator exclusion. Numerically minor taxa showed little or no response to the exclusion of fish. Overall, our study indicates that fish predation can reduce macroarthropod abundances, but this effect is not dramatic. Results of similar studies conducted in aquatic macroarthropod communities that have historically experienced fish predation support these findings. We suggest that experienced prey (i.e, those that naturally co-occur with fish) are likely to possess antipredator defense characteristics that greatly reduce susceptibility to predaceous fish. Therefore, removal of fish-induced mortality has a minor impact on prey survivorship.","UNIV TEXAS, DEPT BIOL, ARLINGTON, TX 76019 USA",,,,,,,,63,21,21,0,5,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Field data and simulation results suggested the coccinellid predator was the most important regulating agent of oleander scale in the mild climate of Albany. However, multiple linear regression analysis of simulation data across all ecological zones of California shows that the parasitoid A. chilensis is the most important agent in suppressing oleander scale densities in warmer climates, while the predator R. lophanthae increases scale density an average of 9.7% across all regions.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Nat Resources, Div Ecosyst Sci, Berkeley, CA 94706 USA; CASAS, Berkeley, CA 94707 USA; Inst Agron Parana, Londrina, PR, Brazil","Gutierrez, AP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Nat Resources, Div Ecosyst Sci, Berkeley, CA 94706 USA.",,,"Gutierrez, Andrew Paul/0000-0001-7773-1715",,,,49,6,6,0,12,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY BRASIL,"LONDRINA,","C POSTAL 481, 86001-970 LONDRINA,, PR, BRAZIL",1519-566X,,,NEOTROP ENTOMOL,Neotrop.

We have expanded on previous home-range studies by testing the effects of two previously ignored individual-level factors: androgenization and energy reserves (body fat). Location data were collected for wild individuals of Apodemus sylvaticus using the novel method of implanted PIT tags and mobile recording stations. A total of 68 home ranges were estimated using kernel density estimation. Home ranges were split into two regions (HRR): the core', representing the most intensively used areas, and periphery' regions. Body mass, body fat, sex, anogenital distance (AGD) (a proxy for androgenization) and the proportion of HRR, covered by antipredatory features (shrubs and fallen trees), were tested for their relationship with the size of core and periphery HRRs. Models were constructed for each HRR for three seasons: nonbreeding season (NBS), early and late breeding seasons (LBSs), to account for seasonal variation in behaviour associated with changes in food abundance and reproductive cycles. Body fat had a negative relationship with periphery size and an interaction with sex on core size in the early breeding season (EBS). Body mass also had a significant interaction with sex on core size in the EBS. Androgenization has a strong effect on home range size in both sexes: AGD had a positive relationship with both HRRs for males in the LBS and females in the NBS. Males had larger peripheries than females in both early and LBSs. Habitat features that reduce predation risk explain HRR size throughout the breeding period. This study emphasizes the importance of embracing natural complexity to gain insight into the drivers of space use behaviour; the consideration of individual and ecological factors, the recognition of the species-specific selective pressures that seasonal change presents for each sex and the identification of biologically meaningful home range areas will help advance the field.","[Godsall, Ben; Malo, Aurelio F.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Coulson, Tim; Malo, Aurelio F.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Malo, AF (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",aurelio.malo@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Coulson, Tim/AAL-8148-2021; Malo, Aurelio F/D-3973-2011; Malo, Aurelio F/X-8865-2019","Malo, Aurelio F/0000-0002-0846-2096; Malo, Aurelio F/0000-0002-0846-2096; Coulson, Tim/0000-0001-9371-9003","ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [249872]; Marie CurieEuropean Commission [PIEF-GA-2008-220322]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/K014218/1, NBAF010001] Funding Source: researchfish","The authors wish to thank C.

A gradient of consumer removal was maintained long enough to allow the abundances of both consumer and prey (phytoplankton) to equilibrate to the manipulation. Strong and unequivocal non-linearities were found in the effect of Daphnia on total phytoplankton abundance and the abundance of most of the common phytoplankton species. Daphnia's suppression of phytoplankton was strong between 0 and similar to400 mug Daphnia L-1 but essentially nil from similar to400 to 900 mug Daphnia L-1. The sharp deceleration in Daphnia's effect was not caused by a shift within the phytoplankton community toward consumption-resistant forms. The most likely explanation for the deceleration was a reduction in Daphnia's filtering effort at low phytoplankton abundance, that is, a Type III functional response. A review of experimental literature suggested that decelerating effects of consumers are the norm in aquatic systems. Nonlinear effects present problems for the estimation of interaction strength and the building of community interaction models from the results of predator manipulations. It is suggested that the role of field experiments in community ecology should be to test rather than to parameterize models.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Sarnelle, O (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",sarnelle@msu.edu,,,,,,115,28,28,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Globally, amphibians have suffered considerable losses, with a key driver being predation by large invasive invertebrate and vertebrate predators. However, there is no research regarding the potential ecological impact of small invertebrate invaders. The invasive freshwater amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus can act as a top predator capable of displacing native amphipods and preying heavily upon a range of native species. Listed as one of Europe's top 100 worst invaders, D. villosus has significantly restructured freshwater communities across western Europe and is expected to invade North America in the near future. Here we explore the ecological impact of invasive D. villosus upon UK native and invasive amphibians (Rana temporaria and Xenopus laevis respectively) using the Relative Impact Potential (RIP) metric. By combining estimations of per capita effects (i.e. functional response; FR) and relative field abundances, we apply the RIP metric to quantify the potential ecological impact of invasive D. villosus upon embryonic and larval amphibian prey, compared to the native amphipod Gammarus pulex. Both native and invasive amphipods consumed early-stage amphibians and exhibited potentially destabilising Type II FRs. However, larger body size in invasive D. villosus translated into a superior FR through significantly lower handling times and subsequently higher maximum feeding rates-up to seven times greater than native G. pulex. Higher invader abundance also drove elevated RIP scores for invasive D. villosus, with potential impact scores predicted up to 15.4 times greater than native G. pulex. Overall, D. villosus is predicted to have a greater predatory impact upon amphibian populations than G. pulex, due primarily to its larger body size and superior field abundance, potentially reducing amphibian recruitment within invaded regions.","[Warren, Daniel A.; Bradbeer, Stephanie J.; Dunn, Alison M.] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Warren, Daniel A.; Dunn, Alison M.] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Water Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Dunn, AM (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.; Dunn, AM (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Water Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",A.Dunn@leeds.ac.uk,,"Warren, Daniel/0000-0002-2073-7857","School of Biology at the University of Leeds; Water@Leeds SPRING competition; Natural Environmental Research Council, the Environment Agency and South West Water [NE/N008391/1]","This study was carried out under the Frank Stell Research Scholarship, awarded to DAW by the School of Biology at the University of Leeds.

Few studies have assessed the importance of biological interactions in structuring these communities. In the present study, benthic diatom community structure in relation to manipulated food webs was assessed using in situ mesocosms, whereby predator-free environments and environments comprising two different fish species were assessed. Zooplankton abundance, settled algal biomass and the diatom community were monitored over a 12-day period across each of the three trophic scenarios. Differences among treatments over time were observed in zooplankton abundances, particularly copepods. Similarly, the benthic diatom community structure changed significantly over time across the three trophic treatments. However, no differences in total algal biomass were found among treatments. This was likely the result of non-diatom phytoplankton contributions. We propose that the benthic diatom community structure within the mesocosms was influenced by trophic cascades and potentially through direct consumption by the fish. The study highlights that not only are organisms at the base of the food web affected by predators at the top of the food web, but that predator identity is potentially an important consideration for predator-prey interaction outcomes with consequences for multiple trophic levels.","[Wasserman, R.

I tested for interspecific competition between these two species during a drought year when primary productivity in the prairie was unusually low. In late June 1989, 1 transferred young nymphs of P. nebrascensis among enclosed plots (each 550-900 m2) to produce three pairs of plots with grasshoppers removed or added. Pretransfer densities in the six plots were estimated at 6 nymphS/m2. Experimental transfers resulted in densities of P. nebrascensis in addition plots 2-3 times as large as in paired removal plots; significant differences in density between addition and removal plots persisted throughout the summer. Densities of O. speciosa in plots with P. nebrascensis removed or added did not differ significantly throughout the growing season of 1989, nor in early summer of 1990. Furthermore, growth and development of O. speciosa in these plots (as measured by rate of maturation, and adult femur length and mass in 1989) were not reduced in the presence of high densities of P. nebrascensis, nor was reproductive potential (measured as the ratio of young nymphs present in early summer 1990 to adults in late summer 1989). These results are similar to those of a previous experiment at the same site during 1987 when primary productivity was moderate. Even under the extreme conditions of 1989, with particularly high ratios of grasshoppers to available food resources, variation in P. nebrascensis density did not adversely affect populations of O. speciosa. These results contrast with recent results for sedentary phytophagous insects, but are consistent with the hypothesis that free-ranging insect herbivores may rarely experience interspecific competition for food resources.",,"EVANS, EW (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,LOGAN,UT 84322, USA.",,,,,,,49,25,32,0,17,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1992,73,3,,,,,1038,1044,,10.2307/1940178,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU767,WOS:A1992HU76700028,,,,,2021-09-27,

The theory implies that once the threshold is crossed, rates of key ecological processes, such as predation and competition, will change. This conjecture was tested on sheltered intertidal shores of New England that are dominated by either mussel (Mytilus edulis) beds or algal (Ascophyllum nodosum) stands. Twelve sets of clearings of different sizes, which mimicked effects of ice scour, were created in algal stands, and mortality of transplanted mussels was monitored. Clearings were 1, 2, 4 and 8 m in diameter. Mussel mortality due to the predatory snail Nucella lapillus declined in a step-like manner in clearings greater than or equal to 4 m in diameter. Initial densities of the predator did not vary among experimental clearings or sites and were not correlated with mussel mortality. Mussel mortality was correlated with predatory snail densities during and at the end of the experiment. These results provide experimental evidence supporting conjectures about the switch between alternative states in ecological communities.","Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Petraitis, PS (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,"Petraitis, Peter/D-1048-2013",,,,,33,87,87,0,43,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1999,84,2,,,,,239,245,,10.2307/3546718,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,169VG,WOS:000078769300007,,,,,2021-09-27,

These pests are generally controlled with pesticides, which have adverse effects on human and environmental health. Furthermore, resident vegetation in orchards is often eliminated with herbicides due to suspected competition with citrus trees for resources. Yet this resident vegetation could serve as a habitat for natural enemies of crop pests, particularly ladybirds (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), which are well-known aphid predators, thus reducing the need for pesticide treatments. Results of a 2-year study conducted in an experimental citrus orchard, on the impacts of four different weed management treatments on ladybird populations, viz: i) M: hedge-trimmer mowing; ii) T: disk harrow tilling; iii) HM: hammer mill crushing/mulching; iv) H: herbicide spraying are presented. Ladybirds were captured over a 5 week period each year using Malaise-derived flight interception traps. A total of 690 ladybird specimens, belonging to 12 species distributed across four subfamilies, were captured. These were mainly aphidophagous, with Scymnus constrictus Mulsant being largely dominant. There was a significant effect of distance to a field border with diversified vegetation on ladybird abundance and diversity. Ladybirds were also significantly more abundant on tall vegetation cover than on short cover. Although proportionately fewer ladybirds were trapped in the 'H' treatment than in the other three, there were no clearcut effects of weed management treatments on ladybird abundance. This study nevertheless confirmed the efficacy of interception traps for assessment of ladybird population abundance and diversity. It also demonstrated the potential of these natural enemies as bioindicators of habitat disturbance.","[Rothe, Marie; Pelletier, Nina; Touneji-Catouaria, Anna-Morgane; Le Bellec, Fabrice; Ratnadass, Alain] CIRAD, UPR HortSys, F-97455 St Pierre, Reunion, France; [Bockstaller, Christian] Univ Lorraine, INRA, LAE, F-68000 Colmar, France; [Rothe, Marie; Pelletier, Nina; Touneji-Catouaria, Anna-Morgane; Le Bellec, Fabrice; Ratnadass, Alain] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, HortSys, Montpellier, France","Ratnadass, A (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR HortSys, F-97455 St Pierre, Reunion, France.; Ratnadass, A (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, HortSys, Montpellier, France.",alain.ratnadass@cirad.fr,,"RATNADASS, Alain/0000-0002-8873-5671; LE BELLEC, Fabrice/0000-0001-8145-7560",French Biodiversity Agency,"This study was financially supported by the French Biodiversity Agency (formerly ONEMA), in the framework of the tender `Biodiversite-Ecophyto' (Agrum'Aide project, 2014-2018).",,24,2,2,2,23,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1742-7584,1742-7592,,INT J TROP INSECT SC,Int.

We address this issue experimentally in a threespine stickleback species pair showing exaggerated divergence in bony defensive armor in association with competition-driven character displacement. We used semi-natural ponds to test the role of a native predator in causing divergent evolution of armor and two known underlying genes. Predator presence/absence altered selection on dorsal spines and allele frequencies at the Msx2a gene across a generation. Evolutionary trajectories of alleles at a second gene, Pitx1, and the pelvic spine trait it controls, were more variable. Our experiment demonstrates how manipulation of putative selective agents helps to identify causes of evolutionary divergence at key genes, rule out phenotypic plasticity as a sole determinant of phenotypic differences, and eliminate reliance on fitness surrogates. Divergence of predation regimes in sympatric stickleback is associated with coevolution in response to resource competition, implying a cascade of biotic interactions driving species divergence. We suggest that as divergence proceeds, an increasing number of biotic interactions generate divergent selection, causing more evolution in turn. In this way, biotic adaptation perpetuates species divergence through time during adaptive radiation in an expanding number of traits and genes.","[Rennison, Diana J.; Rudman, Seth M.; Schluter, Dolph] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Rennison, Diana J.; Rudman, Seth M.; Schluter, Dolph] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Rennison, Diana J.] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Bern, Switzerland; [Rudman, Seth M.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Rennison, DJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Rennison, DJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Rennison, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Bern, Switzerland.",diana.rennison@iee.unibe.ch; schluter@zoology.ubc.ca,,"Schluter, Dolph/0000-0003-1683-7836; Rennison, Diana/0000-0002-5944-0743",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; University of British Columbia (UBC); Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; BC Knowledge Development Fund; UBC,"The authors thank the following agencies for funding: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for a Discovery Grant (D.S.) and PGS-D Fellowship (D.J.R.); University of British Columbia (UBC) for a Four-Year-Fellowship (D.J.R. and S.M.R.) and Zoology Fellowamples and Benjamin ship (D.J.R.); and the Canada Foundation for Innovation, BC Knowledge Development Fund, and UBC for the experimental pond facility.

After hunting ceased, some populations have recovered to pre-exploitation levels and may have regained their prominent position as top predator in marine ecosystems. Also, the harbor seal population in the international Wadden Sea grew at an exponential rate following a ban on seal hunting in 1960s, and the current number similar to 38,000 is close to the historic population size. Here we estimate the impact of the harbor seal predation on the fish community in the Wadden Sea and nearby coastal waters. Fish remains in fecal samples and published estimates on the seal's daily energy requirement were used to estimate prey selection and the magnitude of seal consumption. Estimates on prey abundance were derived from demersal fish surveys, and fish growth was estimated using a Dynamic Energy Budget model. GPS tracking provided information on where seals most likely caught their prey. Harbor seals hauling-out in the Dutch Wadden Sea fed predominantly on demersal fish, for example, flatfish species (flounder, sole, plaice, dab), but also on sandeel, cod, and whiting. Although harbor seals acquire the majority of prey further offshore in the adjacent North Sea, and only spend 14% of their diving time in the Wadden Sea, seal predation was still estimated to cause an average annual mortality of 43% of the remaining fish in the Wadden Sea and 60% in the nearby shallow coastal waters (<20 m). There were however large sources of uncertainty in the estimated impact of seals on fish, including the migration of fish between the North Sea and Wadden Sea, and catchability estimates of the fish survey sampling gear, particularly for sandeel and other pelagic fish species. Our estimate suggested a considerable top-down pressure by harbor seals on demersal fish. However, predation by seals may also alleviate density-dependent competition between the remaining fish, allowing for increased fish growth, and partly compensating for the reduction in fish numbers. This study shows that recovering coastal marine mammal populations could become an important component in the functioning of shallow coastal ecosystems.","[Aarts, Geert; Brasseur, Sophie; Poos, Jan Jaap; Schop, Jessica; Kirkwood, Roger; van Kooten, Tobias; Mul, Evert; Reijnders, Peter; Rijnsdorp, Adriaan D.; Tulp, Ingrid] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Marine Res, Ankerpk 27, NL-1781 AG Den Helder, Netherlands; [Aarts, Geert] Univ Utrecht, Dept Coastal Syst, NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Poos, Jan Jaap; Rijnsdorp, Adriaan D.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Aquaculture & Fisheries Grp, Zodiac Bldg 122,De Elst 1, NL-6708 WD Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Kooten, Tobias] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, POB 94240, NL-1090 GE Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Reijnders, Peter] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management AEW, Droevendaalsesteeg 3a,Bldg 100, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands","Aarts, G (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Marine Res, Ankerpk 27, NL-1781 AG Den Helder, Netherlands.; Aarts, G (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Coastal Syst, NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.",geert.aarts@wur.nl,"Rijnsdorp, Adriaan/A-4217-2008","Rijnsdorp, Adriaan/0000-0003-0785-9662; mul, evert/0000-0001-7297-8081","Dutch ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (MinLNV); Groningen Sea Port; Eneco; Gemini windpark; MinLNV; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF); KennisBasis program System Earth Management [KB-24-002-020]","We want to thank all assistants and colleagues from Wageningen Marine Research for their help during seal tagging, aerial surveys and fish data collection, especially: Piet-Wim van Leeuwen, Andre Meijboom, Hans Verdaat, Jenny Cremer, Marcel de Vries, Andre Dijkman, Gerrit Rink, & Thomas Pasterkamp and the crew of the Wadden Unit.

After the crop harvest, large quantities of seeds survive on the soil surface, where they stay until germination or enter the soil seed bank. Seed predation by herbivores is an useful tool that may significantly reduce the seed input in the soil seed bank and in this way reduce the abundance of volunteers in the subsequent crop. In this study, we investigated which groups of invertebrate seed predators are involved in the depletion of rape seeds on the soil surface. Nine carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and one terrestrial isopod (Crustacea: Isopoda: Oniscoidea) which were most abundant in pitfall traps placed in the rape fields were observed under laboratory conditions. Laboratory essay in which 50 dry seeds of winter rape were offered to individual beetles or isopods revealed that Pseudoophonus rufipes, Pterostichus melanarius and Amara ovata consumed the highest numbers of seeds per mass unit. Harpalus affinis, Poecilus cupreus, A. aenea, A. familiaris, and A. littorea consumed fewer seeds per mass unit, and H. signaticornis and the isopod species Armadillidium vulgare ate the rape seeds only occasionally. Surprisingly, carnivorous carabids significantly contributed to seed predation.","[Koprdova, S.; Saska, P.] Res Inst Crop Prod, Prague 6, Ruzyne, Czech Republic; [Soukup, J.] Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Agroecol & Biometeorol, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic","Koprdova, S (corresponding author), Res Inst Crop Prod, Drnovska 507, Prague 6, Ruzyne, Czech Republic.",koprdova@vurv.cz,"Soukup, Josef/U-1284-2019; Saska, Pavel/K-6434-2013","Soukup, Josef/0000-0003-2890-2359; Saska, Pavel/0000-0003-1397-2987",,,,20,10,10,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1861-3829,1861-3837,,J PLANT DIS PROTECT,J.

Two groups of organisms have potential as Dreissena control agents: selectively toxic microbes and natural enemies. Selectively toxic microbes are naturally occurring soil and water microorganisms that simply by chance happen to be toxic to Dreissena. Applied at artificially high densities to water, the microbial cells per se or their released metabolites are selectively lethal to Dreissena. In contrast, natural enemies are organisms that, by their evolutionary nature, will debilitate or kill Dreissena, including predators, parasites (both multicellular and microbial), and benthic competitors (organisms capable of competitively displacing Dreissena from substrates). Selectively Toxic Microbes: In the short run, these microorganisms represent the most promising candidates as biological control agents. The use of highly-specific, toxic microbes has a clear record of commercial success and environmental safety in the control of invertebrate pests in North America, and strains lethal to Dreissena have been already isolated. Considering how quickly a selectively toxic microbe could move from the laboratory to commercialization, continued research to develop this microbial control strategy is a high priority. Natural Enemies: In North America, as in Eurasia, there will likely be isolated field reports of major impacts by natural enemies, and, on the whole, we will likely see a cumulative effect of a complex of enemies having a constant, but limited, role in naturally suppressing Dreissena populations. In the majority of cases, Dreissena populations will cause economic and ecological effects at densities well below those that their enemies could naturally maintain. This does not mean, however, that certain natural enemies could not be artificially manipulated (e.g., mass produced and released in an inundative fashion) to cause major Dreissena reductions. 1. Parasites: These natural enemies would likely be the most environmentally-safe biocontrol agents, due primarily to their high host specificity. Comprehensive investigations to identify parasites that are strictly specific to Dreissena and that can be economically mass produced are a key research priority. Parasites from Dreissena's native Eurasian range should be studied to identify species that would be nearly risk free candidates for importation into North America. Research to uncover parasites of Dreissena that are already present in North America should be intensified. 2. Predators: Although organisms, such as fish and birds, have sometimes been documented to consume Dreissena at high rates, this does nor necessarily mean that they would be effective candidates for use in control programs. Predators are typically not specific enough in their prey choices. A predator introduced to a waterbody from outside its natural range may highly prefer Dreissena as a prey item, but will also consume other aquatic organisms. The consumption of such nontarget prey could potentially have serious, adverse, ecological impacts. 3. Benthic Competitors: In addition to being micro/macrofouling organisms themselves, the lack of specificity of species that can competitively displace Dreissena from substrates (e.g., sponges) significantly reduces their potential as biocontrol agents.","New York State Museum, Biol Survey, State Educ Dept, Cultural Educ Ctr, Albany, NY 12230 USA","Molloy, DP (corresponding author), New York State Museum, Biol Survey, State Educ Dept, Cultural Educ Ctr, Albany, NY 12230 USA.",,,,,,,34,17,19,0,21,NATL SHELLFISHERIES ASSOC,SOUTHAMPTON,"C/O DR.

Isolated teeth of selachians, actinopterygians and marine reptiles are extremely numerous in these phosphatic. deposits and have been used for biostratigraphical, palaeodiversity and palaeoecological purposes. Detailed field work allowed to establish an exhaustive list of the Benguerir marine vertebrate faunas with their biostratigraphical distribution through five main fossiliferous levels (L6 to 12) spanning all the Maastrichtian. Their importance for biochronological purposes and correlations with other Maastrichtian phosphate deposits worldwide appears noteworthy. The selachians are currently represented by 60 species belonging to 32 genera and 7 orders. Among them, the genus Squalicorax is one of the most interesting concerning high-resolution biostratigraphy and correlations with other phosphate basins because of important rates of change noted between the 5 species recovered from base (e.g. occurrence of S. africanus) to top (e.g. strong representation of S. pristodontus) of the Maastrichtian. The marine reptiles include mainly mosasaurids but also scarcer plesiosaurs, chelonians and crocodyliforms, representing at least 14 taxa. The mosasaurid squamates are the most abundant and diversified with at least 8 species ranging all along the succession. The actinopterygians include mainly teleosts but also pycnodonts, also common in all levels and representing at least 7 taxa. Selachians and reptiles show the same trends, in terms of species richness per level, even if the reptiles are less informative due to a less diversified assemblage. For sharks, L6 and L2 show a high percentage of genera and species occurring only in the layer concerned. The evolution of diversity in actinopterygian fishes is less clear because of their low diversity. The use of dissimilarity indices and agglomerative method underscores two distinct associations: a lower one including the levels L6 and L5, and an upper one comprising the levels L4 to 12. These two associations allow to separate a lower and an upper Maastrichtian level and are important for correlations all around the southern and eastern margins of the Tethys. Another clear faunal turnover occurs between 13 and 12, because of a high appearance rate in L2 (at least in sharks) suggesting an increase in prey abundance, as testified by the rapid increase of marine predator density. Indeed, and through L6 to L2, a possible signal of an environmental damage affecting the predator community can be noted by faunal turnovers, even if no significant change in prey association was clearly detected. From a palaeobiogeographical point of view, the faunal associations of Benguerir appear typical of the southern and eastern margins of the Tethys, with several typical species not occurring in the northern Tethys.

Even though this type of indirect interaction has received significant theoretical and empirical attention, alternative mechanisms producing similar results have not been considered in the literature. In this paper we document the results of a series of microcosm experiments aimed to evaluate the importance of the generalist consumer Daphnia ambigua upon the relative abundance of the more specialized Moina micrura and Ceriodaphnia dubia (Cladocera). We compared the population parameters of M. micrura and C. dubia when alone, in coexistence, and in the presence and absence of D. ambigua. While M. micrura and C. dubia did not show evidence for interspecific competition, the addition of D. ambigua promoted a reduction in the maximal population density of M. micrura, causing a pattern of indirect competition with C. dubia that resembles predator-mediated apparent competition. This result suggests that non-predatory interactions need to be considered as a potential source of apparent interactions in natural communities.","Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile","Martinez, G (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Casilla 653, Santiago, Chile.",gingerma@ing.uchile.cl,,"Medel, Rodrigo/0000-0001-9955-764X",,,,36,4,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2002,97,1,,,,,111,115,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970111.x,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,559JC,WOS:000176022200011,,,,,2021-09-27,

Urban development results in the decline of amphibian density and species richness. A logical next step towards understanding why urbanisation negatively impacts amphibians is to track species-specific demographic responses to urbanisation. 2. We monitored growth of two-lined salamander (Eurycea cirrigera Green) larvae over two complete cohorts (2006 and 2007) in nine western Georgia, U.S.A. streams. 3. We found that salamanders in streams surrounded by urbanised and developing catchments hatched at the same size as their reference-stream counterparts, but achieved larger sizes within the first few months of growth. We evaluated the effect of four variables that correlate with the urban-forest gradient and found that elevated temperatures in the urban environment, coupled with decreased intraspecific competition because of lower survivorship in these same habitats, were two of the most likely explanations for increased growth rates. 4. Such an increase in growth of surviving larvae may maintain population viability in urban areas where it has been shown survival is difficult because of increased in-channel flow during flood events. Because larvae that do survive in urban streams undergo metamorphosis at large sizes, they may recoup a component of fitness (i.e. increased adult survivorship and reproduction) through growth.","[Barrett, Kyle] Univ Georgia, DB Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Barrett, Kyle; Helms, Brian S.; Samoray, Stephen T.; Guyer, C.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Barrett, K (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, DB Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, 180 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",kbarrett@warnell.uga.edu,,,Center for Forest Sustainability at Auburn University,"We thank Shannon Hoss, John Peterson, Christina Romagosa and Matt Williams for assistance in the field.

This study examined habitat use of four carnivores in the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve, Belize. We calculated photographic trap success (TS) rates for jaguars Panthera onca, pumas Puma concolor, ocelots Leopardus pardalis, grey foxes Urocyon cinereoargenteus, potential prey and humans at 47 remote camera stations spaced along roads and trails within the 139 km2 study site. At each station, we used manual habitat sampling in combination with geographic information systems to estimate habitat characteristics pertaining to vegetation cover. We used negative binomial models to analyse species-specific TS as a response to habitat (including vegetation and landscape variables, prey activity and human activity) and co-predator activity rates. Jaguars [TS=7.56 +/- 1.279 (se) captures per 100 trap-nights (TN)] and grey foxes (31.5 +/- 6.073 captures per 100 TN) were commonly captured by cameras, while pumas (0.66 +/- 0.200 captures per 100 TN) and ocelots (0.55 +/- 0.209 captures per 100 TN) were rare. Model selection via Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that models including habitat variables generally performed better than models including co-predator activity. Felid captures were positively associated with small bird TS and with the width or length of surrounding roads, while fox counts showed few habitat associations. Ocelot activity was positively related to jaguar captures, an effect probably explained by their shared preference for areas with more roads. Pumas were negatively related to human activity and jaguars showed a similar, though non-significant, trend, suggesting that these felids may be sensitive to human disturbance even within protected areas. Results suggest that these predators do not spatially partition habitat and that the jaguar could function as an umbrella species for smaller sympatric carnivores.","[Davis, M. L.; Kelly, M.

How species respond to regular changes in patch habitat structure, however, remains poorly understood, especially within seasonal seascapes. We explored the importance of patch habitat quality for the seasonal population dynamics of a widespread reef fish, Leptoscarus vaigiensis, within a shifting mosaic of seaweed patch habitats. Following dietary and behavioral assessments of L. vaigiensis microhabitat preferences, we used best subsets model selection to explore the relative importance of seaweed canopy attributes (cover, height, density) and the abundance of putative competitors and predators for explaining regional variations in L. vaigiensis density across summer and winter. Dietary analysis (n = 53 individuals) and behavioral observations (n = 1014) indicated that L. vaigiensis are habitat specialists that primarily consume brown seaweeds and prefer areas within patches that have tall (>30 cm height) canopy-forming seaweeds (Sargassum, Sargassopsis) at low to intermediate densities (1-5 holdfasts per m(2)). Accordingly, we found seaweed percent cover and canopy height were two of the most powerful predictors for L. vaigiensis abundance, with major seasonal shifts in L. vaigiensis abundance from summer to winter strongly related to patch-level changes in canopy cover and height. We conclude that patch habitat quality, based upon microhabitat preferences, can be a powerful predictor for the response of species to a seasonally shifting habitat mosaic, and that high-quality patches that provide seasonal refuges should be a focus for spatial conservation and management.","[Lim, Isis E.; Noble, Mae M.; Fulton, Christopher J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Wilson, Shaun K.; Holmes, Thomas H.] Dept Pk & Wildlife, Marine Sci Program, Sci & Conservat Div, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia; [Wilson, Shaun K.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Fulton, CJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",christopher.fulton@anu.edu.au,"Fulton, Christopher/A-5971-2008","Fulton, Christopher/0000-0002-1140-1999; Wilson, Shaun/0000-0002-4590-0948",Australian Society for Fish Biology (Michael Hall Award); Australian National UniversityAustralian National University; WA Department of Parks and Wildlife; National Parks Board of Singapore,"We thank staff of the WA Department of Parks and Wildlife Exmouth Office and Coral Bay Research Station for field assistance, and the Australian Society for Fish Biology (Michael Hall Award), Australian National University, WA Department of Parks and Wildlife, and National Parks Board of Singapore for funding.

The Little River Band of Ottawa Indians (LRBOI) and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), along with universities and public interest groups, are re-examining the potential for re-introduction of the Arctic Grayling Thymallus arcticus, a species that has been extirpated in Michigan since the 1930s. The Manistee River, Michigan, flows through the LRBOI's reservation and once supported the last known native Arctic Grayling population in the state's Lower Peninsula. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify potential biotic limitations, such as competition and/or predation from other fish species, that may interfere with Arctic Grayling re-introduction in the Manistee River watershed; and (2) describe how instream habitat features currently relate to populations of potentially interacting species. Field surveys conducted during June-August 2012 in eight Manistee River tributaries identified suitable abiotic habitat for Arctic Grayling in 20 of 22 sampling reaches. However, high densities of Brown Trout Salmo trutta (a nonnative salmonid) may have influenced some of the habitat associations observed for Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis and Slimy Sculpin Cottus cognatus, two species that currently and historically co-occurred in Arctic Grayling habitats. These two species were the most abundant in river reaches with Brown Trout densities less than 0.10fish/m(2). Based on habitat conditions and Brown Trout densities, there appear to be four distinct tributary regions for which management strategies could be developed to enhance the success of Arctic Grayling re-introduction efforts. Re-introduction of Arctic Grayling in the Manistee River watershed would support LRBOI and MDNR goals for native species restoration and would provide a unique and historic angling opportunity that has been absent in Michigan for nearly 100years.","[Goble, Cameron W.; Auer, Nancy A.; Huckins, Casey J.; Danhoff, Brian M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Holtgren, J.

Larval amphibians are model organisms to investigate the balancing of life history trade-offs because individuals must metamorphose before a wetland dries. Therefore, we deployed enclosures in a natural wetland to investigate the interactive effects of Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) density (50 or 100 tadpoles) and Brook Stickleback (Culaea inconstans) presence on survival and growth of tadpoles. We hypothesized that the effects of conspecific density on tadpole survival and growth would be dependent on the presence of fish predators. Stickleback predation significantly decreased Wood Frog survival; however, a trend of higher tadpole survival with fish was detected at high conspecific densities. Wood Frog time to and mass at metamorphosis was not significantly affected by either conspecific density or stickleback presence. Our results demonstrate that Brook Sticklebacks can play a significant role in regulating Wood Frog survival in a Subarctic wetland, but the impact is likely dependent on tadpole density. Therefore, this research highlights the dynamic and complex effects of competition and predation in a Subarctic wetland. Our study also contributes to the limited understanding of factors affecting amphibian community structure in Subarctic wetlands.","[Davenport, Jon M.] Southeast Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, One Univ Plaza, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA; [Seiwert, Phillip A.; Ben Cash, W.] Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Biol, 201 Donaghey Ave, Conway, AR 72035 USA; [Fishback, LeeAnn] Churchill Northern Studies Ctr, POB 610, Churchill, MB R0B 0E0, Canada","Davenport, JM (corresponding author), Southeast Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, One Univ Plaza, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA.",jdavenport@semo.edu; pseiwert1@uca.edu; fishback@churchillscience.ca; wbcash@uca.edu,"Davenport, Jon M/AAG-8457-2020","Davenport, Jon M/0000-0002-9911-2779",CNSC; Earthwatch Institute; University of Central Arkansas,"We thank Earthwatch Institute participants from the summer of 2013 and D.

The experiment consisted of bird exclusion, ray + bird exclusion and reference plots. Samples were collected from each plot on 2 occasions: 6 mo after the initiation of the experiment, when rays were absent and common bivalve densities were high following recruitment, and 8 mo later when rays were present and bivalve population structure was not dominated by new recruits. At the end of the experiment analysis of surficial sediment features did not indicate the experiment was confounded by localised modifications of sediment or hydrodynamic conditions. Community level differences on both occasions were driven by effects on common taxa. The seasonality of effects in our experiment precluded direct comparison of the 2 predators. However, the 6 mo results indicated that bird predation resulted in indirect effects due to adult/juvenile interactions amongst the dominant bivalve Macomona liliana. At the end of the experiment, 14 mo after its initiation, analysis of common taxa generally revealed direct negative effects of predation, with significantly high densities in the ray + bird exclusion treatment. Infaunal density changes in response to the exclusion of shorebirds and rays did not indicate the presence of multiple trophic levels in this infaunal assemblage. Differences between the results obtained from the bird exclusion and the ray + bird exclusion treatments on the first sampling occasion were attributed to an edge effect around the bird exclusion plots which effectively increased their area. This edge effect emphasises the importance of infaunal mobility and its potential to swamp predator effects. The results of this experiment highlight the importance of considering the role of predators within an appropriate spatial and temporal context.",,"THRUSH, SF (corresponding author), NATL INST WATER & ATMOSPHER RES, DIV ECOSYST, POB 11-115, HAMILTON, NEW ZEALAND.",,,"Cummings, Vonda/0000-0003-1076-3995; Thrush, Simon/0000-0002-4005-3882",,,,66,86,86,0,29,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In this study, we consider the importance of disturbance (salinity) and predator and competitor variables on mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in small ephemeral water bodies across the Wheatbelt of Western Australia. Similar to mosquitoes, and contrary to general perceptions, nonculicid aquatic fauna (aquatic fauna) had a common occurrence (number or percentage of water bodies occupied) and were abundant (average density) in ephemeral water bodies, albeit with a simplified trophic structure. The occurrence and density (number per unit area) of aquatic fauna between water bodies were highly variable, but general relationships of aquatic fauna with rainfall, water body surface area, salinity, and mosquitoes were apparent. In contrast to mosquitoes, the density of aquatic fauna declined with recent rainfall, implying mosquitoes may colonize newly created water bodies more quickly than aquatic fauna. Assemblages (richness and density of taxa) of aquatic fauna changed along a salinity gradient, as did mosquitoes, and this was pronounced for predator groups. Densities of mosquitoes were not limited by any single taxonomic group, by a negative relationship. However, the density and richness of mosquitoes generally declined in association with increased richness of predators and density of all other taxa (taxa not specifically classified as predators or competitors of mosquitoes). These relationships may account for higher densities of mosquitoes in smaller water bodies, where richness of predators is reduced and the density of other taxa does not differ from larger water bodies. Our results also suggest salinity in the Western Australia Wheatbelt may facilitate greater abundance of halotolerant mosquitoes, Aedes alboannulatus Macquart and Aedes camptorhynchus Thomson (a vector of Ross River virus [Togoviridae: Alphavirus]), by releasing them from biotic regulation.","[Carver, Scott] Univ Montana, Montana Tech, Dept Biol, Butte, MT 59701 USA; [Carver, Scott; Spafford, Helen; Storey, Andrew] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol M085, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Carver, Scott; Weinstein, Philip] Univ Western Australia, Sch Populat Hlth M431, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Spafford, Helen] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Plant & Environm Protect Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Weinstein, Philip] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia","Carver, S (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Tech, Dept Biol, 1300 Pk St, Butte, MT 59701 USA.",scarver@mtech.edu,"Carver, Scott/J-7654-2014; Weinstein, Phil/C-9805-2011","Carver, Scott/0000-0002-3579-7588; Weinstein, Philip/0000-0001-9860-7166",Australian Government Bureau of Rural SciencesAustralian Government; Australian and Jean Rogerson postgraduate awards; Department of Environment and Conservation,"We acknowledge the contribution of Jessica Lynas and Lisa Chandler for assistance in the laboratory and numerous volunteers that helped with all aspects of the field work.

Tree stem density decreased exponentially with distance from the forest edge early in succession. Later in succession the predictive power of the negative exponential model decreased, suggesting that processes such as animal seed dispersal within a field become important. Species palatable to herbivores were denser than unpalatable species close to the forest edge which implies that consumer pressure originates in the field rather than in the forest. Stems of all species were clumped on the scale of the 1 m2 plots. However, stems of bird-dispersed species showed the highest degree of clumping as expected if perches serve as recruitment foci. Results suggest that spatial patterns of tree seedlings in oldfields are significantly influenced by successional age, herbivory, dispersal vector and proximity to forest edge.","NEW YORK BOT GARDEN,INST ECOSYST STUDIES,MILLBROOK,NY 12545","MYSTER, RW (corresponding author), UNIV PUERTO RICO,DIV TERR ECOL,BOX 363682,SAN JUAN,PR 00936, USA.",,,,,,,51,46,51,0,20,TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB,BRONX,"NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN, BRONX, NY 10458",0040-9618,,,B TORREY BOT CLUB,Bull.

Individuals with unlimited attachment to the substrata should rapidly be protected by their growth form, thus decreasing their need to settle in refuges and limiting the length of time any locations on heterogeneous substrata act as refuges. Alternatively, organisms with limited attachment to the substrata should remain susceptible to the causes of mortality for a longer time, and as a result should settle in high quality refuges(sites that protect individuals from competitors, predators or physical disturbance events until either a size refuge or reproductive maturity is obtained). Results agreed with these predictions for 4 species of invertebrates examined on both the topographically complex surface of the solitary ascidian Styela plicata (hereafter Styela) and on settlement plates with uniformly spaced roughness elements that mimicked the heights of roughness elements (2.0 and 5.0 mm) found on Styela in Beaufort, North Carolina, USA. On all surfaces, the 2 species with limited attachment to the substrata, Balanus sp. (aclonal, solitary) and Bugula neritina (clonal, arborescent), settled almost exclusively in the location that provided individuals with the best refuge: the crevices formed where the bases of roughness elements intersect with the flat surfaces. Additionally, when roughness elements of various heights were present (Styela, range: 0.6 to 8.8 mm), intermediate size roughness elements (2.0 < x less than or equal to 5.0 mm) were picked over 72% of the time. Settlement locations and locations where survival were enhanced were less consistent for the 2 species with unlimited attachment to the substrata: a clonal, encrusting form (Schizoporella errata) and a clonal stolen-mat form (Tubularia crocea). Fewer individuals of these 2 species settled on roughness elements on Styela and when they did, they were not restricted to the bases of the roughness elements. On the plate surfaces, most settlement did occur in crevices, but both species grew away from this location within days and short-term survival was not consistently greater in this location. Additional trials were run on plates with pits of the same maximum dimensions as the tested roughness elements (2.0 and 5.0 mm depth) to see if crevices and pits provide refuges of equal quality for newly settled individuals. Only survival of Balanus sp. recruits was greatest in both crevices and pits. Evidence for active choice of settlement location comes from consistent results in trials in which some larvae settled in greater numbers on specific size roughness elements on Styela and in areas of high erosion. Overall, these results show that one must be very cautious when generalizing about refuge quality on heterogeneous surfaces, and to determine if a location is a spatial refuge, it is critical to consider: (1) the dimensions oi the larva, (2) the relative dimensions of the individual and potential refuge:location at any point in time from the moment settlement occurred, and (3) the growth form of the individual which is related to its need for protection from biotic and abiotic sources of mortality.","UNIV S CAROLINA, DEPT BIOL SCI, COLUMBIA, SC 29208 USA; UNIV S CAROLINA, MARINE SCI PROGRAM, COLUMBIA, SC 29208 USA",,,"Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014","Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606",,,,51,174,176,0,37,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The population on Santa Rosa Island declined by 99% during the 1990s due to golden eagle (Aguila chrysaetos) predation but is now recovering. This drastic population reduction provided an unprecedented opportunity to study home-range size and habitat use at very low levels of intraspecific competition. We used global positioning system (GPS) collars to track 14 adult male foxes from September 2009 through June 2010. On average, the collars operated for 16.5 wk, yielding 364 locations per fox. The 95% minimum convex polygon home ranges averaged 3.39 km(2), which is several times larger than reported in previous studies conducted at higher population densities. We used Euclidean distance analysis to assess habitat selection within 95% kernel density isopleth (KDI) home ranges and 50% KDI core areas. The foxes used most of the available vegetation types but exhibited significant selection for valley bottoms and for bare areas and grassland at night. Our results, together with previous studies on island foxes, suggest an inverse relationship between home-range size and population density as has been shown for many other species. However, the pattern is confounded by differences among study areas and methods. We therefore recommend that this study be repeated when the Santa Rosa Island population recovers to its historic density of 4 adult foxes/km(2) to better assess density-dependent changes in home-range size and habitat use.","[Drake, Elizabeth M.; Perrine, John D.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Biol Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 USA; [Cypher, Brian L.] Calif State Univ Stanislaus, Endangered Species Recovery Program, Turlock, CA 95372 USA; [Ralls, Katherine] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [White, Russell] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Informat Serv, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 USA; [Coonan, Timothy J.] Natl Pk Serv, Ventura, CA 93001 USA","Drake, EM (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Biol Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 USA.",bcypher@esrp.csustan.edu,,"White, Russell/0000-0002-2141-3862",California Department of Fish and Game; National Park Service; Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution,"Funding for this project was provided by the California Department of Fish and Game through the Endangered Species Act (Section-6) Grant-in-Aid Program, the National Park Service, and the Smithsonian Institution through a restricted endowment grant.

Here I show how the colonial anemone, Corynactis californica, creates a refuge for benthic macroalgae and invertebrate fish prey on intensively grazed shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel off southern California, USA. On reefs heavily grazed by sea urchins, benthic macroalgae and invertebrate fish prey were relatively more abundant among Corynactis colonies than adjacent areas lacking the anemone. Results from field experiments showed that Corynactis facilitated the recruitment of macroalgae and tubicolous amphipods in urchin-barren'' areas subjected to intensive grazing. In areas forested by giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), where grazing intensity from urchins was low, Corynactis suppressed algal recruitment but facilitated tubicolous amphipods. A manipulation of fish and sea urchins suggested that grazing by urchins, as opposed to predation from fish (primarily surfperch Embiotocidae), suppressed tubicolous amphipods, and this activity was hindered by the presence of Corynactis. In systems where human activity has intensified herbivory, associational refuges may maintain species diversity and support higher trophic levels.","[Levenbach, Stuart] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Levenbach, S (corresponding author), Off Management & Budget, New Execut Off Bldg,725 17th St NW,Room 9215, Washington, DC 20503 USA.",stuart_levenbach@omb.eop.gov,,,Santa Barbara Coastal LTER [OCE-9982105]; University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System; Nancy Brown Environmental Graduate Dissertation Fellowship,"The fieldwork was aided by M.

The percentage of predated mines declined from an average of 61% to an average of 29% in plots where crawling predators had been excluded. There were concomitant increases in successful beetle emergence and in the numbers of beetles attacked by parasitoids. 3. The probability of a miner that had escaped predation being attacked by a parasitoid was the same in experimental and control treatments, indicating that the risks of predation and parasitism are statistically independent. 4. The results were consistent across species and plots with the exception of one species in one plot where emergence was lower in the exclusion treatment than in the control because of very severe parasitoid attack. This result is unexplained. 5. Limited observations, and evidence from the type of damage observed on predated mines, suggest that the most important crawling predators are ants.","IMPERIAL COLL, NERC, CTR POPULAT BIOL, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND; NAT HIST MUSEUM, DEPT ENTOMOL, LONDON, ENGLAND; IMPERIAL COLL, DEPT BIOL, ASCOT, BERKS, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,27,16,17,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Underwater time-lapse photography on rocky shores in Southern California revealed that dense aggregations of spiny lobsters prey on mussels during nocturnal high tides. In contradiction of the refuge hypothesis, the densest aggregations occurred on midshore levels of the most wave-exposed site, a semi-protected site showed intermediate densities, and a protected site showed only sparse numbers of lobsters. On wave-beaten shores, the lobsters' high mobility and rapid prey handling allowed them to exploit intertidal prey in the brief period at extreme high tide, when both desiccation and hydrodynamic stresses were at a minimum. The spatial differences in lobster densities were, however, positively related to the recruitment rates of juvenile mussels, the preferred prey. A field experiment demonstrated that predation by lobsters within a mussel bed affects the age/size structure of the bed without changing primary percent coverage. Therefore, concentrations of adult prey on some wave-swept sites appear to result from elevated rates of prey recruitment that surpass rates of predation, rather than absolute refuges from predation.","Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Biol & Microbiol, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA","Robles, CD (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Biol & Microbiol, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",,,,,,,41,27,27,0,13,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,2001,128,1,,,,,142,152,,10.1007/s004420100638,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,447VE,WOS:000169592500018,28547084,,,,2021-09-27,

In a subtropical area of the coast of Brazil, Southwestern Atlantic (23 degrees 48'S, 45 degrees 22'W), the effect of predators on subtidal benthic assemblages was tested by manipulating consumers access to experimental units. Community attributes were then measured at two different successional stages (30 and 100 days) and two spatial scales (within and among sites a few kilometers apart). Since recruitment can modulate predation, settlement rate and composition of recruits were also estimated at each site. Consumer effects were not general, depending on both site and successional stage. During early succession, and at sites where bare space was promptly occupied, predation did not reduce species richness, probably because settlement of a diverse species pool was intense. However, where recruitment rate was reduced and space occupation slower, predation decreased species richness as has been commonly observed in tropical areas. In later assemblages, and at sites where recruitment was intense, predation altered species composition, either facilitating poorer competitors or mediating competitive interactions between dominant species, as predicted by classical theory for temperate areas. This study shows that the outcome of predation in subtropical areas may vary, with effects either resembling those reported to the tropics or more aligned to classic observations in temperate areas. We advocate that variation between these extremes can be largely explained by recruitment dynamics.","[Vieira, Edson A.] Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Biol Anim, Inst Biol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Dias, Gustavo M.] Univ Fed ABC UFABC, Ctr Ciencias Nat & Humanas, Rua Arcturus,03 Jardim Antares, BR-09606070 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil; [Flores, Augusto A.

Decades of research have provided a litany of examples of the potential for shrubs as nurse plants for establishment of desirable species, especially in water-limited environments. However, interactions with the existing understory community may alter the outcome of interactions between shrubs and understory plants. A manipulative experiment was conducted to disentangle interactions between a native forb species (Penstemon palmeri A. Gray), a native shrub (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), and a diverse understory of exotic and native forbs and grasses in a semi-arid shrubland of Northern Utah, USA. Seedlings of P. palmeri were transplanted in a factorial design: (1) beneath shrub canopies or into their interspaces and (2) with understory interactions retained or removed. Transplant survival was tracked for roughly 1 year. Shrubs appeared to facilitate P. palmeri survival while interactions with the existing understory community were equivalently negative, leading to overall neutral interactions. Further, positive shrub interactions and negative understory interactions appeared to operate independently and simultaneously. While the debate over the importance of facilitation and competition in driving plant community dynamics continues, our observations strongly suggest that both have considerable effects on plant establishment in A. tridentata communities. Furthermore, our results inform the conservation and restoration of P. palmeri populations, and suggest the utility of nurse shrubs and/or understory thinning as strategies for increasing the diversity of desirable species in the arid and semi-arid western United States shrublands.","[Poulos, Jesse M.; Schupp, Eugene W.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Poulos, Jesse M.; Schupp, Eugene W.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Rayburn, Andrew P.] River Partners, Modesto, CA 95354 USA","Poulos, JM (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",poulos.j.m@gmail.com,"Schupp, Eugene W/F-1834-2010","Schupp, Eugene/0000-0002-1258-503X","Utah Agricultural Experiment Station (UAES); Ecology Center, Utah State University","We thank the USDA/WS/NWRC Predator Research Facility for constructing grazing exclosures and for site access.

In social species, dominance status can affect the functional response of competing individuals, but studies conducted in an interference-free context have provided contrasting results on the extent of between-individual variability in functional response. We tested the prediction that individuals intrinsically differ in their functional response, and that these differences could predict body weight and dominance status in social species. We used goats as a model species and performed foraging experiments to assess the functional response of these goats in an interference-free context. Our results show that some individuals are consistently better foragers than others, and these individuals were more likely to be heavier and dominant. Parameters of the functional response are, however, more strongly associated with dominance status than with body weight. We conclude that interference while foraging is not needed to explain body weight differences between dominant and subordinate individuals. We suggest that these differences can emerge from intrinsic differences in foraging efficiency between individuals, which could also allow better foragers to demonstrate greater tenacity during agonistic interactions.","[Hartley, Alexandra; Shrader, Adrian M.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scotsville, South Africa; [Shrader, Adrian M.; Chamaille-Jammes, Simon] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Private Bag X28, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa; [Chamaille-Jammes, Simon] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France","Chamaille-Jammes, S (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Private Bag X28, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa.; Chamaille-Jammes, S (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France.",simon.chamaille@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Shrader, Adrian M/E-9472-2010; Chamaille-Jammes, Simon/B-3833-2009","Shrader, Adrian M/0000-0002-6451-6132; Chamaille-Jammes, Simon/0000-0003-0505-6620",CNRS 'Groupe de Recherche International France-Afrique du Sud'; National Research Foundation [77582],"We thank K.

Environmental differences among intertidal habitats, such as tidepools and emergent rock, may influence the intensity of predation and its effect on community structure. We manipulated densities of both recruits ( < 5 mm shell length, SL) and post-recruits ( greater than or equal to 5 mm SL) of N. lapillus in tidepools and on emergent rock to examine the effects of whelk predation on mussel assemblages on a rocky shore near Halifax, Nova Scotia. Mussels > 10 mm SL were more abundant in plots where the density of whelk post-recruits was reduced than in control plots where their density was not manipulated. Percentage cover of mussels remained stable where the density of post-recruits was reduced but declined in control plots, more so on emergent rock than in tidepools. This between-habitat difference probably reflects differences in the density of whelk post-recruits since feeding rates of whelks enclosed in cages did not differ significantly between tidepools and emergent rock. Predation by whelk post-recruits could not fully account for the reduction in mussel cover and abundance on emergent rock or in tidepools. This discrepancy is probably due to dislodgment by wave action of mussels killed by whelks, as well as the live mussels surrounding the empty shells. We could not detect an effect of recently recruited whelks on mussel cover or size distribution. Laboratory experiments indicated that the size of Nucella lapillus could be predicted from the diameter of the drill hole they create when feeding on a mussel. in the laboratory, feeding rate was linearly related to body size for recruits but not for post-recruits. Mean size of mussels consumed increased with increasing whelk size for both recruits and post-recruits. in the field, the size distribution of shells drilled by post-recruits differed from that of Live mussels, but the distribution of shells drilled by recruits was generally similar to that of live mussels. Analysis of field-collected drilled shells indicated that whelk post-recruits will prey on mussels as small as 2 mm SL, while recent recruits can prey on mussels as large as 22 mm SL. Given the relatively high feeding rate of recent recruits and broad size range of mussels they consume, we conclude that these small whelks are potentially important in limiting mussel recruitment on these shores.

However, recent developments in scientific technologies allow for more local, context-specific approaches. In the present article, we highlight how developments in five such methodologies (radiocarbon approaches, stable isotope analysis, ancient DNA, ancient proteomics, microscopy) have helped drive detailed analysis of specific megafaunal species, their particular ecological settings, and responses to new competitors or predators, climate change, and other external phenomena.

In long-distance migratory systems, local fluctuations in the predator-prey ratio can exhibit extreme variability within a single year depending upon the seasonal location of migratory species. Such systems offer an opportunity to empirically investigate cyclic population density effects on short-term food web interactions by taking advantage of the large seasonal shifts in migratory prey biomass. 2. We utilized a large-mammal predator-prey savanna food web to evaluate support for hypotheses relating to the indirect effects of apparent competition and apparent mutualism from migratory ungulate herds on survival of resident megaherbivore calves, mediated by their shared predator. African lions (Panthera leo) are generalist predators whose primary, preferred prey are wildebeests (Connochaetes taurinus) and zebras (Equus quagga), while lion predation on secondary prey such as giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) may change according to the relative abundance of the primary prey species. 3. We used demographic data from five subpopulations of giraffes in the Tarangire Ecosystem of Tanzania, East Africa, to test hypotheses relating to direct predation and indirect effects of large migratory herds on calf survival of a resident megaherbivore. We examined neonatal survival via apparent reproduction of 860 adult females, and calf survival of 449 giraffe calves, during three precipitation seasons over 3 years, seeking evidence of some effect on neonate and calf survival as a consequence of the movements of large herds of migratory ungulates. 4. We found that local lion predation pressure (lion density divided by primary prey density) was significantly negatively correlated with giraffe neonatal and calf survival probabilities. This supports the apparent mutualism hypothesis that the presence of migratory ungulates reduces lion predation on giraffe calves. 5. Natural predation had a significant effect on giraffe calf and neonate survival, and could significantly affect giraffe population dynamics. If wildebeest and zebra populations in this ecosystem continue to decline as a result of increasingly disrupted migrations and poaching, then giraffe calves will face increased predation pressure as the predator-prey ratio increases. Our results suggest that the widespread population declines observed in many migratory systems are likely to trigger demographic impacts in other species due to indirect effects like those shown here.","[Lee, Derek E.; Bond, Monica L.] Wild Nat Inst, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Kissui, Bernard M.] Sch Field Studies, Tarangire Lion Project, Karatu, Tanzania; [Kiwango, Yustina A.] Tanzania Natl Pk, Arusha, Tanzania","Lee, DE (corresponding author), Wild Nat Inst, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",derek@wildnatureinstitute.org,"Lee, Derek E./E-1131-2013; Bond, Monica L/E-3161-2013","Lee, Derek E./0000-0002-1042-9543; Bond, Monica L/0000-0001-8500-6564",Dartmouth College Graduate Studies; Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program; Sacramento Zoo; Safari West; Columbus Zoo; Cincinnati Zoo; Tulsa Zoo; Dartmouth College Cramer Fund; Explorer's Club,"This research was carried out with permission from the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH), Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA), the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI), African Wildlife Foundation, Manyara Ranch Conservancy, and the villages of Selela, Lolkisale, and Emboret, under COSTECH permits 2011-106-NA-90-172, 2012-175-ER-90-172, and 2013-103-ER-90-172.

Recruitment limitation implies little or no regulation of the reef-associated population, and is supported by several experimental studies that failed to detect density dependence. Previous manipulations of population density have, however, focused on juveniles, and there have been no tests for density-dependent interactions among adult reef fishes. I tested for population regulation in Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, a small, short-lived goby that is common in the Caribbean. Adult density was manipulated on artificial reefs and adults were also monitored on reefs where they varied in density naturally. Survival of adult gobies showed a strong inverse relationship with their initial density across a realistic range of densities. Individually marked gobies, however, grew at similar rates across all densities, suggesting that density-dependent survival was not associated with depressed growth, and so may result from predation or parasitism rather than from food shortage. Like adult survival, the accumulation of new recruits on reefs was also much lower at high adult densities than at low densities. Suppression of recruitment by adults may occur because adults cause either reduced larval settlement or reduced early post-settlement survival. In summary, this study has documented a previously unrecorded regulatory mechanism for reef fish populations (density-dependent adult mortality) and provided a particularly strong example of a well-established mechanism (density-dependent recruitment). In combination, these two compensatory mechanisms have the potential to strongly regulate the abundance of this species, and rule out the control of abundance by the supply of recruits.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA","FORRESTER, GE (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, INST MARINE SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X",,,,60,132,133,0,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1995,103,3,,,,,275,282,,10.1007/BF00328615,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RR948,WOS:A1995RR94800003,28306820,,,,2021-09-27,

Freshwater snails are able to detect and respond to kairomones, from predators, and chemical cues, such as alarm cues, from other snails. Invasive species, such as the Chinese mystery snail (Cipangopaludina chinensis), are known to affect native species through competition and predation. This study examines the effects of competition and predation risks on the feeding rate of Helisoma trivolvis. Higher densities of competitors cause the snails to increase their feeding rate compared to no competition and low densities of competitive organisms. Presence of crayfish predators causes the snails to decrease their feeding rate and masks the effects of competitor density and type on the feeding rate. This study found no significant difference in feeding rates for the different treatments between the predation and crushed snails experiments, suggesting kairomones are more influential than alarm cues in altering foraging behavior. Despite the effects of Chinese mystery snails on the feeding rate of H. trivolvis, the invasion of Chinese mystery snails is likely to alter the community structure by consuming more algae and possibly increasing the feeding rate of native snails.","[Sura, Shayna A.; Mahon, Heidi K.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Mahon, HK (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",hmahon@nd.edu,,"Sura, Shayna/0000-0002-2143-8218",Bernard J.

The strength of these effects is spatiotemporally variable, and several sets of authors have suggested that they are governed in part by primary productivity. However, prior theoretical and field studies have generated conflicting results and predictions, underscoring the need for a synthetic global analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis of the direction and magnitude of large mammalian herbivore-initiated indirect interactions using 67 published studies comprising 456 individual responses. We georeferenced 41 of these studies (comprising 253 responses from 33 locations on five continents) to a satellite-derived map of primary productivity. Because predator assemblages might also influence the impact of large herbivores, we conducted a similar analysis using a global map of large carnivore species richness. In general, LMH reduced the abundance of other consumer species and also tended to reduce consumer richness, although the latter effect was only marginally significant. There was a pronounced reduction in the strength of negative (i.e. suppressive, due e.g., to competition) indirect effects of LMH on consumer abundance in more productive ecosystems. In contrast, positive (facilitative) indirect effects were not significantly correlated with productivity, likely because these comprised a more heterogeneous array of mechanisms. We found no effect of carnivore species richness on herbivore-initiated indirect effect strength. Our findings help to resolve the fundamental problem of ecological contingency as it pertains to the strength of an understudied class of multitrophic interactions. Moreover, these results will aid in predicting the indirect effects of anthropogenic wildlife declines and irruptions, and how these effects might be mediated by climatically driven shifts in resource availability. To the extent that intact ungulate guilds help to suppress populations of small animals that act as agricultural pests and disease reservoirs, the negative impacts of large mammal declines on human well-being may be relatively stronger in low-productivity areas.","[Daskin, Joshua H.; Pringle, Robert M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 106A Guyot Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Daskin, JH; Pringle, RM (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 106A Guyot Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",daskin@princeton.edu; rpringle@princeton.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1501306]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1355122, DEB-1457697]; Carr Foundation; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1457697, 1501306] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank members of the Pringle Lab (T.

However, whether and how complex food-webs respond to selection remain largely unknown. We show in the field that antagonistic selection from predators and pathogens on prey body-size can be a primary driver of food-web functioning. In Windermere, U.K., pike (Esox lucius, the predator) selected against small perch (Perca fluviatilis, the prey), while a perch-specific pathogen selected against large perch. The strongest selective force drove perch trait change and ultimately determined the structure of trophic interactions. Before 1976, the strength of pike-induced selection overrode the strength of pathogen-induced selection and drove a change to larger, faster growing perch. Predation-driven increase in the proportion of large, infection-vulnerable perch presumably favored the pathogen since a peak in the predation pressure in 1976 coincided with pathogen expansion and a massive perch kill. After 1976, the strength of pathogen-induced selection overrode the strength of predator-induced selection and drove a rapid change to smaller, slower growing perch. These changes made perch easier prey for pike and weaker competitors against juvenile pike, ultimately increasing juvenile pike survival and total pike numbers. Therefore, although predators and pathogens exploited the same prey in Windermere, they did not operate competitively but synergistically by driving rapid prey trait change in opposite directions. Our study empirically demonstrates that a consideration of the relative strengths and directions of multiple selective pressures is needed to fully understand community functioning in nature.","[Edeline, Eric; Ben Ari, Tamara; Vollestad, L.

Earlier work was criticized for failing to assess this possible source of variation. To evaluate this suggestion in relation to factors already known to be important in such communities, I incorporated estimates of recruitment with data from prior experiments in New England and Panama and reanalyzed the results using multiple regression. Rates of increase of prey abundance in predator exclusion experiments in New England were at least an order of magnitude greater than in Panama (e.g., it took 4-6 mth vs. 60-72 mth to reach 100% cover, respectively). Recruitment densities of sessile invertebrates and algae were variable in space and time at both sites, but were lower by at least an order of magnitude and less synchronous in Panama than in New England. The analyses indicated that, although predation, competition, recruitment, and level on the shore explained significant amounts of variation in community structure at both places, the proportionate contributions of these factors differed. In New England, recruitment explained at most 11% while predation and competition explained 50% to 78% of variation in sessile invertebrate abundance. In Panama, recruitment explained 39% to 87% while predation and competition explained 8 to 10% of variation in sessile invertebrate abundance.

Recent theory and experiments reveal that whether an interaction is beneficial or detrimental to the dynamics of a population often depends on species densities and other environmental factors. Here, we explore how, for suitable densities, facilitation may arise between two competing species with an Allee effect. We consider two different mechanisms for the Allee effect: 1) plant species with obligate insect pollination, and 2) generalist predation. In the first case, a second plant species, competing for nutrients, may have a facilitative effect by attracting more pollinators. In the second case, another potentially competing species may serve to satiate the same generalist predator and thereby have a facilitative effect. We explore three aspects of facilitation in each of the two systems. The focal species may benefit from the presence of a competitor' if it experiences 1) the removal of the Allee threshold, 2) a lowering of the Allee threshold, or 3) an increase in carrying capacity. We find that the latter two effects occur in both study systems whereas the first only occurs for the generalist predation system but not for the plant-pollination system. We give precise conditions on when such a facilitative effect can be expected. We also demonstrate several unexpected outcomes of these two-species interactions with multiple steady states, such as obligate co-occurence; we draw parallels to the dynamics of species known as ecosystem engineers', and we discuss implications for conservation and management.","[Lutscher, Frithjof; Iljon, Tzvia] Univ Ottawa, Dept Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1N 8G1, Canada","Lutscher, F (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Math & Stat, 585 King Edward Ave, Ottawa, ON K1N 8G1, Canada.",flutsche@uottawa.ca,"Lutscher, Frithjof/C-9484-2012","Lutscher, Frithjof/0000-0001-7380-7647",MITACS dispersal network; Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program at the Univ. of Ottawa; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Univ. of Ottawa,"We thank Risa Sargent for an inspiring presentation on pollen facilitation and Curtis McCloskey for valuable discussions in the early stages of the work.

These gastropods have shown to be important corallivores. The objective of this work was to evaluate in situ the prey selectivity of C. abbreviata and C. caribaea in some coral reefs of Morrocoy National Park by means of experimental and descriptive methods. We used quadrats of 1 m(2) to estimate coral abundance and richness, number of Coralliophila specimens, and coral species preyed on by Coralliophila sp. in three sites at each locality. For the experiment, we enclosed in cages five coral colonies of different species together with 10 individuals of C. abbreviata located in the center of the cages and equidistant to all colonies. A total of 8 exclusion cages of 1 m(3) were evaluated. We observed in situ a higher relation predator-prey between C. abbreviata and the hexacoral species M. annularis, representing 56.8% of the total interactions at all localities, followed by D. strigosa (19.3%), A. agaricites (12.2%), C. natans (4.6%) and A. tenuifolia (3.1%). C. caribaea presented a higher relation predator-prey with the octocoral species E. caribaeorum (42.6%), followed by those with the hexacoral species C. natans (24.1%), M. faveolata (11.1%), P. porites (7.4%) and D. strigosa (11.1%).

According to the outcomes C. abbreviata is thought to generate a larger impact than C. caribaea on Morrocoy National Park because its more common preys are mainly coral reef building species while C. caribaea predate mainly on E. caribaeorum, which is a competitive species of hexacorals.","[del Monaco, Carlos; Villamizar, Estrella] Cent Univ Venezuela, Lab Estudios Marino Costeros, Caracas, Venezuela; [Narciso, Samuel] Fdn Def Nat, Chichiriviche, Estado Falcon, Venezuela","del Monaco, C (corresponding author), Cent Univ Venezuela, Lab Estudios Marino Costeros, Apdo Postal 1080, Caracas, Venezuela.",carlosdelmonaco@gmail.com,,,,,,30,2,2,0,10,UNIV CATOLICA DE VALPARAISO,VALPARAISO,"AV BRASIL 2950, PO BOX 4059, VALPARAISO, CHILE",0718-560X,,,LAT AM J AQUAT RES,Lat.

Different size classes of L. littorea showed no significant difference in preferences when offered four kinds of either possible food or substrata (Fucus vesiculosus, Ulva lactuca, Carcinus maenas, brick). Large and medium winkles preferred Fucus vesiculosus, followed by Ulva lactuca. Dead shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) were the least preferred objects for all size classes. On the first day of the experiment bricks were more attractive to small littorines than to larger ones. Considering all four days, the same ranking occurred for all size classes: Fucus vesiculosus > Ulva lactuca > brick > Carcinus maenas. The reaction of juveniles to increased densities was examined using an in situ caging experiment on a mussel bed. Mesh size of the cages allowed adult densities to be increased while juveniles could escape by passing through the meshes. However, there was no significant emigration of small winkles even from cages with 10 to 20 times natural density of large individuals. Of greater importance was the original number of winkles at the site. The available resources on the mussel beds appear to be sufficient to maintain a high population density. Intraspecific competition does not seem to play a major role in this L. littorea-population.","Univ Greifswald, Inst Zool, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany","Fenske, C (corresponding author), Univ Greifswald, Inst Zool, JS Bach Str 11-12, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",,,,,,,54,13,13,1,25,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,OCT 3,1997,355,,,,,,29,39,,10.1023/A:1003079507242,,,11,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,YU860,WOS:000071763300005,,,,,2021-09-27,

Here, we investigated for the first time the foraging movements and activity patterns of Audouin's gull Larus audouinii by using satellite-tracking data from eight breeding adults in the main colony of the species worldwide (Ebro Delta, NW Mediterranean). Tagged gulls foraged in the marine area close to the breeding colony (62% of foraging locations) and in the terrestrial area of the Ebro Delta (mainly rice fields; 38% of foraging locations). The foraging activity patterns changed significantly throughout the day; lower from dusk through the first half of the night (19-1 h; 32% of active locations) and higher during the rest of the day (1-19 h; 75.5 +/- 4.3% of active locations). These results confirm the foraging plasticity of this seabird and, based on previous information about the dietary habits of this species, we hypothesize how its time-dependent activity patterns and habitat use could be associated with variations in the availability of marine food resources (e.g. diel vertical migrations of pelagic fish) and the exploitation of terrestrial resources (e.g. American crayfish Procarnbarus clarkii).

Traditionally it was believed that predators take only wounded, sick, old or otherwise low-quality individuals, and thus have little impact on prey populations. However, there is increasing evidence that, at least under certain circumstances, vertebrate predators may indeed limit prey numbers. This potential role of predators as limiting factors of prey populations has created conflicts between predators and human hunters, because the hunters may see predators as competitors for the same resources. A particularly acute conflict has emerged over the past few decades between gamebird hunters and birds of prey in Europe. As a part of a European-wide research project, we reviewed literature on the relationships between birds of prey and gamebirds. We start by analysing available data on the diets of 52 European raptor and owl species. There are some 32 species, mostly specialist predators feeding on small mammals, small passerine birds or insects, which never or very rarely include game animals (e.g. hares, rabbits, gamebirds) in their diet. A second group (20 species) consists of medium-sized and large raptors which prey on game, but for which the proportion in the diet varies temporally and spatially. Only three raptor species can have rather large proportions of gamebirds in their diet, and another seven species may utilise gamebirds locally to a great extent. We point out that the percentage of a given prey species in the diet of an avian predator does not necessarily reflect the impact of that predator on densities of prey populations. Next, we summarise available data on the numerical responses of avian predators to changing gamebird numbers. In half of these studies, no numerical response was found, while in the remainder a response was detected such that either raptor density or breeding success increased with density of gamebirds. Data on the functional responses of raptors were scarce. Most studies of the interaction between raptors and gamebird populations give some estimate of the predation rate (per cent of prey population taken by predator), but less often do they evaluate the subsequent reduction in the pre-harvest population or the potential limiting effect on breeding numbers. The few existing studies indicate that, under certain conditions, raptor predation may limit gamebird populations and reduce gamebird harvests. However, the number and extent of such studies are too modest to draw firm conclusions, Furthermore, their geographical bias to northern Europe, where predator prey communities are typically simpler than in the south, precludes extrapolation to more diverse southern European ecosystems. There is an urgent need to develop further studies, particularly in southern Europe, to determine the functional and numerical responses of raptors to gamebird populations in species and environments other than those already evaluated in existing studies. Furthermore, additional field experiments are needed in which raptor and possibly also mammalian predator numbers are manipulated on a sufficiently large spatial and temporal scale. Other aspects that have been little studied are the role of predation by the non-breeding part of the raptor population, or floaters, on the breeding success and survival of gamebirds, as well as the effect of intra-guild predation. Finally there is a need for further research on practical methods to reduce raptor predation on gamebirds and thus reduce conflict between raptor conservation and gamebird manageent.","Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Ringing Ctr, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Kincardine, Scotland; ERENA, Ordenamento & Gestao Recursos Nat, P-1000289 Lisbon, Portugal; CNRS, CEBC, F-79360 Viliers En Bois, France; Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, Direct Etudes & Rech, F-78612 Le Perray En Yvelines, France; Winfrith Technol Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England; Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; Frankfurt Zool Soc, Africa Reg Off, Arusha, Tanzania; IREC, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain","Valkama, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Ringing Ctr, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",jari.valkama@helsinki.fi,"Beja, Pedro/A-7851-2008; Manosa, Santiago/R-6693-2018; Arroyo, Beatriz/A-3504-2013; Redpath, Stephen/B-4640-2012","Beja, Pedro/0000-0001-8164-0760; Arroyo, Beatriz/0000-0002-4657-6609; Vinuela, Javier/0000-0002-8916-0398; Redpath, Stephen/0000-0001-5399-9477; Manosa, Santi/0000-0003-0681-1552; Valkama, Jari/0000-0002-0393-7320",,,,393,118,123,2,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

Predation and competition are major selective pressures influencing the evolution of rearing site selection. Poison frogs look after their clutches and deposit the newly hatched tadpoles in bodies of water where they remain until metamorphosis. In some species, cannibalism occurs, so parents deposit their tadpoles singly in very small pools. However, cannibalism also occurs in species that deposit tadpoles in larger pools already occupied by heterospecific or conspecific larvae that could be either potential predators or competitors. Here, I test the hypothesis that, given the choice, males of Dendrobates tinctorius would deposit their newly hatched tadpoles in low-risk sites for their offspring. I characterised the pools used by D. tinctorius for tadpole deposition, conducted experiments to determine the larval traits that predict the occurrence of and latency to cannibalism, and tested whether parents deposit their tadpoles in low-risk pools. I found that (1) neither pool capacity nor the presence of other larvae predict the presence/absence or number of tadpoles; (2) cannibalism occurs often, and how quickly it occurs depends on the difference in size between the tadpoles involved; and (3) the likelihood of males depositing their tadpoles in occupied pools increases with the size of the resident tadpole. I suggest that predation/cannibalism is not the only factor that parents assess when choosing deposition sites, and that the presence of larger conspecifics may instead provide information about pool quality and stability.","[Rojas, Bibiana] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Waurn Ponds, Vic 3216, Australia; [Rojas, Bibiana] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Ctr Excellence Biol Interact, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Rojas, B (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Ctr Excellence Biol Interact, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",bibiana.rojas@jyu.fi,"Rojas, Bibiana/M-2331-2019","Rojas, Bibiana/0000-0002-6715-7294",CIE at Deakin University (Australia),"This study was funded by the CIE at Deakin University (Australia).

We conducted two mesocosm experiments to determine whether breeding phenology and presence of Rana affect the growth, time to metamorphosis, and survival of Ambystoma (Experiment 1) and whether Rana density and access to Ambystoma embryos affect the growth, duration of larval period, and survival of both species (Experiment 2). Rana did not affect Ambystoma embryonic survival in either experiment. In Experiment 1, seasonal time of oviposition did not affect the overall response of Ambystoma larvae; however, Rana presence decreased larval survival and prolonged time to metamorphosis. In Experiment 2, relatively high tadpole density significantly reduced Ambystoma survival and decreased Rana survival, growth, and development. The results of this and other studies suggest that R. sylvatica may adversely affect A. maculatum through an array of context-dependent interactions, including indirect food web alteration, direct competition for benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton, and consumption of embryos. We provide a conditional interpretation of community organization that encompasses bottom-up and top-down effects generated by Rana on community members.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","Petranka, JW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Asheville, NC 28804 USA.",petranka@unca.edu,,,,,,14,11,14,0,22,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,DEC 15,2004,,4,,,,,932,939,,10.1643/CE-04-037R1,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,880QU,WOS:000225805100022,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, it has been observed empirically that in some settings it is possible to have coexistence. One example is Hutchinson's 'paradox of the plankton'. This is an instance where a large number of phytoplankton species coexist while competing for a very limited number of resources. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that temporal fluctuations of the environment can facilitate coexistence for competing species. Hutchinson conjectured that one can get coexistence because nonequilibrium conditions would make it possible for different species to be favored by the environment at different times. In this paper we show in various settings how a variable (stochastic) environment enables a set of competing species limited by a smaller number of resources or other density dependent factors to coexist. If the environmental fluctuations are modeled by white noise, and the per-capita growth rates of the competitors depend linearly on the resources, we prove that there is competitive exclusion. However, if either the dependence between the growth rates and the resources is not linear or the white noise term is nonlinear we show that coexistence on fewer resources than species is possible. Even more surprisingly, if the temporal environmental variation comes from switching the environment at random times between a finite number of possible states, it is possible for all species to coexist even if the growth rates depend linearly on the resources. We show in an example (a variant of which first appeared in Benaim and Lobry '16) that, contrary to Hutchinson's explanation, one can switch between two environments in which the same species is favored and still get coexistence.","[Hening, Alexandru] Univ Sydney, Sydney Math Res Inst, L4-42,Quadrangle A14, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Hening, Alexandru] Tufts Univ, Dept Math, Bromfield Pearson Hall,503 Boston Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Nguyen, Dang H.] Univ Alabama, Dept Math, 345 Gordon Palmer Hall,Box 870350, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Hening, A (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney Math Res Inst, L4-42,Quadrangle A14, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Hening, A (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Dept Math, Bromfield Pearson Hall,503 Boston Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",alexandru.hening@tufts.edu; dangnh.maths@gmail.com,,,,,,72,8,8,3,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0303-6812,1432-1416,,J MATH BIOL,J.

Two predators were inoculated to the cultivation system, the mixotrophic flagellate Ochromonas sp., an interception feeder, and the filter-feeding heterotrophic ciliate Cyclidium glaucoma. The system was sampled every second day over a period of 3 mo. The competition between algae and bacteria for limiting phosphorus (20 mu g P l(-1) d(-1)) was reflected in pronounced fluctuations of the ratio of algal versus bacterial biomass. High grazing pressure exerted on bacteria by the flagellate led to a strong decrease of bacterial abundance and biomass, with only few cells left freely dispersed. A succession of various grazing-resistant morphologies was observed, such as microcolonies, large aggregates and filaments. A population affiliated with Aquabacterium sp. formed grazing-resistant co-colonies with a Caulobacter spp., indicating that these 2 bacteria might find a common refuge from protistan grazing within aggregates or biofilms. During the course of the experiment these large colonies were succeeded by grazing-protected morphotypes related to the Flexibacter sancti-Flavobacterium ferrugineum lineage of the Sphingobacteriales. In contrast, the ciliate induced only a slight reduction of bacterial abundance, and bacteria even recovered to higher than original numbers after a few weeks. However, pronounced successions of microbial populations were also observed in the presence of the ciliate.","Univ Innsbruck, Inst Zool & Limnol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Posch, T (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Zool & Limnol, Technikerstr 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",thomas.posch@uibk.ac.at,"Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008; Salcher, Michaela/B-9970-2012; Salcher, Michaela M/A-1141-2013","Salcher, Michaela/0000-0003-1063-6523; Salcher, Michaela M/0000-0003-1063-6523",,,,49,34,35,1,35,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0948-3055,1616-1564,,AQUAT MICROB ECOL,Aquat.

The Angle Frequency Method (AFM) allows the detection of interactions in time series data. The AFM takes pairwise data plotted in phase diagrams and identifies signals (vector directions in phase diagrams) associated with particular interactions. Using microbial experimental systems consisting of predators (bacteriophage T4) and prey/competitors (strains of Escherichia coli), we demonstrate that the AFM can identify predator-prey and competitive interactions. The level of control afforded by such microbial experimental systems allows direct tests of the utility and robustness of the AFM. Signals of predation were distinct from signals of competition, with the strongest signal of predation corresponding to the collapse of the predator population at low prey densities. Signals of competition reflected the difference in competitive strength between the superior and the inferior competitors. In addition, the effects of invasion and resource enrichment on interactions in the laboratory communities were detectable using the AFM. Our analyses support results from model simulations and analyses of lake time series by identifying similar sets of signals characteristic of predation and competition, and demonstrate that the AFM is an effective tool in rigorous studies of time series.","Hgsk Telemark, Dept Environm Technol, Porsgrunn, Norway; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Sandvik, G (corresponding author), Hgsk Telemark, Dept Environm Technol, Porsgrunn, Norway.",gunnsa2@frisurf.no,"Bohannan, Brendan J.

If encounter rates with predators are proportional to activity level, then we might expect predation mortality to be affected by resource availability and predator density independent of the number of effective predators. In a factorial experiment, we tested whether predation mortality of larval wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, caused by a single larval dragonfly, Anax junius, was affected by the presence of additional caged predators and elevated resource levels. Observations were consistent with predictions. The survival rate of the tadpoles increased when additional caged predators were present and when additional resources were provided. There was no significant interaction term between predator density and food concentration. Lower predation rates at higher predator density is a form of interference competition. Reduced activity of prey at higher predator density is a potential general mechanism for this widespread phenomenon. Higher predation rates at low food levels provides an indirect mechanism for density-dependent predation. When resources are depressed by elevated consumer densities, then the higher activity levels associated with low resource levels can lead to a positive association between consumer density and consumer mortality due to predation. These linkages between variation in behaviour and density-dependent processes argue that variation in behaviour may contribute to the dynamics of the populations. Because the capture rate of predators depends on the resources available to prey, the results also argue that models of food-web dynamics will have to incorporate adaptive variation in behaviour to make accurate predictions.","Univ Toronto, Erindale Coll, Dept Zool, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Anholt, BR (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, POB 3020, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.",,,,,,,58,101,102,0,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

During CM periods, many plant species from various families synchronously flower and subsequently undergo community-level fruiting. Seed predation is a key factor in understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors affecting CM. Masting is proposed to decrease seed mortality due to predation in two ways: by depressing predator abundance through extended and unpredictable absences of seeds; and by satiating predators via mass seed production (predator satiation hypothesis). If the hypothesis is valid in these rainforests, the incidence of seed predation will be higher in a fruiting event that occurs soon after a previous fruiting event, because the intervening period of seed absence would be inadequate to starve the predators. In this study, we examined seed predation by insects, focusing on five dipterocarp species that exceptionally reproduced twice during an extended CM period. All of the five species suffered more intense seed predation in the second fruiting event, consistent with the prediction expected from the predator satiation hypothesis. Weevils, bark beetles and mammals were the main cause of increased seed predation in three, one and one plant species, respectively. However, seed predation intensity did not increase during the second fruiting event in a few combinations of predator and plant species. We discuss the possibility that competition for seeds among predators and/or the interspecific differences in life history traits among predators might affect the varying intensities of seed predation among dipterocarp species by different seed predators.","[Iku, Asano; Itioka, Takao] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Nihonmatsu Cho, Kyoto 6068316, Japan; [Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1530041, Japan; [Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko] Coll Arts & Sci, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1530041, Japan; [Shimizu-kaya, Usun; Sakai, Shoko] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Mohammad, Fatimah Bte; Hossman, Mohamad Yazid; Bunyok, Azimah; Abd Rahman, Mohd Yusuf; Meleng, Paulus] Forest Dept Sarawak, Res Dev & Innovat Div, KM 10 Jalan Datuk Amar Kalong Ningkan, Kuching 93250, Sarawak, Malaysia","Iku, A (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Nihonmatsu Cho, Kyoto 6068316, Japan.",asano_iku@yahoo.co.jp,,"Sakai, Shoko/0000-0002-4267-8405","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and CultureMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [21255004]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16J08043] Funding Source: KAKEN","This study was conducted in accordance with memorandums of understanding signed in November 2005 by the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC, Kuching, Malaysia) and the Japan Research Consortium for Tropical Forests in Sarawak (JRCTS, Sendai, Japan), and in December 2012 by the Sarawak Forest Department (SFD, Kuching, Malaysia) and JRCTS.

Typically, emphasis is on pattern emulation, and less on processes, such as competition, predation or habitat selection. Knowing how communities in the boreal forest assemble can provide further insight to the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the processes responsible, permitting assessments about whether forestry practices emulate processes as well as patterns. We contrasted variation in species richness among forest types, with stand area, and between local (forest stand) and regional (landscape) scales on managed and natural boreal landscapes in NW Ontario. Species richness varied more among forest stand types than between landscapes, or with stand area, on either landscape. On both landscapes, mean local species richness was 1/3 of regional richness, consistent with the hypothesis that competition structured stand-level assemblages regardless of stand origin. We further compared the structure of stand-level assemblages from randomized null models using presence/absence and abundance data with observed assemblages on each landscape, while controlling for variation in habitat structure among stands. Local bird assemblages were over-dispersed in niche space relative to random assemblages, also consistent with the competition hypothesis, regardless of stand origin. We found no evidence that patterns of variation in diversity of songbirds and woodpeckers, nor the processes that govern them, differed between managed and natural boreal forest landscapes. Our results suggest that past forest practices in this region, if by default, nevertheless emulated natural patterns of variation in diversity and species assembly of bird communities.","[Wyshynski, Sarah A.; Nudds, Thomas D.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Nudds, TD (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",tnudds@uoguelph.ca,,,Network of Centres of Excellence; The Canadian Forest Service and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources,"We thank Ian Thompson, James Baker, and John Fryxell for inviting our collaboration with the Marten Project in Ear Falls.

Alternatively, according to evolutionary game theory models, nonterritorial males should settle in the vicinity of high-quality sites and 'choose' to delay breeding until these habitats are vacant for them ('male player' hypothesis). However, nonterritorial male spatial distribution has not been experimentally tested. If the defeated male hypothesis is true (1) deterioration of high-quality sites should increase the number of nonterritorial males in a population and (2) vacated low-quality territories should be taken over by new territorial males. If the male player hypothesis is true, a similar manipulation should (1) decrease the number of nonterritorial males and (2) vacated low-quality territories should not be taken over. We performed two types of field experiment to test these hypotheses: male removal and patch quality manipulation. Our study species was the territorial damselfly Calopteryx splendens; males of this species exhibit both territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Our results suggest that deterioration of highquality habitats significantly reduced the number of nonterritorial males. The proportion of take-overs of the high-quality territories was significantly higher than that of low-quality territories. Our study supports the assumptions of the male player hypothesis and indicates that nonterritorial damselflies are more sensitive to habitat quality changes than territorial ones. Because nonterritorial individuals exist in most populations of territorial taxa, a better understanding of their settlement rules may be relevant for population dynamics and modelling.

In a dose response experiment, we compared Zn sensitivity, measured as body growth and reproduction, of these enchytraeids with that of animals taken from three unpolluted sites. Because C. sphagnetorum is a keystone species, regulating microbial processes in coniferous forest soil, we performed a microcosm experiment to study the interaction of enchytraeids from several sites with soil microbes. The idea was to study whether there is a link between metal stress response of individuals (tolerance level, life history alteration) and changes observed at higher organization levels of the biological system (trophic interaction and decomposition processes). We did not find evidence for increased metal tolerance of C. sphagnetorum. Worms from the polluted site actually had reduced body growth, indicating negative fitness effects caused by long-lasting metal stress. The density and biomass of the worm population from the polluted site was low in Zn contaminated soil. Presence of enchytraeids enhanced and Zn contamination reduced the activity of microbes in the soil. Enchytraeids from different sites with different life histories and population development, however, had the same effect on microbes. Hence, observed stress responses of individuals and populations could not be linked to density-dependent trophic interactions and ecosystem functioning in the soil-decomposer food chain.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Lahti 15140, Finland; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Salminen, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Niemenkatu 73, Lahti 15140, Finland.",janne.salminen@helsinki.fi,,"van Gestel, Kees/0000-0002-5651-0208",,,,41,6,6,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,,2001,10,6,,,,,351,361,,10.1023/A:1012266829555,,,11,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,479AG,WOS:000171381300002,11759568,,,,2021-09-27,

Here we use on-animal data loggers to assess whether such trade-offs can be revealed by the breathing rates (BR) and timing of breaths in long-finned pilot whales (Globicephela melas). We used the period immediately following foraging dives in particular, for which respiratory behavior can be expected to be optimized for gas exchange. Breath times and fluke strokes were detected using onboard sensors (pressure, 3-axis acceleration) attached to animals using suction cups. The number and timing of breaths were quantified in non-linear mixed models that incorporated serial correlation and individual as a random effect. We found that pilot whales increased their BR in the 5-10 min period prior to, and immediately following, dives that exceeded 31 m depth. While pre-dive BRs did not vary with dive duration, the initial post-dive BR was linearly correlated with duration of >2 min dives, with BR then declining exponentially. Apparent net diving costs were 1.7 (SE 0.2) breaths per min of diving (post-dive number of breaths, above pre-dive breathing rate unrelated to dive recovery). Every fluke stroke was estimated to cost 0.086 breaths, which amounted to 80-90% average contribution of locomotion to the net diving costs. After accounting for fluke stroke rate, individuals in the small body size class took a greater number of breaths per diving minute. Individuals reduced their breathing rate (from the rate expected by diving behavior) by 13-16% during playbacks of killer whale sounds and their first exposure to 1-2 kHz naval sonar, indicating similar responses to interspecific competitor/predator and anthropogenic sounds. Although we cannot rule out individuals increasing their per-breath O-2 uptake to match metabolic demand, our results suggest that behavioral responses to experimental sound exposures were not associated with increased metabolic rates in a stress response, but metabolic rates instead appear to decrease. Our results support the hypothesis that maximal performance leads to predictable (optimized) breathing patterns, which combined with further physiological measurements could improve proxies of field metabolic rates and per-stroke energy costs from animal-borne behavior data.","[Isojunno, Saana; Miller, Patrick James O'Malley] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Aoki, Kagari] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba, Japan; [Cure, Charlotte] UMRAE, Cerema Ifsttar, Strasbourg, France; [Kvadsheim, Petter Helgevold] Norwegian Def Res Estab, Horten, Norway","Isojunno, S (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",si66@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Waxler, Robert/S-4345-2018","isojunno, saana/0000-0002-2212-2135","NL Ministry of Defence; FR Ministry of Defence (DGA) [15860052]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research ProgramMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; NOR Ministry of Defence; United States Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-08-1-0984, N00014-10-1-0355, N00014-14-1-0390]","This work was funded by NL Ministry of Defence, NOR Ministry of Defence, United States Office of Naval Research (N00014-08-1-0984, N00014-10-1-0355, and N00014-14-1-0390), and FR Ministry of Defence (DGA) (public market no 15860052).

We used a factorial design to examine the combined foraging effects of herons and smallmouth bass on striped shiners and central stonerollers. We found that there was facilitation between the two predators, resulting in risk-enhancement for the prey species, with particularly pronounced effects on the smallest (< 70 mm) size classes. Facilitation is the least well-documented predator-predator interaction and has not been quantitatively demonstrated for freshwater and terrestrial predators.

Almost half of these species are tunicates, and all but one still occur only in PEI. Recent introductions include Styela clava Herdman in 1997, Botryllus schlosseri (Pallas) in 2001, Botrylloides violaceus Oka in 2002, and Ciona intestinalis (Linnaeus) in 2004. The goal of this paper was to investigate which characteristics of PEI estuaries may have resulted in their being more susceptible to tunicate invasions than estuaries elsewhere in the sGSL. At least one genus that recently established viable populations in PEI was previously introduced to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, apparently without establishing permanent populations. This implies that either propagule pressure has increased or environmental factors are more conducive to establishment now than they were previously. The fluctuating resource availability model predicts increased invasibility of environments that experience pulses of resources such as space or nutrients. Intense development of both agriculture and aquaculture in PEI, and high population density compared to other areas of the sGSL, are associated with high and fluctuating estuarine nutrient levels and a large surface area of artificial substrates (mussel socks) that is kept relatively free of competitors, and is replaced regularly. Changes in nutrient loading and the development of aquaculture have also occurred within the past two to three decades. The provision of artificial structure is likely a critical factor in the successful establishment of tunicates in PEI, because natural hard substrates are scarce. Facilitation by green crabs (Carcinus maenas L.) may be a contributing factor in the spread of Styela. Only one estuary lacking green crabs has an established population of Styela, and at least two known inoculations of Styela into estuaries without green crabs have failed. A likely mechanism for facilitation is the consumption by green crab of the snail Astyris lunata, a known Styela predator. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Shared enemies can also mediate non-reciprocal (-,0) indirect effects, i.e. indirect amensalism. whenever one prey species is not affected by the presence of alternative prey. We review 34 studies on terrestrial and freshwater systems to evaluate the extent to which apparent competition has been perceived as a reciprocal (-. -) or non-reciprocal (-,0) interaction. We found only three studies showing reciprocal effects between apparent competitors. Indirect amensalism was documented in 10 studies and could be inferred For 16 other cases (76% in total). The remaining five studies provided insufficient data to determine the form of indirect interaction. The apparent prevalence of non-reciprocal enemy-mediated interactions resembles that observed for resource-based interspecific competition. Amensal indirect effects via shared predation may result from differences in population size, nutritional value, susceptibility to attack, or asynchronous dynamics of alternative prey, or the predator's Feeding preferences. Moreover, experimental protocols may confound the actual form of apparent competition through short-term observations, incomplete designs, or biased consideration of conspicuous interactions, leading to reciprocal effects being overlooked. We conclude that. at present. it is still difficult to determine the relative role of apparent competition vs indirect amensalism in natural food webs because most published studies have failed to document in full interactions via shared enemies.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Chaneton, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Ecol, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,"Bonsall, Michael/0000-0003-0250-0423",,,,78,186,190,0,69,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2000,88,2,,,,,380,394,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880217.x,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,287QV,WOS:000085518000017,,,,,2021-09-27,

In the absence of spider mite prey, some individuals of immature phytoseiids showed increased development and survival with increasing predator densities up to certain limits, but none survived to the adult stage, except for a single male each of A. andersoni and A. fallacis who completed development by cannibalizing on conspecifics at a density of 32 predators per cage. In the absence of spider mite prey, the mean immature survival time was independent of the initial predator density, but the variance of survival time increased with predator density. In the presence of prey, the proportion of immatures surviving to adulthood generally decreased with initial predator density and dropped sharply to almost none at the predator density of 32 for A. fallacis, eight for A. andersoni, 16 for T. occidentalis and four for T. pyri. The number of prey consumed per predator during the first day generally decreased with predator density in all four species, as prey available per predator decreased and the competition for food increased with predator density. Our data indicate that scramble competition is operating in these four species. Although cannibalism was occasionally observed, especially after the exhaustion of prey and in the generalist predators such as A. andersoni, the immatures of these phytoseiids were less influenced by the interference of conspecifics than by the increasing difficulty of finding food at high predator densities. The implications of this study for understanding phytoseiid population dynamics and their use in biological control are discussed.","OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT ENTOMOL,CORVALLIS,OR 97331",,,"Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/C-4107-2009; Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/L-6079-2019","Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/0000-0003-4172-0592; Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/0000-0003-4172-0592",,,,0,28,31,0,3,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

In this study, we take advantage of the similar semiochemical communication of TF and TC to evaluate the abundance of adults of the two species concurrently using grids of traps baited with pheromone and host volatiles in stands of spruce. Adult TF emerged on average 2 wk before TC both in the field and under controlled laboratory conditions. This observation, combined with the early reproduction of emergent females, implies that the smaller (younger) larvae of native TC may be at increased risk of intra-guild predation by TF. The high spatial association between male and female TF in dense, aggregated populations suggests that the rate of mate encounter is depressed in sparse populations toward the edge of the invasive range. The higher level of spatial aggregation for TF than TC, particularly at high population density, suggests a higher propensity of adult TF to congregate at landmarks. Considering the broader range of host conditions, earlier seasonal emergence, and presumably more effective mate encounter for TF than TC, the exotic TF may be a superior competitor with the potential to displace or reduce the abundance of TC.","[Rhainds, Marc; Heard, Stephen B.; Sweeney, Jon D.; Silk, Peter; Flaherty, Leah] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada","Rhainds, M (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, POB 4000, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada.",mrhainds@nrcan.gc.ca,"Sweeney, Jonathan/Q-5281-2019; Heard, Stephen/C-2737-2012",,Natural Resources CanadaNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Canadian Forest ServiceNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Canadian Food Inspection Agency; Forest Protection Limited New Brunswick; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Nova Scotia Ministry of Natural Resources; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank G.

As a fundamental unit within a landscape, habitat patches create spatial heterogeneity. On a gradient of habitat patch size, one sees patches of denser vegetation cover occurring in otherwise open habitats (e.g. bushes in the desert, forest fragments in grasslands). 2. The resulting habitat fragmentation and consequent edge effects continue to concern conservation biologists, landscape ecologists, and wildlife managers due to their role in influencing wildlife abundance and distribution on broad geographic scales. 3. Although ecological processes near habitat edges often differ from processes away from edges, an animal's suitable habitat may increase or decrease by 'positive' or 'negative' edge effects. Such effects can be measured using behavioural indicators and experiments based on the costs and benefits of foraging under diminishing returns. 4. We used live trapping, giving-up densities [amount of food left behind in experimental food patches - giving-up density (GUD)] and geographic information system (GIS) analyses to test for spatial and temporal habitat selection by the four-striped grass mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) inhabiting a grassland containing distinct 'islands' of woody vegetation (500 m2 of average area). We investigated how these woody islands influence the quality of the grassland in terms of activity patterns, feeding opportunities, predation risk and habitat suitability. We used R. pumilio's GUDs to explicitly map and measure habitats of varying quality using GIS. 5. Our results showed that R. pumilio perceived the wooded patches as habitats with no opportunities and yet highly risky when opportunities are provided. Furthermore, the wooded patches had a negative edge effect, their unsuitability extended for 1-3 m into the otherwise suitable habitats. 6. The combination of live-trapping and giving up densities provided an unbiased and controlled measure of a prey's perception of habitat use and foraging costs when equal opportunities are simultaneously provided. These techniques and concepts should be broadly applicable by conservationists and ecologists interested in understanding and managing edge effects. 7. This approach aims to effectively quantify edge effects and extrapolate predation risk on a landscape scale, thereby developing recommendations for managers to improve the quality or amount of edges for wildlife.","[Abu Baker, Mohammad A.; Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Abu Baker, MA (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, 845 W Taylor St M-C 066, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",mabuba2@uic.edu,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012; Abu Baker, Mohammad/T-7967-2019","Abu Baker, Mohammad/0000-0003-1905-0879","Council on Africa program, the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, USA","We are grateful to Ian and Retha Gaigher (Lajuma Research Centre) for providing access to the study site and for logistical support.

Hypotheses related to environmental filters and biotic resistance were used most frequently to support studies on river the floodplain, but many studies not addressed the invasion theory.

I used a number of experiments to document competitor-induced behavior and morphology in wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica), to quantify how competitor-induced changes affected subsequent competitive ability, and to investigate the cues responsible for the competitor-induced response. Competitors induced wood frogs to increase their activity and generally develop larger bodies and smaller tails. Further, wood frogs were able to discriminate between intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Whereas behavioral responses to competitors are well documented, the widespread morphological responses are a new discovery; these responses are particularly intriguing because they are in the opposite direction of predator-induced responses in tadpoles. The competitor-induced phenotypes are not simply an allometric effect, but appear to be adaptive responses to competitors; competitor-induced wood frogs experienced higher relative growth rates than noninduced wood frogs in subsequent performance trials, but past studies suggest that the competitor-induced phenotype should experience higher predation risk. When responding to competition, wood frogs were not responding only to reduced food. They were able to sense changes in both the per capita food levels and changes in density (per unit volume) that were independent of per capita food level. Thus, these animals have an amazing ability to sense changes in their environments and respond in very precise ways. When one considers competitor-induced responses in light of past studies on predator-induced phenotypes in larval anurans, one sees that predator-induced traits provide individuals with increased predator resistance but decreased competitive ability, whereas competitor-induced traits provide individuals with increased competitive ability but decreased predator resistance. This suggests that predator- and competitor-induced plasticity have evolved an intricate link that presents a trade-off between competitive ability and predator resistance ability. This trade-off is common across species and makes sense in light of the environments in which wood frogs live, ranging from ponds with high densities of predators and few tadpoles competing to ponds with few predators and extremely high densities of tadpoles competing. Further, there is evidence that this type of plasticity trade-off might be quite common in other phenotypically plastic taxa.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea+@pitt.edu,,,,,,106,181,187,0,91,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Thus, how the few spider species occurring in the region choose their prey, and what prey taxa they focus on, may significantly affect the community structure of arctic arthropods. Here we estimate the ecological imprint of adult spiders of three large-bodied species coexisting in Northeast Greenland: the morphologically similar crab spiders Xysticus deichmanni and X. labradorensis (Thomisidae) and the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis (Lycosidae). To describe an important part of these spiders' diet in detail, we amplified and sequenced DNA from prey remains in their guts, selectively focusing on two of the most abundant prey orders in the area (Diptera and Lepidoptera). By comparing the resultant sequences to a reference library including most taxa encountered in the region, we assigned the prey to species. Among the spider taxa occurring in the region, the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis is dominant in terms of both biomass and density. All three spider species proved to be wide generalists, with no detectable differences in prey choice among either the two crab spiders, or among these crab spiders and the wolf spider. This lack of dietary differentiation among species may be caused by the limited prey availability in the Arctic, forcing the predators to both generalism and opportunism. Given the substantial abundance of spiders and the lack of other predatory arthropods in the region, the opportunistic prey choice observed implies that these High-Arctic spider species have the potential for inflicting a strong influence on their prey community.","[Wirta, Helena K.; Roslin, Tomas] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Spatial Foodweb Ecol Grp, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Weingartner, Elisabeth; Hamback, Peter A.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Wirta, HK (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Spatial Foodweb Ecol Grp, Latokartanonkaari 5, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",helena.wirta@helsinki.fi,"Hamback, Peter A/A-8194-2008; Roslin, Tomas/E-8648-2016; Wirta, Helena/U-1892-2019","Hamback, Peter A/0000-0001-6362-6199; Roslin, Tomas/0000-0002-2957-4791; Wirta, Helena/0000-0002-4667-2166",INTERACT (project QUANTIC) under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme; University of Helsinki [788/51/2010]; Carl Tryggers Foundation; Kone Foundation,"We thank Riikka Kaartinen, Gergely Varkonyi and Kristiina Visakorpi for their invaluable contribution to field work at Zackenberg, and Bess Hardwick and the Zackenberg station for excellent logistics.

However, the effect of CE on weed occurrence has received little attention. A 5-yr successive experiment (2015 to 2019) was conducted to compare weed occurrence in CE and a corn (Zea mays L.) monoculture (CM). The results show that CE significantly decreased weed diversity, the dominance index, total weed density, and biomass, but increased the weed evenness index. The 5-yr mean number of weed species per plot was 8.4 in CE and 10.7 in CM. Compared with those in CM, the 5-yr mean density and biomass of total weeds in CE decreased by 59.2% and 66.6%, respectively. The effect of CE on weed occurrence was species specific. The mean density of large crabgrass [Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.], green foxtail [Setaria viridis (L.) P. Beauv.], goosegrass [Eleusine indica (L.)

However, predation is a strong mortality factor for members of the tit guild and predation risk may restrict the selection of foraging sites and organisation of the mixed-species tit flock. We evaluated pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) predation on North European tits and goldcrests. A literature analysis of six areas showed clearly that pygmy owls feed more heavily on those species that forage on exterior tree parts (coal tit P. ater and goldcrest Regulus regulus). These species are also subdominant in mixed-species flocks. The dominant species, crested tit (P. cristatus) and willow tit (P. montanus) were killed less frequently by pygmy owls. These two species forage on the inner parts of trees. The predation or competition hypothesis cannot alone explain the foraging site selection by the dominant species. There is more arthropod food on the outer parts ot branches and predation pressure is also higher on the outer parts of the tree. The most dominant species. crested tit, forages in the middle part of branches. We suggest that in the Parus guild there is a trade-off between predation risk and interspecific competition for food.

Against the background of surface temperature, salinity and chlorophyll-a distributions, major seasonal changes in plankton biomass distributions and specific production of copepods were seen. High biomass levels in October rapidly declined into November and January, especially in the north. These changes were followed by early (January/February) production and biomass increases in the southeastern North Sea. Although lowest between November and January, depending on species and location, production continued for many copepod species throughout the winter, despite low temperatures and large predator populations. It was concluded that winter survival of herring larvae and other predators was enhanced by herbivore production in the southeastern North Sea, and that in the north, low herbivore production, competition and predation decreased the probabilities of predator survival. Copepod overwintering strategies and the implications of winter herbivore production and predator abundance for later plankton production processes are discussed.","DANISH INST FISHERIES & MARINE RES,DK-2920 CHARLOTTENLUND,DENMARK","HAY, SJ (corresponding author), MARINE LAB,SOAFD,POB 101,VICTORIA RD,ABERDEEN AB9 8DB,SCOTLAND.",,"Kiorboe, Thomas/ABI-4733-2020; Kiorboe, Thomas/G-3190-2011","Kiorboe, Thomas/0000-0002-3265-336X",,,,49,92,92,0,25,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0278-4343,,,CONT SHELF RES,Cont.

Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability. 2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature. 3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change. 4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change.","NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Kincardine, Scotland","Hulme, PE (corresponding author), NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Kincardine, Scotland.",pehu@ceh.ac.uk,"Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011","Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474",,,,92,254,271,1,237,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Prior studies have revealed that intertidal hermit crabs can be attracted to chemical cues from predated gastropods. Yet their attraction is usually assumed to be driven primarily by the availability of new shells rather than by food. We conducted field experiments to assess hermit crabs' potential role as generalist carrion scavengers on the California Coast, examining their speed of attraction and the size of the aggregations they formed in response to chemical cues from freshly smashed gastropods and mussels, both of which indicated available carrion. Compared to all other marine species, hermit crabs (Pagurus samuelis, P. hirsutiusculus, and P. granosimanus) were the fastest to arrive at the provisioning sites. Hermit crabs also dominated the provisioning sites, accumulating in the largest numbers, with aggregations of up to 20 individuals, which outcompeted all other scavengers for carrion. Notably, hermit crabs arrived equally quickly for both smashed gastropod and mussel, even though the latter does not offer suitable shells for hermit crabs and even though the former only yields shell-related chemical cues over time frames longer than our experiments. These results thus suggest that shell availability is not the only, or even the primary, reason marine intertidal hermit crabs aggregate at carrion sites; they also aggregate to forage, thereby playing an important role as active carrion scavengers in intertidal ecosystems.","[Laidre, Mark E.; Greggor, Alison L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Laidre, ME (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",mark.laidre@dartmouth.edu,"Greggor, Alison/H-6956-2019","Greggor, Alison/0000-0003-0998-618X",Miller Institute at Berkeley,"We thank the Bodega Marine Laboratory and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for permission to conduct this research.

Location Eastern islands of the Canary Islands archipelago. Methods We compared climatic patterns (temperature and rainfall), habitat and microhabitat structure, food availability during a full annual cycle, and the abundance of native avian competitors and predators inside and outside the species' range. Three study areas, located in similar habitats on nearby islands, were studied: northern Fuerteventura, close to the northern border of the species' range; southern Lanzarote, 22 km from the nearest site occupied by stonechats; and the Lobos islet, 10 km from the nearest occupied site and 2 km from the coast of Fuerteventura. Results The cover of suitable habitats (slopes with high cover of large shrubs, stony fields and ravines) and microhabitats (shrubs and boulders) and the abundance of arthropods during the breeding period of Canary Islands stonechats were lower outside than inside the species' range. Temperature, rainfall and the abundance of competitors and predators inside and outside the species' range did not differ significantly. Main conclusions Ecological requirements explaining the distribution of the Canary Islands stonechat within its range seem to be the main factor hindering its settlement on nearby islands. Geological and palaeoclimatic processes, as well as past and current human impact, could also have constrained the distribution of this narrow-range endemic bird species.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ La Laguna, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim Zool, Tenerife, Canary Isl, Spain; Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Medio Ambiente, Dept Ciencias Ambientales, Toledo, Spain; CSIC, IPNA, Isl Ecol & Evolut Res Grp, Tenerife, Canary Isl, Spain","Illera, JC (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",j.illera@uea.ac.uk,"Nogales, Manuel/I-9831-2014; Illera, Juan Carlos/C-6583-2014","Nogales, Manuel/0000-0002-5327-3104; Illera, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-4389-0264",,,,68,12,14,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

While it is recognized that some tadpoles are predaceous, little attention has been given to understanding how tadpoles shape age and size structures of populations and the composition of tadpole assemblages. I examined the incidence of intraguild predation (IGP) among three species that co-occur In ephemeral pools In the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. I found a high Incidence of IGP among the three species, with IG predators differing in their voracity for prey eggs and IG prey differing In their vulnerability to IGP. I also examined the factors that influence the Intensity of cannibalism and tadpole performance In a model species, Smilisca phaeota. I manipulated predator and prey size and developmental stage, tadpole density, food quantity, and tadpole relatedness in microcosm experiments. Cannibalism in S. phaeota was dependent on tadpole predator and prey size and developmental stage, with medium and large tadpoles causing almost complete mortality of embryos, but little mortality of mobile hatchlings. In contrast, predation by small tadpoles was restricted primarily to the embryo developmental stage. Tadpole mortality was high In low plant food quantity treatments, suggesting a high Incidence of cannibalism. Other measures of tadpole performance, including survival to metamorphosis, metamorph mass, and larval period, were influenced by tadpole density and plant food quantity. Additions of conspecific prey eggs and degree of tadpole relatedness did not affect tadpole performance. My results suggest that tadpoles are capable of playing a regulatory role, Influencing the relative abundance and composition of species in pools through differential IGP and cannibalism on eggs and hatchlings. The Intensity of IGP In ephemeral pools Is likely Influenced by the morphology of IG predators, reproductive mode and fecundity of IG prey, and priority effects. My study supports the view that we need to reconsider the position tadpoles occupy within the aquatic food webs, with greater appreciation for their role as predators.","Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Hawley, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Dept Biol, POB 249118, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",thawley@bio.miami.edu,,,Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency,"I thank P. and G.

We use both stochastic and field theory simulations in one and two spatial dimensions, as well as analytical arguments, to describe the association at the interfaces of mutually neutral individuals belonging to enemy partnerships and to probe their role in the development of the dynamical structures at the interfaces. We identify an interesting behavior associated with the symmetric or asymmetric evolution of the interface profiles depending on whether N/2 is odd or even, respectively. We also show that the macroscopic evolution of the interface network is not very sensitive to the internal structure of the interfaces. Although this work focuses on cyclic predator-prey models with an even number of species, we argue that the results are expected to be quite generic in the context of spatial stochastic May-Leonard models.","[Avelino, P.

However, these interactions are highly dependent on the type and behaviour of the prey, an aspect of IGP that is frequently overlooked. Here we demonstrate how a parasitoid (Dolichogenidea tasmanica) facilitates attack on a lepidopteran larva (Epiphyas postvittana) by a predatory mite (Anystis baccarum). We show that anti-predator behaviour of the lepidopteran larva is the mechanism that facilitates this. E. postvittana is protected by its silken leaf roll which limits predation by the mite except when the larva is attacked by the parasitoid causing the larva to leave its shelter. We explored the implications of the interactions among these three species for pest suppression by modelling changes in mite density and mite predation intensity. The presence of mites (the IG predator) always leads to a decrease in ability of the parasitoid to control E. postvittana and, as mite predation intensity increases, the ability of the parasitoid to suppress E. postvittana decreases. The results from the experiment show a synergistic interaction, but results from the population model show an interaction resulting in pest release. These findings support the general idea that if uni-directional IGP occurs, and competition is strong between the top and intermediate predator, then a single best control agent will likely be more effective at suppressing the prey population than multiple control agents combined. These findings have important implications for the management of E. postvittana in vineyards across Southern Australia and for other multi-species systems.","[Paull, C. A.; Austin, A.

Several mechanisms may be responsible for the decline in distribution and abundance of European pearl mussel populations, but almost no quantitative data exists about the possible negative impacts of invasive alien species (IAS). In this study, we clearly demonstrate that the invasive signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus predates pearl mussels, using a laboratorial experiment followed by in situ validation in four rivers in the North of Portugal (Mente, Rabacal, Tuela and Baceiro Rivers; Douro Basin). In the laboratory, the crayfish had a clear preference for small-sized pearl mussels but no differences in predation were found in mesocosms with and without sediment. In addition, we clearly demonstrated that the signal crayfish predates pearl mussels in natural conditions and detected a significant density dependent effect (i.e., sites with more crayfish presented higher number of pearl mussel shells with marks of predation). Given the recent introduction of the signal crayfish and the potential negative impacts on pearl mussel populations we also investigated its autoecology (distribution, abundance, size structure and sex-ratio) in the four studied rivers. Significant differences in average abundance and size of the crayfish were detected between sites and the sex-ratio was highly skewed to females.

It is not so much tested as used. It helps behavioural ecologists discover the nature of the information in an animal's brain. It helps population ecologists reveal coefficients of interaction and their patterns of density-dependent variation. And it helps community ecologists examine niche relationships. In our studies on two species of Negev desert gerbil, we have taken advantage of the second and third of these functions. Both these gerbils prefer semi-stabilized dune habitat, and both altered their selective use of this habitat and stabilized sand according to experimental changes we made in their populations. Their changes in selectivity agree with a type of optimal foraging theory called 'isoleg theory'. Isoleg theories provide examples of dipswitch theories - bundles of articulated qualitative predictions - that are easier to falsify than single qualitative predictions. By linking behaviour to population dynamics through isoleg theory, we were able to use the behaviour of the gerbils to reveal the shapes of their competitive isoclines. These have the peculiar non-linear shapes predicted by optimal foraging theory. Finally, when owl predation threatens, the behaviour of Gerbillus allenbyi reveals the shape of their victim isocline. As has long been predicted by predation theory and laboratory experiments, it is unimodal.","BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV, DEPT BIOL, IL-84105 BEER SHEVA, ISRAEL","Rosenzweig, ML (corresponding author), UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.",,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012",,,,,53,73,73,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

A central focus of ecology is to understand the conditions under which biotic interactions affect species' abundance and distribution. Classic and recent studies have shown that biotic interactions can strongly impact local or regional patterns of species abundance, but two fundamental questions remain largely unaddressed for non-competitive biotic interactions. First, do the effects of these interactions on population performance change predictably with environmental context? Second, to what extent do population-scale effects contribute to limiting species' geographic distributions? 2. To address these questions, we experimentally assessed the extent to which pollen limitation and insect seed predators affected the fecundity and projected population growth rate (lambda) of the native forb Astragalus utahensis. We studied populations at the centre and northern edge of the latitudinal range of A. utahensis that occur across a gradient in abiotic harshness characterized primarily by declining mean annual precipitation. 3. Supplementing pollen and suppressing pre-dispersal seed predators increased seed production similarly within A. utahensis populations at the centre and northern edge of the range. Integral projection population models revealed that relaxing these checks on seed production tended to increase. in most populations, regardless of their location within the range. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that pollen limitation and insect herbivores limit population growth in A. utahensis similarly across the centre-to-north portion of its latitudinal distribution. However, because A. utahensis population growth barely reaches the level of replacement at the northern range edge, the reduction in. resulting from these interactions may contribute to limiting expansion at the northern edge of A. utahensis' latitudinal range.","[Baer, Kathryn C.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Dept Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Baer, Kathryn C.] USDA Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Anchorage, AK USA","Baer, KC (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.; Baer, KC (corresponding author), USDA Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Anchorage, AK USA.",kcbaer2@gmail.com,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518, DEB_0614406, DGE-1313190]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518, DEB_0614406 and DGE-1313190",,90,14,14,1,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Predator environments (i.e., isolated predators, conspecific pairs, and interspecific pair) were used to identify multiple predator effects on prey by comparing observed predation to that predicted from the multiplicative risk model. Behavioural data and per capita consumption rates provided insight into mechanisms underlying observed multiple predator effects on prey. Experiments were conducted at various spatial scales in the laboratory and field. In all experiments, dogwhelks reduced or ceased feeding when a green crab was present compared to isolated dogwhelks, although overall predation was not influenced. Independent multiple predator effects on prey, where observed and predicted consumption did not differ, were usually maintained because crabs and whelks forage on dissimilar time scales. Contrary to other studies, interference competition through aggressive encounters was not observed for dogwhelk and green crab conspecifics, or the interspecific pair, and non-independent multiple predator effects on prey in the form of risk reduction did not result. Spatial scale appeared to influence some outcomes of predator interactions. In large tanks, green crab conspecifics and the interspecific pair caused risk enhancement for prey. This resulted from increased search time, increased per capita consumption rate, and decreased handling time per prey of crabs, and was likely induced by longer residence time of water in the large tanks compared to smaller tanks. In small tanks, dogwhelks with a conspecific had higher per capita consumption rates than isolated dogwhelks, suggesting risk enhancement for prey. However, dogwhelks were unable to consume enough prey over the experiment to allow detection of a non-independent multiple predator effect on prey by comparing observed to predicted consumption. Predator species that operate on different time scales of predation may have independent multiple predator effects on prey even when changes to individual predator behaviours or per capita consumption rates occur. Examination of predator behaviours and per capita consumption rates, in addition to the full suite of predator environments, is essential to fully understand dynamics among multiple conspecific and interspecific predators, particularly when predator species forage on dissimilar time scales.

Although both richness and species composition of the plant community at the study site were largely determined by abiotic factors (mainly rainfall and soil nutrients), predator and herbivore exclusion had significant effects on the relative abundance of several plant species. Experimental exclusion of herbivores was associated with increased cover of some shrubs and a perennial grass, and decreased cover and seed densities of several ephemerals, especially those exotic or restricted to areas underneath shrubs. Herbivores apparently reduced shrubs through browsing and indirectly affected herb cover and seed densities by opening up areas under shrubs and/or modifying physical and chemical conditions of the soil. Plant responses to predator exclusion were less clear. Nevertheless, higher cover of some shrubs and ephemerals in the presence of predators suggests tritrophic effects through changes in small mammal densities and/or foraging behavior.","NO ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, DE KALB, IL 60115 USA; COMIS NACL MEDIO AMBIENTE, SANTIAGO, CHILE; PONTIFICIA UNIV CATOLICA CHILE, DEPT ECOL, SANTIAGO, CHILE","Gutierrez, JR (corresponding author), UNIV LA SERENA, DEPT BIOL, CASILLA 599, LA SERENA, CHILE.",,"Jaksic, Fabian M/G-1705-2014","Jaksic, Fabian M/0000-0003-0098-0291",,,,63,80,86,0,32,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,1997,109,3,,,,,398,406,,10.1007/s004420050099,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WJ884,WOS:A1997WJ88400010,28307537,,,,2021-09-27,

The relative importance of habitat complexity on the availability of littoral-benthic species of Cladocera, including Alonella exigua, A. excisa and A. nana (Chydoridae), to planktonic predators (Leptodora and cyclopoid copepods) was investigated in a series of laboratory experiments and under natural conditions (Lake Piaseczno, eastern Poland). The laboratory experiments showed that invertebrate predators influenced the density of cladocerans, but that predatory success was related to spatial complexity. A treatment imitating a habitat of water milfoil provided the highest survival rate, whereas a treatment imitating a habitat of macroalgae provided the lowest survival rate of the Alonella species, independently of the type of predators. Leptodora showed a higher predation pressure than did the cyclopoid copepods in a treatment imitating a habitat of common reed. In the field research, inverse correlations between the density of Alonella and potential invertebrate predators in distinct habitats were found. The species most strongly preyed on under the experimental conditions showed the highest fecundity, thus suggesting that the predation pressure by planktonic invertebrates influences the demography and life-history trade-offs of juvenile Alonella individuals in the lake. The obtained results extend our knowledge on the type and magnitude of interactions between the littoral-benthic and pelagic food webs.","Univ Life Sci, Dept Hydrobiol, PL-20262 Lublin, Poland","Adamczuk, M (corresponding author), Univ Life Sci, Dept Hydrobiol, Bogdana Dobrzanskiego 37, PL-20262 Lublin, Poland.",malgorzata.adamczuk@up.lublin.pl,,"Adamczuk, Malgorzata/0000-0003-3599-2006",,,,34,6,6,0,21,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

Lionfish are small-bodied predators that can reduce the abundance and diversity of native fishes via predation. Additionally, native predators or competitors appear to have a negligible effect on similarly sized lionfish. Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) are a regionally endangered, large predator found throughout lionfish's invasive range. Because lionfish and Nassau grouper occupy similar habitats and use similar resources, there is potential for competition between these two species. Using large, outdoor in-ground tanks, we investigated how lionfish and Nassau grouper affect each other's behavior by comparing their distance from and use of shelter when in isolation versus when both species were in the presence of each other with limited shelter. We found that Nassau grouper, which displayed a high affinity for shelter in isolation, avoided lionfish in two distinct ways; (1) groupers positioned closer to and used limited shelter more when paired with similarly sized lionfish and (2) grouper moved much further away from shelter when paired with smaller lionfish. We also found that neither large lionfish nor large Nassau grouper preyed upon smaller individuals of the opposite species suggesting that Nassau grouper do not recognize small lionfish as prey. This study highlights how invasive lionfish may affect native Nassau grouper, and suggests that competition for shelter between these two species may be size dependent.","[Raymond, Wendel W.; Albins, Mark A.; Pusack, Timothy J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Raymond, WW (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, 620 Univ Rd, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA.",wraymond@u.washington.edu,"Raymond, Wendel/AAL-7689-2020","Raymond, Wendel/0000-0003-3597-2435","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [08-51162, 12-33027]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Oregon State University Undergraduate Research, Innovation, Scholarship & Creativity (URISC); Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1233027] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank the staff and interns of the Perry Institute for Marine Science at Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas for their help and logistical support.

The site is unusual in that the amphipod Corophium volutator is absent. In flats where the above polychaetes and Corophium co-occur, fish and shorebird predators significantly affect Corophium abundance but not polychaete abundance. Experiments were performed at Porter Point to determine whether fish and shorebirds depress polychaete abundance in the absence of their preferred prey. Caging experiments, with cages erected in late May 1985 and sampled in early July and in late August, revealed that Tharyx abundance was significantly higher within cages, demonstrating a significant effect of epibenthic predators. No other species showed significant differences in abundance between caged and control areas. Experiments demonstrate that fish prey on Tharyx but shorebirds do not. No species showed significant differences in abundance between caged and control areas in October collections. Winter ice, present between mid-December and mid-March, did not lead to a decline in the abundance of any taxon.

However, connectivity can also negatively affect diversity by allowing the spread of strong competitors or predators. In a microcosm experiment with five ciliate species as prey and a copepod as an efficient generalist predator, we analysed the effect of connectivity on prey species richness in metacommunities that were either unconnected, connected for the prey, or connected for both prey and predator. Presence and absence of predator dispersal was cross-classified with low and high connectivity. The effect of connectivity on local and regional richness strongly depended on whether corridors were open for the predator. Local richness was initially positively affected by connectivity through rescue of species from stochastic extinctions. With predator dispersal, however, this positive effect soon turned negative as the predator spread over the metacommunity. Regional richness was unaffected by connectivity when local communities were connected only for the prey, while predator dispersal resulted in a pronounced decrease of regional richness. The level of connectivity influenced the speed of richness decline, with regional species extinctions being delayed for one week in weakly connected metacommunities. While connectivity enabled rescue of prey species from stochastic extinctions, deterministic extinctions due to predation were not overcome through reimmigration from predator-free refuges. Prey reimmigrating into these sink habitats appeared to be directly converted into increased predator abundance. Connectivity thus had a positive effect on the predator, even when the predator was not dispersing itself. Our study illustrates that dispersal of a species with strong negative effects on other community members shapes the dispersal-diversity relationship. When connections enable the spread of a generalist predator, positive effects of connectivity on prey species richness are outweighed by regional extinctions through predation.","[Limberger, Romana; Wickham, Stephen A.] Salzburg Univ, Dept Organism Biol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria","Limberger, R (corresponding author), Salzburg Univ, Dept Organism Biol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",romana.limberger@stud.sbg.ac.at,,"Limberger, Romana/0000-0002-9421-7520","Austrian Science Fund, FWFAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [P19117-B17]; University of Salzburg","This study was funded by the Austrian Science Fund, FWF, grant P19117-B17 to S.

Possible causes for the differences in size-structure could be differences in environmental factors at the two creeks, differential competition at the two sites, inherent factors causing a greater growth rate in the PC population, differences in reproductive timing, or differential predation at the two sites. Lab microcosm studies were used to examine the possibility of inherent population differences or environmental conditions (including differences in salinity) causing faster growth in PC. There was no evidence that PC shrimp grew faster than TK shrimp, nor that PC conditions fostered greater growth compared to TK. Salinity adjustments in PC and TK tanks also had no effect on growth. Therefore, it appears that genetic and environmental factors did not play a significant role in greater shrimp growth in PC. In the field, data on relative abundances of Fundulus heteroclitus and P. pugio, and size-frequency distributions of P. pugio were collected from the two estuaries. Gravid females and recruits of young shrimp physically appeared at approximately the same time within both systems, eliminating earlier reproduction as a cause of the size discrepancy. There were three times as many shrimp in PC than in TK (eliminating the possibility of increased population density and competition at TK as a cause) and three times as many F. heteroclitus present in TK than in PC. Since it has already been established that the Fundulus at PC are smaller than at TK and that they are poor predators, differences in Fundulus predation would appear to be an important factor in determining the number and size-frequency of the grass shrimp.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; Langan Engn & Environm Serv Inc, Elmwood Pk, NJ 07407 USA; New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn Chem & Environm Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA","Weis, JS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",jweis@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,,,,,34,11,12,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAY,2001,450,1-3,,,,,231,241,,10.1023/A:1017505229481,,,11,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,472BP,WOS:000170963600020,,,,,2021-09-27,

Coral-dwelling gobies are habitat specialist fishes that depend on the availability of a few key species of coral for their survival and rely on skin toxins to reduce predation risk. This study investigated the influence of benthic substratum around coral colonies on patterns of habitat use and toxicity of two species of coral-dwelling gobies (Gobiodon erythrospilus and Gobiodon histrio) that compete for access to the coral, Acropora nasuta. Field surveys demonstrated that the benthic substratum around A. nasuta coral colonies differed between colonies occupied by G. histrio and G. erythrospilus. Juvenile, single adult and breeding pairs of G. erythrospilus mostly inhabited A. nasuta colonies surrounded by branching corals. In contrast, juvenile and single adult G. histrio associated with A. nasuta coral colonies that had adjacent epilithic algal matrix and G. histrio breeding pairs inhabited colonies surrounded by sand/rubble. Habitat choice experiments demonstrated that both goby species prefer A. nasuta coral colonies with benthic substratum mainly composed by epilithic algal matrix and sand; suggesting that competition for coral colonies in preferred locations could influence patterns of habitat use observed in the field. The substratum around preferred coral colonies also influenced the toxicity levels of associated fishes. Gobies inhabiting A. nasuta coral colonies surrounded by epilithic algal matrix and sand showed higher levels of toxicity than gobies collected from colonies surrounded by branching corals. Given the potential for toxicity level to reduce the risk of predation, this could explain why gobies would compete for access to colonies of the preferred coral species surrounded by epilithic algal matrix and sand. These results show that the habitat use of coral habitat specialist fishes can be affected by the benthic composition around preferred coral colonies and demonstrate how competition for important secondary resources can influence patterns of habitat use.","[Pereira, Pedro Henrique Cipresso] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Pereira, Pedro Henrique Cipresso] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Pereira, PHC (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Pereira, PHC (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",pedro.pereira@my.jcu.edu.au,,,ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; CNPq scholarshipConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"I thank Matthew Jankowski, Rahel Zemoi and the staff at Lizard Island Research Station for assistance with field work.

However, interspecific interactions did not differ significantly from the effects of intraspecific competition. Larval growth and survival were negatively correlated with the duration of water in the pond, and both species had similar mortality rates during two years of contrasting environmental extremes. Both species exhibited similar microhabitat usage when alone, When refugia were absent, both species suffered heavy mortality. Shifts in microhabitat use when refugia were present resulted in increased survivorship of larvae. Behaviors resulting in habitat partitioning and the use of refugia by larvae may be important components for the coexistence of A. maculatum and A. jeffersonianum in breeding ponds.

Carnivorous plants are unusual in that they can be simultaneously engaged with animals in multiple mutualistic and antagonistic interactions including reversed plant-animal interactions where they are the predator. Competition with animals is a potential antagonistic plant-animal interaction unique to carnivorous plants when they and animal predators consume the same prey. The goal of this field study was to test the hypothesis that under natural conditions, sundews and spiders are predators consuming the same prey thus creating an environment where interkingdom competition can occur. Over 12 months, we collected data on 15 dates in the only protected Highland Rim Wet Meadow Ecosystem in Kentucky where sundews, sheet-web spiders, and ground-running spiders co-exist. One each sampling day, we attempted to locate fifteen sites with: (a) both sheet-web spiders and sundews; (b) sundews only; and (c) where neither occurred. Sticky traps were set at each of these sites to determine prey (springtails) activity-density. Ground-running spiders were collected on sampling days. DNA extraction was performed on all spiders to determine which individuals had eaten springtails and comparing this to the density of sundews where the spiders were captured. Sundews and spiders consumed springtails. Springtail activity-densities were lower, the higher the density of sundews. Both sheet-web and ground-running spiders were found less often where sundew densities were high. Sheet-web size was smaller where sundew densities were high. The results of this study suggest that asymmetrical exploitative competition occurs between sundews and spiders. Sundews appear to have a greater negative impact on spiders, where spiders probably have little impact on sundews. In this example of interkingdom competition where the asymmetry should be most extreme, amensalism where one competitor experiences no cost of interaction may be occurring.","[Krupa, James J.; Gruber, Samuel B.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Hopper, Kevin R.] Bluegrass Community & Tech Coll, Biol Sci, Lexington, KY USA; [Schmidt, Jason M.; Harwood, James D.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY USA; [Schmidt, Jason M.] Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, 2360 Rainwater Rd, Tifton, GA 31793 USA; [Harwood, James D.] Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Plant Hlth & Med, 700 Changcheng Rd, Qingdao 266109, Shandong, Peoples R China","Krupa, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",bio149@uky.edu,,"Harwood, James/0000-0002-0018-7288",Kentucky Science and Engineering Foundation [KSEF2679-RDE-015],"Kentucky Science and Engineering Foundation, Grant/Award Number: KSEF2679-RDE-015",,47,1,1,4,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Using foraging theory as a framework, we tested the effects of prey availability on diet specialization and overlap among competing Asian predators: dhole, leopard, and tiger. We used scat analysis from a prey-poor site, combined with a quantitative synthesis of 40 other diet studies, to determine biomass of different prey types consumed by each predator. We then assessed diet composition in relation to prey density, and compared diet breadth and overlap between prey-poor and prey-rich sites. In prey rich areas, all three predators specialized on energetically profitable medium and large ungulates (>30 kg), resulting in narrow, overlapping niches. Each predator shifted toward less profitable small-bodied prey (<= 30 kg) as preferred ungulates declined, whereas consumption of preferred ungulates was unrelated to small prey abundance, as predicted by foraging theory. Diet breadths doubled under prey depletion (except leopard), but overlap declined as diets diverged via species-specific traits that facilitated capture of different types of alternative prey. Asia's apex predators adapt similarly to depletion of mutually preferred ungulates by switching to more numerous but less profitable small prey. Yet they can also partition a depleted prey base through intrinsic niche differences, thereby avoiding competitive exclusion. Our findings illuminate the stabilizing properties of adaptive foraging and niche differences in ecological communities, and provide insights into the behavior and resilience of Asia's endangered apex predators in response to prey depletion in the heavily poached forests of this region.","[Steinmetz, Robert; Seuaturien, Naret] World Wide Fund Nat Thailand, Phisit Bldg,9 Soi Pradiphat 10,Pradiphat Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Intanajitjuy, Pairoj; Inrueang, Pichet; Prempree, Kittipat] Kuiburi Natl Pk, Prachuapkirikhan, Thailand","Steinmetz, R (corresponding author), World Wide Fund Nat Thailand, Phisit Bldg,9 Soi Pradiphat 10,Pradiphat Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.",roberts@wwf.or.th,,,WWF Germany; WWF France; WWF US; WWF Sweden; WWF Denmark; WWF Austria; The Rhino and Tiger Conservation Fund (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service); Keidanren Nature Conservation Fund,"We are grateful to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation, for project permission and collaboration.

It is considered to be rare and its biology and population parameters are still poorly understood. The Amazon is one of the main strongholds of this species and is important for maintaining viable populations, as the region still holds extensive tracts of pristine habitat. We gathered field data from camera-trap studies throughout the Brazilian Amazon to estimate the relative abundance of the species and gain an understanding of its rarity, and how this compares with estimates from other vegetative formations and for sympatric hypercarnivores. We focused on three pristine or partially disturbed sites and one fragmented site. The estimated relative abundance of the species was 0.060-0.185 individuals per 100 trap-days, confirming that the species is rare. The bush dog's abundance in the Amazon is equivalent to that in all other areas outside the Basin. The mean group size recorded was c. 2.5 individuals. There were no differences in group sizes between forests in the Amazon and in other regions of Central America; however, there were significant differences between forests and open habitats. A combination of competition/predation, habitat structure/integrity, and disease may be acting synergistically in determining the abundance and rarity of bush dogs.","[de Oliveira, Tadeu G.] Univ Estadual Maranhao, Dept Biol, Cidade Univ Paulo 6 Caixa Postal 09, BR-65055000 Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Tadeu G.; Michalski, Fernanda] Inst Pro Carnivoros, Parque Edmundo Zanoni, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Botelho, Andre L.

The gall's position on H. spinosa is verv specific, reflected in the fact that the gall maker attaches principally to the basal floral buds of the inflorescence, and in the lower sector of the plant. We labelled inflorescences with and without galls in order to (quantify goat herbivory and gall predation. The goat feeds both on plants and infructescences with or without galls, resulting in gall destruction and larval death (phenotypic selection). The browsing behaviour of goat was influenced by the general stunted growth of the plant, as well as by the abundance of spiny stems. This fact allows chalcids to escape goat herbivory on a very fine spatial scale. Gall survival strongly depends on gall position in the inflorescence, being greater in the lower position. Furthermore, galls situated in the lower sector of the plant have a greater survival chance than galls situated in the upper sector. The goat acted as a true predator of the gall maker wasp, becoming a potential selective agent conditioning the reproductive success of Systasis. The relationship between goat and gall-maker is an asymmetrical hierarchy mediated by size differences, the bigger one conditions the smaller one, but the reverse does not occur.

Fouling epifauna are generally believed to reduce the settlement of interspecific larvae through competitive exclusion and predation. Studies of these interactions, however, often utilize artificial settlement panels, which can exhibit different recruitment patterns to those observed on natural substrates. Native (Crassostrea virginica) and non-native (Crassostrea ariakensis) oyster larvae were exposed to reef-collected shells, each supporting a single species of reef-associated fauna, over a series of laboratory microcosm studies. The presence of adult bryozoans (Membranipora tenuis) had little effect on rates of larval settlement or mortality. The boring sponge (Cliona sp.) significantly decreased oyster larval settlement, and generally increased oyster mortality. Barnacles (Balanus improvisus) typically facilitated settlement. Barnacle molds and empty barnacle tests, intended to mimic the surface area and rugosity of live barnacles, did not significantly affect settlement. In some trials, adult barnacle bathwater enhanced settlement of oyster larvae, highlighting the importance of waterborne cues. Barnacle bathwaters, adult clam worm (Neanthes succinea) bathwaters and bathwaters created using adult oysters were all found to cause oyster larval mortality. Predation by clam worms, which were observed at very high densities on field-collected oyster shells, caused significant oyster larval mortality in these experiments. The combined effects of positive and negative interactions between oyster larvae and resident invertebrate reef fauna require enumeration under field conditions. The results from this study highlight the need for a more thorough understanding of settlement behavior and mortality sources of recruiting oyster larvae. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, the ability of adult females to choose quality oviposition sites is critical for offspring success. Gravid females of many insect taxa have the capability to detect environmental conditions in water-holding containers (e.g., resource level, presence of competitors or predators) and to choose the sites that are most suitable for offspring growth and development. Mosquitoes may also detect physical container characteristics related to water permanence such as surface area, volume, or container size, and some species such as those in the genus Culex have been shown to prefer larger containers. However, predators may also preferentially colonize larger containers; thus, ovipositing females may face decisions based on cues of site quality that balance the costs and benefits for offspring. We used a field experiment to evaluate the oviposition preferences of two Culex species in response to experimental container size and predator abundances within the containers. We found that both species avoided ovipositing in the largest containers, which have high abundances of Chaoborus sp. and dragonfly larvae (predators). However, the container size most commonly chosen for oviposition (15-L buckets) also had high mean abundance per liter of dragonfly larvae.

Two mechanisms have been advanced by which a decrease in growth may increase the mortality of young predators: (1) increased time during which juvenile predators are susceptible to gape-limited predation and (2) increased susceptibility to starvation. To study the effects of competition from a prey fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) on the recruitment of a piscivorous fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis), roach were introduced in two of four small adjacent unproductive lakes inhabited by natural populations of perch. We thereafter studied the diet, growth, and survival of the new-born cohorts of perch during a 13-mo period. Growth and survival of larval perch were not affected by roach whereas during the latter part of the growing season, growth and condition of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch were negatively affected by roach. The growth retardation of YOY perch in roach-treatment lakes coincided with a shift in diet from free-swimming zooplankton to benthic cladocerans and chironomids, which in turn was related to a stronger decline in pelagic zooplankton resources in these lakes. The small size and poor condition of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes resulted in almost all these perch dying from starvation during the winter and subsequent spring. There was a tendency for there to be higher densities of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes, possibly due to a strong die-off of adult perch in these lakes that in turn may have reduced cannibalism in these lakes. The results from an enclosure experiment on intra-cohort competition among YOY perch, however, suggested that the discrepancy in growth of YOY perch between the lakes was mainly due to direct competition from roach for the zooplankton resource. Temporal variation in competition intensity and in duration of periods for growth and energy gain (e.g., summer) vs. periods of only energy loss (e.g., winter) are suggested to have major effects on juvenile predator growth and subsequent recruitment to the adult stage through competitive juvenile bottlenecks, and thus to affect overall community dynamics. The relative importance of size-dependent winter starvation mortality compared to mortality caused by gape-limited predators as a mortality agent on juveniles is hypothesized to increase with latitude. Whole-lake experiments lend themselves both to testing the importance in natural systems of mechanisms previously identified at small spatial and short temporal scales, and also to identifying important mechanisms that cannot be studied at smaller scales.","Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Bystrom, P (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,,,,94,121,127,1,43,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1998,79,6,,,,,2153,2167,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2153:CPAPJB]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,116YM,WOS:000075752700026,,,,,2021-09-27,

In a previous study, densities of tuft-weaving midges increased in the presence of large fish. In the absence of large fish, midges decreased as densities of predatory invertebrates built up, and higher standing crops of algae were maintained. To examine the mechanisms underlying these dynamics, we compared the vulnerability of tuft-weaving midges (naked or in algal tufts) to fish and predatory invertebrates, in field and laboratory experiments. When midges were exposed for 1 h in the river to fish, 15 out of 15 midges in tufts survived, while 15 of 15 naked midges were consumed. Tufts afforded only partial protection to midges exposed to invertebrate predators, however. After 1 h, enhancement of survivorship by tufts was moderately significant for midges exposed to aeshnids, and insignificant for midges exposed to lestids and naucorids. We suggest that the vulnerability of tuft-weaving midges to invertebrate predators, and their relative invulnerability to fish, sets the stage for trophic cascades observed in this system. Fish, by consuming small predators, release midges, which graze down algae. The strong effects of fish as fourth-level consumers would not be predicted from their diets, in which algivorous mayflies dominate (>60% of the insect biomass found in each of the two most common fish species). Nevertheless, fish in this food web act as fourth-level, rather than third-level, consumers because of the differential vulnerability of one guild of primary consumers, which, when released from predation, can suppress plants.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DAVIS,CA 95616","POWER, ME (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720, USA.",,,,,,,45,60,68,1,13,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1992,73,6,,,,,2218,2223,,10.2307/1941469,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KB843,WOS:A1992KB84300023,,,,,2021-09-27,

Anuran larvae have therefore been widely studied as a model system for competition. Body size and activity level are considered the most important factors that influence the outcome of competition between tadpoles. As species from temporary ponds normally show higher activity levels in order to achieve rapid growth and thus reduce the risk of desiccation, these species are often considered superior competitors. We designed several laboratory experiments to examine the intra- and interspecific effects on growth rate, mass at metamorphosis and survival to metamorphosis of six species in a Mediterranean area. Body size and activity level were used as explanatory covariables to determine competitive ability among species. An asymmetric and hierarchical relationship was found among the six species. Larger tadpole species were more successful in competitive interactions than smaller ones, but no relationship was found between activity level and competition effects. Species typically found in temporary ponds (Pelodytes punctatus and Bufo calamita) were considered poor competitors in contrast with other communities studied. Species with low competitive ability can persist by using refuges in which competition is reduced (e.g. ephemeral ponds).","Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Richter-Boix, A (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Av Diagonal 645, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",arichterboix@ub.edu,"Richter-Boix, Alex/E-3990-2012; Llorente, Gustavo A./I-3097-2015","Richter-Boix, Alex/0000-0002-8559-5191; Llorente, Gustavo A./0000-0002-0310-8290",,,,75,12,13,1,22,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0173-5373,1568-5381,,AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,Amphib.

Experimental populations were established in replicate mesocosms (wading pools), and growth and demographic characteristics of H. formosa populations were examined in the presence and absence of G. holbrooki. In pools with G. holbrooki, populations of H. formosa were small and significantly skewed toward large-bodied females. and relative abundance of males and juveniles was reduced. In populations of H. formosa alone, sex ratios and adult to juvenile ratios were about 1:1, individual adult female body sizes were smaller, and populations were large. This combination of population characteristics coincides with those predicted by a strong predator-prey model. We suggest that, even though these species are similar in adult size, diet, and habitat use, the dominant interaction between them, rather than competition, is size-selective predation by large G. holbrooki on small H. formosa. However, in natural populations, predation on G. holbrooki by other species may ameliorate the strong effects on H. formosa observed in this study.","UNIV GEORGIA, SAVANNAH RIVER ECOL LAB, AIKEN, SC 29802 USA; UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT ZOOL, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA; AUBURN UNIV, DEPT ZOOL & WILDLIFE SCI, AUBURN, AL 36849 USA",,,,,,,,39,27,29,1,9,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,MAY 16,1994,,2,,,,,296,302,,,,,7,Zoology,Zoology,NM667,WOS:A1994NM66700004,,,,,2021-09-27,

In aquatic habitats, predation risk is often linked to hydroperiod as the latter directly influences predator identity within these ecosystems. For pond-breeding salamanders, intraguild predation (IGP) and cannibalism are prevalent interactions in larval communities, but the frequency of each type of agonistic interaction, as well as changes in their pervasiveness along hydroperiod gradients are not well understood. Size-structured populations of aquatic life stages (paedomorphic adults and overwintered larvae) of mole salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum) have the potential to be dominant IG predators and cannibals in permanent ponds because of large size advantages over successive cohorts, but the species exists as only a single larval cohort in temporary ponds with reduced predatory abilities on guild members. Thus, both the potential for and intensity of predation by this species is linked to hydroperiod; yet, the predatory abilities of aquatic life stages of mole salamanders have not been evaluated. This study examined the extent to which larger size classes (paedomorphs and overwintered larvae) of mole salamanders preyed upon conspecifics and a congeneric competitor, the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum). Predation trials occurred in indoor microcosms and were executed under two habitat treatments that included pseudo-natural conditions containing alternate prey and refugia, as well as simplified environments (no alternative food or cover). Embryos or hatchlings of mole and spotted salamanders were exposed either separately or concurrently to paedomorphic and overwintered larval mole salamanders in each habitat treatment. Additionally, overwintered larvae were offered as prey to paedomorphic adults. No significant differences in mortality were observed between habitat treatments (complex versus simple) for either embryo or hatchling predation experiments. Mortality of mole and spotted embryos did not differ when they were offered separately or together, but paedomorphs caused significantly higher mortality among mole embryos compared to spotted embryos. Hatchlings of both species were heavily preyed upon (nearly 100% in all trials), but overwintered larvae exhibited 100% survival with paedomorph predators, indicating size-thresholds of predation risk that were not species specific. Paedomorphs and overwintered larvae therefore are most likely generalist predators that feed equally and effectively on hatchlings of co-occurring species, but are more likely to consume egg masses that do not incur significant handling costs. When present, paedomorphs or overwintered larvae have the potential to alter population dynamics of both guild members and conspecifics by being dominant predators on early life stages. As the prevalence of overwintering and paedomorphosis varies along hydroperiod gradients, predation risk from this species is likely to occur discontinuously and thereby may be an important, yet variable, structuring force.","[Anderson, Thomas L.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.; Levine, Todd D.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Mott, Cy L.] Valdosta State Univ, Dept Biol, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA; [Levine, Todd D.] Murray State Univ, Hancock Biol Stn, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 110 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",tlarkf@missouri.edu; cy.mott@gmail.com; tlevine@murraystate.edu; howard.whiteman@murraystate.edu,,,,,,43,14,15,0,32,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,JUL 3,2013,,2,,,,,284,291,,10.1643/CE-12-034,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,AG2WL,WOS:000335277700014,,,,,2021-09-27,

In order to identify likely interactions among species, while accounting as much as possible for other factors influencing population dynamics, models included both 'environmental' (water temperature, and phytoplankton concentration) and 'biological' (biomass of potentially interacting species) variables. This approach appeared to be effective at identifying certain types of interactions acting over relatively short time-frames, such as predation and competition for food. Among the species we considered, the strongest effects of this kind appeared to be from what we presume to be predation by Nephtys hombergii, and from competition for food among bivalves. Several of the strongest results of our analysis corroborated expectations derived from previous small-scale surveys or experimental studies, but there were also a number of highly significant results indicating possible interactions which were not immediately explicable, including the apparent positive effect of Maconza balthica on Arenicola marina, and the apparent negative effect of Nephtys hombergii on Mya arenaria. Our results also suggest that year to year changes in Cerastoderma edule and Arenicola marina populations did not have substantial and widespread influences on the population dynamics of the majority of other common infauna, which is not to deny the likely critical importance of recruitment effects and biogenic transformation of the intertidal environment by these species over longer time frames. Our modelling approach could be applied to other long-term data sets, and will become more useful as longer time series become available. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This study re-assesses evolutionary relationships within heliothines, providing an improved phylogeny and classification to support ongoing intensive research on heliothine genomics, systematics, and biology. Our phylogeny estimate is based on two nuclear gene regions, namely elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha; 1240 bp) and dopa decarboxylase (DDC; 687 bp), and on the barcoding region of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI; 708 bp), providing a total of 2635 bp. These were sequenced for 71 heliothines, representing all major genera and nearly all recognized subgenera and species groups, and for 16 outgroups representing all major lineages of trifine Noctuidae. Analysis of the combined data by maximum likelihood, unweighted parsimony and Bayesian methods gave nearly identical topologies, and the individual gene trees showed only one case of potentially strong conflict. Relationships among genera and subgenera are resolved with strong bootstrap support. The earliest-diverging lineages (c. 200 species in total) consist almost entirely of host specialists, reflecting the inferred ancestral heliothine host range under parsimony. The remaining species form a clade - the Heliothis group - that includes most of the polyphages (30% of heliothines) and all of the major pests. Many other species in the Heliolhis group, however, are host specialists. Our results extend previous efforts to subdivide this large clade, and show the most notorious pest groups, the corn earworm complex (Helicoverpa) and the tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) group, to be closely related, joining with a small oligophagous genus in what we term the major-pest lineage. Thus, genomic/experimental results from one model pest may extrapolate well to other pest species. The frequency of evolutionary expansion and contraction in host range appears to increase dramatically at the base of the Heliothis group, in contrast to the case for earlier-diverging lineages. We ascribe this difference provisionally to differential evolutionary constraints arising from contrasting life-history syndromes. Host-specific behaviour and crypsis, coupled with low fecundity and vagility, may discourage host-range expansion in earlier-diverging lineages. By contrast, in the Heliothis group, the absence of host-specific traits, coupled with high vagility and fecundity, may more readily permit expansion or contraction of the host range m response to varying ecological pressures Such as host species abundance or differential competition and predation.","[Cho, Soowon] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Plant Med, Cheongju 361763, South Korea; [Mitchell, Andrew] Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia; [Mitter, Charles] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Regier, Jerome] Univ Maryland, Inst Biotechnol, Ctr Biosyst Res, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Matthews, Marcus] CSIRO Entomol, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Cho, S (corresponding author), Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Plant Med, Cheongju 361763, South Korea.",soowon@chungbuk.ac.kr,"Cho, Soowon/AAF-7890-2019; Mitchell, Andrew/B-7018-2008","Mitchell, Andrew/0000-0001-5022-5898",USDANRICGPUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); 1NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant; University of Maryland Graduate School,"This study could not have been undertaken without the guidance, initial collaboration and expert advice of Robert W.

Mice were trapped in all habitats, but shrews only in ''stone'' habitats except for rare occurrences in one damp depression. Ruderal habitat was rarely used by either species.

This practice substantially reduces the environmental impact of pest control in agriculture by reducing the use of insecticides. However, there are many reasons to expect more or less deleterious effects on biodiversity: if the enemy is not specific to the pest, the release of large populations of predators can directly affect native assemblages through the predation process itself and/or through competition with their native counterparts. In addition, mass-reared populations of enemies generally come from gene pools that are different from native populations and may, through the effects of hybridization, alter their population dynamics. On the other hand, during mass rearing, populations of natural enemies to be released are subject to different selection pressures from those in the field and may be less adapted than native populations to farm ecosystems. These effects are generally very difficult to assess in agro-ecosystems themselves due to the multiplicity of factors. In order to assess the effects of inundative releases of generalist predatory mites on native assemblages that colonize poultry houses from the surrounding environment, we conducted an experiment over several generations of mites using mesocosms mimicking a piece of a henhouse (mite-proof units, each housing one hen). No deleterious effects on native populations of Androlaelaps casalis and Cheyletus spp. have been detected from the mass introduction of marketed populations of A. casalis and C. eruditus. The mass introduction of marketed predatory mites against D. gallinae appears to be compatible with the conservation of native arthropod assemblages. The mass-reared populations of A. casalis and C. eruditus did not establish their populations under conditions which otherwise allowed their native counterparts (same taxa) to do so.","[Zriki, Ghais; Blatrix, Rumsais; Dadu, Liza; Soulie, Anne-Sophie; Dijoux, Jordan; Degueldre, David; Roy, Lise] Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, EPHE, CNRS,IRD,CEFE, Montpellier, France; [Sleeckx, Nathalie] Expt Poultry Ctr, Geel, Belgium","Zriki, G (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, EPHE, CNRS,IRD,CEFE, Montpellier, France.",ghais.zriki@cefe.cnrs.fr; rumsais.blatrix@cefe.cnrs.fr; anne-sophie.soulie@cefe.cnrs.fr; david.degueldre@cefe.cnrs.fr; nathalie.sleeckx@provincieantwerpen.be; lise.roy@univ-montp3.fr,", Roy/G-5648-2017",", Roy/0000-0001-8833-1717; Sleeckx, Nathalie/0000-0003-0806-1775",European Regional Development Fund by the Interreg North-West Europe Programme (project 'MiteControl') [NWE 756]; CeMEB LabEx (an ANR Investissements d'avenir program)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-04-01]; French Occitanie Region,"Financial support for this work was provided by the European Regional Development Fund provided by the Interreg North-West Europe Programme (project 'MiteControl', grant number NWE 756) supported this work.

The present work reviews concepts and field evidence for enhancement of recruitment of species in MPAs, focusing geographically on the Mediterranean littoral because of its long history of intensive fishery exploitation, but drawing on evidence from studies on recruitment processes in general on MPAs both in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. We considered recruitment as the process of a fish being added to the local population. The general questions of interest are whether the increase in biomass of species protected in MPAs has an effect on recruitment in the MPAs or in neighbouring areas, and, on competition and predation effects on new recruits. A flow diagram of the effects of MPA status on recruitment is developed and employed to identify the relevant processes. The diagram incorporates three levels of factors: (1) characteristics of MPAs (location, size, habitat type, oceanography and level of protection); (2) life stages of species protected in MPAs relevant to recruitment (eggs, larvae, settlers and juveniles); and (3) fundamental processes of dispersal/movement, predation and competition. From this conceptual diagram, the following main components of the recruitment process were identified and used to structure the review: (1) relationship between the ecology of pelagic stages and the design, location and oceanographic regime of MPAs; (2) effects of protection in MPAs from fishery exploitation of nursery habitats on settlement success; and (3) effects of protection on survival of settlers and juveniles from competition and predation. We found an exceptionally low number of studies specifically addressing recruitment processes in MPAs. This was particularly the case in in hat concerns the relationship between larval ecology and the characteristics and oceanographic regime of MPAs. The effectiveness of MPAs in promoting recruitment mainly depends on the locations and on sizes of the MPAs in relation to the reproductive biology and larval ecology of the species concerned. The locations and sizes of MPAs in turn depend on MPA objectives, whether the purpose is to protect entire life cycles, the juveniles, or to increase egg production and larval export. The assessment of the relationship between the protection of nursery habitats and settlement success indicates that the magnitude of the effects of protection depends on whether the recruitment of the species involved is restricted to a narrowly-defined set of environmental conditions or, on the contrary, can occur in diverse environments, including areas beyond the influence of the MPAs. Thus, the locations of MPAs determine the habitats which are protected and, consequently, the species, the settlement of which will be favoured. For Mediterranean shallow-water species, the nearshore zone encompasses most of the essential nursery habitats for protection. Recruitment studies conducted in MPAs in the north-western Mediterranean have showed no differences in survival of newly-settled littoral fish between MPAs and the areas outside of them. Conversely, for older recruits, mortality was found to be higher inside MPAs, probably due to the increased abundance and size of large predators. This study highlights the almost total absence of studies addressing even the most elementary. questions of recruitment in the specific context of MPAs.","Univ Perpignan, EPHE, URA CNRS 1453, F-66860 Perpignan, France; Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; IEO, Ctr Oceanog Baleares, Palma de Mallorca 07015, Spain; Univ Aix Marseille 2, COM, UMR 6540, Marine Endoume Stn, F-13007 Marseille, France; GIS Posidonie, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; COM, UMR 6540, F-13288 Marseille 9, France","Planes, S (corresponding author), Univ Perpignan, EPHE, URA CNRS 1453, F-66860 Perpignan, France.",,"Quetglas, Antoni/K-9089-2014; Lenfant, Philippe/D-3908-2009","Quetglas, Antoni/0000-0002-1303-8003; Garcia-Rubies, Antoni/0000-0002-4824-9337",,,,176,73,75,1,44,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0376-8929,,,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

Grazing halos-barren areas of sand surrounding coral reefs-are readily visible in remotely sensed imagery, and are formed by herbivores preferentially grazing close to the safety of the reef. Grazing halo size can vary by more than an order of magnitude, yet we lack an understanding of what underlies this variation. Changes in grazing intensity and the distance herbivores travel may be influenced by predation risk, resource availability, and structural attributes of the reef. Here, we tested how predator density, herbivore density, and patch reef area are correlated with halo size and grazing patterns by linking satellite imagery with mensurative experiments on patch reefs in the Caribbean. Chronic predation risk suppressed the overall foraging intensity of herbivorous fishes; a doubling in predator density led to a 29% decrease in grazing. Variation in herbivore density, which was tightly correlated with patch reef area, was linked to the distance herbivores foraged from the reef. Furthermore, herbivore density and/or reef area was the best predictor of halo width at field sites, and reef area explained a significant proportion of the variation in halo size across the landscape. Our results contribute to a growing body of research suggesting that halos may function as footprints of ecological processes, such as herbivory, that can be quantified using remote sensing, and offer a potential avenue to improve monitoring of coral reef management.","[DiFiore, Bartholomew P.; Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [DiFiore, Bartholomew P.; Queenborough, Simon A.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [DiFiore, Bartholomew P.; Paul, Valerie J.] Smithsonian Marine Stn Ft Pierce, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA; [Madin, Elizabeth M.

This assertion has been countered by reports of exclusively bottom-up control, with both conclusions based on studies of the same species. Accelerating deterioration of coral reefs motivates knowing the contexts in which either consumers or nutrients or both control key ecosystem role players like sponges. Accordingly, genotype-and size-controlled individuals of 12 common Caribbean reef sponge species were transplanted, in the field, into five circumstances differing in predators, competitors, and the picoplankton consumed by sponges. Growth and survival of the experimental transplants for periods of 1-9 yr revealed context-dependent control of sponges. Primary control of growth was bottom-up, with more picoplankton resulting in consistent and sustained higher growth rates for all 12 of these ecologically and phylogenetically diverse species. Top-down control was not detected within-habitat, on the coral reef. However, between-habitat control was by predation and competition, with reef sponges excluded from adjacent seagrass meadows by spongivorous starfish, and excluded from mangrove prop roots by faster-growing mangrove sponges. These results highlight the strong importance of experimental design details that consider behavior idiosyncrasies, sufficiently long time scales, and appropriate division of species into categories. Diametrically opposite results from studies of the same species also illustrate the inherently greater difficulty of detecting bottom-up processes and the importance of distinguishing within-habitat vs. between-habitat patterns and processes.","[Wulff, Janie] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Wulff, Janie] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama","Wulff, J (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Wulff, J (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama.",wulff@bio.fsu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0550599]; Marine Science Network of the Smithsonian Institution - Hunterdon Oceanographic Research Endowment; Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems Program (CCRE) of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution","I am extremely grateful to have been able to do fieldwork based at the Carrie Bow Cay Station for many years, during which Klaus Rutzler and Mike Carpenter, and more recently Zachary Foltz, and many generous and capable volunteer station managers, have facilitated my work.

Here, we examine the response of two gerbil species (Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum) to greater sand vipers (Cerastes cerastes) and to added illumination (a factor associated with increased risk of predation from owls). We measured gerbil foraging behavior using the number of seed trays (resource patches) foraged and amount of seed resources left in each tray (giving-up densities; GUDs). Fewer seed trays foraged and higher GUDs indicate a higher perceived risk of predation. Accordingly, G. allenbyi foraged fewer seed trays in response to illumination and in the open microhabitat. In addition, vipers may have affected foraging activity in both gerbil species and caused G. pyramidum to forage in fewer trays in the bush microhabitat Viper activity also caused both species to abandon seed trays at higher GUDs. Overall, gerbils altered their use of resource patches in response to the risk of predation.

These neighborhoods may affect the distribution and abundance of generalist small-mammal seed predators by creating spatial variation in the availability of food resources, protective cover, and interactions with competitors. Small-mammal distribution and abundance may then influence tree population dynamics through variation in seed predation and seedling establishment. To. determine if small-mammal activity patterns, seed survival, and seedling recruitment varied with neighborhood structure, we designed a study conducted at two habitat levels: canopy-tree neighborhoods, which reflected variation in seed production, and understory neighborhoods, which reflected differences in protective cover and interactions among animals. We live-trapped small mammals during the summer and fall of 1995 and 1996, experimentally measured seed survival in the falls of 1995 and 1996, and quantified total tree seedling recruitment in the spring of 1997. We developed a new method for nonlinear Poisson regression to relate canopy and understory neighborhood composition to small-mammal distribution and activity,. seed survival, and seedling establishment. Small-mammal activity patterns changed between 1995 and 1996 in response to seed production. Canopy tree neighborhoods were a good predictor of overall small-mammal activity, and neighborhoods with high small-mammal activity had low seed survival. The canopy-tree neighborhoods with sufficient, seed rain and high seed survival displayed increased seedling recruitment. Understory structure was a poor predictor of seed survival and seedling recruitment but appeared to be the primary axis along which habitat partitioning among mammal species took place when population densities were low. This study demonstrates that small-mammal seed predators influence tree recruitment patterns through their actions as seed predators in temperate deciduous forests, and that local effects of small mammals on seedling recruitment can be predicted from the species composition of tree neighborhoods.","Sheldon Jackson Coll, Sitka, AK 99835 USA; Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; Idaho State Univ, Ctr Ecol Res & Educ, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA","Schnurr, JL (corresponding author), Sheldon Jackson Coll, 801 Lincoln St, Sitka, AK 99835 USA.",jschnurr@sj-alaska.edu,"Canham, Charles D/F-6161-2011","Canham, Charles D/0000-0001-8361-9148; Inouye, Richard/0000-0002-2759-3390; Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301",,,,82,65,74,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2004,85,3,,,,,741,755,,10.1890/02-0644,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,805VD,WOS:000220392900017,,,,,2021-09-27,

The two agricultural pests consist of one species of thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis(Pergande 1895)) and one species of whiteflies (Trialeurodes vaporariorumWestwood, 1956), and the shared predator is a predatory mite (Amblyseius swirskiiAthias-Herriot, 1962). The predatory mite is the biocontrol agent employed in order to achieve the biological control. The proposed model successfully reproduces this density mediated indirect interactions between pests when their carrying capacities are increased. Moreover, the pests' final population levels may depend on their initial densities and those of their predator. With these results, the proposed model may have the potential to assess whether these indirect pest interactions disrupt or enhance biological control. Additionally, it can also be used as an ancillary tool to theoretically assess the effects of pest biocontrol strategies in the referred experimental setup.","[Costa, M. I.

Furthermore, G. allenbyi and G. pyramidum collected seeds at significantly higher rates in the field than in the laboratory because the seed encounter rates for both species were higher in the field. This suggests that in natural conditions, probably involving predation risk and competitive pressure, gerbils must respond in two ways: (1) they must choose a foraging strategy that reduces predation risk by minimizing time spent feeding outside their burrows; and (2) they must forage more efficiently. In the field, seed handling time of the larger species, G. pyramidum, was shorter than that of the smaller one, G. allenbyi. This difference mat give G. pyramidum an advantage when resource levels are high and when most of a forager's time is spent handling seeds rather than searching for more seeds. Additionally, our field study showed that the seed encounter rate of G. allenbyi was higher than that of C. pyramidum. This difference may give G. allenbyi an advantage when resource levels are low and when searching occupies most of the forager's time. The different advantages that each species has over the other, under different conditions, may well be factors promoting their coexistence over a wide range of resource densities.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Ovadia, O (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",ofer.owdia@yale.edu,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012; ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947; Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,61,26,26,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The feeding mode of both species and the tube-building of P. elegans are assumed to affect community structure by interactions with other species. The weight of tubes of P. elegans varied between 2 and 13 g DW/100 cm2 at the two stations investigated and during the year, which is equivalent to 230-1500 cm of tubes per 100 cm2 of sediment surface. Sediment stability may be affected directly or indirectly by the amount of tubes present. M. balthica shows a linear relation between the maximum size of particles which can be inhaled and animal length. In Kiel Bay, particles > 0.5 mm are out of the range of this species. In summer, the potential feeding area (PFA) of a P. elegans population at one station in Kiel Bay was 1.8 times the available surface area. The PFA of three different populations of M. balthica in Kiel Bay exceeded the available surface area by factors of 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2. These findings indicate strong intra- and interspecific competition for food. Additionally, the feeding of both species may strongly affect the recruitment of benthic species via pelagic larvae.

Thus, interspecific competition affects different age classes differently. Adults of sympatric species often show distinct foraging niche segregation, but juvenile resource use might overlap with adult competitors of similar body size. Resultant negative effects on juveniles can have important consequences for population dynamics, yet such interactions have received little attention in studies of mammalian communities. Using GPS tracking devices, time-depth recorders and stable isotope data, we compared diving depth, activity time, trophic position and foraging habitat characteristics to investigate foraging niche overlap between similar-sized sympatric juvenile Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) and adult Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and compared each group with much larger-bodied adult Galapagos sea lions. We found little indication for direct competition but a complex pattern of foraging niche segregation: juvenile sea lions and adult fur seals dived to shallow depths at night, but foraged in different habitats with limited spatial overlap. Conversely, juvenile and adult sea lions employed different foraging patterns, but their foraging areas overlapped almost completely. Consistency of foraging habitat characteristics between juvenile and adult sea lions suggests that avoidance of competition may be important in shaping foraging habitat utilization. Resultant specialization on a limited habitat could contribute to low sea lion numbers that contrast with high fur seal abundance. Our data suggest that exploitation by multiple predators within spatially restricted foraging ranges of juveniles might negatively impact juvenile foraging success and ultimately influence population dynamics.","[Jeglinski, Jana W.

However, the positive impacts of their presence in terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in human-dominated landscapes, remain controversial. Limited experimental insights regarding the consequences of apex predator recoveries may be behind such controversy and may also impact on the social acceptability towards the recovery of these species. Using a quasi-experimental design and state-of-the-art density estimates, we show that mesopredator abundances were reduced after the restoration of an apex predator, with evidence of resonating positive impacts on lower trophic levels. Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus reintroduction was followed by the reduction of the abundance of mesocarnivores (red foxes Vulpes vulpes and Egyptian mongooses Herpestes ichneumon by ca. 80%) and the recovery of small game of high socio-economic value (European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa). The observed mesopredator reduction resulted in an estimated 55.6% less rabbit consumption for the entire carnivore guild. Our findings have important implications for the social acceptability of Iberian lynx reintroductions, which crucially depend on the perception of private land owners and managers. Under certain circumstances, restoring apex predators may provide a sustainable and ethically acceptable way to reduce mesopredator abundances.","[Jimenez, Jose; Mougeot, Francois; Ferreras, Pablo] UCLM, CSIC, JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Carlos Nunez-Arjona, Juan; Munoz-Igualada, Jaime] Tragsatec, Gerencia Calidad Evaluac Ambiental & Biodiversida, C Julian Camarillo 6B,Planta 4, Madrid 28037, Spain; [Mariano Gonzalez, Luis; Garcia-Dominguez, Francisco] Minist Transic Ecol, Subdirecc Gen Medio Nat, Plaza San Juan de la Cruz S-N, Madrid 28075, Spain; [Jesus Palacios, Maria] Direcc Gen Medio Ambiente Junta Extremadura, Avda Luis Ramallo S-N, Badajoz 06800, Spain; [Pla, Samuel; Rueda, Carmen] Fdn CBD Habitat, C Gustavo Fernandez Balbuena 2,Oficina A, Madrid 28002, Spain; [Villaespesa, Francisco] Org Autonomo Parques Nacl, Huelva 21760, Spain; [Najera, Fernando] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Vet, Avda Puerto Hierro S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Najera, Fernando] Junta Extremadura, FOTEX Direcc Gen Med Ambiente, Avda Luis Ramallo S-N, Badajoz 06800, Spain; [Palomares, Francisco] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, C Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose] Oviedo Univ, CSIC, UO, Res Unit Biodivers,PA, Mieres 33600, Spain","Jimenez, J (corresponding author), UCLM, CSIC, JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.",Jose.Jimenez@uclm.es; Francois.Mougeot@uclm.es; Pablo.Ferreras@uclm.es; LMGonzalez@miteco.es; fgdominguez@miteco.es; at_sgmn2@mapama.es; mariajesus.palacios@juntaex.es; samuel.pla@cbd-habitat.com; fvillaespesa@oapn.es; femanaj@ucm.es; ffpaloma@ebd.csic.es,"Jimenez, Jose/I-9840-2019; Ferreras, Pablo/A-6017-2009; Mougeot, Francois/Y-9569-2019","Jimenez, Jose/0000-0003-0607-6973; Ferreras, Pablo/0000-0002-1116-6706; Mougeot, Francois/0000-0002-5819-6275","IberLince LIFE Project in Extremadura [LIFE10NAT/ES/570]; Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition (MITECO) [17MNES021]; Ramon & Cajal program from the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [RYC-2015-18932]","We thank the staff and owners of Los Quintos for their help and commitment with lynx conservation, the staff of IberLince LIFE Project (LIFE10NAT/ES/570) in Extremadura, and Extremadura Regional Government.

This experiment investigated effects of accumulated invertebrate carcasses as a resource for two competing mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes aegypti (L.) whether either species differentially benefited from accumulated carcasses, and if such a benefit affected interspecific competition. First, we measured accumulation of invertebrate carcasses in standard containers at a field site. We then used a replacement series with five different species ratios at the same total density: and varied the input of invertebrate carcasses [dead Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) ] in three levels: none, the average input from our field site, or the maximum input recorded at our field site. Survivorship, development time, and mass were measured for each mosquito species as correlates of population growth, and were used to calculate a population performance index, lambda'. There were strong positive effects of invertebrate carcass additions on all growth correlates and lambda'. Differences in performance between species were pronounced in small or no carcass additions and absent in large inputs of invertebrate carcasses, but there was little evidence that inputs of invertebrate carcasses altered the competitive advantage in this system. These results suggest that terrestrial invertebrate carcasses may be an important resource for many types of container communities, and large accumulations of dead invertebrates may: reduce resource competition between these mosquitoes. thus favoring coexistence. We propose that the total amount of resource, including accumulated invertebrate carcasses, may explain observed patterns of replacement involving these mosquitoes.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Div Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Daugherty, MP (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Div Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI044793, R01 AI044793-01, R15 AI039700-01, R01 AI44793-01, R15 AI39700-01] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI039700, R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,37,111,115,0,18,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0022-2585,,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Theory predicts three possible equilibria, which parallel increasing resource enrichment: exclusion of the IG predator, stable coexistence, and exclusion of the IG prey. Here, we report on the existence of two concurrent states in a model carnivore system dominated by IGP. Using species occurrence data obtained from randomly distributed remote cameras, we modeled the probabilities of detection and occupancy of the kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) and its IG predator, the coyote (Canis latrans), at White Sands National Monument, New Mexico, USA, using a recently developed conditional two-species occupancy model. Kit foxes persisted in habitats of low resource abundance, which could not support coyotes. Coexistence occurred in adjacent habitats of higher resource enrichment, with coyote occupancy strongly correlated with small mammal abundance. The odds of a coyote being present vs. absent in prey-rich habitats was 332:1 (+/- 0.006; SE) whereas the odds of a coyote being present vs. absent in prey-poor habitats was 1:4 (+/- 0.11); thus, coyotes were much more likely to be present in prey-rich habitats. Kit foxes were more frequently photographed in prey-poor habitats avoided by coyotes. The odds of kit foxes being present vs. absent at a site where coyotes were absent was 7.9:1 (+/- 0.082), which was greater than the odds of kit foxes being present vs. absent at a site where coyotes were present (2.2:1 +/- 0.081). These findings indicate that kit foxes avoid coyotes, but that their adaptations to arid conditions enable them to exploit habitats unsuitable for coyotes. Consequently, the primary driver of this spatial separation is the inability of coyotes to use prey-poor habitats, rather than kit fox avoidance of coyotes. Our results reveal the existence of concurrent IGP states within the same ecological community, which is consistent with theoretical predictions, and highlight the power of the conditional two-species occupancy model to illuminate how the abundance of shared prey shapes the competitive dynamic in ecological systems dominated by IGP.","[Robinson, Quinn H.; Roemer, Gary W.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Ecol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Bustos, David] White Sands Natl Monument, Holloman AFB, NM 88330 USA","Roemer, GW (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Ecol, POB 30003,MSC 4901, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",groemer@nmsu.edu,,,Chihuahuan Desert Network; WHSA; T and E Inc.; New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station,"We thank White Sands National Monument (WHSA), Holloman Air Force Base, and White Sands Missile Range for study site access.

A field experiment was conducted in a Mediterranean vineyard to evaluate ground cover management impacts on predatory insect and potential grapevine pest abundance and diversity, both on the ground and in the grapevine canopy. Three different ground cover management techniques (tillage, spontaneous cover and flower-driven cover) were tested for two years (2016 and 2017). Overall, the ground cover management significantly affected the abundance of important epigeal predators, of which carabids, forficulids and staphylinids were the most captured. The carabid abundances under both the cover crop treatments were found to be approximately three times higher compared with that under the tillage treatment. In contrast, the canopy insect abundance in the vineyard was similar among the treatments for both the predators and the potential grapevine pest species. These results indicate that cover crop vegetation can be used in vineyards to enhance predatory insect abundance and may improve agroecosystem resilience.","[Gloria Saenz-Romo, Maria; Veas-Bernal, Ariadna; Martinez-Garcia, Hector; Martinez-Villar, Elena; Santiago Marco-Mancebon, Vicente; Perez-Moreno, Ignacio] Univ La Rioja, Dept Agr & Food, C Madre de Dios 51, Logrono 26006, La Rioja, Spain; [Ibanez-Pascual, Sergio; Campos-Herrera, Raquel] Inst Grapevine & Wine Sci ICVV, Logrono 26071, La Rioja, Spain","Marco-Mancebon, VS (corresponding author), Univ La Rioja, Dept Agr & Food, C Madre de Dios 51, Logrono 26006, La Rioja, Spain.",masaenr@unirioja.es; ariadna.veas@unirioja.es; hector.mtz.garcia@gmail.com; sibanezp@larioja.org; elena.martinez@unirioja.es; raquel.campos@icvv.es; vicente.marco@unirioja.es; ignacio.perez@unirioja.es,"Saenz-Romo, Maria/AAX-8963-2020; Martinez-Garcia, Hector/ABF-2829-2020; Perez-Moreno, Ignacio/K-7077-2014; Campos-Herrera, Raquel/A-5299-2017","Martinez-Garcia, Hector/0000-0001-8258-9952; Perez-Moreno, Ignacio/0000-0003-4253-1689; Campos-Herrera, Raquel/0000-0003-0852-5269",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2014-53336R]; University of La Rioja (Spain) (FPI-UR 2015); University of La Rioja (Spain) (FPI-UR 2018); Ramon y Cajal award [RYC-2016-19939],"This research was funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (AGL2014-53336R).

More than half of all Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus occurred in the absence of Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis during nesting and post-hatching periods compared to c. 20% when concentrated by pre-breeding snow cover. In contrast, only 5% of Barnacle Geese were observed in the absence of Pink-footed Geese pre-breeding, 15% during nesting, and 35% post-hatching. Among six defined habitat types, Barnacle Geese resorted more to 'upland' habitats during pre-breeding and nesting and to lowland lakes post-hatching when compared to Pink-footed Geese. Although Pink-footed Geese showed less change in seasonal habitat preference, many shifted to the river valley bottom post-hatching, giving access to open water (predator avoidance) and lush green vegetation (foraging for goslings). The smallest extent of distributional overlap between the two species occurred post-hatching, but each species was also highly restricted by snow cover during pre-nesting. The greatest extent of overlap in distribution and diet occurred during incubation, when large dietary variation between different breeding valleys reflected local food availability around nests (probably a result of nest-site preference rather than food selection per se). Whether this means that increased interactions within and between the two goose species with future increases in local density are most likely to be manifest at this stage of the summer is impossible to determine without knowledge of available food resources and manipulative experiments. More detailed investigations of the effects of foraging by both species on plant structure, quality and community composition are necessary to predict likely outcomes of future changes in population densities of both species.","[Fox, Tony A.

Maybe because they represent a hidden part of ecosystems, responses of ecological interactions are rarely studied. A more comprehensive view of the processes underlying the restructuring of food webs under environmental gradients appears crucial to understand how ecosystems functionalities are altered. We address this general issue in an experiment where trophic interactions are reorganized under a gradient of top-down effects (predation pressure) and bottom-up effects (nutrient availability). Unimodal relationships of species diversity are pervasive in ecology; we extend this principle to food-web topology: in our study, most topological descriptor values peak at intermediate predation intensity. The same unimodal pattern holds for network complexity, measured by entropy and scaled entropy (a measure independent of species diversity). Moreover, food web complexity is maximized at higher fish abundance when nutrient availability is increased. We infer that whereas in absence of top predators, a mechanism of competitive exclusion takes place, and indirect facilitation process underlies systems with a moderate predation pressure. These results highlight the importance of the dynamic reorganization of trophic links in response to bottom-up and top-down effects. Interaction between bottom-up and top-down forces argue for multifactorial studies of ecological effects.","[Gauzens, Benoit] Univ Rennes 1, UMR Ecobio 6553, Ave Gen Leclerc,Campus Beaulieu, FR-35042 Rennes, France; [Legendre, Stephane] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR IBENS 8197, 46 Rue Ulm, FR-75230 Paris 05, France; [Lazzaro, Xavier] UPMC, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR BOREA MNHN, CNRS 7208,IRD 207, CP 53,1 Rue Buffon, FR-75231 Paris 5, France; [Lazzaro, Xavier] UMSA, LCA, La Paz, Bolivia; [Lacroix, Gerard] Univ Paris 06, UMR iEES Paris, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci Paris, CNRS,INRA,IRD,AgroParisTech,UPEC, 7 Quai St Bernard, FR-75005 Paris, France; [Lacroix, Gerard] CNRS, ENS, UMS CEREEP Ecotron IDF 3194, 78 Rue Chateau, FR-77140 St Pierre Les Nemours, France","Gauzens, B (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, UMR Ecobio 6553, Ave Gen Leclerc,Campus Beaulieu, FR-35042 Rennes, France.",benoit.gauzens@univ-rennes1.fr,,,R2DS Ile-de-France program [2007-14]; EC FP7 FETEuropean Commission; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR CEP&S program - PULSE project)French National Research Agency (ANR); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (program ANR BLANC program - PHYTBACK project)French National Research Agency (ANR),"Nicolas Loeuille provided advice that improved the manuscript.

The purpose of my study was to investigate experimentally the differential and/or interactive effects of two predator guilds on herbivore densities. I performed my experiments on 24 creosotebushes at each of three sites within the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research Site in the Chihuahuan Desert of southwestern New Mexico, USA. At each site the experiment consisted of: six creosotebushes from which birds were excluded with nylon mesh cages; six creosotebushes from which arthropod predators were removed by hand or aspirator; six creosotebushes from which both birds and arthropod predators were removed; and six control creosotebushes from which neither birds nor arthropod predators were removed. I conducted nondestructive nocturnal visual censuses of herbivores on each creosotebush at the beginning of the experiments in mid-May, 6 wk after the start of the experiment in late June, and 12 wk after the start of the experiment in early August. I conducted these experiments and censuses in 1993 and again in 1994. In both years the herbivore densities became significantly higher in experimental than in control creosotebushes. The effects of bird and arthropod predation on herbivore densities were additive in 1993, but they were compensatory in 1994. In 1994 arthropod predator densities became lower in creosotebushes from which birds had been removed than in creosotebushes from which birds had not been removed, but this result did not obtain in 1993. These results may be due to a combination of factors including: avian and arthropod predation on herbivores, ''intraguild'' predation of birds on arthropod predators, and competition within the herbivore community. The relative numerical impacts of the predator-removal experiments varied among seasons and among sites within either year, but temporal and spatial variation in predator impacts did not correlate strongly with known gradients of climatic or bottom-up heterogeneity in this system. The results of this study confirm the important direct and cumulative effects of multiple predator guilds, even against a complex background of temporal and spatial heterogeneity.","PENN STATE UNIV, PESTICIDE RES LAB, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",,,,,,,,54,46,47,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1996,77,5,,,,,1544,1555,,10.2307/2265550,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UX396,WOS:A1996UX39600023,,,,,2021-09-27,

If such a reaction reduces competitive ability, for example by reducing food intake, predator presence can lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Because predator avoidance typically leads to reduced growth rather than reduced survival, its effect on population processes is difficult to assess. This is especially true for organisms with complex life-cycles, where predator avoidance during one stage is expected to lead to trait-mediated indirect effects if it has effects reaching into the following life stages. I experimentally investigated the effect of caged (thus non-lethal) dragonfly larvae on the competition between tadpoles of two frog species (Rana lessonae and R. esculenta) and on juvenile frog survival during the subsequent terrestrial stage. In response to caged predators, R. lessonae delayed metamorphosis more than R. esculenta, but they both metamorphosed heavier. These differences suggest the possibility of a competitive disadvantage for R. lessonae in the presence of predators, which could lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. However, the presence of predators did not modify competitive effects and had no measurable consequences on terrestrial survival. Regardless of the presence of predators, competition during the larval stage had large effects on metamorphosis and led to strongly decreased survival in the subsequent terrestrial stage. These results suggest that trait-mediated indirect effects are not important in this system, because the predator reaction of the tadpoles in both species had no measurable effect on the following life stage and, therefore, probably no strong effect on community dynamics.","Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Altwegg, R (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,62,27,30,1,11,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

After an introduction to these sister taxa, I consider how they bore, focussing on the evolution of the cephalic hood in teredinids, which could contribute to the depth separation between the families. If the hood serves as a counter pressure to the foot, it may be vital in allowing teredinids to bore wood that contains air. The availability of wood has been suggested to determine the distribution of these animals. Mangrove habitats with abundant wood sustain the highest diversity, about one-third of all known teredinids. The open ocean, where wood is all but nonexistent, presents a nearly impassable barrier to most wood borers. Only after wooden sailing ships transported teredinids between ports did introduced species become problematic. Despite the rarity of wood in the open ocean, some xylophagaids live there as, it is hypothesized, do a limited number of teredinids; wood in the open ocean is predicted to be large because large size enhances buoyancy. The life history of open-ocean species may differ fundamentally from that of nearshore species. Physical stressors of temperature, salinity and desiccation appear to affect teredinids minimally; xylophagaids on the seafloor do not experience these variables. How biotic interactions such as competition and predation affect wood borers is yet to be thoroughly studied, but their impact may be greater than has been recognized, especially among teredinids. Although humans regard teredinids as pests that destroy wooden structures, and attempt to eradicate them from some areas, these animals play vital ecological roles. Teredinids make the energy and nutrients locked into wood available to the local community. Xylophagaids are nearly unique in breaking down cellulose and are analogous to primary producers in sustaining the diverse deep-sea wood-fall communities. The survival of borers requires wood to be present. The reduction of trees near water courses, removal of driftwood from navigable rivers and the destruction and fragmentation of the world's mangrove habitats all threaten the predictable supply of wood in the sea and may seriously threaten the survival of these molluscs.","Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Voight, JR (corresponding author), Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",Jvoight@fieldmuseum.org,,,,,,139,30,31,3,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0260-1230,1464-3766,,J MOLLUS STUD,J.

In particular, in the majority of bee species, the relative contribution of intrasexual competition and female choice to patterns of male body size is unknown. In this field study, we examined two possible components of male mating success with respect to body size in the solitary bee Diadasia rinconis Cockerell (Hymenoptera: Apidae): 1) ability to procure a mate and 2) the duration of copulation. We found that larger males were better able to procure mates and copulated for shorter periods of time. Although consistent with sperm competition theory, differences in copulation duration were slight; possibly, the shorter copulations of larger males instead reflect in copulo female choice. Consistent with this notion, males engaged in complex courtship while mounted, characterized for the first time in any bee in such detail via audio recordings and high-speed, high-definition video. The number of pulses in male courtship behavior was also positively associated with copulation duration and may have stimulated females to continue copulating, thereby potentially allowing smaller males to transfer a full ejaculate. Females were shown to be potentially polyandrous and although we did not observe precopulatory rejection in the field, captive females frequently rejected copulation attempts by captive males. Our work indicates that intrasexual competition selects for increased body size in a solitary bee.","[Russell, Avery L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Russell, Avery L.; Buchmann, Stephen L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Russell, Avery L.] Univ Arizona, Grad Interdisciplinary Program Entomol & Insect S, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Buchmann, Stephen L.; Papaj, Daniel R.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Sabino, William de O.] Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Coordenacao Zool, Ave Perimetral 1901,Caixa Postal 399, BR-66077530 Belem, PA, Brazil","Russell, AL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.; Russell, AL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.; Russell, AL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Grad Interdisciplinary Program Entomol & Insect S, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",alr204@pitt.edu,,"Sabino, William/0000-0003-2151-0723; Russell, Avery/0000-0001-8036-2711",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1257762],"We are grateful to Callin Switzer for assistance with R acoustical analysis and to Jack Neff for discussion.

Pond enclosures encompassed 3 X 6 m of dense vegetation and 9 X 6 m of open habitat, and were stocked with 75 young-of-year and 30 1-yr-old perch and with either three piscivorous perch, three northern pike (Esox lucius), or no piscivores. Northern pike were both larger and possessed a larger gape than piscivorous perch. To isolate behavioral responses of juvenile perch to piscivores, we replaced consumed young-of-year perch. Prey fish mortality was lowest without piscivores and highest with northern pike. Young-of-year perch increased their use of vegetation in the presence of both piscivores, whereas 1-yr-old perch increased their use of vegetation only with northern pike. For both age classes of prey fish, increased use of the vegetation led to reduced individual growth, owing to two complementary mechanisms. First, the physical complexity of submerged macrophytes likely interfered with the benthic feeding of perch, Second, increased use of the (relatively small) vegetated habitat increased the mean density experienced by prey fish. Piscivore-induced changes of prey fish densities in the two habitats had substantial effects on the biomass of prey fish resources in the open habitat, but only minor effects in the vegetation. Sialis lutaria, the major predatory macroinvertebrate (approximate to 50% of total macroinvertebrate biomass in the open habitat), and total predatory macroinvertebrates were positively affected by piscivores in the open habitat, but not in the vegetation. Chironomids (<3% of total macroinvertebrate biomass in the vegetation) and the sizes of nonpredatory macroinvertebrates were negatively affected by piscivores in the vegetation, but not in the open habitat. Biomass of nonpredatory macroinvertebrates, Cladocera, and Copepoda did not differ among treatments in either habitat. From our review of field experiments, vulnerable prey fish always change their habitat use in the presence of piscivores. Behaviorally mediated indirect effects of piscivores on individual growth rates and prey fish resources were just as frequently observed as direct effects of piscivores on prey fish survival.","UMEA UNIV,DEPT ANIM ECOL,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN",,,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,51,131,135,0,44,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1995,76,6,,,,,1712,1726,,10.2307/1940705,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RQ248,WOS:A1995RQ24800003,,,,,2021-09-27,

A laboratory experiment was performed to assess the microhabitat use and cannibalism between intermediate and late instars of Calopteryx virgo larvae and predation by larger Somatochlora metallica larvae on the intermediate C. virgo instars. The experiment was run in small running-water aquaria where the larvae were able to divide their mutual habitat vertically by clinging onto artificial perches or crawling on the bottom. Life span of the small C. virgo larvae and attack rate on them were compared between the cannibalism and IGP treatments. The effect of predation on the activity, habitat use and spatial distribution of the small C. virgo larvae was examined. The IGP rate was 36%. The prey larvae spent the most of their time on the perches, whereas the S. metallica preferred the substrate. The large C.virgo larvae did not cannibalise smaller conspecifics. The presence of a predator (S. metallica) had no effect on the habitat use or activity of the prey (C. virgo) larvae. Habitat use differed more between those species than between conspecifics of different size classes of C. virgo. The spatial distribution between S.metallica and C. virgo showed a completely random pattern, whereas the two size classes of C. virgo aggregated in the vegetation. Absence of cannibalism and behavioural observations indicate that C. virgo may have a low tendency for intraspecific aggressions.","Finnish Environm Inst 140, FIN-00251 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Ilmonen, J (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst 140, FIN-00251 Helsinki, Finland.",jari.ilmonen@ymparisto.fi,,"Suhonen, Jukka/0000-0001-8546-8945",,,,43,5,7,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

Rapid evolution can occur over ecological time-scales, potentially resulting in altered temporal variation in abundance and complicating inferences about the consequences of temporal variation. We assessed whether evolution altered the temporal variability in species' abundances in simple assemblages of species. We then compared experimental results to predictions from two-species models to better understand our results in the context of competitive and predator-prey interactions. We compared founder populations and their evolved descendants in experimental communities of ciliates and rotifers. Using a series of orthogonal contrasts, we then evaluated whether: (a) evolutionary history of invaders or (b) residents, (c) co-evolution among invaders and residents, and (d) invasion itself altered temporal variability in species abundances following invasion by a novel species. Using two-species competition and predator-prey models, we also generated predictions to better understand the effects of evolution on temporal variation in the abundances of interacting species. Finally, we compared experimental and modelling results to aid in the interpretation of which interspecific interactions might be affected by ongoing evolution in our communities. In experimental populations, differing evolutionary histories resulted in significant differences among treatments in abundances and temporal variation in abundances of both resident and invading species. For the contrasts, we found evidence that evolutionary history of the invader and residents, co-evolution among invaders and residents, and invasion itself affected temporal variability in abundance, but the importance of each differed for the two communities and the species within those communities. When comparing experimental results to model predictions, the increased abundance and decreased temporal variation in one invader, Euplotes daidaleos, are potentially consistent with evolution resulting in reduced attack rates in the novel community. Evolutionary history alone can affect temporal variation in the abundances of species, generating important consequences for interspecific interactions among species and complicating inferences about the consequences of temporal variability in biological communities.","[Faillace, Cara A.; Morin, Peter J.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Grad Program Ecol & Evolut, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Faillace, Cara A.] Natl Ctr Sci Res France, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Moulis, France","Faillace, CA (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Grad Program Ecol & Evolut, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",c.faillace@gmail.com,,,Rutgers University; Rutgers University Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolution,Rutgers University; Rutgers University Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolution,,50,4,4,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The distributions of 148 species of the megafauna and of four age classes of Pecten maximus were sampled. Suspension feeders dominate all megabenthic assemblages within the bay. This domination can be related to Crepidula fornicata spreading in the bay; however, no direct competition for food between scallops and the slipper limper (introduced species) has been observed. On the other hand, Crepidula spreading leads to major changes in sediment type (silting) in the bay owing to biodeposit production, and silting would be a major factor inducing the decrease in Pecten maximus distribution. Predation would not be limiting. Within 10 years, one may predict a strong decrease in the area colonized by scallops in the bay.

We compared the demographic characteristics of native central-European and invasive USA-populations of Lythrum salicaria growing in similar habitats. Based on the Evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis, we predicted that shoot density, height, and biomass, fertility, and fecundity would be less in the European populations due to greater loss of plant material caused by exposure to control agents. Shoot density was significantly greater in most USA-populations, but shoot height and biomass were similar in invasive and native populations growing in similar habitats, especially in growing seasons with greater water availability. The number of fertile shoots was greater for invasive populations, except for those growing in sandy, nutrient-poor substrates, while percent fertility did not differ between populations growing under similar field conditions. Fecundity was also similar for populations growing in nutrient-poor and intermediate habitats, but was significantly greater in USA-populations (89103 seeds per fruit), compared to European populations (5864 seeds per fruit), growing in nutrient-rich habitats; seed predators were found in these European populations only. Log-linear analysis of transition frequency matrices showed that the growth of USA-populations is different from European populations, but that habitat effect was strong. Population dynamics were similar for populations growing in nutrient-poor habitats; location was of marginal importance only. USA-populations responded differently from European populations growing in intermediate and nutrient-rich habitats; differences were most pronounced between invasive (center of its North American distribution) and native populations growing in nutrient-rich habitats. The use of insect herbivores as biological control agents in North America will work best against L. salicaria populations growing in nutrient-rich habitats in the center of its invasive distribution, but will be less effective against populations growing in other habitats or portions of its range. Other factors, including nutrient- or water availability, and climate, may be as important as herbivory in affecting invasive populations; these factors interact to control L. salicaria in a more complex manner than thought previously.","[Edwards, Keith R.] Univ Wisconsin, Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Edwards, Keith R.; Kvet, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic; [Adams, Michael S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kvet, Jan] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Edwards, KR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",keith.edwards@tix.bf.jcu.cz,,,U.S. National Park Service [CA 6000-1-8025]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [INT-9116439],"This paper is dedicated to Dr. Herbert Sukopp, in honor of his many and important contributions to the field of invasive plant ecology.

Here we dissect their contributions to community stability in a model herbivore-natural enemy interaction consisting of two aphid species (Acyrthosiphon pisum and Megoura viciae) and a specialist parasitoid (Aphidius ervi) that attacks only one of the aphids (A. pisum). In replicated cage experiments, we found that the two aphid species alone were unable to coexist, with A. pisunt competitively excluding M. viciae. We also found that the simple host-parasitoid interaction between A. pisum and the parasitoid was unstable. However, the three-species community persisted for at least 50 weeks. We constructed a series of models to explain the stability of the full community and conclude that it is due to a combination of density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect interactions. Parasitoid attack on the susceptible host reduces the interspecific competition experienced by the non-host (a density-mediated effect), and the presence of the non-host reduces the searching efficiency of the parasitoid (a trait-mediated effect).","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","van Veen, FJF (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",f.vanveen@imperial.ac.uk,"van Veen, Franciscus JF/H-2101-2013","van Veen, Frank/0000-0003-0708-5492",,,,44,50,51,0,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2005,86,12,,,,,3182,3189,,10.1890/04-1590,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,994YI,WOS:000234066700006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Population densities of C. aleuticus were only consistent with resource densities across years during two of five study years, indicating a lack of resource matching at large temporal scales. On shorter temporal scales, fish growth rates that were two to three times higher in the estuary compared with the stream were inconsistent with the predictions of resource matching theory. A manipulation of C. aleuticus density showed that the estuary could support at least twice the number of individuals that occurred there; thus, the profitable estuary is underutilized. Interspecific competition with Cottus asper was partially responsible for this underutilization as indicated by a substantial reduction in growth and condition among C. aleuticus individuals in experimental manipulations that compared intra- and inter-specific effects. Observed spatial overlap between these two cottids combined with the results of the competition experiment suggests that C. aleuticus is more strongly limited in its ability to use estuarine habitats opportunistically by interspecific competition than by intraspecific competition.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Polivka, KM (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, Wenatchee Forestry Sci Lab, 1133 N Western Ave, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA.",kpolivka@fs.fed.us,,,,,,83,9,10,0,8,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Preference-performance theory predicts that adults will select habitat patches that match the expected performance of their offspring in those patches. Many amphibians breed in temporary ponds immediately after they fill, and one species, Hyla chrysoscelis (Cope's Gray Treefrogs), selects between breeding sites based on patch age differences of as little as 7 d. Prior work established that H. chrysoscelis have better larval performance in more recently filled ponds, but not in ponds less than 15 d after filling or among ponds that differed in age by less than 65 d. Our objective was to determine experimentally whether larval H. chrysoscelis performance varies across short time scales after filling (3- and 23-d-old ponds) and across two larval densities (15 and 30 larvae per mesocosm). Higher larval densities reduced metamorph mass and body condition, but did not otherwise affect larval performance. There were lower survival, shorter larval periods, and slightly lower mass and body condition among larvae from 3- d-old ponds than those in 23-d-old ponds. These mixed performance differences across our two levels of habitat age might not necessarily be representative of what happens in natural systems, however, where older ponds have more established communities of competitors and predators.","[Pintar, Matthew R.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; Univ Mississippi, Ctr Water & Wetlands Resources, University, MS 38677 USA","Pintar, MR (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA.",matthew.pintar@gmail.com,"Pintar, Matthew/AAP-1876-2020","Pintar, Matthew/0000-0003-0165-3882",University of Mississippi Graduate Student Council; Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation; University of Mississippi Field Station,"Support was provided by the University of Mississippi Graduate Student Council, the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation, and the University of Mississippi Field Station.

The human population is rapidly urbanizing, and the negative impacts of urban cover on biodiversity and ecosystem function are expected to increase. Trophic dynamics have been hypothesized to change with urbanization, with consequences for biodiversity and function. Here, I review recent progress in this area by focusing on how urbanization affects dietary sources, trophic interactions and the functional ecology of synanthropic species. 2. Urbanization affects primary autochthonous production in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by replacing and fragmenting natural areas with impervious cover, increasing nutrient supply, changing hydrological regimes, and altering the composition and seasonality of primary producers. The responses of primary production differ between climatic regions or across hydrological regimes. 3. Urbanization can also change the availability of subsidies (autochthonous vs. allochthonous resources) because many urban species feed on human food (anthropogenic subsidies) and because of changes in the plant composition and physical characteristics of riparian zones. 4. Urbanization can change the composition of consumers by decreasing the abundance of apex predators, releasing mesopredators, as well as the introduction of non-native omnivores. 5. Few direct experiments have been conducted on trophic interactions in urban ecosystems. They broadly suggest that urbanization weakens herbivory and predation, but that it might increase competition between synanthropic and urbanophobic species. However, the outcomes of these interactions are highly context-specific. 6. The reliance of synanthropic species on anthropogenic subsidies appears to be an important aspect of urban trophic ecology. However, more research is needed to understand how dietary flexibility, especially in relation to anthropogenic subsidies, contributes to the physiology and population dynamics of synanthropes. 7. Urbanization can dramatically change trophic dynamics in the urban ecosystem with implications for biodiversity patterns, management and conservation. However, it is clear that a broader and more mechanistic understanding of the urban food webs is needed. This can be accomplished through inclusion of functional trophic metrics in monitoring efforts, the use of stable isotope food web metrics, the use of multi-trophic-level experiments and a more detailed study of the functional ecology of synanthropes.","[El-Sabaawi, Rana] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada","El-Sabaawi, R (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada.",rana@uvic.ca,,,,,,114,21,22,9,96,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Most communities of insect herbivores are unlikely to be structured by resource competition, but they may be structured by apparent competition mediated by shared natural enemies. 2. The potential of three guilds of natural enemies (parasitoids, fungal entomopathogens and predators) to influence aphid community structure through indirect interactions is assessed. Based on the biology, we predicted that the scope for apparent competition would be greatest for the predator and least for the parasitoid guilds. 3. Separate fully quantitative food webs were constructed for 3 years for the parasitoid guild, 2 years for the pathogen guild and for a single year for the predator guild. The webs were analysed using standard food web statistics designed for binary data, and using information-theory-based metrics that make use of the full quantitative data. 4. A total of 29 aphid, 24 parasitoid, five entomopathogenic fungi and 13 aphid specialist predator species were recorded in the study. Aphid density varied among years, and two species of aphid were particularly common in different years. Omitting these species, aphid diversity was similar among years. 5. The parasitoid web showed the lowest connectance while standard food web statistics suggested the pathogen and predator webs had similar levels of connectance. However, when a measure based on quantitative data was used the pathogen web was intermediate between the other two guilds. 6. There is evidence that a single aphid species had a particularly large effect on the structure of the pathogen food web. 7. The predator and pathogen webs were not compartmentalized, and the vast majority of parasitoids were connected in a single large compartment. 8. It was concluded that indirect effects are most likely to be mediated by predators, a prediction supported by the available experimental evidence.","[Van Veen, F. J. F.; Godfray, H. C.

Because obligate mutualists are more reliant than facultative mutualists on the resources that their partners provide, they are expected to compete more strongly for those resources. Here, I examined interference competition in two goby fishes: Nes longus (an obligate mutualist) and Ctenogobius saepepallens (a facultative mutualist). Both gobies associate with the shrimp, Alpheus floridanus. Shrimp provide gobies with refuge from predators (a burrow in the sand), and gobies provide shrimp with a warning signal when predators are near. Using an aquarium experiment, I examined the behavior of a pair of gobies with access to a single shrimp burrow. I used four different goby pairings: large N. longus and small N. longus, large N. longus and small C. saepepallens, large C. saepepallens and small N. longus, and large C. saepepallens and small C. saepepallens. When paired with large N. longus individuals, small gobies of both species were less likely to occupy the single burrow than when paired with large C. saepepallens individuals. In addition, large N. longus individuals were less likely to co-occupy the single burrow with smaller gobies than were large C. saepepallens individuals. These results seem to indicate that large N. longus individuals exclude smaller gobies from burrows, while large C. saepepallens individuals do not. This study adds evidence to the supposition that obligate mutualists in general compete more strongly for mutualist partners than do facultative mutualists.","[Lyons, Patrick J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Lyons, PJ (corresponding author), CIEE Res Stn Bonaire, Kaya Gobernador N Debrot 26, Kralendijk, Bonaire, Netherlands.",patrick.lyons5@gmail.com,,,W.

In the first experiment, the zooplanktivorous fish species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) (primary carnivore), was reduced to 27% of its previous population size (53%) of biomass) by a selective rotenone treatment. In the second experiment, zander (Stizostedion lucioperca) (secondary carnivore), were stocked in the lake resulting in a reduction in the population size of roach to 51% of its previous population size (31% of biomass). In both experiments, seasonal average biomass of Daphnia cucullata) increased in the two years with the lowest roach biomasses. but no shift to larger zooplankton forms took place. In the years with increased Daphnia biomass, phytoplankton biomass and transparency showed an increased seasonal variation (measured as coefficient of variation). In contrast to manipulations in which planktivorous fish were totally removed, no effect on seasonal average phytoplankton biomass was observed. Due to the high reproductive capacity of roach, the system returned to previous conditions within a year or two after the perturbations. Under unperturbed conditions, the lake showed few indications of instability as suggested by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis. This lack of instability can. among other things, be related to high zooplanktivore predation pressure present in highly productive lakes preventing overexploitation of primary producers by grazers. In addition, the omnivorous feeding characteristics of roach (feeding on both zooplankton and algae/detritus) and interactions between the open water and the detritus nutrient pool are likely to increase the stability of the system. The two perturbation experiments plus a previous natural experiment (winter fish kill), which all were pulsed perturbations, provide no evidence for the presence of alternative stable states in highly productive lakes. Possibly, a sustained perturbation over several years may shift highly productive lakes from a dominance of phytoplankton production to a dominance of macrophyte production leading to an alternative state.","UNIV LUND,DEPT ECOL LIMNOL,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN","PERSSON, L (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV,DEPT ANIM ECOL,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,90,62,63,0,36,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1993,66,2,,,,,193,208,,10.2307/3544805,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KJ535,WOS:A1993KJ53500003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although these factors vary simultaneously in most systems, their interactive effects are poorly understood. Using artificial pond mesocosms and multiple prey types, we manipulated plant density (SHC: low, high) and inter-patch distance (FHC: short, long) in a full factorial design to test for potential interactive effects of these factors on competition and predation by a dragonfly larva (Anax junius) and fish predator (Lepomis cyanallus). When inter-patch distances (FHC) were short, A. junius consumed more amphipods (36% +/- 4.6%) compared with long treatments (19% +/- 4.8%). We detected no significant effects of plant density (SHC) on prey consumption by A. junius. There were significant interactive effects of FHC and SHC on Lepomis cyanellus consumption of amphipods and damselflies. The most counterintuitive of these effects was that sunfish consumed more larval damselflies at high plant density (64% +/- 6.0%) than at low plant density (38% +/- 8.6%) but only in short connection treatments. This interactive effect of SHC and FHC on damselfly predation by L. cyanellus was likely because damselflies exhibited riskier behavior at higher SHC. Prey consumption with both predators present was additive, but no significant effect of either SHC or FHC on interspecific predation was detected, suggesting compensatory foraging responses. Structural habitat complexity and FHC interactively influence predator foraging behavior in complex, non-intuitive ways that are highly dependent on the predator/prey combination in question. Structural habitat complexity and FHC are currently being influenced by anthropogenic factors in multiple ways (e.g., habitat loss, global climate change), and being able to predict the responses of biotic communities to these changes should be an important consideration in restoration and conservation efforts.","[Pitcher, Kristopher A.; Soluk, Daniel A.] Univ South Dakota, Dept Biol, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA","Pitcher, KA (corresponding author), Univ South Dakota, Dept Biol, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.",kristopher.pitcher@usd.edu,,,University of South Dakota Foundation: Raymond D.

We showed that, separately or in combination, T. aripo and N. tanajoae significantly reduced M. tanajoa populations. Moreover, combined release of T. aripo and N. tanajoae on the same cassava plants improved M. tanajoa control. However, our data suggest between T. aripo and N. tanajoae an asymmetric competition that significantly affected N. tanajoae only. This interference is indirect, probably mediated by their common prey or host mite, M. tanajoa since N. tanajoae is not pathogenic to T. aripo. We conclude that adding N. tanajoae to T. aripo populations in Africa would not negatively affect T. aripo and would further promote biocontrol of M. tanajoa.","[Onzo, Alexis] Univ Parakou, Fac Agron, Parakou, Benin; [Onzo, Alexis] Int Inst Trop Agr, Benin Stn, Cotonou, Benin; [Hanna, Rachid] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin; [Bello, Iliyath A.] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Sci & Tech, Cotonou, Benin; [Hanna, Rachid] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cameroon Stn, Yaounde, Cameroon","Onzo, A (corresponding author), Univ Parakou, Fac Agron, BP 123, Parakou, Benin.",onzalex@yahoo.com,,,International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),"We are grateful to B.

The presence of H. axyridis adults, unlike the presence of C. undecimpunctata, significantly affected the reproductive numerical response of C. undecimpunctata even though the resource was not in short supply. The results suggest that interference competition with heterospecifics may adversely affect the reproductive capacity of C. undecimpunctata.

Dietary analysis of the coqui frog showed that aerial insects made up 33.8 % of the diet. The dietary similarity of the bat and frog was relatively low (Pianka index = 0.25), however, coqui frogs consumed a wide range of juvenile flying insects. Population densities of coqui frogs at two low elevation sites were projected to range from 750 to 14,000 individuals/hectare, and could consume an estimated 1500-19,000 aerial insects/hectare/night, or nearly 90.6 % of all available aerial insects/hectare.

Ecosystem restoration typically focuses on re-establishing native plant communities with the hope of restoring ecological processes over the long term. In contrast, endangered species management usually focuses on short-term actions that directly affect population numbers. Here, we present an intermediate approach. We develop an ecologically based population target for the overabundant herbivore, moose Alces alces, with the goal of restoring a predator-prey system and thus preventing the extinction of the endangered ungulate, woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus. 2. Forest harvesting is a major factor contributing to increases in the number of moose, which in turn increases predator populations. Caribou populations decline as a result of increased predation representing a form of apparent competition between moose and caribou. This presents a unique conservation challenge as recovery of caribou through forest restoration would take decades, while the alternative of directly reducing predator numbers is a short-term solution. A third option is to reduce moose numbers to also maintain predators at low numbers, but the question is to what density should moose be reduced? 3. We created a statistically based target for moose abundance under conditions without forest harvesting by developing a habitat-based population model for moose under current conditions. We then calculated the habitat quality in the same area but under simulated 'pristine' conditions. We also evaluated three measures of ecological carrying capacity to determine the reliability of using current moose abundance to back-calculate numbers for the pristine landscape. 4. Our analysis suggests an 81.6% (71.0-89.9%, 95% CI) reduction in moose habitat quality under pristine conditions. All three measures indicated that moose numbers in the current landscape were near carrying capacity, suggesting that the current abundance could be used to approximate numbers for the pristine landscape and thus be used as an ecological target. 5. Synthesis and applications. There are few experimental tests designed to alleviate predator-mediated apparent competition by reducing overabundant prey. Our target will now be used in an adaptive management framework to evaluate the success of this recovery option for caribou, and inform whether this approach can be applied to other systems involving species endangerment from the apparent competition mechanism.","[Serrouya, Robert; Boutin, Stan] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [McLellan, Bruce N.] British Columbia Minist Forests & Range, Res Branch, Revelstoke, BC V0E 3K0, Canada; [Seip, Dale R.] British Columbia Minist Forests & Range, Res Branch, Prince George, BC V2L 3H9, Canada; [Nielsen, Scott E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada","Serrouya, R (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",Serrouya@ualberta.ca,"Boutin, Stan A/A-2619-2014; Brainerd, Scott M./A-1172-2010; Nielsen, Scott/O-7482-2019; Nielsen, Scott/C-2842-2013","Boutin, Stan A/0000-0001-6317-038X; Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; BC Forest Science Program; Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation; Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program; Downie Timber; Selkirk College; BC Ministry of Environment,"RS was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada scholarship.

Microbial habitats can resemble ecological battlefields where microbial cells struggle to dominate and/or annihilate each other and we explore the hypothesis that (like plant weeds) some microbes are genetically hard-wired to behave in a vigorous and ecologically aggressive manner. These ` microbial weeds' are able to dominate the communities that develop in fertile but uncolonized or at least partially vacant -habitats via traits enabling them to out-grow competitors; robust tolerances to habitat-relevant stress parameters and highly efficient energy-generation systems; avoidance of or resistance to viral infection, predation and grazers; potent antimicrobial systems; and exceptional abilities to sequester and store resources. In addition, those associated with nutritionally complex habitats are extraordinarily versatile in their utilization of diverse substrates. Weed species typically deploy multiple types of antimicrobial including toxins; volatile organic compounds that act as either hydrophobic or highly chaotropic stressors; biosurfactants; organic acids; and moderately chaotropic solutes that are produced in bulk quantities (e. g. acetone, ethanol). Whereas ability to dominate communities is habitat-specific we suggest that some microbial species are archetypal weeds including generalists such as: Pichia anomala, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas putida; specialists such as Dunaliella salina, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus spp. and other lactic acid bacteria; freshwater autotrophs Gonyostomum semen and Microcystis aeruginosa; obligate anaerobes such as Clostridium acetobutylicum; facultative pathogens such as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Pantoea ananatis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and other extremotolerant and extremophilic microbes such as Aspergillus spp., Salinibacter ruber and Haloquadratum walsbyi. Some microbes, such as Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Pseudoxylaria spp., exhibit characteristics of both weed and non-weed species. We propose that the concept of nonweeds represents a ` dustbin' group that includes species such as Synodropsis spp., Polypaecilum pisce, Metschnikowia orientalis, Salmonella spp., and Caulobacter crescentus. We show that microbial weeds are conceptually distinct from plant weeds, microbial copiotrophs, r-strategists, and other ecophysiological groups of microorganism. Microbial weed species are unlikely to emerge from stationary-phase or other types of closed communities; it is open habitats that select for weed phenotypes. Specific characteristics that are common to diverse types of open habitat are identified, and implications of weed biology and openhabitat ecology are discussed in the context of further studies needed in the fields of environmental and applied microbiology.","[Cray, Jonathan A.; Bell, Andrew N.

In December Daphnia was the only susceptible taxon present in large numbers, whereas in March, Ceriodaphnia and Chydorus were also present. This result is consistent with laboratory findings that predation rates are lowered in the presence of more than one prey type. The difficulty of obtaining evidence for significant effects of these planktonic predators is in part due to changes in the preferred prey species in the diet of Piona depending on stage and sex of the mite and to aspects of experimental design. The wide variability between replicate enclosures at each predator density reduced the 'power' of the statistical analyses used to test the null hypothesis.

To investigate the role of intra-guild predation in mediating the impact of the natural enemy complex on herbivore populations, a manipulative field experiment was conducted using uncaged plots (islets of Spartina cordgrass) on a North American salt marsh. The densities (moderate or low) of two invertebrate predators, the generalist wolf spider Pardosa littoralis and the specialist mirid bug Tytthus vagus, were manipulated in a 2 x 2 factorial design, and the resulting treatment effects on the population growth of their herbivorous prey, Prokelisia planthoppers, were assessed. 2. The abundance of wolf spiders on experimental islets was unaffected by the presence of mirid bugs, however the density of mirid bugs was influenced very negatively by the presence of the wolf spider. 3. The negative effect of the wolf spider on mirid bugs most probably resulted from the intra-guild predation of mirids by spiders because planthopper limitation by the wolf spider alone was significantly greater than when both predators were present. 4. As a result of intra-guild predation, planthopper population growth was positive in the presence of both predators, despite the fact that each predator alone promoted a decrease in planthopper population growth. 5. Notably, the occurrence of intra-guild predation diminished top-down impacts on planthopper populations in a relatively simple food web where strong top-down effects were expected. This result, however, was limited to habitats on the marsh with simply structured vegetation lacking leaf litter.","Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Finke, DL (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,49,73,77,0,46,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Indirect effects act among species within or across trophic levels through multiple pathways in an interaction network. Although there are many studies showing indirect effects in ecological communities, we know little about how indirect effects impact the wider community by linking other direct and indirect interactions. Herbivore-induced indirect effects are ubiquitous and powerful forces in structuring ecological communities. In a plant-associated network, aphids have the potential to connect multiple interactions through ant- and plant-mediated indirect effects on co-occurring and/or temporally separated species. We examined how aphids affect the interaction network on tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima, based on data of arthropod species on it with and without the aphid, Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum, using structural equationmodelling (SEM) analysis. The presence of aphids greatly changed the strength of several species interactions throughout the season. In the early season, aphids had negative indirect effects on leafhoppers and moth caterpillars through ants. On the other hand, aphid-induced leaf regrowth decreased scale insects but increased grasshoppers in the late season, when the aphid was no longer present. Moreover, the aphid-generated interactions increased seed production of tall goldenrods, due to indirect pathways through the leaf regrowth. The aphid thus played a critical role as a network creator in determining the interaction network by generating ant- and plant-mediated indirect effects. In particular, the aphid-induced leaf regrowth contributed to interaction diversity (i.e. total number of positive/negative interactions and link density per each species) by connecting arthropod species in the early and late seasons. We disentangled the complexity of direct and indirect pathways generated by the aphid (i.e. keystone herbivore), which largely determines community structure of associated arthropods and plant reproductive success. Our study combining ant- and plant-mediated indirect interactions mediated by the aphid provides a basis of better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how the impact of the keystone herbivore can spread through plant-based insect networks via direct and indirect pathways.","[Ando, Yoshino; Utsumi, Shunsuke; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Ando, Yoshino] Hokkaido Univ, Northern Forestry Res & Dev Off, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Nayoro, Hokkaido 0960071, Japan; [Utsumi, Shunsuke] Hokkaido Univ, Uryu Expt Forest, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Horokanai, Hokkaido 0740741, Japan","Ando, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.; Ando, Y (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Northern Forestry Res & Dev Off, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Nayoro, Hokkaido 0960071, Japan.",anyoshi@gmail.com,,"Utsumi, Shunsuke/0000-0003-1558-8073","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [B-20370010, B-25291102, 16H04842];  [A14];  [A06]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H04842] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank T.

However, little is known about whether the R-AH might serve to predict predator-inducible plastic responses involving different prey phenotypes. We approached this question through an experiment in outdoor mesocosms, manipulating predation risk (with caged predators) and prey conspecific density to test the importance of R-AH for the expression of predator-induced morphological and behavioral phenotypes. We found behavioral (swimming activity) and morphological (tail width and tail muscle depth) responses of bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) to be affected by chemical predation cues. However, only the morphological phenotype responded to the predation-risk: conspecific-density interaction. The width of the tail and the muscle depth of tadpoles were significantly greater when individuals were exposed to predators. However, this effect was not significant in treatments with high prey density in an experimental setup that minimized intraspecific competition. We interpret the differences found among the responses of the phenotypes in terms of the effects of three factors: the potential costs related to each phenotype expression, how these phenotypes are affected by environmental conditions and the immediate response of the phenotypes to actual and perceived prey risk. Our results shed light on the fact that prey individuals use information about population density to estimate actual predation risk from chemical cues. However, different traits are differentially affected, suggesting that trade-off mechanisms associated with the costs of the expression in terms of anti-predator defenses may interfere with the predictions of R-AH for multiple prey phenotypes.","[Guariento, Rafael D.] Fed Univ Mato Grosso Sul UFMS, Ctr Hlth & Biol Sci, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Carneiro, Luciana S.; Caliman, Adriano] Fed Univ Rio Grande Norte UFRN, Dept Ecol, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Esteves, Francisco A.] Fed Univ Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Nucleo Pesquisas Ecol Macae NUPEM, Macae, RJ, Brazil; [Jorge, Jaqueiuto S.] Fed Univ Rio Grande Norte UFRN, Dept Bot & Zool, Natal, RN, Brazil","Guariento, RD (corresponding author), Fed Univ Mato Grosso Sul UFMS, Ctr Hlth & Biol Sci, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.",rafael.guariento@ufms.br,"GUARIENTO, RAFAEL DETTOGNI/J-1211-2014; Caliman, Adriano/A-8668-2008; Guariento, Rafael Dettogni/Q-3602-2019","Caliman, Adriano/0000-0001-9218-5601; Guariento, Rafael Dettogni/0000-0003-2035-2030",Brazilian Council of Research and Technology (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Level Education (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [063/2013]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"We are indebted to Angelica Nagata for field assistance during the sampling of giant water bugs.

To obtain more insight into this process, the influence of grazing by the bacteriovorous flagellate Adriamonas peritocrescens on the competition for limiting amounts of ammonium between the ammonium-oxidizing species Nitrosomonas europaea and the heterotrophic species Arthrobacter globiformis was studied in the presence of Nitrobacter winogradskyi in continuous cultures at dilution rates of 0.004 and 0.01 h-1. The ammonium concentration in the reservoir was maintained at 2 mM, whereas the glucose concentration was increased stepwise from 0 to 7 mM.A. globiformis won the competition for limiting amounts of ammonium when the glucose concentration in the reservoirs increased, in agreement with previously described experiments in which the flagellates were not included. The numbers of nitrifying bacteria decreased as the numbers of heterotrophic bacteria rose with increasing glucose concentrations. Critical C/N ratios, i.e., ratios between glucose and ammonium in the reservoirs at which no nitrate was found in the culture vessels, of 12.5 and 10.5 were determined at dilution rates of 0.004 and 0.01 h-1, respectively. Below these critical values, coexistence of the competing species was found. The numbers of nitrifying bacteria decreased more in the presence of flagellates than in their absence, presumably by selective predation on the nitrifying bacteria, either in the liquid culture or on the glass wall of the culture vessels. Despite this, the rate of nitrate production did not decrease more in the presence of flagellates than in their absence. This demonstrates that no correlation has to be expected between numbers of nitrifying bacteria and their activity and that a constant nitrification rate per cell cannot be assumed for nitrifying bacteria. Above the critical C/N ratios, low numbers of nitrifying bacteria were still found in the culture vessels, probably because of attachment of the nitrifying bacteria to the glass wall of the culture vessels. Like the numbers of heterotrophic bacteria, the numbers of flagellates increased when the glucose concentrations in the reservoirs increased. Numbers of 2 x 10(5) and 12 x 10(5) flagellates ml-1 were found at 7 mM glucose at dilution rates of 0.004 and 0.01 h-1, respectively. It was concluded that the critical C/N ratios were practically unaffected by the presence of protozoa. Although nitrate production rates were equal in the presence and absence of flagellates, the numbers of nitrifying bacteria decreased more strongly in their presence. This indicates a higher activity per nitrifying cell in the presence of flagellates.",,"VERHAGEN, FJM (corresponding author), NETHERLANDS INST ECOL,CTR TERR ECOL,POB 40,6666 ZG HETEREN,NETHERLANDS.",,"Laanbroek, Hendrikus/AAV-9215-2020; Laanbroek, Hendrikus J./C-3830-2008","Laanbroek, Hendrikus/0000-0003-2400-3399; Laanbroek, Hendrikus J./0000-0003-2400-3399",,,,47,45,49,1,15,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171",0099-2240,,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

Our objective was to investigate how fire, rodent activity, and competition among plant species modify plant community structure, invasion patterns, and vulnerability to altered fire regimes. We imposed experimental fires, and reduced rodent density using fencing in a full factorial design and quantified competitive interactions among plant species in the northeast Mojave Desert that has experienced dramatic increases in plant invasion and fire in recent years. Vegetation surveys were conducted in the experimental plots to determine plant density, cover, and biomass of herbaceous plants over a 5-year period. Rodent exclusion increased the density, cover, and biomass of Bromus rubens, an invasive annual grass, and density of forb species. In contrast, rodent exclusion decreased the density, cover, and biomass of Schismus spp. another dominant annual invader. Fire increased Schismus spp. and forb species density, cover, and biomass but decreased B. rubens density. Negative spatial correlation between B. rubens and Schismus spp., and forbs indicated interspecific competition among the dominant plant species. Fire reduced rodent community diversity (Shannon's) 2.5-fold, which was correlated with increases in B. rubens cover and biomass, and native forb diversity. Fire, high rodent diversity, and competition from the other plant species may decrease fire potential in our study system by reducing the density and biomass of B. rubens, which because of its taller growth form tends to ignite and carry fire better than Schismus spp. and forbs.","[Bishop, Tara B.

Connections between consumers and resources in food webs are complex and affect the structure and functioning of ecosystems. We assessed the influence of amphibians as consumers on the structure and functioning of temporary ponds, determining their impact on macrophyte abundance, zooplankton diversity and water chemistry. 2. The effect of amphibians may be modulated by interactions with predators or competitors that alter tadpole density or behaviour. Therefore, we also investigated the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of native and invasive predators on amphibian larvae and pond ecosystems. 3. High amphibian density decreased macrophyte biomass and zooplankton diversity and increased water turbidity and nutrient content. These effects were largely attributable to tadpoles of the largest herbivorous species, spadefoot toads (Pelobates cultripes). In the absence of spadefoot toads, amphibians unexpectedly affected plant biomass positively. 4. Invasive crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) altered community structure in similar ways to high densities of amphibians and caused greater mortality of amphibian larvae than did native predators. 5. The high herbivorous impact of spadefoot toads and invasive crayfish carried over to the following hydrological cycle.","[Arribas, Rosa; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain","Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/F-8226-2014","Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/0000-0003-0094-8195","Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [CGL2009-11123, CGL2012-4044, BES2010-042243]","We thank P.

Hypoxia may affect fish stocks directly or via detrimental effects on important prey species, such as zooplankton. A unique feature of the northern Benguela Current upwelling region and Angola-Benguela frontal system is a pronounced intermediate oxygen minimum layer (IOML) at 60-500 m depth with oxygen concentrations <= 1.4 ing O(2)l(-1) (minimum < 0.7 mg O(2)l(-1)). Field studies during February-March 2002 demonstrated that the abundance of calanoid copepods and the biomass of mesozooplankton in general were severely reduced within the IOML. The dominant copepod Calanoides carinatus showed a bimodal vertical distribution with parts of the population either comprising all developmental stages concentrated in the surface layer (0-60 m), or copepodids C5 diapausing below 400 in depth apparently avoiding the IOML. Accordingly, abundances of other calanoid copepods were higher at the surface and below 300 in than in the centre of the IOML. The scarcity of planktonic life within the IOML raises the question whether this layer represents an effective barrier for zooplankton vertical migrations. Especially in C. carinatus, ontogenetic vertical migration plays a key role in the retention of the population within the productive upwelling region and for the rapid re-colonisation of plumes of newly upwelled water. To address this issue, the hypoxia tolerance of C. carinatus was determined in a series of laboratory-based, closed-bottle experiments in January 2005. Copepods were kept in gas-tight bottles and the decreasing oxygen concentrations were monitored to establish their minimum oxygen demands. Although copepodids survived apparently unharmed at surprisingly low oxygen concentrations of ca. 1.5 Mg O(2)l(-)1, they could not tolerate oxygen levels < 1.1 Mg O(2)l(-1), implying that the core of the IOML, where O2 concentrations are below this threshold, is uninhabitable for C carinatus. In contrast, the IOML may represent a refuge from competition and predation for other copepod species specifically adapted to hypoxic environments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The abundance of native macropod wallabies is extremely high at Booderee National Park (BNP) in south-eastern Australia. This has occurred because of the reduction of exotic predators through an intensive baiting program, coupled with the absence of other predators. The high density of wallabies at BNP may be inhibiting the recruitment of many plant species following fire-induced recruitment events. We experimentally examined the post-fire response of a range of plant species to browsing by wallabies in a forest heavily infested with the invasive species, bitou bush Chrysanthemoides monilifera. We recorded the abundance and size of a range of plant species in 18 unfenced (browsed) and 16 fenced (unbrowsed) plots. We found the abundance and size of bitou bush was suppressed in browsed plots compared to unbrowsed plots. Regenerating seedlings of the canopy or middle storey tree species Eucalyptus pilularis, Acacia implexa, Allocasuarina littoralis, Breynia oblongifolia and Banksia integrifolia were either smaller or fewer in number in grazed plots than treatment plots as were the vines Kennedia rubicunda, Glycine tabacina and Glycine clandestina. In contrast, the understorey fern, Pteridium esculentum increased in abundance in the browsed plots relative to unbrowsed plots probably because of reduced competition with more palatable angiosperms. Twelve months after plots were installed the community structure of the browsed and unbrowsed plots was significantly different (P = 0.023, Global R = 0.091). The relative abundance of C. monilifera and P. esculentum contributed most to the differences. We discuss the possible development of a low diversity bracken fern parkland in Booderee National Park through a trophic cascade, similar to that caused by overabundant deer in the northern hemisphere. We also discuss its implications for broad scale fox control in southern Australian forests.","[Dexter, Nick; Hudson, Matt; James, Stuart] Booderee Natl Pk, Jervis Bay, Australia; [MacGregor, Christopher; Lindenmayer, David B.] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Environm Res Program, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Dexter, N (corresponding author), Booderee Natl Pk, Jervis Bay, Australia.",nicholas.dexter@environment.gov.au,"Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017","Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088",Parks Australia; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"Funding was provided by Parks Australia, and the Australian Research Council.

This hypothesis, inherent in nearly all seed dispersal studies, assumes that density effects are species-specific. Yet because many tree species exhibit overlapping fruiting phenologies and share dispersers, seeds may be deposited preferentially under synchronously fruiting heterospecific trees, another location where they may be particularly vulnerable to mortality, in this case by generalist seed predators. We demonstrate that frugivores disperse higher densities of Cornusflorida seeds under fruiting (female) Ilexopaca trees than under non-fruiting (male) Ilex trees in temperate hardwood forest settings in South Carolina, USA. To determine if density of Cornus and/or Ilex seeds influences survivorship of dispersed Cornus seeds, we followed the fates of experimentally dispersed Cornus seeds in neighborhoods of differing, manipulated background densities of Cornus and Ilex seeds. We found that the probability of predation on dispersed Cornus seeds was a function of both Cornus and Ilex background seed densities. Higher densities of Ilex seeds negatively affected Cornus seed survivorship, and this was particularly evident as background densities of dispersed Cornus seeds increased. These results illustrate the importance of viewing seed dispersal and predation in a community context, as the pattern and intensity of density-dependent mortality may not be solely a function of conspecific densities.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, Bent Creek Expt Forest, Asheville, NC 28806 USA","Kwit, C (corresponding author), Savannah River Ecol Lab, PO Drawer E, Aiken, SC 29802 USA.",kwit@srel.edu,,,,,,56,41,42,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2004,107,2,,,,,303,308,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13388.x,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,853XE,WOS:000223863100009,,,,,2021-09-27,

The capacity of parasitic plants in structuring natural communities is increasingly recognized. These plants can affect the structure, composition and productivity of plant communities by modifying the competitive balance between hosts and non-host species and by altering the quantity and quality of resources entering the soil. Despite the progress made in this field, there is still a lack of integrative studies showing the structuring capacity of parasitic plants in forest ecosystems, where their effect may be less detectable due to the long life span of the system. 2. In this study we evaluate the long-term impact of Viscum album subsp. austriacum on the woody-plant community of a Mediterranean pineland. This mistletoe remains several years on the same host, exerting long-lasting, spatially concentrated effects on community and ecosystem characteristics. Mistletoe concentrates zoochorous seeds and induces changes in the soil fertility and light availability beneath the canopy of parasitized trees, which have the potential to facilitate zoochorous-plant colonization, recruitment, and growth at the same time as it weakens the host. Here, we analyse whether mistletoe-driven changes could result in a nucleus of zoochorous woody plants nourished by the abundant organic detritus accumulated under the host. We also analyse whether mistletoe effects can expand after host death. 3. We selected unparasitized, parasitized, and dead parasitized Pinus nigra trees, in which we studied the joint effect of mistletoe-mediated changes in soil nutrient and light availability, with the seed rain, seed predation, seedling establishment, plant recruitment, and plant growth. Light-and soil-nutrient resources were greater under parasitized trees, and intensified after host death. The seed rain was maximum under parasitized trees, where seedling recruitment proved more likely. Sapling density, richness, and growth increased with the development of parasitism. 4. Our findings show that V. album exerts a strong and lasting impact on the structure and dynamics of Mediterranean pinelands, with parasitized trees acting as centres for the establishment and growth of colonizing fleshy-fruited woody species, which, over the long term, promote vegetation shifts by limiting dominant pine trees and facilitating less represented fleshy-fruited shrubs.","[Mellado, Ana; Zamora, Regino] Univ Granada, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Dept Ecol, Granada, Spain","Mellado, A (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Dept Ecol, Granada, Spain.",anamegar@ugr.es,"Zamora, Regino/B-3179-2010","Zamora, Regino/0000-0002-5049-9968; Mellado, Ana/0000-0002-5188-3726","Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [BES-2009-023219, CGL2008-04794, CGL2011-29910]","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: BES-2009-023219, CGL2008-04794 and CGL2011-29910",,49,21,22,3,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Using the model system of the post-Pleistocene radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) inhabiting blue holes, we used a comparative field study to examine variation in density, age structure, tertiary (adult) sex ratio, habitat use, as well as adult feeding and social behaviors in relation to environmental features including predation risk, interspecific competition, productivity (e.g. chlorophyll a, zooplankton density), and abiotic factors (e.g. salinity, surface diameter). The primary environmental factor associated with ecological differentiation in G. hubbsi was the presence of piscivorous fish. Gambusia hubbsi populations coexisting with predatory fish were less dense, comprised of a smaller proportion of juveniles, and were more concentrated in shallow, near-shore regions of blue holes. In addition to predation risk, the presence of a competitor fish species was associated with G. hubbsi habitat use, and productivity covaried with both age structure and habitat use. Feeding and social behaviors differed considerably between sexes, and both sexes showed behavioral differences between predator regimes by exhibiting more foraging behaviors in the absence of predators and more sexual behaviors in their presence. Males additionally exhibited more aggressive behaviors toward females in the absence of predators, but were more aggressive toward other males in the presence of predators. These results largely matched a priori predictions, and several findings are similar to trends in other related systems. Variation in predation risk appears to represent the primary driver of ecological differentiation in this system, but other previously underappreciated factors (interspecific competition, resource availability) are notable contributors as well. This study highlights the utility of simultaneously evaluating multiple environmental factors and multiple population characteristics within a natural system to pinpoint environmental drivers of ecological differentiation.","[Heinen, Justa L.; Coco, Matthew W.; Marcuard, Maurice S.; Martin, Ryan A.; Langerhans, R.

First, we analysed the general pattern by correlation analysis. Thereafter, we experimentally assessed cause-effect relationships between the species or assemblages that were clearly related in the correlation study. The abundance of Cliona viridis (Schmidt 1862) was positively correlated with that of sea urchins and negatively correlated with fleshy algal cover. These relationships were confirmed by field experiments: treatments without fleshy algae, owing to both natural and simulated sea urchin grazing, promoted C. viridis growth significantly more than controls. Our results support the hypothesis that sea urchin grazing on seaweeds increases light availability at the basal stratum, which favours the primary production of the symbiotic zooxanthellae and thus C. viridis growth through nutrient transfer. We found a network of interactions with several signs, directions and strengths: a strong positive indirect interaction ('facilitation') between sea urchins and C. viridis, a negative direct interaction between sea urchins and seaweeds ('predation'), a negative direct interaction between seaweeds and C, viridis ('shading-interference') and a weaker but significant direct interaction between C, viridis and Pione vastifica ('space competition'). The multiple interactions observed suggest a cascade that involves 4 trophic levels: primary producers, herbivorous, carnivorous, and filter-feeders. This cascading process can have negative cryptic implications on the environment, as the excavating sponge C. viridis is a bio-eroder that may strongly impact the shallow sublittoral landscape by producing substrate weakening and instability. The knowledge acquired on the sign and strength of these multi-species interactions is useful to model and predict the responses of shallow benthic communities to anthropogenic disturbances (i.e. overfishing and eutrophication).","CSIC, Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes, Blanes 17300, Spain","Cebrian, E (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes, C-O Acces Cala St Francesc 14, Blanes 17300, Spain.",emma@ceab.csic.es,"Uriz, Maria/J-9001-2012; Cebrian, Emma/J-9640-2012","Cebrian, Emma/0000-0001-7588-0135",,,,26,28,29,1,14,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

For most taxa, abundances of epifauna were greatest during the austral winter (July to September). Abundances of epifauna showed a negative correlation with Sargassum biomass but a positive correlation with levels of epiphytes. Two hypotheses were tested to elucidate the causes of these temporal variations: (1) abundance of epifauna was constrained by habitat complexity (as defined by levels of epiphytic algae not Sargassum biomass); (2) predation by fishes maintained epifaunal abundance below the carrying capacity of the environment. The first hypothesis was tested using artificial macroalgal mimics with different levels of epiphytes. Multivariate analysis of a number of epifaunal taxa revealed significant effects of levels of epiphytes: abundances of most taxa were greater on epiphytised mimics and community composition was different between treatments. The second hypothesis was tested using a caging experiment to exclude fishes and the results showed no demonstrable effects of predation. However, significant caging artifacts were found which could have masked effects of predation. It is suggested that the additional Complexity of habitats provided by epiphytes has an important effect in determining seasonal patterns of abundance of epifauna.",,"MARTINSMITH, KM (corresponding author), JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND,DEPT MARINE BIOL,TOWNSVILLE,QLD 4811,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,48,95,99,0,40,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Haplochromine males uniquely possess oval, bright spots on their anal fin, called 'egg-spots' or 'egg-dummies'. These are presumed to be an evolutionary key innovation that contributed to the tribe's evolutionary success. Egg-spots have been proposed to mimic the ova of the mouthbrooding females of the corresponding species, contribute to fertilization success and even facilitate species recognition. Interestingly, egg-spot number varies extensively not only between species, but also within some populations. This high degree of intraspecific variation may appear to be counterintuitive since selection might be expected to act to stabilize traits that are correlated with fitness measures. We addressed this 'paradox' experimentally, and found that in the haplochromine cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, the number of egg-spots was related to male age, body condition and dominance status. Intriguingly, the egg-spot number also had a high heritable component ( narrow sense heritability of 0.5). These results suggest that the function of egg-spots might have less to do with fertilization success or species recognition, but rather relate to mate choice and/or male-male competition, helping to explain the high variability in this important trait.","[Lehtonen, Topi K.; Meyer, Axel] Univ Konstanz, Lehrstuhl Zool & Evolut Biol, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Lehtonen, Topi K.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland","Meyer, A (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Lehrstuhl Zool & Evolut Biol, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",axel.meyer@uni-konstanz.de,"Lehtonen, Topi/A-6679-2010; Meyer, Axel/C-9826-2009","Lehtonen, Topi/0000-0002-1372-9509; Meyer, Axel/0000-0002-0888-8193",Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG); University of Konstanz,"We thank Janine Sieling for logistical help, Birgit Gogol for help with measuring the photographs, Hysing Bolstad and Carla Sgro for their advice on statistical matters, and Frederico Henning, Matthias Sanetra and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and discussions.

Experiments provide strong evidence of the role of selective predation by cyclopoid copepods in structuring zooplankton communities. To assess the predation impact of a cyclopoid copepod, Mesocyclops pehpeiensis, we conducted a mesocosm experiment using 20-1 polyethylene tanks in which the density of the predator and the food available to herbivorous zooplankton varied. M. pehpeiensis had a notable but selective effect on the zooplankton community. The population of a small cladoceran, Bosmina fatalis was affected negatively, but M. pehpeiensis did not have any apparent impact on the population dynamics of another Bosmina species, B. longirostris. On the other hand, the population of small rotifers responded positively to the presence of M. pehpeiensis.. and their densities increased in mesocosms with a high density of M. pehpeiensis. It seems that suppression of B. fatalis by M. pehpeiensis predation indirectly affected rotifers by releasing them from competition with B. fatalis.

Grazing activity on periphytic mats determines mat structure and spatial heterogeneity. Spatial complexity in stream periphyton is highly divergent and may depend on the functional traits of the different primary consumers species (i.e., grazers) such as mouthpart morphology, feeding behavior, and feeding activity. We evaluated the effect of grazing by three species having different functional traits on periphytic mat structure with a focus on mohthpart morphology. Methods. An enclosure experiment was conducted in a stream located in the Nara Prefecture of Japan using two caddisflies with scraping mouthparts, Micrasema quadriloba and Glossosoma, and one mayfly, Epeorus, with brushing mouthparts. The spatial heterogeneity of chlorophyll a(Chl a) was evaluated, and the periphytic mat was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after a 12-d feeding experiment. Results. Our results showed the differences in the spatial heterogeneity of the periphytic mats, such as differences in Chl a levels, grazed by the different grazing species. The strongest effect on the spatial heterogeneity and periphytic abundance was observed for Micrasema quadriloba, a caddisfly species with scraping mouthparts. Epeorus mayfly, with brushing mouthparts and high-mobility behavior, produced the weakest effect on spatial heterogeneity. Glossosoma caddisflies had moderate effects on periphytic spatial heterogeneity and abundance. Our results suggest that differences in grazing effects are largely dependent on grazer mouthparts and behavior.","[Katano, Izumi] Nara Womens Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Sci, Nara, Japan; [Katano, Izumi] Nara Womens Univ, KYOUSEI Sci Ctr Life & Nat, Nara, Japan; [Doi, Hideyuki] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Simulat Studies, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan","Katano, I (corresponding author), Nara Womens Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Sci, Nara, Japan.; Katano, I (corresponding author), Nara Womens Univ, KYOUSEI Sci Ctr Life & Nat, Nara, Japan.",katanon2003@yahoo.co.jp,,"Katano, Izumi/0000-0002-1657-619X",,,,28,0,0,0,1,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2167-8359,,,PEERJ,PeerJ,JUN 5,2019,7,,,,,,,,e6747,10.7717/peerj.6747,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,IB2BV,WOS:000470074100001,31205820,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-27,

Spatially distributed resources can lead to the formation of metapopulations, where individual subpopulations are often small and can experience frequent local extinction events followed by recolonisation. An example of terrestrial metapopulations are specialised phytophagous insects on their patchily distributed host plants. 2. The present study investigated the population dynamics of a specialised aphid (Metopeurum fuscoviride) on its patchily distributed host plant (Tanacetum vulgare) and associated community of mutualistic ants and predators in a small-scale field site. Furthermore, aphid habitat differences (plant size, C/N ratio, location and surrounding vegetation) were quantified, and seasonal timing and precipitation were considered. 3. Seasonal timing and precipitation both had effects on aphid colonisation, extinction events and aphid colony persistence. Towards the end of the season, and after higher precipitation, aphid colonisation events decreased and extinction events increased. Plant size and location as well as aphid within-field dispersal determined the spatio-temporal distribution of aphid colonies. 4. Mutualistic ants (Lasius niger and Myrmica rubra) increased the chance of establishment of aphid colonies. However, when M. rubra was tending, aphid colony persistence was reduced. Aphid persistence and extinction were dependent on aphid abundance, as a higher colony size reduced the probability of extinction by predation. 5. The results emphasise the importance of dispersal limitation, population growth and the presence of mutualists when studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of tansy aphids, particularly in a small-scale field site.","[Senft, Matthias; Weisser, Wolfgang W.; Zytynska, Sharon E.] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Senft, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",matthias.senft@tum.de,"Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014; Zytynska, Sharon/C-9089-2011","Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Zytynska, Sharon/0000-0002-0174-3303; Senft, Matthias/0000-0003-3478-4774",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [WE 3081/25-1]; FP7-IRSES project APHIWEB [611810],"We gratefully acknowledge Anna Ayvazyan, Andreas Huber and Santiago Hinojosa for help in the field, Sigrid Hiesch for plant C/N analysis, Prof. Dr. Heike Feldhaar for help with ant identification, and Irene Haslberger for permission to work on the field site.

The aim of this study was to analyse the trophic ecology of two demersal predator species, black anglerfish (Lophius budegassa) and white anglerfish (L. piscatorius), in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Both species are important in the study area due to their high abundance and economic value, but information about their feeding behaviour is scarce. Here, we described the diet composition and ecological role of these two species, investigating whether trophic segregation exists between them and amongst fish of different sizes. In addition, by using experimental survey data we described the spatial distribution of both species to help us interpret trophic behaviour patterns. We gathered samples of two different sizes (small individuals of a total length <30 cm and large individuals >= 30 cm) of both species and combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) of nitrogen and carbon with isotopic mixing models. Our results revealed that both anglerfish species are opportunistic predators, showing a diet composed mainly of fishes and, to a lesser extent, of crustaceans, with a small proportion of cephalopods, gastropods, bivalves and echinoderms. We found trophic segregation between the two species and the two sizes, indicating that they feed on different prey, in line with differences in their spatial distribution within the study area. This partial partition of food resources could also be explained by the differences in rhythms of activity that were reported in previous studies. In addition, although both species occupied a high position within the food web, our results showed that white anglerfish individuals and the large-sized fish of both species held higher trophic positions.

However, quantifying habitat quality is problematic because it may comprise of abiotic components at different spatial scales and also be influenced by biotic processes. This study investigated the relationship between reef-associated Caribbean fishes and habitat quality at 2 spatial scales: (1) multiple characteristics of Montastraea annularis coral colonies (<1 m(2)) and (2) coral density in a 5 x 5 m plot around each microhabitat. Furthermore, the influence on habitat quality of 2 biotic factors (predation pressure and interactions between competitively superior territorial damselfishes and other species) was considered. A total of 102 M. annularis colonies within thirty 25 m(2) plots were surveyed on a Belizean forereef. Generalised linear mixed-effect models demonstrated that both damselfishes and other reef associated species were correlated with colony-scale habitat quality (more abundant on taller, refuge-rich colonies). Adult reef-associated species were also correlated with larger-scale habitat quality, being more abundant on colonies with high densities of other Montastraea colonies within 25 m(2) (probably higher quality home ranges). However, the presence of damselfishes was associated with reduced abundances of other reef-associated species on M. annularis colonies, reflecting the importance of both biotic and abiotic controls of habitat quality. On reefs, coral mortality will reduce the density of optimal colonies and potentially increase the proportion occupied by damselfishes. This may lead to smaller populations of inferior competitors as they are increasingly displaced onto sub-optimal microhabitats.","[Harborne, Alastair R.; Kennedy, Emma V.] Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Harborne, Alastair R.; Mumby, Peter J.; Ferrari, Renata] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Harborne, AR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Lab, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",a.r.harborne@ex.ac.uk,"Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010; Harborne, Alastair R/F-6155-2013; Ferrari, Renata/E-3109-2016; Kennedy, Emma V/M-3193-2014","Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053; Harborne, Alastair R/0000-0002-6818-8615; Ferrari, Renata/0000-0002-5056-1178; Kennedy, Emma V/0000-0003-1821-9740",Global Environment Facility; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/F015704/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G017344/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"This study was funded by the Global Environment Facility's Coral Reef Targeted Research, awarded to P.J.M.

However, in many cases little information is available on host populations and few comparative studies have been conducted to test predictions. Herein, we compare the basic ecology of the sea anemone Phymactis clematis and the sea urchin Tetrapygus niger, each being host to a different porcellanid crab species, Allopetrolisthes spinifrons and Liopetrolisthes mitra, respectively. We first provide a description of host abundance and distribution and then test predictions concerning the behavioral ecology of the two crab symbionts to understand how and to what extent host characteristics affect the behavior of symbionts (i.e., host-resource monopolization). In the field, distances between host individuals (similar to15 cm) were similar for both sea anemones and sea urchins. However, the sea anemones were significantly less abundant than sea urchins. Furthermore, sea anemones represent a relatively small and morphologically simple microhabitat for A. spinifrons crabs, whereas sea urchins represent a relatively large and morphologically complex microhabitat for L. mitra crabs. The population distribution and size-specific association pattern of the two symbiotic crabs differed substantially, with A. spinifrons leading a solitary and L. mitra a gregarious life-style. Adults of A. spinifrons only cohabited with sexually immature individuals on their host, whereas adult L. mitra frequently occurred together with other adult crabs of both sexes on their host. These differences suggest strong territorial behavior for A. spinifrons but not for L. mitra, which is supported by results from other experimental studies on the intraspecific interactions of the two crab symbionts. The presence or absence of host-resource monopolization behaviors in these crab species appears to be an adaptive behavioral response depending on features of the corresponding host species - particularly host abundance, morphological complexity, and relative size. Based on these results, we developed a conceptual model to predict the probability for a symbiont to monopolize a host successfully, depending on host characteristics. The model predicts that the probability of host-resource monopolization behavior of a symbiont decreases with increasing (1) host abundance, (2) host complexity, and (3) relative host size. The present study is a first attempt to understand how host-resource monopolization behaviors have evolved and developed in symbiotic crustaceans and other marine invertebrates.","Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Biol Marina, Coquimbo, Chile","Thiel, M (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Biol Marina, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.",thiel@ucn.cl,,"Baeza, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-2573-6773",,,,44,48,52,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Consequently, it is important that we understand how anthropogenic resource (bottom-up) and consumer (top-down) manipulations affect aquatic food web structure and production. Future climate changes are predicted to increase the inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon to lakes. These carbon subsidies can either increase or decrease total basal production in aquatic food webs, depending on bacterial competition with phytoplankton for nutrients. This study examines the effects of carbon subsidies (bottom-up) on a pelagic community exposed to different levels of top-down predation. We conducted a large scale mesocosm experiment in an oligotrophic clear water lake in northern Sweden, using a natural plankton community exposed to three levels of glucose addition (0, 420 and 2100 mu g C l-1 total added glucose) and three levels of young-of-the-year perch Perca fluviatilis density (0, 0.56 and 2 individuals m-3). Bacterioplankton production doubled with glucose addition, but phytoplankton production was unaffected, in contrast to previous studies that have manipulated carbon, nutrients or light simultaneously. This suggests that carbon addition alone is not sufficient to reduce autotrophic production, at least in an oligotrophic lake dominated by mixotrophic phytoplankton. Larval perch grazing did not produce a classical trophic cascade, but substantially altered the species composition of crustacean zooplankton and ciliate trophic levels. Glucose addition increased the biomass of rotifers, thus potentially increasing energy transfer through the heterotrophic pathway, but only when fish were absent. This study illustrates that changes in community structure due to selective feeding by top-predators can determine the influence of bottom-up carbon subsidies.","[Faithfull, C.

Despite the importance of seed predation, large-scale patterns of small-mammal granivory are often highly variable and thus difficult to predict. We hypothesize distributions of apex predators can create large-scale variation in the distribution and abundance of mesopredators that consume small mammals, creating predictable areas of high and low granivory. For example, because gray wolf (Canis lupus) territories are characterized by relatively less use by coyotes (C. latrans) and greater use by foxes (Vulpes vulpes, Urocyon cinereoargentus) that consume a greater proportion of small mammals, wolf territories may be areas of reduced small-mammal granivory. Using large-scale, multiyear field trials at 22 sites with high- and low-wolf occupancy in northern Wisconsin, we evaluated whether removal of seeds of four tree species was lower in wolf territories. Consistent with the hypothesized consequences of wolf occupancy, seed removal of three species was more than 25% lower in high-wolf-occupancy areas across 2 years and small-mammal abundance was more than 40% lower in high-wolf areas during one of two study years. These significant results, in conjunction with evidence of seed consumption in situ and the absence of significant habitat differences between high- and low-wolf areas, suggest that top-down effects of wolves on small-mammal granivory and seed survival may occur. Understanding how interactions among carnivores create spatial patterns in interactions among lower trophic levels may allow for more accurate predictions of large-scale patterns in seed survival and forest composition.","[Chandler, Jennifer L.; Orrock, John L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Van Deelen, Timothy R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Nibbelink, Nathan P.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Chandler, JL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jchandler3@wisc.edu,,"Orrock, John/0000-0003-0768-7389",American Society of Mammalogists; Natural Resources Foundation of WI's Turtle Flambeau Scenic Waters Area Fund; UW Vilas Associates Fellowship,"This work was supported by an American Society of Mammalogists Grant-in-Aid to JLC, a grant from the Natural Resources Foundation of WI's Turtle Flambeau Scenic Waters Area Fund to JLC, and a UW Vilas Associates Fellowship to JLO.",,84,1,1,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Faster growing, larger and/or more aggressive crayfish species are predicted to dominate permanent waterbodies. We tested this prediction using a 9 year dataset for two species of crayfish (Procambarus alleni and Procambarus fallax) co-existing in a sub-tropical flowing slough in southern Florida. Using a series of laboratory and mesocosm experiments we also compared life history traits and performance of the respective species to test mechanisms that could explain dominance shifts in the local crayfish assemblages. 2. Over the 9-year period, P. alleni densities were the greatest in shallower, shorter-hydroperiod areas bordering the slough, while P. fallax densities were higher in deeper, longer-hydroperiod central areas. These areas were separated by 0.8-2 km of continuous wetland with no apparent barriers to movement between them. 3. Density of P. fallax was not strongly affected by any measures of hydrological variation, while P. alleni density increased with more severe drought conditions. Following the strongest droughts, P. alleni colonized areas in the centre of the slough where they had been absent or scarce in wetter years. 4. We conducted experiments to compare growth rates, drought tolerance, and competitive dominance of these species. P. alleni survived drought conditions better, had higher growth rates, and was the dominant competitor for space and food. While drought probably limits P. fallax in the drier slough habitats, neither drought sensitivity nor interspecific competition with P. fallax can explain decreases of P. alleni with wetter conditions. 5. Our results indicate that a competition-colonization tradeoff cannot explain the crayfish compositional dynamics in this wetland because P. alleni is both the best competitor and the best at surviving in and colonizing areas with the strongest droughts. Future attention should focus on the potential for selective effects of predators that co-vary with hydrology. 6. The traits (large size, fast growth, competitive dominance) exhibited by P. alleni, which is absent in long-hydroperiod wetlands, are those exhibited by dominant crayfish in permanent lakes and streams containing fish. Although these traits make crayfish less vulnerable to fish in some lakes and streams, life-history models of community structure across permanence gradients suggest the opposite traits should be favoured for co-existence with fish.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Dorn, NJ (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USA.",ndorn1@fau.edu,"Trexler, Joel C/I-5265-2012",,,,,37,40,42,0,43,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Mosquito breeding habitats harbor a diversified naturally occurring microbiota assemblage, and the biota have different types of interactions with mosquito larvae in those habitats. Those interactions may include parasitism, pathogenism, predation, and competition which cause the mortality of larvae, natural reduction of larval abundance, or alterations in their growth. Many microbiota species serve as food items for mosquito larvae, and there are also some indigestible or toxic phytoplanktons to larvae. However, when there is coexistence or mutualism of different mosquito species along with associated microbiota, they form a community sharing the habitat requirements. With the available literature, it is evident that the abundance of mosquito larvae is related to the densities of associated microbiota and their composition in that particular breeding habitat. Potential antagonist microbiota which are naturally occurring in mosquito breeding habitats could be used in integrated vector control approaches, and this method rises as an ecofriendly approach in controlling larvae in natural habitats themselves. To date, this aspect has received less attention; only a limited number of species of microbiota inhabiting mosquito breeding habitats have been recorded, and detailed studies on microbiota assemblage in relation to diverse vector mosquito breeding habitats and their association with mosquito larvae are few. Therefore, future studies on this important ecological aspect are encouraged. Such studies may help to identify field characteristic agents that can serve as mosquito controlling candidates in their natural habitats themselves.","[Ranasinghe, H. A. K.; Amarasinghe, L.

Theory indicates that this variation might stem from life-history characteristics of parasites and key ecological factors. Here, we illustrate how the interaction of an important predator and the schedule of transmission potential of two parasites can explain parasite abundance. A field survey showed that a noncastrating fungus (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) commonly infected a dominant zooplankton host (Daphnia dentifera), while a castrating bacterial parasite (Pasteuria ramosa) was rare. This result seemed surprising given that the bacterium produces many more infectious propagules (spores) than the fungus upon host death. The fungus's dominance can be explained by the schedule of within-host growth of parasites (i.e., how transmission potential changes over the course of infection) and the release of spores from sloppy predators (Chaoborus spp., who consume Daphnia prey whole and then later regurgitate the carapace and parasite spores). In essence, sloppy predators create a niche that the faster-schedule fungus currently occupies. However, a selection experiment showed that the slower-schedule bacterium can evolve into this faster-schedule, predator-mediated niche (but pays a cost in maximal spore yield to do so). Hence, our study shows how parasite life history can interact with predation to strongly influence the ecology, epidemiology, and evolution of infectious disease.","[Auld, Stuart K. J.

The two sites were sampled yearly for 10 years. Average sizes, growth and mortality of the different age-classes were estimated from the cohort structure of the two populations. Laboratory experiments also investigated the ability of the common predatory isopod Saduria entomon to cause density-dependent (DD) mortality of the prey M. affinis. At site A, 43 m depth, the average density of M. affinis was twice as high as at site B, 81 m depth. The fluctuations in density were asynchronous between the two sites. Recruitment and subadult sizes of Monoporeia affinis were density dependent at both sites. The main functional difference between the two populations seemed to be the DD mortality of the 1 + cohort that occurred only at the low-density site B. A corresponding DD mortality was found in the predation experiments at densities of 1 + M. affinis corresponding to those found at site B. The potential importance of the predator was also indicated by a significant negative correlation between the biomass of S. entomon and the rate of change in M. affinis density in the field. The similarities in the abiotic factors between the two sites suggested that differences in carrying capacity should be small. The results could be explained by the predation regulation hypothesis for the low-density population at site B, while at site A M. affinis seemed to be regulated by intra-specific competition and limited by predation. It is suggested that in this simple predator-prey system there is potential for the existence of alternative equilibria.",,"LEONARDSSON, K (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,60,23,23,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,1994,97,1,,,,,26,34,,10.1007/BF00317905,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MY916,WOS:A1994MY91600004,28313586,,,,2021-09-27,

Ecological processes, in particular negative indirect effects mediated by shared natural enemies (apparent competition), may be important in structuring phytophagous insect communities. The potential for indirect interactions can be assessed by analyzing the trophic structure of insect communities, and we claim that quantitative food webs are particularly well suited for this task. We review the experimental evidence for both short-term and long-term apparent competition in phytophagous insect communities and discuss the possible interactions between apparent competition and intraguild predation or shared mutualists. There is increasing evidence for the importance of trait-mediated as well as density-mediated indirect effects. We conclude that there is a need for large-scale experiments manipulating communities in their entirety and a greater integration of community and chemical ecology.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, Ctr Populat Biol, NERC, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","van Veen, FJF (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, Ctr Populat Biol, NERC, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",f.vanveen@imperial.ac.uk; rebecca.morris@zoology.oxford.ac.uk; c.godfray@imperial.ac.uk,"van Veen, Franciscus JF/H-2101-2013","van Veen, Frank/0000-0003-0708-5492",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [D19263] Funding Source: Medline,,,137,193,198,2,133,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

Their invasions appear to comprise a combination of passive and active dispersal mechanisms, both natural and human-mediated. Despite the significance of Ponto-Caspian gobies as invasive species, there is little information about the mechanisms underpinning their dispersal. They are relatively small benthic fish, with high site affinity. Thus, actively dispersing individuals must express a behavioural motivation to engage in persistent directional movement. Several recent studies have suggested that inter-individual behavioural differences in boldness, activity level and tendency to explore might underpin dispersal. In addition, because males are highly territorial, intraspecific competition may lead to density-dependent dispersal of subordinate individuals. To date, studies on this subject have focused mainly on comparisons between individuals from the core of established populations with those at the margins and, thus, address the outcome of dispersal rather than the mechanism itself. We conducted a series of experiments on the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus to address the question of what behavioural and physiological traits predict the tendency of an individual to perform dispersal behaviour, specifically considering the role of conspecifics in influencing the tendency to disperse. We used an artificial channel to measure dispersal tendency in this species in combination with behavioural trials. Our results showed that fish with a greater tendency to disperse in an experimental channel grew more slowly and were bolder; that is displayed a greater propensity to emerge from a cryptic background onto a white background and performed worse in prey capture trials. As predicted, intraspecific competition played a primary role in the dispersal of the racer goby. Dominant males showed a tendency to monopolise limited shelters with an outcome that subordinates were forced to disperse upstream. The specific growth rate of individuals appeared to be a good indicator of social position. Subordinate males expressed the lowest rates of growth, probably as a result of long-term deprivation of food in the presence of dominant conspecifics. They were also quicker to explore novel environments, possibly to search for food. Contrary to expectations, subordinate individuals performed relatively poorly in feeding trials when tested individually. Our findings suggest that intraspecific competition in racer goby males is an important mechanism for active dispersal. It can also influence inter-individual variation in traits such as boldness and tendency to explore novel environments. Similar responses to competitive interactions may have encouraged the invasive expansion of other Ponto-Caspian gobies following establishment in new environments, as well as other fish species that exhibit territorial behaviour.","[Grabowska, Joanna; Zieba, Grzegorz; Przybylski, Miroslaw; Smith, Carl] Univ Lodz, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Lodz, Poland; [Smith, Carl] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Smith, Carl] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Smith, Carl] Univ St Andrews, Bell Pettigrew Museum Nat Hist, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland","Grabowska, J (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Lodz, Poland.",joanna.grabowska@biol.uni.lodz.pl,"; Grabowska, Joanna/K-8305-2013","Przybylski, Miroslaw/0000-0001-5786-5695; Grabowska, Joanna/0000-0001-9924-0650; Zieba, Grzegorz/0000-0003-4443-6802; Smith, Carl Hendrik/0000-0003-3285-0379",,,,58,4,4,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Some areas of moist eucalypt forest that are managed for sustained timber production also support very high densities of bell miners. In this study, we quantified the relative population density of bell miners in forests, and investigated the relationship between bell miner population density, the relative population density of other birds and species richness. A study site of 900 ha was selected in Olney State Forest on the Central Coast of New South Wales (33 degrees 7' S, 150 degrees 22' E), an area that has been managed for timber production since the 1920s. Monthly census counts were carried out over a 16-month period to include diurnal and seasonal variation. Bell miner population density ranged from 14-38 birds/ha and was found to be negatively correlated with diversity of other species. A linear empirical relationship was found between bird species richness (y) and bell miner relative population density (x) by the equation y = -0.12x + 7.78 (R = 0.9638, n = 8, P < 0.0001), and an increase in bell miner abundance was found to decrease the abundance of other species as given by the equation y = -0.32x + 16.83 (R = -0.9646, n = 8, P < 0.0001). Experiments elsewhere in which bell miners were removed from eucalypt woodland plots have shown a return of avian biodiversity and enhanced tree growth, and this study provides an empirical relationship describing the impact on avian diversity for a given forest. We recommend a test of the hypothesis that manipulation of the understorey during burning and logging, could be used to reduce bell miner population levels in wet eucalypt forests, with corresponding benefits to avian biodiversity and tree growth. Work toward these ends has been initiated by the bell miner Associated Dieback Working Group in northern NSW at present and our findings support their strategy.

Colonial species have been proposed to be more vulnerable than dispersed, solitary species to disturbance and perceived risk from hunting. However, empirical comparisons of density dependence vs. risk disturbance in hunted species are few. To compare density dependence with risk-disturbance effects of hunting on individuals and populations of a colonial species, we tested the response of black-tailed prairie dogs Cynomys ludovicianus to shooting in a before-after, treatment-control experiment. We subjected five colonies to a pulse of shooting, and compared individual and colony attributes to those of five control colonies, protected from shooting. Surviving prairie dogs increased alert behaviours eightfold and reduced both above-ground activity and time spent foraging by 66%. Changes in behaviour lowered the body condition of surviving adults by 35%. Survivors of shooting, especially juveniles, exhibited elevated stress levels; faecal corticosterone concentrations increased by 80% among juveniles. Unexpectedly, overwinter survival rates did not increase in response to reduced prairie dog density. Colonies subjected to shooting experienced reproductive near-collapse the summer after shooting; pregnancy rates declined by 50% and reproductive output fell by 82%. Risk-disturbance overwhelmed any possible density-dependent effects of shooting in prairie dogs, which exhibited additive mortality in response to hunting, and reproductive failure 1 year after shooting. Risk-disturbance was the predominant mechanism whereby individuals and colonies were affected by hunting. Synthesis and applications. Because of their coloniality, prairie dogs possess certain life-history traits that predisposed them to be particularly susceptible to hunting-associated disturbances, which had cascading effects on population-level processes. Our findings contradict the general belief that small-bodied mammals quickly rebound from hunting exploitation via compensatory mortality and reproduction. Managers should consider measures to reduce recreational shooting intensity and duration in regions where black-tailed prairie dog colony growth and persistence is desired, yet allow shooting in areas where colonies conflict with landowner interests.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Pauli, JN (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jpauli@uwyo.edu,"Buskirk, Steven W/K-2871-2016","Buskirk, Steven W/0000-0003-0611-6648",,,,58,28,28,0,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

A detailed description of the biodiversity and community structure is needed to help understand the ecological processes that underlie the distribution and dynamics of deep-sea vent communities. Here, we assessed the composition, abundance, diversity and trophic structure of six tubeworm samples, corresponding to different successional stages, collected on the Grotto hydrothermal edifice (Main Endeavour Field, Juan de Fuca Ridge) at 2196m depth. Including R. piscesae, a total of 36 macro-faunal taxa were identified to the species level. Although polychaetes made up the most diverse taxon, faunal densities were dominated by gastropods. Most tubeworm aggregations were numerically dominated by the gastropods Lepetodrilus fucensis and Depressigyra globulus and polychaete Amphisamytha carldarei. The highest diversities were found in tubeworm aggregations characterised by the longest tubes (18.5 +/- 3.3 cm). The high biomass of grazers and high resource partitioning at a small scale illustrates the importance of the diversity of free-living microbial communities in the maintenance of food webs. Although symbiont-bearing invertebrates R. piscesae represented a large part of the total biomass, the low number of specialised predators on this potential food source suggests that its primary role lies in community structuring. Vent food webs did not appear to be organised through predator-prey relationships. For example, although trophic structure complexity increased with ecological successional stages, showing a higher number of predators in the last stages, the food web structure itself did not change across assemblages. We suggest that environmental gradients provided by the biogenic structure of tubeworm bushes generate a multitude of ecological niches and contribute to the partitioning of nutritional resources, releasing communities from competition pressure for resources and thus allowing species to coexist.","[Lelievre, Yann; Sarrazin, Jozee; Marticorena, Julien; Day, Thomas; Matabos, Marjolaine] IFREMER, Ctr Bretagne, REM EEP, Lab Environm Profond, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Lelievre, Yann; Legendre, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, CP 6128,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Schaal, Gauthier] UMR 6539 9 CNRS UBO IRD Ifremer, Lab Sci Environm Marin LEMAR, BP 70, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Hourdez, Stephane] Sorbonne Univ, Stn Biol Roscoff, UMR7144, F-29680 Roscoff, France; [Hourdez, Stephane] CNRS, UMR7144, Stn Biol Roscoff, F-29680 Roscoff, France","Lelievre, Y (corresponding author), IFREMER, Ctr Bretagne, REM EEP, Lab Environm Profond, F-29280 Plouzane, France.; Lelievre, Y (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, CP 6128,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",yann.lelievre10@gmail.com,"Legendre, Pierre/C-8279-2013; Legendre, Pierre/U-9266-2019","Legendre, Pierre/0000-0002-3838-3305; Legendre, Pierre/0000-0002-3838-3305; Matabos, Marjolaine/0000-0003-1983-9896; Marticorena, Julien/0000-0003-3295-2615",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Laboratoire d'Excellence LabexMER [ANR-10-LABX-19]; French government under the Investissements d'Avenir programmeFrench National Research Agency (ANR),"The authors thank the captains and crews of the R/V Thomas G.

We conducted an inter-colony comparison of foraging space use and behavior, diet, and reproductive success of common murres Uria aalge breeding at a large offshore and a small inshore colony on the northeastern coast of Newfoundland (Canada) during 2016-2018 under varying prey (capelin Mallotus villosus) biomass. Murres from the large offshore colony foraged over a greater area, with greater individual foraging distances, indicative of higher commuting costs compared to the smaller inshore colony. Although this pattern might reflect prey depletion near the offshore colony due to higher conspecific densities, it likely also reflects the greater distance to predictable, high-abundance prey aggregations. This is supported by high spatial overlap of foraging areas from both colonies near coastal, annually persistent capelin spawning sites. Adult diet was similar between colonies during incubation, but diverged during chick-rearing, with offshore murres consuming a higher proportion of alternative prey, while inshore murres consumed more capelin. These differences did not affect fledging success, although hatching success was lower in the larger colony, suggesting that divergent factors (e.g. predation, nest attendance) influence colony-specific population dynamics. Overall, our findings suggest that abundant local prey is key in shaping spatial patterns of breeding common murres in northeastern Newfoundland and results in apparently minimal intraspecific competition. As anthropogenic pressures on resource availability heighten, insight into factors influencing intraspecific foraging niche dynamics will be critical to inform management.","[Gulka, Julia; Jenkins, Edward; Maynard, Laurie D.; Davoren, Gail K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Montevecchi, William A.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Cognit & Behav Ecol Programme, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada; [Regular, Paul M.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, St John, NF A1A 5S7, Canada","Gulka, J (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",juliagulka@gmail.com,"Regular, Paul/AAY-5741-2021","Regular, Paul/0000-0003-0318-2615","Newfoundland and Labrador Murre Conservation Fund [19M-3]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2014-06290]; Ship Time Grants [486208-2016, 501154-2017, 55517-2018]; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science; National Geographic Young Explorers GrantNational Geographic Society [WW-075ER-17]; World Wildlife Fund-Canada [G-0618-583-00-D]; Environment and Climate Change Canada","Principal funding was provided by the Newfoundland and Labrador Murre Conservation Fund (19M-3), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery (2014-06290) and Ship Time Grants (486208-2016, 501154-2017, 55517-2018), along with the University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support program grants (2016-2018).

To promote a mechanistic understanding of the ecological impacts of non-native seaweeds, we assessed how effects on resident organisms vary according to their trophic level. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe performed meta-analytical comparisons of the effects of non-native seaweeds on both individual species and communities. We compared the results of analyses performed on the whole dataset with those obtained from experimental data only and, when possible, between rocky and soft bottoms. ResultsMeta-analyses of data from 100 papers revealed consistent negative effects of non-native seaweeds across variables describing resident primary producer communities. In contrast, negative effects of seaweeds on consumers emerged only on their biomass and, limited to rocky bottoms, diversity. At the species level, negative effects were consistent across primary producers' response variables, while only the survival of consumers other than herbivores or predators (e.g. deposit/suspension feeders or detritivores) decreased due to invasion. Excluding mensurative data, negative effects of seaweeds persisted only on resident macroalgal communities and consumer species survival, while switched to positive on the diversity of rocky-bottom consumers. However, negative effects emerged for biomass and, in rocky habitats, density of consumers other than herbivores or predators. Main conclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that seaweeds' effects on resident biodiversity are generally more negative within the same trophic level than on higher trophic guilds. Finer trophic grouping of resident organisms revealed more complex impacts than previously detected. High heterogeneity in the responses of some consumer guilds suggests that impacts of non-native seaweeds at higher trophic levels may be more invader- and species-specific than competitive effects at the same trophic level. Features of invaded habitats may further increase variability in seaweeds' impacts. More experimental data on consumers' response to invasion are needed to disentangle the effects of non-native seaweeds from those of other environmental stressors.","[Maggi, E.; Benedetti-Cecchi, L.; Castelli, A.; Ghedini, G.; Ravaglioli, C.; Rindi, L.; Bulleri, F.] Univ Pisa, CoNISMa, Dipartimento Biol, Pisa, Italy; [Chatzinikolaou, E.] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Biotechnol & Aquaculture, Iraklion, Greece; [Crowe, T.

In this paper we compare population densities of herbivores, predators, and parasitoids on collards in monocultures and on collards interplanted with two different groups of weeds, one with weed species from the same plant family as the collards (Brassicaceae) and one with weed species from unrelated plant families (non-Brassicaceae). The collards in the Brassicaceae weed polyculture had higher densities (number of herbivores/mean leaf area (cm(2)) per plant) of specialist herbivores than collards in the non-Brassicaceae weed polyculture and in collard monoculture. The ''resource concentration'' hypothesis is supported by the observation of higher populations of Phyllotreta spp., acting as facultative polyphages, in the Brassicaceae weed polyculture than in the non-Brassicaceae weed polyculture where Phyllotreta spp. are facultative monophages. Population densities of natural enemies (mostly coccinellids, carabids, and staphylinids) were higher in the polycultures than in the monoculture: carabid and staphylinid predators may be responsible for larval mortality in the imported cabbage worm, Pieris rapae, and in the diamondback larvae, Plutella xylostella. In spite of differences in densities of specialist herbivores across treatments, crop yield, leaf area (cm(2)), the proportion of leaf area damaged, and the number of leaves undamaged did not differ. These findings suggest that plant competition may interfere with attempts to reduce herbivore damage. We conclude that the use of weedy cultures can provide effective means of reducing herbivores if the crop and weed species are not related and plant competition is prevented.","UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT BIOL,ST LOUIS,MO 63121",,,"Schellhorn, Nancy/B-6716-2009",,,,,38,60,63,1,43,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1997,111,2,,,,,233,240,,10.1007/s004420050230,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XK992,WOS:A1997XK99200012,28307999,,,,2021-09-27,

These species have become dominate in coastal embayments and marinas but are usually absent from more open water coastal areas. A colonial ascidian, Didemnum sp. has invaded southern New England during the past 10 years and we first observed this species in eastern Long Island Sound in 2000. It has become the dominant at several field sites while remaining in low abundance at others. We conducted an experiment at two places, a protected marina and an open coast site, to examine its ability to compete with the established fouling community. Small colonies of Didemnum were transplanted onto panels with communities that varied in age from one to four weeks old and these treatments along with controls with only Didemnum were exposed at both sites. In most treatments Didemnum became a dominant species in the communities at both sites but it reached higher abundances at the open coast site. Potential causes of the observed differences are predation on other species of ascidians at the open coast site reducing recruitment of these species and competition, lower tolerance for elevated temperatures at the marina site, or other environmental parameters that might affect growth rates.

The refuge characteristics of introduced plants are predicted to enhance impacts of generalist herbivores on native competitors and thereby result in an increased abundance of the invader. However, this prediction has so far not been experimentally verified. This study tested if the invasion of a chemically defended seaweed is promoted by native generalist herbivores via refuge-mediated apparent competition. The invader was shown to offer herbivores a significantly better refuge against fish predation compared with native seaweeds. Furthermore, in an experimental community, the presence of herbivores decreased the performance of neighbouring native seaweeds, but increased growth and relative abundance of the invader. These results provides the first experimental evidence that native generalist herbivores can shift a community towards a dominance of a well-defended invader, inferior to native species in direct competitive interactions, by means of refuge-mediated apparent competition.","[Enge, Swantje; Nylund, Goran Mikael; Pavia, Henrik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci Tjarno, S-45296 Stromstad, Sweden","Enge, S (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci Tjarno, S-45296 Stromstad, Sweden.",swantje.enge@bioenv.gu.se,"Pavia, Henrik/G-2764-2013","Enge, Swantje/0000-0003-4292-0051",,,,51,29,31,1,107,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Closure is an efficient protection of flowers against non-specialist predators and harsh external environmental conditions. Each Ficus species is pollinated by a single insect species, an agaonid wasp, capable of forcing its way through a bract-covered pore, the ostiole, to gain access to the flowers. Figs also provide oviposition sites for the wasps. The fig/pollinator interaction is a classic example of mutualism. It has been widely assumed that, once pollinators have entered a fig, oviposited and pollinated, they die trapped within the fig. In this paper, we present observations under natural conditions and results of field experiments on three very different fig species (Ficus aurea Nutt., F. carica L. and F. microcarpa L.) showing that some pollinators do exit or try to exit from the fig after pollination and oviposition. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that in at least one species (F. carica), the pollinator is able to oviposit successively in two different figs. The frequency of re-emergences from figs after pollination varies among species and this may be related to variations in pollination dynamics depending on environmental constraints such as the abundance of trees and tree phenology. Several factors that may favour pollinators that leave figs after pollination and oviposition are discussed. They include competition between pollinators for oviposition sites, and minimising of the risk of vertical transmission of parasites and pathogens.","UNIV MIAMI, DEPT BIOL, CORAL GABLES, FL 33124 USA","Gibernau, M (corresponding author), CNRS, CTR ECOL FONCT & EVOLUT, BP 5051, F-34033 MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.",,"Kjellberg, Finn/S-3281-2019; Gibernau, Marc/A-7388-2010; Anstett, Marie Charlotte/N-7977-2017","Kjellberg, Finn/0000-0001-6708-9538; Anstett, Marie Charlotte/0000-0001-7786-0357",,,,61,41,49,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

In our experimental study, we assessed the behavioral response of individual workers of 4 subordinate ant species during their co-occurrence with workers of a single dominant species. Contrary to most classical experiments focused on aggressive interactions, we assessed workers' speed as a crucial factor in the outcome of co-occurrence. Generally, there was a large intraspecific variation in the speed of the studied specieseach had slow and fast individuals. Workers of all studied species moved faster just after interaction, suggesting that contact between 2 hostile workers is a stressful stimulus, generating a behavioral reaction of increasing speed. Also, the number of aggressive contacts experienced by a given individual positively affected its speed. Moreover, workers which were fast when exploring territory were also fast after interspecific interactions. The duration of aggression was significantly reduced by the speed and body size of a subordinate species workerthe more quickly a worker reacted and bigger it was, the shorter was the time of cumulative aggression. To our knowledge, this is the first study of this type to be conducted on ants and we conclude that speed is an overlooked and important characteristic of species and also individuals, therefore it should be considered as a driver of patterns of co-occurrence in ant assemblages.","[Slipinski, Piotr] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Zmihorski, Michal] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Zmihorski, Michal] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, Krakow, Poland","Slipinski, P (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",piotrs@miiz.waw.pl,,"Slipinski, Piotr/0000-0002-7336-4134; Zmihorski, Michal/0000-0001-5137-1635; , Michal/0000-0002-2951-3462","Iuventus Plus - Ministry of Science and Higher Education [IP2011 064771]; Internal Grant for Young Scientists from the Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences","We are grateful for the helpful comments of 3 anonymous referees, which greatly improved the quality of this article.

We conducted a 3 year, multiple field study to characterize the dynamic relationships between the predator, the pest, and alternative prey in soybean. Using field sampling data, we showed that thrips were the only alternative prey to be well-established in fields prior to O. insidiosus arrival and were likely to promote predator colonization of soybean fields prior to the arrival of soybean aphid. The predator displayed a reproductive numerical response to thrips in one of the 3 years and a primarily aggregative response in another year. The predator did not respond numerically to soybean aphid in the majority of fields. Experimental manipulations of thrips populations in field plots temporarily reduced thrips densities but had a minimal effect on O. insidiosus densities, suggesting that the predator is resilient against temporary reductions in a major resource. In the 2 years O. insidiosus populations were well-established in fields prior to soybean aphid arrival, soybean aphid remained at low levels throughout the season. In the year soybean aphid arrived early with respect to the growing season and before O. insidiosus populations were established, soybean aphid reached outbreak levels in all fields. Future research efforts on the factors determining soybean aphid population dynamics need to address the relative importance of early-season soybean aphid colonization and generalist predator population dynamics on the potential for soybean aphid population outbreaks.

These species overlap in diet and spatial use at medium distances from rocky outcrops in summer. We evaluated the spatial use through feces distribution in winter and determined seasonal foraging intensity in relation to the distances from rocky outcrops in order to elucidate how these herbivores use food and spatial resources in food scarcity periods. The vizcacha utilized the habitat close to rocky outcrops (< 40 m) independent of season, while the hare exploited the space more widely, especially distances > 40 m. However, in winter, at medium distances from rocky outcrops, there was partial spatial overlap because hares' activities were closer to rocky outcrops. Foraging intensity increased significantly in areas used by the vizcacha closer to rocky outcrops when food availability decreased, and the grasses Stipa speciosa, Poa sp., and Festuca pallescens were strongly foraged. In contrast, foraging intensity showed no changes in further distances to rocky outcrops and more use by the hare. The spatial and feeding behavior of the vizcacha, restricted to vicinity of rocky outcrops, showed high vulnerability to food availability changes. In resource scarcity situations, the spatial opportunistic behavior of the hare and the overlap in diet with the vizcacha constitutes a threat to this native herbivore. It is necessary to monitor populations of hare, since high densities could lead to food competition, impacting the small colonies of the southern vizcacha.","[Raffaele, Estela] Natl Univ Comahue, Lab Ecotono, INIBIOMA Natl Univ Comahue, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Galende, GI (corresponding author), Natl Univ Comahue, Dept Zool, Bariloche Reg Univ Ctr, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",gladysgalende1@gmail.com,,,CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 5066]; National University of Comahue [UNC-B126],We thank the student field assistants and the financial support provided by the CONICET (PIP 5066) and the National University of Comahue (grant UNC-B126).

Biotic invasions are one of the most important reasons for changes in biodiversity. The alien sheetweb spider Mermessus trilobatus (Araneae: Linyphiidae) has become abundant in large parts of Central Europe within the past three decades. Its invasion might negatively influence native spiders, for instance via competition for webs. 2. Laboratory experiments were developed to test if M. trilobatus is competitively superior to native spiders. The alien M. trilobatus and five native sheetweb spiders (Erigone dentipalpis, E. atra, Gnathonarium dentatum, Dicymbium nigrum and Micrargus herbigradus) were compared with respect to their success to take over occupied webs from E. dentipalpis. 3. The rate of web takeover or defence was determined by body size, whereby individuals with a wider thorax invaded webs more successfully. After taking body size into account, the frequency of defence or web takeover did not differ between species. In 13% of all confrontations, predation against generally smaller opponents was recorded. Contrary to the predictions, raising the web value with food resources did not raise the effort expended on web defence but reduced predation by the web owner. 4. The current study does not indicate that the invasion of the relatively small-sized M. trilobatus is facilitated by strong competitiveness.

Modern concepts view ecological succession as largely driven by bottom-up resource competition for light and nutrients. However, growing evidence shows that top-down effects of consumers can govern succession. These contrasting perspectives require synthesis. We offer such a synthesis by revitalizing the hypothesis that succession proceeds by abrupt transitions to alternative states or dynamic regimes. We present evidence from field sampling along two successional gradients in a New England old field aimed at identifying pattern, and from experimentation in the same field aimed at identifying process. Field sampling revealed that a competitive dominant plant existed in a mosaic with two distinct patch types of relative abundances (<= 25% and > 30%). Competitive dominant plant abundance varied systematically with plant species diversity (evenness), and resource supply (light and soil nitrogen). The six-year field experiment tested for alternative regimes by systematic removal and staggered reintroduction of top predators. Long-term predator removal caused an abrupt and irreversible shift from a top-down to a bottom-up controlled regime with a breakpoint at approximately 25% relative abundance of the competitive dominant plant. This caused significant shifts in plant species evenness and resource supply (solar radiation and N mineralization rate). Moreover, the competitive dominant abundance, species evenness and resource supply in the two dynamic regimes matched levels in the different patch types in the field. We conclude that a single ecosystem can display both top-down and bottom-up control. Abrupt shifts in trophic control lead to abrupt changes in the rate of development of ecosystems consistent with a working hypothesis that succession proceeds via abrupt regime shifts.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA","Schmitz, OJ (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",oswald.schmitz@yale.edu,,,,,,78,38,38,2,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,JUN,2006,9,4,,,,,659,672,,10.1007/s10021-006-0006-4,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,053GD,WOS:000238292700013,,,,,2021-09-27,

In the past decade molecular methods have begun to be used extensively in studies of host-parasitoid webs to clarify species concepts.

This well-studied direct bottom-up effect is especially prominent for herbivore-plant interactions. Low-quality prey species, particularly when defended, are generally considered to be less prone to predator-driven extinction. Undefended high-quality prey species sustain high predator production thereby potentially increasing their own extinction risk. The food quality of primary producers is highly species-specific. In communities of competing prey species, predators thus may supplement their diets of low-quality prey with high-quality prey, leading to indirect horizontal interactions between prey species of different food quality. We explore how these predator-mediated indirect interactions affect species coexistence in a general predator-prey model that is parametrized for an experimental algae-rotifer system. To cover a broad range of three essential functional traits that shape many plant-herbivore interactions we consider differences in 1) the food quality of the prey species, 2) their competitive ability for nutrient uptake and 3) their defence against predation. As expected, low food quality of prey can, similarly to defence, provide protection against extinction by predation. Counterintuitively, our simulations demonstrate that being of high food quality also prevents extinction of that prey species and additionally promotes coexistence with a competing, low-quality prey. The persistence of the high-quality prey enables a high conversion efficiency and control of the low-quality prey by the predator and allows for re-allocation of nutrients to the high-quality competitor. Our results show that high food quality is not necessarily detrimental for a prey species but instead can protect against extinction and promote species richness and functional biodiversity.","[Raatz, Michael; Gaedke, Ursula; Wacker, Alexander] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Neuen Palais 10, DE-14469 Potsdam, Germany","Raatz, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Neuen Palais 10, DE-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",michael.raatz@uni-potsdam.de,"Wacker, Alexander/I-8277-2012","Wacker, Alexander/0000-0001-9687-6477; Raatz, Michael/0000-0002-6968-6560","DFG as part of the Priority Programme 1704 (DynaTrait) [WA 2445/8-1, WA 2445/11-1, GA 401/26-1]","This work was funded by DFG (WA 2445/8-1, WA 2445/11-1, GA 401/26-1) as part of the Priority Programme 1704 (DynaTrait).",,42,10,10,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2017,126,10,,,,,1501,1510,,10.1111/oik.03863,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI6AN,WOS:000412070800014,,,,,2021-09-27,

An increase in the number of larvae developed in one Petri dish resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of development in individuals from both populations which fed on aphids. Survival decreased with an increase in the number of larvae developed in one Petri dish with feeding on both prey species, but only due to larvae from the invasive population of H. axyridis. The weight of emerging adults decreased with the number of larvae per dish in individuals from both study populations, but only when fed on aphids.

Advances have been made in the development of reliable methods for estimating the abundance and density of large threatened mammalian predators, but there is little progress on developing population estimates for their principal prey. No standardised protocol for estimating prey populations exists, therefore different researchers use different methods. As such, there is little information on key prey species of the vulnerable snow leopard and this has hindered the preparation of effective snow leopard conservation plans. Aims. This study aimed to establish an estimated seasonal baseline population abundance and density of blue sheep in the Lingzhi Park Range (LPR) of Bhutan's Jigme Dorji National Park over winter (December to February) and summer (May to July). It also aimed to assess the number of snow leopard individuals that the current blue sheep population can sustain in the study area. Methods. A refined double-observer survey method was used and involved walking transect lengths of 414 km in winter and 450 km in summer to estimate blue sheep abundance with the aid of 8 x 30 binoculars and 15 x 45 spotting scopes. Key results. In total, 1762 (s.e. +/- 199) blue sheep individuals were recorded in winter at a density of 8.51 individuals per km(2) and 2097 (s.e. +/- 172) individuals in summer at a density of 9.32 individuals per km(2). Mean group size of blue sheep was 38.12 individuals (s.e. +/- 6) in winter and 52.36 individuals (s.e. +/- 4) in summer. LPR was estimated to sustain 11-17 snow leopards in winter and 15-21 in summer. Key conclusions. LPR can be a hotspot for snow leopard conservation in western Bhutan and regionally in the eastern Himalayas, because the comparatively higher estimated blue sheep abundance and density supports possibly the highest density of snow leopards in Bhutan. The modified double-observer method used to assess blue sheep population estimates is inexpensive, robust and practical for the mountainous terrain of the Himalayas. Implications. On the basis of this study, it is recommended that a refined double-observer method is adopted as a standard technique for estimating blue sheep populations in the snow leopard range countries of the Himalayas. Snow leopard conservation plans should, additionally, include efforts to minimise threats to blue sheep populations. This refined method is also highly applicable for future surveys of gregarious mammalian taxa, such as ungulates and primates, in difficult mountainous terrain elsewhere in the world.","[Leki] Jigme Dorji Natl Pk, Dept Forests & Pk Serv, Lingzhi Pk Range, Gasa, Bhutan; [Thinley, Phuntsho] Ugyen Wangchuck Inst Conservat & Environm Res, Dept Forests & Pk Serv, Bumthang, Bhutan; [Thinley, Phuntsho] Univ New England, Ecosyst Management, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia; [Rajaratnam, Rajanathan] Univ New England, Geog & Planning, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia; [Shrestha, Rinjan] World Wildlife Fund, Toronto, ON M5V 1S8, Canada","Thinley, P (corresponding author), Ugyen Wangchuck Inst Conservat & Environm Res, Dept Forests & Pk Serv, Bumthang, Bhutan.; Thinley, P (corresponding author), Univ New England, Ecosyst Management, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia.",chetsho78@gmail.com,"Rajaratnam, Rajanathan/U-8690-2019; Thinley, Phuntsho/AAX-4869-2020","Rajaratnam, Rajanathan/0000-0002-5932-7935; Thinley, Phuntsho/0000-0002-5062-8010; , Leki/0000-0001-8129-3674","Royal Government of Bhutan, Department of Forests and Park Services; Rufford Foundation, UK; Royal Society for Protection of Nature, Bhutan","lWe express our deepest appreciation to the Royal Government of Bhutan, particularly the Department of Forests and Park Services, for kindly permitting us to carry out the study and also for providing financial support.

Australia harbours an immense diversity of reptiles, which are generally expected to have frequent and diverse trophic interactions with introduced mammalian carnivores. Nevertheless, the potential for predatory or competitive interactions is likely to be contingent on multiple processes, including the importance of reptiles in the diet of introduced predators, alongside overlaps in their body sizes and ecological niches that would influence the strength of their interactions. In Australia's temperate and relatively productive mesic environments there is little understanding of how introduced mammalian predators affect reptile assemblages. Aims. The aim was to investigate the effects that a European red fox (Vulpes vulpes; 5-7 kg) suppression program had on the abundance and species richness of a reptile community, with species ranging in size from the largest local ectothermic predator, the lace monitor (Varanus varius; 4-7 kg), to small terrestrial reptiles (mostly 10-150 g). Methods. We utilised two sampling designs (baited camera monitoring stations and pitfall trapping) to evaluate the effects of fox suppression and other site-level ecological covariates (fire regime and habitat vegetation characteristics) on the lace monitor and small terrestrial reptiles. Reptile abundance and richness at site level were estimated from countrelated abundance models. Key results. For lace monitors, significantly higher abundances occurred in poison-baited areas relative to control areas. This suggests that fox suppression can affect the populations of the lace monitor via mesopredator release arising from reduced competition and, possibly, predation. For small terrestrial reptiles, neither abundance nor species richness were influenced by fox suppression. Individual abundances of the three most common small reptile species matched the overall pattern, as only responses to structural parameters of the habitat were detected. Conclusions. Fox suppression can have different impacts for different reptile taxa, pending their ecological niche, as only the largest species was affected. Implications. Increase in lace monitor abundance may change food web dynamics in fox-suppressed sites, such as by increasing predation pressure on arboreal marsupials.","[Hu, Yang; Jessop, Tim S.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Geelong, Vic 3216, Australia; [Gillespie, Graeme] Dept Environm & Nat Resources, Palmerston, NT 0830, Australia","Hu, Y (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Geelong, Vic 3216, Australia.",yhu0855@yahoo.com,"Jessop, Tim/Q-2473-2019",,ECREuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre,"The research was carried out under research permits 10005634 from the Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria, and Animal Experimental Ethics Committee approval DSE AEC10.15.A (Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria) and 0911328.2 (University of Melbourne).

In total, 1,367 containers with water in 624 premises were studied in Salinas, southern Puerto Rico (May-July 2004). We counted 3,632 pupae, and most female pupae (70%) were in five of 18 types of containers. These containers were unattended and influenced by local yards' environmental conditions. Pupal productivity was significantly associated with the number of trees per premise, water volume, and lower water temperatures. Larval and pupal abundance were larger in containers with leaf litter or algae. Pupal productivity and biomass of emerging females varied in containers with litter of different tree species. We found a significant and positive association between numbers of larvae and pupae of Ae. aegypti. and a negative relationship between larval density and mass of emerging females. From multivariate analyses, we interpreted that 1) food limitation or competition existed in a number of containers; and 2) to a lesser extent, there was lack of negative larval density effects in containers with a larger water volume and lower temperature, where emerging females were not under nutritional stress. Corroborating evidence for food limitation or intraspecific competition effects came from our observations that females emerging in the field had an average body mass comparable with those females produced in the laboratory with the lowest feeding regime. Ae. aegypti larvae in Salinas are most likely influenced by resource limitation or competition and by rainfall in unmanaged containers in the absence of aquatic predators. Source reduction and improved yard management targeting unattended containers would eliminate most Ae. aegypti productivity and removal or control of shaded, larger containers would eliminate the production of the largest emerging mosquito females in the study area.","Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, DVBID, Dengue Branch, San Juan, PR 00920 USA","Barrera, R (corresponding author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, DVBID, Dengue Branch, 1324 Calle Canada, San Juan, PR 00920 USA.",,,,,,,39,116,120,0,30,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY AMERICA,LANHAM,"10001 DEREKWOOD LANE, STE 100, LANHAM, MD 20706-4876 USA",0022-2585,,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

We tested six hypotheses for the evolution of foraging rate in 24 spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) populations from three latitudinally divergent sites using structural equation models derived from theory and applied to our system. We raised salamander larvae in a common-garden experiment and then assayed foraging rate under controlled conditions. Gape-limited predation risk from marbled salamanders solely explained foraging rate variation among populations at the southern site, which was dominated by this form of selection. However, at the middle and northern sites, populations evolved different foraging rates depending on their unique responses to local intraspecific density. The coupling of gape-limited predation risk from marbled salamanders and high intraspecific density at the middle site jointly contributed to selection for rapid foraging rate. At the northernmost site, intraspecific density alone explained 97% of the interpopulation variation in foraging rate. These results suggest that foraging rate has evolved multiple times in response to varying contributions from predation risk and intraspecific competition. Predation risk often varies along environmental gradients, and, thus, organisms might often shift evolutionary responses from minimizing predation risk to maximizing intraspecific competitive performance.","[Urban, Mark C.; Richardson, Jonathan L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Urban, MC (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",mark.urban@uconn.edu,"Urban, Mark Christopher/Y-2430-2019",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1119877]; James S.

Recently, dramatic increases in ungulate populations have provided a useful quasi-experiment on the effects of unrestrained ungulates on forest ecology. The islands of Haida Gwaii (Canada) offer a unique situation to investigate the potential of large herbivores to control temperate forest community structure and diversity. Black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus Merriam, native to adjacent mainland areas of British Columbia, were introduced in 1878 and spread to all but a few islands. Because deer were not native to the archipelago, islands that still lack deer provide a rare instance of temperate forest vegetation and fauna that developed in the absence of large herbivores. The colonisation of different islands at different times, and the absence of significant predation allow us to assess whether and how a large herbivore can exert top-down control on vegetation and its associated fauna. We studied plant communities in forest interior and shoreline, on seven small islands of varying browse history. Three islands were untouched by deer, deer had been resident for about 15 years on two, and on another two deer had been present for more than 50 years. Without deer, vegetation in the understorey and/or shrub layer was dense or very dense. Structure and composition varied markedly within and between shoreline and interior communities. Without deer, shoreline communities were dominated by species absent from islands with deer. Where deer had been present for less than 20 years most plant species characteristic of shorelines on islands without deer were already absent or scarce, but in the forest interior species richness was less affected and extensive shrub thickets remained. On islands where deer had been present for > 50 years vegetation below the browse line was extremely simplified, converging in both forest interior and shoreline towards an open assemblage of a few deer-tolerant species, basically two coniferous trees. This top down effect on the plant community reflected up the food chain so that understorey invertebrate and shrub-dependent songbird communities became simplified. In contrast, species densities of litter arthropods (especially weevils and millipedes) were highest where deer were present for > 50 years. Canopy birds were unaffected by deer presence. In the absence of predators, major climatic stress or other means to control the herbivore, deer browsing created greatly simplified plant and animal communities.","[Martin, Jean-Louis; Allombert, Sylvain] CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Martin, Jean-Louis; Gaston, Anthony J.] Carleton Univ, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Environm Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Stockton, Stephen A.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Martin, JL (corresponding author), CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France.",jean-louis.martin@cefe.cnrs.fr; stockton@humber.ca; sylvain_allombert@yahoo.fr; tony.gaston@ec.gc.ca,"Martin, Jean-Louis/E-5059-2010",,"Canada-British Columbia South Moresby Forest Replacement Account (SMFRA) [SMFRA99DQC-002, 24.2]; Forest Renewal British Columbia (FRBC) [PA97335-BRE]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) [PICS 389]; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs","This is a publication from the Research Group on Introduced Species (RGIS).

For example, guard crabs (Trapezia spp.) protect corals (Pocillopora sp.) from attacks by crown-of-thorn seastar and sedimentation. Here, a field experiment demonstrates that guard crabs (Trapezia serenei) also ameliorate the strong negative effects of the giant vermetid (Dendropoma maximum) on growth of Pocillopora. This experiment highlights the importance of this crab-coral mutualism: guard crabs facilitate the growth of corals in stressful environments (e.g., where vermetids are abundant), thereby preserving the ecological goods and services (e.g., food and shelter) that these corals may provide to other reef-associated species.","[Stier, A.

Parasitism was predominately aggregated in its distribution within the beetle breeding logs, while percentage parasitism ranged from spatially random to spatially density dependent between logs. The effects of spatial density dependence in the model was, however, overshadowed by the effects of both parasitoid mutual interference and competition between female beetles for oviposition 'space'. Searching efficiency (area of discovery) declined with increasing adult parasitoid density as a result of mutual interference. This density dependent change in searching efficiency had a strong stabilizing influence on the parasitoid-host interaction. Crowding of adult parasitoids also led to a decline in the proportion of female progeny emerging. Such density-dependent changes in the secondary sex ratio had very little effect on either stability or equilibrium levels. The model predicts that whilst C. quadrum has the potential to strongly regulate beetle populations, its contribution in practice is only to suppress P. scarabaeoides populations by a mere 20%, which is insufficient to reduce the beetle numbers to non-damaging levels. A major constraint on the effectiveness of the parasitoid appears to be mutual interference, without which the emerging beetle population could be reduced by about 70%.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Pure & Appl Biol, Cardiff CF1 3TL, S Glam, Wales; Estac Expt Zaidin, Granada, Spain","Kidd, NAC (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Pure & Appl Biol, POB 915, Cardiff CF1 3TL, S Glam, Wales.",,"Jervis, Mark/A-4351-2010; Campos, Mercedes/L-6323-2014","Campos, Mercedes/0000-0003-4313-7069",,,,36,8,8,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-2048,1439-0418,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

We present here an experiment that tests the way the same indirect cues of predation risk are interpreted by bank voles, Myodes glareolus, as the game changes through exposure to a caged weasel. Using optimal patch use, we asked wild-caught voles to rank the risk they perceived. We measured their response to olfactory cues in the form of weasel bedding, a sham control in the form of rabbit bedding, and an odor-free control. We repeated the interviews in a chronological order to test the change in response, i.e., the changes in the value of the information. We found that the voles did not differentiate strongly between treatments pre-exposure to the weasel. During the exposure, vole foraging activity was reduced in all treatments, but proportionally increased in the vicinity to the rabbit odor. Post-exposure, the voles focused their foraging in the control, while the value of exposure to the predator explained the majority of variation in response. Our data also suggested a sex bias in interpretation of the cues. Given how the foragers changed their interpretation of the same cues based on external information, we suggest that applying predator olfactory cues as a simulation of predation risk needs further testing. For instance, what are the possible effective compounds and how they change fear response over time. The major conclusion is that however effective olfactory cues may be, the presence of live predators overwhelmingly affects the information voles gained from these cues.Significance statementIn ecology, fear is the strategic response to cues of risk an animal senses in its environment. The cues suggesting the existence of a predator in the vicinity are weighed by an individual against the probability of encounter with the predator and the perceived lethality of an encounter with the predator. The best documented such response is variation in foraging tenacity as measured by a giving-up density. In this paper, we show that an olfactory predator cue and the smell of an interspecific competitor result in different responses based on experience with a live-caged predator. This work provides a cautionary example of the risk in making assumptions regarding olfactory cues devoid of environmental context.","[Bleicher, Sonny S.] George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.; Yloenen, Hannu; Kaepylae, Teemu; Haapakoski, Marko] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",bleicherss@gmail.com,"Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo/AAE-6272-2020","Bleicher, Sonny S/0000-0001-8727-5901",Finnish Academy research grant [288990],"The experiment was financially supported by the Finnish Academy research grant 2015-2019 for HY, No. 288990, 11.5.2015.",,78,9,9,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

In this work we analyze the distribution of spider assemblages at three microhabitats (canopy, tree trunk and soil) in Citrus sinensis orchards (Rutaceae) in the Province of Corrientes. Argentina. Spiders were collected monthly using four sampling techniques: beating foliage, leaf litter sifting, pitfall traps and direct capture by hand. A total of 2 160 samples were examined and 7 194 spiders were collected (2462 on the canopy, 983 on trunk and 3 749 on the floor) belonging to 34 families and 200 species/morphospecies of Araneomorphae. There were significant differences among microhabitats and months in the structure of the spider communities, according to analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). The diversity was highest on the canopy, followed by soil and tree trunk. Araneidae, Salticidae and Anyphaenidae were the most abundant taxa in the canopy; the dominant species were Jessica erythostoma and Cheiracanthium inchtsum, a predator of the leaf herbivore Phyllocni.stis citrella (Lepidoptera) a pest of Citrus spp. The most abundant families on the tree trunk were Tetragnathidae, Hersiliidae and Theridiidae, Iviraiva pachyura was a species specialist in such microhabitat; and Leucauge venusta was an opportunistic species, because their abundance increaseds markedly in anthropic environments that modified by man. The most abundant families on the floor were Lycosidae. Linyphiidae and Coriniidae. In this habitat, Lycosa erythrognatha and Pardosa plumipedata were dominant species. The Chao-Jaccard similarity index was highest between the canopy and trunk (J-C = 0.95), likewise ordination by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed strong differentiation between assemblages of soil spiders and canopy and trunk spiders. Also, on the soil the temporary replacement of species was greater and the seriation method was significant (z = 3.82. P= 0.00) therefore there was a succession of species during the year. The different species in each microhabitat probably avoided competition by using different hunting strategies and different ecological resources, in addition to specific patterns of temporal distribution. Our results suggest that anthropic environments, such as in Citrus orchards, tend to harbor populations of spiders able to adapt to those environments and interact in a balanced way in space and time.","[Cecilia Achitte-Schmutzler, Helga; Avalos, Gilberto] Univ Nacl Nordeste, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Catedra Biol Artropodos, Avda Libertad 5470, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina; [Adolfo Porcel, Eduardo] Univ Nacl Nordeste, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat & Agrimensura, Dept Matemat, Corrientes, Argentina","Achitte-Schmutzler, HC (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Nordeste, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Catedra Biol Artropodos, Avda Libertad 5470, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina.",ceciliaachitte@hotmail.com; eporcel@exa.unne.edu.ar; gilbertoa@exa.unne.edu.ar,,,,,,85,0,1,2,4,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,SAN JOSE,"UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",0034-7744,2215-2075,,REV BIOL TROP,Rev.

We analyzed this mixture of size-structured interactions for a species constellation consisting of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) in a replicated whole lake experiment over 4 yr. Roach are preyed upon by large perch, but at the same time compete with small perch for zooplankton. Predictions regarding the effects of roach on perch performance and resource dynamics in the whole-lake experiment were based on results from previous pond and enclosure experiments carried out over short (months) time periods. Variables measured in the whole-lake experiment included both individual level parameters (diet and growth of perch) as well as population level parameters (mortality, population numbers and size structures of perch, abundance and biomass of zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates). The population size of perch greater than or equal to 2 yr old decreased to less than 10% of the pre-treatment levels in treatment lakes after the introduction of roach and remained low over the whole study period. The mortality in perch one-year-old and older increased with size. Larger perch had a higher growth decrease than smaller perch, but also the individual growth rate of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch was lower in treatment lakes than in control lakes. YOY perch were almost excluded during the winter and spring following the roach introduction. The few perch of this year class that survived had the following years a higher growth than the corresponding year class in control lakes. This could be related to an increased availability of predator-sensitive macroinvertebrates in treatment lakes. Perch in treatment lakes fed to a larger extent on macroinvertebrates and less on pelagic zooplankton than perch in control lakes. As expected, zooplankton abundances decreased in treatment lakes the year following the roach introduction, but thereafter zooplankton abundances were higher in treatment lakes due to the absence of perch recruitment in these lakes. No incidence of perch predation on roach was recorded during the study period. We attribute this to the spatial scale dependent escape ability and habitat use of vulnerable size classes of roach. YOY perch had a stronger impact on between-year variation in zooplankton than YOY roach and this can be related to the higher foraging (handling) capacity of the former and the restricted habitat use of the latter. Individual level parameters (diet, growth) had a higher statistical power than population level parameters (abundance, biomass, mortality), and small-scale experiments successfully predicted a higher proportion (81%) of the individual level parameters. However, the lower success in predicting population level responses (38%) was directly connected to a failure to predict individual level parameters (large perch diet and growth). Our results suggest that the small spatial scale was the major limitation on the predictive ability of the small-scale experiments.","Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Persson, L (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",lennart.persson@animecol.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","Hjelm, Joakim/0000-0001-8423-8873",,,,89,46,46,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1999,87,1,,,,,139,156,,10.2307/3547005,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,248AG,WOS:000083252700015,,,,,2021-09-27,

Total basal area simulated for each site was within +/-10% of that observed, although species-specific basal area predictions were less accurate. 3 A decrease in nutrient availability from marine to mesohaline sites modelled the reduced basal area of Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa. However, at the lower nutrient site a 83% reduction in maximum sapling recruitment of both A. germinans and L. racemosa was required to fit field results. Increased basal area of A. germinans and L. racemosa limited the development of Rhizophora mangle at higher nutrient downstream sites, apparently due to competition for light resources. Both observed and simulated results indicated that R. Mangle had higher frequencies in the smaller size classes at all three sites, compared to a bell-shaped size-class distribution of L. racemosa, particularly at the higher nutrient sites. 4 Succession was projected for the next 500 years at a site in the lower estuary. Longterm forest dynamics were sensitive to species-specific maximum sapling recruitment rates. In the absence of large-scale disturbance, initial dominance by L. racemosa was predicted to be replaced eventually by A. germinans, even when maximum sapling recruitment rate of A. germinans was set at half of L. racemosa and R. mangle. 5 Response curves for each species along gradients of soil nutrient resource and salinity illustrated their relative competitive balance over time (up to 300 years). Laguncularia racemosa dominated in fertile soils with low salinity at early stages of recovery, but its abundance decreased over time while A. germinans increased. The dominance of R. mangle was limited to regions with low nutrient availability and low salinity. Avicennia germinans dominated at higher salinities, where the effect of nutrient availability was overwhelmed by the tolerance of individual species to salt stress.","Univ SW Louisiana, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA","Chen, RG (corresponding author), Univ SW Louisiana, Dept Biol, Box 42451, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",,,,,,,83,122,126,0,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Location: A pasture in the Jura mountains, Switzerland. Methods: Seeds were sown in a complete three-way factorial design with eight blocks in May 2003. Each block consisted of a competition treatment (four gap sizes including zero) and a mowing treatment (mown and unmown). Emergence, survival and total biomass of tree seedlings of three species (Picea abies, Acer pseudoplatanus and Fagus sylvatica) were measured. A fourth species (Abies alba) failed to germinate. Results: Gaps had a positive influence on the early stages of tree development for all species. Larger gaps favoured growth and survival more than small gaps. Seedling growth was higher when vegetation around the openings was mown. Mowing the vegetation at gap size zero enhanced both growth and survival compared to unmown vegetation. Mown gaps larger than zero had increased seedling desiccation but decreased seedling predation. Species showed similar trends in their emergence and growth responses to gap size and mowing treatments but for Picea emergence rate was higher and survivorship was lower than for Acer and Fagus. Conclusions: Gap size does matter for tree seedling success but even in more favourable large gaps only a small percentage of seedlings emerged and survived. The effects of gaps on tree seedling establishment are complex as a result of interactions between biotic and abiotic changes caused by gaps.","Swiss Fed Res Inst, WSL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Ecol Syst, ECOS, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Vandenberghe, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst, WSL, Case Postale 96, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",charlotte.vandenberghe@epfl.ch; francois.frelechoux@epfl.ch; fawziah.gadallah@gmail.ch; alexandre.buttler@epfl.ch,"Buttler, Alexandre AB/K-1137-2012",,,,,50,33,40,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

This hypothesis was tested with the species Pardosa milvina (Hentz), a small wolf spider that shows high densities in disturbance-driven ecosystems, including agricultural fields, throughout eastern North America. Under laboratory conditions, cannibalism was more common between pairs of P. milvina with the greatest differences in both mass and size. Field studies, in which we stocked natural densities, 2x natural densities, and 4x natural densities of R milvina in enclosures placed in soybean fields, revealed that survival was lowest when conspecific density was highest, and larger individuals prevailed under high-density conditions. Thus, cannibalism likely plays an important role in governing populations of P. milvina, and the generality about the prevalence and importance of cannibalism with wolf spiders is supported.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Buddle, CM (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Macdonald Campus,21 111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",chris.buddle@mcgill.ca,"Walker, Sean E/A-4722-2008","Buddle, Christopher/0000-0002-7494-9732; Walker, Sean/0000-0001-9310-3305",,,,34,39,40,2,16,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

We investigated if tracing stable isotopes allows distinction between different types of predation and confirmation of IGP. Wolf spiders were chosen as model organisms for generalist predators; IGP of third instar A. cuneata on second instar P. palustris was investigated in a laboratory experiment. The availability of alternative prey and the complexity of the microhabitat were manipulated, since both factors are thought to facilitate coexistence of predators. Stable isotope analysis documented predation of A. cuneata on P. palustris and predation on alternative prey by both juveniles. Both the presence of alternative prey and the availability of shelter reduced mortality of juvenile P. palustris during the first week. During the second week mortality increased in complex structure without alternative prey presumably due to enhanced activity and cannibalism among starving P. palustris. Thus, microhabitat complexity and prey abundance may foster coexistence of wolf spiders in the field. In conclusion, stable isotope analysis was proven a powerful tool to investigate animal behaviour without direct observation. The method allowed disentangling predator feeding behaviour when more than one type of prey was present.","Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; Forschungszentrum Waldokosyst, Kompetenzzentrum Stabile Isotope, DE-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Rickers, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",s.rickers@gmx.de,"Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015",,,,,57,40,40,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2006,114,3,,,,,471,478,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14421.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,076WH,WOS:000239988300009,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, experimental demonstrations of chaos in ecology are scarce, and have been limited to simple laboratory systems with a short duration and artificial species combinations(9-12). Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a long- term experiment with a complex food web. Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15 - 30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos. This implies that stability is not required for the persistence of complex food webs, and that the long- term prediction of species abundances can be fundamentally impossible.","[Beninca, Elisa; Huisman, Jef; Johnk, Klaus D.; Branco, Pedro] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Beninca, Elisa; Van Nes, Egbert H.; Scheffer, Marten] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Heerkloss, Reinhard] Univ Rostock, Inst Biosci, Rostock, Germany; [Ellner, Stephen P.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Huisman, J (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 127, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jef.huisman@science.uva.nl,"Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013; Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012; van Nes, Egbert H/F-2681-2011; Johnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008","Huisman, Jef/0000-0001-9598-3211; Johnk, Klaus/0000-0002-5972-4201; Branco, Pedro/0000-0002-5010-0419; van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X",,,,30,226,233,3,189,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,FEB 14,2008,451,7180,,,,,822,U7,,10.1038/nature06512,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400041,18273017,,,,2021-09-27,

Disease is also emerging at increasing rates, resulting in massive impacts on populations, communities, and ecosystems. However, assessing these impacts requires foundational knowledge of disease agents and hosts, which is often lacking, particularly in aquatic insects. We describe a recent disease outbreak in caddisflies, suggesting potential consequences for population and community dynamics of the host. We use a series of complementary studies to develop a cohesive foundation of information about this disease, including identification using genomic methods, observational prevalence studies, laboratory experiments to establish transmissibility and fitness consequences, and laboratory and field investigations to infer transmission mechanisms. We identified the infection as being caused by the oomycete Saprolegnia-the first time this parasite has been noted in insect eggs. Prevalence surveys found high prevalence (up to 36%) with variation across space, time, and host species. We demonstrated increasing egg mortality with increasing infection within an egg mass (every 10% increase in infection rate doubles odds of mortality), thereby confirming disease. We established transmissibility and show that transmission occurs through both direct contact with infected egg masses and from background sources, which probably interact to create complex patterns of disease. Taken together, our findings show that conditions necessary for population and community consequences are present. Specifically, increased mortality rates almost certainly occurred during the outbreak, yielding lower larval numbers and potentially altering community interactions. Transmission by contact between egg masses combined with observed species-specific prevalence suggest shifts in the relative performance of different species because of interactions between host and parasite life histories. Outside extreme examples such as chytrid fungus, disease has traditionally received less interest than resource competition or predation in community ecology, although disease ecology is advancing rapidly. One major hurdle is a lack of foundational knowledge characterising disease processes in natural communities, particularly in aquatic insects. Our findings highlight the importance of investigating diseases in insect eggs and provide the foundation for further investigations of how these processes play out at the population and community scale.","[Holt, Galen; Dwyer, Georgia K.; Bourke, Courtney; Macqueen, Ashley; Lester, Rebecca E.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Reg & Rural Futures, Locked Bag 20000, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia; [Matthews, Ty G.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Holt, G (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Ctr Reg & Rural Futures, Locked Bag 20000, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia.",g.holt@deakin.edu.au,,"Bourke, Courtney/0000-0002-7837-8201; Macqueen, Ashley/0000-0002-6450-2128; Dwyer, Georgia/0000-0002-3579-3819",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,Australian Research Council,,63,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Recent reviews have highlighted the importance of both types of effects for understanding species interactions in food webs. However, most studies focus on only density or trait effects-few have examined both within a single predator-prey system. Here I examine both the density and trait effects of egg-stage predators of the East African reed frog, Hyperolius spinigularis, a species with arboreal clutches and aquatic larvae. To quantify the density effects of egg predators, I monitored seasonal clutch production and survivorship over two breeding seasons and thus estimated the effects of different predators on larval input into the aquatic habitat. I also quantified the effects of egg predators on the timing of hatching and hatchling phenotype. The reed frog, Afrixalus fornasini, and the ephydrid fly, Typopsilopa sp., caused most of the mortality of H. spinigularis eggs, so I focused on these two predators. Egg predation reduced larval densities from 18 to 82% depending upon the time of the season. Predation by Afrixalus and Typopsilopa caused surviving embryos to hatch 3-4 days earlier, at an earlier developmental stage, and at sizes that were 20-30% smaller compared to hatchlings from undisturbed clutches. Recent experimental studies in this system have demonstrated that reductions in larval density and size due to egg-stage predators facilitate larval survival in the presence of aquatic predators. Reductions in larval density increase larval survival by reducing larval competition and increasing growth through vulnerable size classes. Predator-induced early-hatched tadpoles exhibited higher larval growth rates than tadpoles from undisturbed clutches, and thus realized higher survival by growing more rapidly though vulnerable size classes. Thus both the density and trait effects of egg-stage predators have important, sometimes unexpected, consequences for survival in subsequent life-stages.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Vonesh, JR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Tyson Res Ctr, POB 258, Eureka, MO 63025 USA.",vonesh@biology2.wustl.edu,"Vonesh, James/I-1573-2013","Vonesh, James/0000-0003-2481-9988",,,,75,45,48,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2005,110,2,,,,,241,252,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13759.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,925VL,WOS:000229081300004,,,,,2021-09-27,

We use a spatially explicit individual-based model to explore mechanisms behind changes in functional responses when the scale of observation is increased. Model parameters were estimated from a predator-prey system consisting of the predator Delphastus catalinae (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Bemisia tabaci biotype B (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) on tomato plants. The model explicitly incorporates prey and predator distributions within single plants, the search behavior of predators within plants, and the functional response to prey at the smallest scale of interaction (within leaflets) observed in the laboratory. Validation revealed that the model is useful in scaling up from laboratory observations to predation in whole tomato plants of varying sizes. Comparing predicted predation at the leaflet scale, as observed in laboratory experiments, with predicted predation on whole plants revealed that the predator functional response switches from type II within leaflets to type III within whole plants. We found that the magnitude of predation rates and the type of functional response at the whole plant scale are modulated by (1) the degree of alignment between predator and prey distributions and (2) predator foraging behavior, particularly the effect of area-concentrated search within plants when prey population density is relatively low. The experimental and modeling techniques we present could be applied to other systems in which active predators prey upon sessile or slow-moving species.","[Rincon, Diego F.] Ctr Invest Tibaitata, Corporac Colombiana Invest Agropecuaria Corpoica, Km 14 Via Bogota Mosquera, Mosquera 250047, Cundinamarca, Colombia; [Rincon, Diego F.; Canas, Luis A.; Hoy, Casey W.] Ohio State Univ, OARDC, Dept Entomol, 1680 Madison Ave, Wooster, OH 44691 USA; [Hoy, Casey W.] Ohio State Univ, OARDC, Agroecosyst Management Program, 1680 Madison Ave, Wooster, OH 44691 USA","Rincon, DF (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Tibaitata, Corporac Colombiana Invest Agropecuaria Corpoica, Km 14 Via Bogota Mosquera, Mosquera 250047, Cundinamarca, Colombia.; Rincon, DF (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, OARDC, Dept Entomol, 1680 Madison Ave, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.",drincon@corpoica.org.co; canas.4@osu.edu; hoy.1@osu.edu,,"Rincon, Diego/0000-0001-6869-4430","Corpoica; ColcienciasDepartamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias; Fulbright Program; Department of Entomology at The Ohio State University; SEEDS Research Enhancement Competitive Grants Program [OHOA1006]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)-United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","We are grateful to Larry Madden, Larry Phelan, Robin Taylor, and two anonymous reviewers for comments that greatly improved our manuscript.

Mutualisms can be unstable, shifting to commensal or even negative outcomes with context. Quantifying context dependency in mutualisms is critical for understanding how biotic interactions will shift along disturbance gradients in freshwater systems. A common reproductive interaction among stream fishes, nest association occurs when individuals of one species spawn in nests constructed by a host fish. Hosts benefit from a dilution effect: high proportions of associate eggs decrease the odds of host brood predation. Thus, partner abundance can be an important source of biotic context influencing the outcome of an association. We conducted a large in situ experiment manipulating abundance of partner yellowfin shiner (Leuciscidae: Notropis lutipinnis) (absent, low, high) at constant abundance of host bluehead chub (Leuciscidae: Nocomis leptocephalus), and quantified chub reproductive success using genetic tools. Evidence suggests that the nest association switched from mutualistic to parasitic outcomes as shiner abundance decreased. Chub reproductive success was highest at high shiner abundances. However, chub reproductive success was actually higher in the complete absence of shiners than at low shiner densities. This study shows that outcomes of biotic interactions in freshwater systems are context-dependent, and that partner abundance can be a key source of context-dependency in nest associations. We encourage future studies on freshwater mutualisms, which are thus far largely overlooked, relative to competition and predation.","[Silknetter, Samuel; Peoples, Brandon K.] Clemson Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Conservat, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Kanno, Yoichiro] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Metris, Kimberly L.

Thus, we hypothesized that changes in the social context would cause male vocal competition to change in real time in order to minimize the costs and maximize the benefits of competition. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of repeating playbacks of either white noise (WN) or male advertisement calls on male call production in the Emei music frog (Babina daunchina), a species in which males build mud-retuse burrows and call from within these nests. Previous studies have shown that calls produced from inside burrows are highly sexually attractive (HSA) to females while those produced outside nests are of low sexual attractiveness (LSA). Results showed that most subjects called responsively after the end of WN playbacks but before the onset of conspecific call stimuli although call numbers were similar, indicating that while males adjusted competitive patterns according to the biological significance of signals, their competitive motivation did not change. Furthermore, these data indicate that the frogs had evolved the ability of interval timing. Moreover, when the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between playbacks was varied, the subjects preferentially competed with HSA calls when the ISI was short (< 4 s) but responded equally to HSA and LSA calls if the ISI was long (a parts per thousand yen4 s), suggesting that males allocate competitive efforts depending on both the perceived sexual attractiveness of rivals and the time available for calling. Notably, approximately two-thirds of male calls occurred in response to HSA calls, a preference rate comparable to that previously found for females in phonotaxis experiments and consistent with the idea that the mechanisms underlying both the male's competitive responses to rivals and the female's preferences toward potential mates coevolved under the same selective pressure.","[Fang, Guangzhan; Jiang, Fan; Yang, Ping; Cui, Jianguo; Tang, Yezhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Brauth, Steven E.] Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Tang, YZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, 9 Sect 4,Renmin Nan Rd, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",fanggz@cib.ac.cn; tangyz@cib.ac.cn,"fang, guangzhan/AAH-1098-2020","Fang, Guangzhan/0000-0003-1803-6610","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31372217, 31270042]; Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-R-077]; Youth Professor Project of Chengdu Institute of Biology [Y3B3011]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y2C3011, KSCX2-EW-J-22]","This work was supported by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31372217 to Guangzhan Fang and No. 31270042 to Jianguo Cui), from the Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-YW-R-077) to Yezhong Tang and from the Youth Professor Project of Chengdu Institute of Biology (Y3B3011) and Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y2C3011, KSCX2-EW-J-22) to Jianguo Cui.",,66,21,23,4,50,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-9448,1435-9456,,ANIM COGN,Anim.

We review empirical examples of apparent competition in phytophagous insect hosts attacked by polyphagous parasitoids and develop models of apparent competition in host-parasitoid systems. Apparent competition is particularly likely in insect assemblages because parasitoids can limit their hosts to levels at which resource competition is unimportant. A consideration of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium models in which polyphagous parasitoids impose significant mortality on their hosts suggests that the most common outcome is the exclusion of all but one host species, which generates dynamic monophagy (i.e., a single host species persisting with a potentially polyphagous parasitoid). A crisp criterion for dominance in apparent competition is that the winning host supports the highest parasitoid density. We conclude that it is difficult for alternative hosts to coexist when the sole regulatory factor is a shared parasitoid. Yet in nature, coexisting hosts frequently do share parasitoids. We examine several mechanisms promoting host coexistence, including donor-controlled parasitoid dynamics, additional sources of host density dependence (e.g., resource limitation), spatial and temporal refuges, trophic web structure, and labile parasitoid behavior. Elucidating the mechanisms permitting the coexistence of host species confronted by effective polyphagous parasitoids deserves more attention from experimental field ecologists.","UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI & TECHNOL, CTR POPULAT BIOL, NERC, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND","HOLT, RD (corresponding author), UNIV KANSAS, MUSEUM NAT HIST, DEPT SYSTEMAT & ECOL, LAWRENCE, KS 66045 USA.",,,,,,,54,205,210,2,82,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

This outcome is widely attributed to the fact that disturbance reduces biotic resistance from native plant competitors. However, biocrusts, communities of mosses, lichens, and micro-organisms, are a prominent component of semi-arid grasslands occurring in the interstitial spaces between vascular plants. Biocrusts may provide an important source of biotic resistance to invaders, different from native plant competition, but poorly understood. We established a large-scale field experiment to examine how intact versus disturbed biocrusts influenced the emergence and establishment of four native and four exotic plant species in intermountain bunchgrass systems over 2 years-one wet and one dry. We also conducted a complementary greenhouse experiment to explore how differences in moisture might influence biocrust effects on germination. In the greenhouse, biocrusts inhibited the germination of both native and exotic plants in the high moisture treatment only. In field experiments, biocrusts inhibited the overall emergence of exotic seedlings in the wetter of the 2 years and inhibited the establishment of exotic seedlings in both years, but they had no overall effect on the emergence or establishment of native seedlings. We found that intact biocrusts in intermountain grasslands can suppress the establishment of some exotic plants, but have much weaker effects on natives. They also suggest that water availability may influence biocrust effects on seed germination. Synthesis. Our results indicate that intact biocrusts may provide an important source of biotic resistance to exotic plant invasions in intermountain grasslands. Furthermore, precipitation inputs may mediate biocrust effects on plant establishment.","[Slate, Mandy L.; Callaway, Ragan M.; Pearson, Dean E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Slate, Mandy L.; Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Slate, Mandy L.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Slate, Mandy L.] MPG Ranch, Florence, MT 59833 USA","Slate, ML (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.; Slate, ML (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",slatemandy@gmail.com,,"Slate, Mandy/0000-0002-4026-7952",David Nicholas Memorial Award; P.L.

We examined the activity of H. trunculus on a sublittoral mussel bed at 24 m depth through in situ time-lapse observations and bulk samples. The camera photographed a 0.25 m(2) section of the mussel bed at 6-min intervals for similar to 23 h. Photos were examined frame-by-frame for gastropod movement and activities, especially interactions between H. trunculus and Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819). Our survey indicates high activity-levels of H. trunculus on the sea floor: all gastropods made minor movements, most made major movements, and most left the field of view during the study-interval. On average, individuals remained stationary for only 7.3 h. Two predation attempts on Mytilus involving conspecific competition were documented, and one Hexaplex was consuming a mussel at the onset of the deployment. Additionally, 487 M. galloprovincialis from four diver-taken 0.25 m(2) quadrates were measured and examined for traces of marginal chipping and drilling predation. Mytilus from surface samples ranged from 11.1 mm to 95.5 mm in length, and one of the four samples had a significantly different average shell length from the others. 114 H. trunculus were collected and measured. Hexaplex ranged from 22.1 mm to 86.1 mm and the mean shell length did not differ among samples, though they were overwhelmingly medium and large. Predation frequency (the ratio of successfully preyed upon bivalves to the total number of bivalves sampled) is high at the studied site (>55%), and large gastropods preferred a chipping mode of predation to drilling, supporting earlier laboratory studies showing a preference for M. galloprovincialis and this predation strategy. Prey effectiveness (the ratio of failed predatory attacks to total predatory attacks) is also high (63.8%), and no evidence of a size refuge was found. Feeding in H. trunculus is highly facultative, calling for caution when using drill holes to estimate predation intensities; whenever possible, traces of multiple predation modes should be considered.

Across this wide geographic range, many populations have declined due habitat loss, non-native competitors and predators (e.g., American bullfrogs [Lithobates catesbeianus], Centrarchid fish), and disrupted water flow due to dams. Even when flow conditions are not extensively regulated, managers still require basic and region-specific information about the breeding biology of this species to prevent further decline. To document spatiotemporal dynamics of reproductive output during drought and high flow years, we surveyed a 13.5 km reach of the lower Mad River, Humboldt County, CA approximately 70 km downstream of Matthews Dam. We found relatively high densities of egg masses (39 to 59 masses / km). Egg masses were generally laid on small cobbles (mean +/- SE diameter = 11 +/- 0.24 cm) at depths between 0 and 20 cm, and 95% of egg masses were laid within 6 m of the wetted edge. Egg masses were disproportionately found in the tailouts of fast runs and glides, and found less often than expected in side arms, runs, and riffles than would be expected by chance. Breeding timing appeared to be more related to rapid decreases in stream flow variance than air temperature. Taken with previous information about the species, our results suggest that R. boylii rely on multiple cues to initiate breeding. Our results can be used to help inform breeding timing and habitat use by R. boylii breeding under natural flow regimes in Northern California. Our recommendations for future research include further investigating upland habitat use by post-metamorphic life stages factors that influence breeding site selection.","[Van Hattem, Michael; Olson, Jennifer] Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, 619 Second St, Eureka, CA 95501 USA; [Bean, William T.; Belamaric, Pairsa; Gamblin, Holly; Scherbinski, Jennie Jones; Semerdjian, Alyssa; Smith, Katrina; Widick, Ivy] Humboldt State Univ, Wildlife Dept, 1 Harpst St, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Bean, William T.] Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Biol Sci, 1 Grand Ave, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA","Bean, WT (corresponding author), Humboldt State Univ, Wildlife Dept, 1 Harpst St, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.; Bean, WT (corresponding author), Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Biol Sci, 1 Grand Ave, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",wtbean@calpoly.edu,,,Humboldt State University; Cal Poly State University; California Department of Fish Wildlife,"First, we thank R. boylii, California's river frog for hanging in there and continuing to persist in the lower Mad River and other coastal drainages of Humboldt County.

In both vineyards native phytoseiids were present: Amblyseius andersoni in one vineyard, and Phytoseius finitimus in the other. The economically important predators Kampimodromus aberrans and Typhlodromus pyri were released in both vineyards in order to study their efficacy in controlling tetranychids and eriophyids and their persistence during periods of prey scarcity. In both vineyards, relative abundances of the mite species, especially phytoseiids, were found to differ on different varieties in the same vineyard. In the first experiment, A. andersoni reached higher densities and was more persistent on the variety with slightly pubescent leaf under-surface (Merlot). Typhlodromus pyri and K. aberrans releases were successful and the mites became more abundant on the variety with pubescent leaf under-surface (Verduzzo). In the second experiment, P. finitimus was more abundant on a variety with pubescent leaf under-surface (Prosecco) than with glabrous leaf under-surface (Riesling). The most interesting results of the present study concerned the interactions between native and released predators. In the first vineyard, different results were obtained when releasing T. pyri on the two varieties. On the variety with pubescent leaves, A. andersoni was rapidly displaced by T. pyri, whereas the former species persisted on the other variety throughout the three-year study, apparently becoming dominant during the last season. In contrast to T. pyri, interactions between K. aberrans and A. andersoni in this vineyard did not depend on variety. The results of the experiments carried out in the second vineyard stressed the importance of interspecific competition for phytoseiid releases. Typhlodromus pyri colonization failed on both varieties. Kampimodromus aberrans releases appeared to be more successful on Riesling than on Prosecco, where P. finitimus was more abundant. At the end of the experiments, K. aberrans displaced P. finitimus on both varieties.","Univ Padua, Inst Agr Entomol, I-35020 Padua, Italy","Duso, C (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Inst Agr Entomol, Via Romea 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy.",,"duso, carlo/AAG-8435-2020","Duso, Carlo/0000-0002-2600-2536",,,,31,82,85,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

I cultured A. japonicus juveniles below a fish cage and at a control station for 238 days, monitored the wet weight, and analyzed its stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) together with potential food sources, and found that (1) juveniles cultured below fish cages exhibited high survivorship (96%) and significantly higher specific growth rate (1.9%) than those at the control site (1.2%), and (2) the juveniles had significantly reduced delta C-13 values (mean+/-SD=-19.1+/=0.3 parts per thousand vs. -17.5+/-0.4 parts per thousand at the control station), suggesting the incorporation of C-3 plant material in fish feed through fish feces and settling organic matter. All sea cucumbers which were further cultured for additional 307 days below fish cages grew to the marketable size (range and mean wet weight=142-181 g, 160 g, n=9). In order to evaluate the effect of density on growth, 6 culture vessels, in which 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 juveniles of A. japonicus were stocked, were maintained below the fish cage over 118 days. The results showed that the final mean weight of A. japonicus decreased from 6.68 g to 0.94 g as the density increased with a large variation of weight at the end of the experiment (coefficient of variation=52.1-62.2%), suggesting that there was competition between individuals for a limited food supply and there were intraspecific effects on the growth. This study shows the possibility of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture in which A. japonicus is cultured in the water column below fish cages, because the survival and growth of the sea cucumbers were enhanced due to the ability to avoid predator interactions and adverse environmental conditions as well as nutritional feed supply from the fish cage.

Anopheles gambiae, the primary malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa, is typically associated with ephemeral, sunlit habitats; however, An. gambiae larvae often share these habitats with other anophelines along with other disease-transmitting and benign mosquito species. Resource limitations within habitats can constrain larval density and development, and this drives competitive interactions among and between species. Methods: We used naturally occurring stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen to identify resource partitioning among co-occurring larval species in microcosms and natural habitats in western Kenya. We used two and three source mixing models to estimate resource utilization (i.e. bacteria, algae, organic matter) by larvae. Results: Laboratory experiments revealed larval delta C-13 and delta N-15 composition to reflect the food sources they were reared on. Resource partitioning was demonstrated between An. gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus larvae sharing the same microcosms. Differences in larval delta C-13 and delta N-15 content was also evident in natural habitats, and Anopheles species were consistently more enriched in delta C-13 when compared to culicine larvae. Conclusions: These observations demonstrate inter-specific resource partitioning between Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae larvae in natural habitats in western Kenya. This information may be translated into opportunities for targeted larval control efforts by limiting specific larval food resources, or through bio-control utilizing competitors at the same trophic level.","[Gilbreath, Thomas M., III] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kweka, Eliningaya J.] Trop Pesticides Res Inst, Mosquito Sect, Div Livestock & Human Dis Vector Control, Arusha, Tanzania; [Afrane, Yaw A.; Githeko, Andrew K.] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Kisumu 40100, Kenya; [Yan, Guiyun] Univ Calif Irvine, Program Publ Hlth, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Yan, GY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Program Publ Hlth, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",guiyuny@uci.edu,,"Kweka, Eliningaya/0000-0002-8891-758X",FIC NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43 TW001505] Funding Source: Medline; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI050243] Funding Source: Medline; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43TW001505] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI050243] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,36,10,10,0,14,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,DEC 12,2013,6,,,,,,,,353,10.1186/1756-3305-6-353,,,7,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,277RW,WOS:000328838000004,24330747,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-27,

Ecological relationships around this pulsed resource are highly complex and are influenced by many factors, including those related to its availability and the management of carcasses by humans. In recent years progress has been made in understanding the scope, implications and value of carrion ecology, mainly using scavenger birds and arthropods as study models. However, carrion is important for other facultative scavengers, and even for other non-scavenger species, which may be influenced by the onset of the resources generated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of attendance of passerine birds, including the non-scavengers, at carrion inputs in order to divulge the importance of this resource, its relationship to other species, and to reveal its ecological implications. Individuals of the Corvidae family, recognized facultative scavengers, showed a similar trophic behavior to obligate scavenger raptors regarding the selection of carcass characteristics (i.e., format, scattering, biomass), the surrounding landscape and spatiotemporal conditions. Furthermore, corvids mismatched their presence with vultures, benefitting through commensalism from the generation of residual small pieces and scraps. The non-scavenger passerines avoided simultaneous presence with vultures and delayed their attendance to carcasses from the time of input. Non-corvid passerines profited from carrion opportunistically, especially through predation on scavenger arthropods. Thus, their appearance was linked to seasons and conditions with an increased abundance of invertebrates, and coincided with periods of higher energy demand (migration and wintering). Similarly, inter-specific competition in carrion exploitation as well as a decrease in abundance of arthropods may determine the segregation between non-corvid passerines and scavenger raptors.","[Moreno-Opo, Ruben] Univ Complutense Madrid, Vertebrate Biol & Conservat Grp, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Margalida, Antoni] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Moreno-Opo, R (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Vertebrate Biol & Conservat Grp, Madrid 28049, Spain.",rmorenoopo@gmail.com,"Margalida, Antoni/A-2723-2011; Margalida, Antoni/AAG-5337-2020; Margalida, Antoni/A-2723-2011","Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-0576-3993; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-7383-671X; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-3904-6212",TRAGSATEC [ESTRATEC 3076047]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [RYC-2012-11867],"This work was carried out within the framework of the Technical basis and guidelines for a strategy on feeding of endangered scavengers project (ESTRATEC 3076047), developed by TRAGSATEC and commissioned by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment.

This development is characterised by a decreasing proportion of epigeic life forms. In contrast to data from coniferous afforestations in Berzdorf mine sites and other mine sites studied in Lower Lusatia as well as from the literature, the earthworm development on Berzdorf mine sites with deciduous afforestation appear as an ideal and regionally typical development series (ITDS). Earthworm populations at 13 Lower Lusatian mine sites 35-50 years after afforestation were found to have a biomass between 0.1 and 21 g m(-2), dependent on humidity and kind of litter (pine, beech, oak, alder, poplar, lime). An increase of earthworm biomass above 20 g m(-2) was accompanied by a change of humus type from mor via moder to a mull humus. At the same point the biomass share of the humiphagous macrofauna other than earthworms (Diplopods, Isopods, Diptera larvae) decreased, i.e. the biomass of earthworms became more and more dominant. Further information comes from the comparison of the yearly input of dead soil organic matter (SOM), measured as the energy content of the yearly litter fall out and field layer production, and as the potential ability of the soil humiphagous fauna to decompose the yearly supply of SOM, expressed as the potential zootic decomposition level (DLZpot; U m-2 a(-1)). A very high litter production 3-5 years after afforestation is combined with a low DLZpot, caused by the absence of earthworms, thus leading to a high ectolnumus layer. As soon as earthworm biomass rises (after 10 years), the DLZpot becomes very high, later levelling out depending on primary production, and causing a mull humus type. Microarthropods (Collembola, Actinedida, Oribatida, Gamasida) colonised young mine sites with deep deciduous litter layer very quickly and in high densities (> 100.000 ind. m(-2)). Later on, the rising competition with earthworms caused a decline of microarthropods, followed by a second maximum after about 30 years. At the oldest studied sites, the density reached a level near to that of a neighbouring native woodland. On pine afforestations, the colonisation needs more time but reaches the highest observed density (> 250.000 ind. m(-2)) after 30 years. In parallel to the earthworms, the quantitative development of microarthropods on deciduous mine sites can be taken as an ideal and regionally typical developmental series (ITDS). At the species level, 8 colonising groups of Collembola could be distinguished according to the centre of their temporal occurrence. Besides fugitive initial species at the start and stenoecious woodland species at the temporary finish, 6 groups were found to be typical for certain periods of the mine site development. In contrast to the Collembola with 99 species found at the mine sites, only 14 species of predatory centipedes were observed, but as within the Collembola, the centipedes showed a species-specific colonisation behaviour, also marking certain periods of ecosystem succession on the mine sites.

Irrespective of sampling sites and periods considered, sex ratios were female-biased (2.3 on average), and mean sizes of males were greater than those for females. At least shells from 31 different gastropods were used by C. erythropus in the Gulf of Cadiz. Shell selection was largely determined by the sizes of the hermit crab and shells. As result, a generalist pattern of shell use was displayed by this species. Most hermit crabs with shield length > 4.5 mm were males and the less abundant larger shells were occupied by these large males. Statistically significant sex-related (males vs. females) and size -related (small males vs. large males) differences in shell use were observed at two sampling sites with higher shell diversity, suggesting partial intraspecific partitioning of shell resource. There was a negative effect of carrying relatively heavy/large shells on the stage condition (males and females) and on clutch size of ovigerous females, suggesting that protection from predators was prioritised.","[Perez-Miguel, Marta; Cuesta, Jose A.; Manzano, Raquel; Drake, Pilar] ICMAN CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia, Ave Republ Saharaui 2, Cadiz 11519, Spain","Cuesta, JA (corresponding author), ICMAN CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia, Ave Republ Saharaui 2, Cadiz 11519, Spain.",jose.cuesta@icman.csic.es,"Cuesta, Jose A./A-1132-2008; Cuesta, Jose A./P-7142-2019; MANZANO, RAQUEL/AAB-1709-2020","Cuesta, Jose A./0000-0001-9482-2336; Cuesta, Jose A./0000-0001-9482-2336; MANZANO, RAQUEL/0000-0002-7477-8742",,,,40,3,4,0,25,CRUSTACEAN SOC,SAN ANTONIO,"840 EAST MULBERRY, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78212 USA",0278-0372,1937-240X,,J CRUSTACEAN BIOL,J.

Evolutionary theory predicts that ovipositing females that can actively disperse should select hosts that increase offspring performance. However, for organisms that are exclusively passively dispersed, feeding site selection is possible only at the within-host level. This is particularly important for their offspring, which have strong temporal and spatial dispersal constraints within a host. Such constraints are probably magnified by tissue quality heterogeneity caused by competing herbivores. We investigated within-host feeding site selection of passively dispersed neonates of a sessile herbivore, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugaeAnnand), when it shares its eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensisCarriere) host with another sessile herbivore, the elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externaFerris). Within-host feeding site selection was studied (a) at the shoot level (with or without F.externa) using choice tests, and (b) at the needle level by scoring insect presence in field As A.tsugae has no efficient predators or parasitoids in the study area, we conclude that our results are due to the presence of the competing herbivore. Although A.tsugae cannot actively disperse among hosts, we showed that within-host feeding site selection is an important mechanism to minimise the co-occurrence with a competing herbivore that has known negative impacts on A.tsugae population densities. Studying within-host feeding site selection in a multiple-species context could assist in understanding and predicting the impact of destructive pests such as A.tsugae and the interactions with their novel hosts.","[Gomez, Sara; Gonda-King, Liahna; Preisser, Evan L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Gomez, Sara; Orians, Colin M.] Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, Medford, MA USA","Gomez, S (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, 9 East Alumni Ave, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",saracocogomez@gmail.com,,"Orians, Colin/0000-0003-3773-0894",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0715504]; NIFAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-67013-30142],"The authors thank L.

Considerable year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation occurred during the 10-yr study (1983-1992), with most extreme hut-dry conditions in 1988 during a 3-yr drought. Decreased stream temperature and reduced variation in temperature: occurred downstream from the lake outlet because of increased groundwater inputs. Age-0 bass were captured in the stream in each of the eight years sampled, but bass abundance peaked in downstream reaches in 1988, concurrent with a large increase in the downstream density of age-0 chubs. Median length ratio of bass to chubs increased greatly in the 1988 drought year. The shift in relative length of bass and chubs during the drought was because chub length decreased in downstream areas, and bass shifted from feeding an invertebrates to feeding on chubs in downstream but not in upstream reaches. Comparison of bass and chub growth in the presence and absence of interspecific competition for invertebrate resources in an experimental stream revealed higher growth rates for chubs than for bass and little interspecific competition. Experiments in the artificial stream indicated that the presence or absence of chubs susceptible to bass predation had only marginal effects on bass survival, but growth rates of bass were substantially higher if chubs susceptible to predation were present. Only when chubs were present was the growth of individual bass dependent strongly on size, and this led to rapid divergence in the size distribution of bass in chubs vs. no-chubs treatments. Our results indicate that hot-dry climatic conditions associated with drought have potentially strong effects on size-structured trophic interactions between age-0 fish along lake-stream gradients. Hot-dry climatic conditions alter the spatial distribution of lake fish along temperature gradients in the stream, the reproductive success and synchrony of lake and stream fish development, and the eventual growth of predatory lake species. The response of fish to climatic variation appears to be strongly influenced by their position in the hydrologic landscape. The most dramatic fish response occurred in stream reaches influenced by groundwater.","Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, Univ Stn, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA; Univ Lodz, Dept Appl Ecol, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland","Schlosser, IJ (corresponding author), Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, Univ Stn, Box 9019, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",,,"Lapinska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-4421-8330",,,,58,41,42,1,43,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,1046,1057,,10.2307/177177,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500015,,,,,2021-09-27,

A growing body of research has evaluated the influence of reef microstructure on coral settlement and post-settlement survival, showing that physical refugia enhance recruitment. These studies have evaluated coral recruit morality from competition with macroalgae and indirect predation by grazing organisms, but the impact of direct predation by corallivorous piscine species on juvenile corals and how this interacts with reef microstructure is relatively unknown. This study examined whether refugia provided by micro-crevices enhance juvenile coral survival from corallivory. Juvenile corals from two different functional groups, the slow-growing massive Porites lobata and fast-growing branching Pocillopora damicornis, with average nubbin sizes of 1.4 cm x 0.3 cm and 0.5 cm x 1.0 cm (diameter x height), respectively, were attached to experimental tiles using small (1.44 cm(3)) and large (8.0 cm(3)) crevice sizes and were monitored for 29 d on a forereef in Palau. Full crevices (four sided) enhanced coral survival compared to exposed microhabitats in both coral taxa, but crevice size did not alter survival rates. Corallivores targeted recruits within crevices regardless of crevice size; dominant predators included small triggerfish (Balistidae), butterflyfish (Chaetodon), and wrasse (Cheilinus). Overall, Pocillopora suffered much higher rates of mortality than Porites. All Pocillopora were consumed by day 8 of the experiment, but mortality was significantly delayed in full crevices compared to exposed and partial crevice (three sided) microhabitats. In contrast, Por. lobata located in all microhabitats survived the entire experiment up to 29 d, with high survival in full (> 90%) and partial crevices (70%), but only 28% survival in exposed microhabitats. These findings show the importance of crevices as spatial refugia from predators for juvenile corals and highlight the importance of structural complexity for juvenile coral growth and survival that enhances reef recovery.","[Gallagher, Clare] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Gallagher, Clare; Doropoulos, Christopher] Palau Int Coral Reef Ctr, Koror 96940, Palau; [Doropoulos, Christopher] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Doropoulos, Christopher] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia","Gallagher, C (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.; Gallagher, C; Doropoulos, C (corresponding author), Palau Int Coral Reef Ctr, Koror 96940, Palau.; Doropoulos, C (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.; Doropoulos, C (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia.",cgalla44@gmail.com; christopher.doropoulos@csiro.au,"Doropoulos, Christopher/B-7249-2016","Doropoulos, Christopher/0000-0001-8038-2771","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton UniversityPrinceton University; Office of the Dean of the College at Princeton UniversityPrinceton University; Australian Endeavour Award Postdoctoral FellowshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; Marine Spatial Ecology Lab at The University of Queensland","This study was funded by grants to CG from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Office of the Dean of the College, both at Princeton University, and to CD through an Australian Endeavour Award Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Here I report a series of investigations that comprehensively evaluate the influence of conspecific density on key traits (survival, growth, and reproduction) in the intertidal barnacle Balanus glandula. Density was manipulated in mid-intertidal barnacle populations living on both natural rock surfaces and on settlement plates, and monitored in natural populations. Survival was positively related to density: populations at the lowest density level were 19 times more likely to experience >= 95% mortality than those at the highest level. In contrast, growth and individual reproductive output were negatively related to density: animals at lower experimental densities (16-50, adult barnacles/100 cm(2)) grew to 1.6 times the diameter of individuals living at higher densities (200-460 adult barnacles/100 cm(2)), and larger barnacles produced larger brood masses than smaller individuals. Overall, the frequency of brooding barnacles in experimental and natural populations was greatest at intermediate densities. Estimation of the basic reproductive rate for the experimental animals on the settlement plates indicated that the primary effect of increased conspecific density was enhanced survival, and consequently, a larger mean number of larvae produced per original recruit. Thus in this case, the positive intraspecific effects of high-density aggregations outweighed the negative effects. My results demonstrate that key life history traits may not have similar responses to changes in density, and provide a strategy for evaluating the relative importance of positive vs. negative intraspecific interactions.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Leslie, HM (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",hleslie@princeton.edu,"Leslie, Heather M./I-7812-2019; Leslie, Heather/B-4980-2014","Leslie, Heather M./0000-0003-4512-9417; ",,,,42,39,41,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2005,86,10,,,,,2716,2725,,10.1890/04-1767,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,971DP,WOS:000232361800017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although both seastars have similar size structures and generally overlapped in their spatial and temporal distribution, the degree of overlap varied in different sites and appeared to be related to prey abundance, substratum type and slope. Three general patterns were observed: (1) both species aggregating in shallow water and decreasing in numbers with depth; (2) the two species showing inverse depth distributions; and (3) both seastars occurring in low numbers across the subtidal zone. Temporal changes in availability of the preferred prey of the two seastars, the mussel Mytilus edulis, appeared to be a major factor affecting their abundance and distribution. The two seastars occurred together in dense aggregations on mussel beds in shallow water. They consume similar-sized mussels until the number of mussels becomes reduced when A. vulgaris, but not L. polaris, begins to select larger mussels. Once a mussel bed is decimated, the seastars appear to move away, possibly in search of other beds. Intensive seastar foraging limits the distribution of mussels to a few metres in depth. Below the mussel zone, the two seastars are spatially segregated at a small spatial scale (l m(2) quadrat) and select different alternative prey, L. polaris feeding mainly on the crevice-dwelling clam Hiatella arctica and A. vulgaris on the ophiuroid Ophiopholis aculeata. The size partitioning of the preferred prey in shallow water, and spatial segregation and selection of different alternative prey at greater depths may reflect mechanisms permitting the two seastars to coexist.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, GIROQ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Gaymer, CF (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,81,56,59,2,42,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4221 USA",0025-3154,,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Colonization is a key process in community assembly that is both potentially driven by past interactions and amenable to experimental approaches. Colonization and oviposition by an aquatic beetle (Tropisternus lateralis) was assayed in the presence and absence of both 'harmless' and tactilely/visually isolated predatory fish (Lepomis gibbosus and L. macrochirus). Beetles avoided each treatment with fish when compared to fish-free experimental pools. Activity levels after colonization also differed significantly between adults in fish and fish-free tanks. Predator effects on species composition are typically ascribed to contemporary predation events; the presence of a strong avoidance response demonstrates that past species interactions affect present distributions and may play an important role in the ongoing assembly of contemporary communities.

Although diet changes are expected in dimorphic species, ontogeny can be a factor in determining the degree of diet variation within a species. We studied large sexually dimorphic predator, the Yellow anaconda Eunectes notaeus, to learn how influences of sex and size on diet might lead to intersexual niche divergence, therefore avoiding intraspecific competition. We tested the consequences of sexual size dimorphism via two foraging metrics: prey size and feeding frequency. To test the consequences of ontogeny on trophic niche metrics, we related changes in feeding frequency and maximum prey size to increase in anaconda body size. Finally, we tested whether diet composition changed between sexes to the point where it could lead to reduced competition. While females (the larger sex) did eat larger prey compared to males, this effect disappeared when we removed the effect of body size. Females ate more frequently than males, even with body size effect was removed. Predator-prey size ratios were positively affected by maximum prey size, and as expected from foraging theory, did not increase minimum prey size. Feeding frequency did not display any ontogenetic effects. While diet composition varied between sexes, overlap is high. This indicates that variations in resource use as a product of sex-based differences in size are negligible in Yellow anacondas. Although females feed more frequently, this may be an effect of the greater energetic costs of reproduction. Ontogeny has a positive effect on maximum prey size, though this is a general trend, and has already been demonstrated for several other species. Finally, understanding of sex-based changes in resource use will be improved if it can be determined whether such phenomena are consequences rather than causes for sexual size dimorphism.","[Miranda, E.

We investigated the effects of the invasive plant, Brassica nigra on the multi-trophic arthropod community residing on the native California annual Deinandra fasciculata. In a common garden experiment, we planted D. fasciculata without B. nigra or with one of 45 B. nigra half-sib genetic families. We in turn crossed this B. nigra treatment with the suppression of soil fungi to both test for effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on arthropods, and elucidate the mechanisms of B. nigra's below ground effects. B. nigra had no effect on D. fasciculata traits (biomass, inflorescence number, root colonization by AMF), arthropod community composition or predator density, but increased herbivore density. While B. nigra families varied 18-fold in size, there was no genetic variation for effects on D. fasciculata or its arthropods. Soil fungi suppression had no effect on D. fasciculata traits, herbivore density or herbivore community composition, but increased predator density and altered predator community composition. While the exact mechanisms of B. nigra effects are unclear, they do not appear to have been mediated by altered plant performance or reductions in root colonization by AMF. Our experiment shows that invasive plants such as B. nigra may affect higher trophic levels even when they do not measurably affect native plant performance.","[Schreck, Tadj K.; David, Scott J.; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Mooney, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mooneyk@uci.edu,,,"Newkirk Center for Science and Society Graduate Fellowship; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Irvine; NSF Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) fellowship; UC Irvine School of Biological Sciences; UC Irvine Academic Senate Council on Research, Computing and Libraries; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1120794]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1120794] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This research was supported by the Newkirk Center for Science and Society Graduate Fellowship.

Locally, zebra mussels provide structural refuge from predation and deposit organic material. An experiment demonstrated that the density of benthic invertebrates increased locally as a function of zebra mussel density in Oneida Lake, New York. On a lake-wide spatial scale, light penetration increased dramatically in response to zebra mussel invasion. Consequently, the area of lake bottom likely to support benthic primary production also increased. The maximum depth of light penetration sufficient to support benthic algal photosynthesis increased from 7.5 m in pre-invasion years (1975-1991) to 10.5 m in post-invasion years, and macrophytes extended to a greater depth in post-invasion years. Algae and macrophytes may provide food or structural refuge to invertebrates. An intensive survey of one shallow bay showed that benthic invertebrate densities were higher in 1995 than in 2 pre-invasion years (1916 and 1967), even on substrates not colonized by zebra mussels. Continuous data (1967-1997) showed that invertebrates on soft substrate in Oneida Lake have not significantly increased above peak historical levels. However, the abundance of 2 grazing taxa (Amphipoda and Gastropoda) has increased in shallow relative to deep areas, suggesting that grazing invertebrate populations have responded to modification of light penetration by zebra mussels. Phosphorus levels in the lake have declined in the past 30 y, possibly keeping the increase of benthic invertebrate populations below historical levels.","Cornell Biol Field Stn, Bridgeport, NY 13030 USA","Mayer, CM (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, 130 Coll Pl, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",,,,,,,45,74,79,1,26,NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0887-3593,,,J N AM BENTHOL SOC,J.

Successful prediction in complex systems requires empirically accessible theoretical frameworks to limit the range of possible outcomes. I explored the predictions of multispecies Markov models, based on transition probabilities derived from repeated censuses of fixed points in the middle intertidal community of Tatoosh Island, Washington, USA, under natural conditions and after altering the model to reflect species extinction and changes in size-structured processes. The unmanipulated model predicted a mussel-dominated community and quantitatively captured 98.7% of the variation in community composition in independent transects. Although model assumptions that transition probabilities did not vary over time and depended only on the state of a point at the previous census were violated, altering the model to account for these violations provided no improvement in model performance. The manipulated models indicated that most species and transitions had relatively weak effects on community composition, the strongest effects being associated with California mussels (Mytilus californianus), articulated coralline algae (Corallina vancouveriensis), and predatory birds. The manipulated models also predicted that extinction of several species, particularly predatory birds, affects the resilience of the system, as assessed by return time. The effects of species on composition and resilience were poorly correlated, suggesting that assessing the importance of species depends on the type of ecosystem response being considered. The model successfully predicted quantitative shifts in community composition and ecosystem dynamics under several novel conditions: on vertical walls where bird predation and adult mussel recruitment are absent, and in previously published experiments that excluded birds from horizontal benches. These results suggest that Markov models can provide a useful predictive framework for some types of environmental impacts on complex ecosystems.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Wootton, JT (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 East St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",twootton@uchicago.edu,"Wootton, J.

Furthermore, its close botanical affinity to cultivated rice makes its control particularly difficult. However, winter flooding of rice fields can be an efficient technique to control weedy rice infestation by promoting weed seed decay, animal predation, or germination. The effects of winter flooding on weedy rice plant and seed densities were assessed via two methods: field study of plant densities and laboratory study of germination behaviour. In the field experiment, weedy rice plant density decreased following application of winter flooding. In fact, winter flooding resulted in more than a 95% reduction in the number of viable weedy rice seeds on the soil surface as compared to reductions in the range of 26-77% on fields left dry between rice crops. The laboratory study showed that weedy rice germinability was affected by storage duration, moisture condition, and thermal regimen. In general, seed germinability increased with storage duration. Both awnless and awned populations displayed poor germinability under low temperature seed storage, but displayed differences when moisture content varied. At -20 degrees C, we observed, on average, 58% of seeds to be non-viable when stored for 248 days in water. At +5 degrees C the awnless population showed higher germination percentages following shorter storage durations, particularly water stored seeds. At +25 degrees C, the highest germination values were recorded in both populations after dry storage, whereas in water, total germination of the awnless population was inversely related to storage duration. Under typical field temperatures, in dry conditions germination behaviour was intermediate between that displayed at +5 degrees C and +25 degrees C, while storage in water resulted in a faster dormancy breaking in both populations. The results suggest that winter flooding can be a useful practice to mitigate weedy rice infestations as it promotes germination already in the autumn, before rigorous winter conditions, and favours the decay of non-germinated seeds under low temperature conditions.

In this work, we used Chinese tiger frog Hoplobatrachus chinensis tadpoles as an experimental model to investigate the effects of kinship and density on growth and development of this species over a 73 day period. The results showed that density can affect the growth and developmental traits (survival rate, larval period, size at the limb bud protrusion/metamorphic climax and body mass at different life stages) of H. chinensis tadpoles, while kinship does not. Tadpoles took longer to develop and potential metamorphosis was greater in high density groups of both sibling and non-siblings. The interaction of kinship and density did not significantly influenced growth traits of H. chinensis tadpoles during the experimental period. For coefficient variations of each growth trait, no differences were detected between sibling and non-sibling groups.

Little is known about the ecology of these crabs or the factors that influence their distribution in mangrove forests. Pitfall traps were used to sample grapsid crabs in the Murray River estuary in north Queensland. Sampling was conducted at five sites along a salinity gradient from <1 parts-per-thousand at upstream sites to >35 parts-per-thousand at the river mouth. At each site, trapping was done in both low and high intertidal forests. We characterized the sediments at each site by measuring percent sand, silt, clay and organic matter, Eh, pH, and soil pore-water salinity. Four species of grapsids dominated the crab fauna along the Murray River (Sesarma semperi-longicristatum, S. messa, S. brevicristatum, and S. brevipes). Distinct zonation patterns were found along the salinty gradient and between high and low intertidal forests. S. messa was dominant in high intertidal, downstream forests, high and low intertidal forests in the middle to downstream portion of the river, and in low intertidal forests in the central reach of the river. S. brevipes was dominant in both low and high intertidal zone forests at low salinity upstream sites. S. brevicristatum was most abundant in the central reaches of the river and only in the high intertidal zone. S. semperi-longicristatum was found only in the low intertidal zone, downstream forest. Subsequently, tests of salinity tolerances of these crabs were carried out in the laboratory. These indicated very wide tolerances over salinities from completely fresh to hypersaline (60 parts-per-thousand). The osmoregulatory abilities of the crabs were also found to vary. However, neither their salinity tolerance nor osmoregulatory ability adequately explain the zonation patterns we measured in the field. For example, S. brevicristatum had the most restricted distribution, but it had the second broadest salinity tolerance and osmoregulatory ability. Sediment characteristics explained a significant amount of the variation in abundance for two of the crab species. Pore-water salinity provided no explanatory power for any of the species. Individual species abundances are probably influenced by additional factors such as interspecific competition and predation.","AUSTRALIAN INST MARINE SCI,TOWNSVILLE,QLD 4810,AUSTRALIA",,,"Frusher, Stewart/G-5117-2014","Frusher, Stewart/0000-0003-2493-3676",,,,41,59,66,0,28,ESTUARINE RES FEDERATION,LAWRENCE,"PO BOX 368, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0160-8347,,,ESTUARIES,Estuaries,SEP,1994,17,3,,,,,647,654,,10.2307/1352412,,,8,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,QA359,WOS:A1994QA35900012,,,,,2021-09-27,

These interactions can have profound effects on some species including their elimination from desired habitats, increased predation, reduction in numbers, and reduced recruitment. Consequences of these behavioral interactions will vary depending on the amount of niche overlap between competing species. As nonindigenous species are introduced and become established, it becomes imperative that we understand how they interact with native species to develop a better understanding of how they may impact native biota. Introduction of the round goby Neogobius melanostomus into North America and elsewhere has been implicated in the reduction and extirpation of native species. Round gobies negatively influenced yellow perch Perca flavescens in previous studies. In our study, we documented that round gobies influenced yellow perch behavior in the laboratory. We found round gobies displaced young-of-the-year (YOY) yellow perch from rock shelters when introduced into the tank. We also found reduced rock shelter use by YOY yellow perch intruders when round gobies were present. Round gobies were dominant over YOY yellow perch in every case where interactions were observed to occur between these two species. The most aggressive encounters involved round gobies chasing YOY yellow perch and either attempting to bite or actually biting them. These behaviors could have detrimental consequences wherever YOY yellow perch and round gobies overlap in distribution.","[Zuwerink, David A.] Univ Northwestern Ohio, 1744 Hartzler Rd, Lima, OH 45805 USA; [Jude, David J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gannon, John E.] Int Joint Commiss, 100 Ouellette Ave,8th Flr, Windsor, ON N9A 6T3, Canada","Zuwerink, DA (corresponding author), Univ Northwestern Ohio, 1744 Hartzler Rd, Lima, OH 45805 USA.",dzuwerink@unoh.edu,"Zuwerink, David/AAY-7997-2020","Zuwerink, David/0000-0002-6580-833X","Great Lakes National Program Office, United States Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [GL2004-204]; School for Environment and Sustainability, University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan System; Office of the Vice President for Research, University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan System","We thank Ohio State University Stone Laboratory staff for allowing us to use their facilities and equipment for this experiment.

In this study, we analyzed some aspects of the early Life history of the stone crab, focusing especially on (1) recruitment patterns among habitats and between years in intertidal zones, (2) habitat preferences, including some intra- and interspecific interactions that may affect habitat use, and (3) intraspecific interactions that may affect survival. We also evaluated the percent cover of suitable habitats for juvenile stone crabs in a MPA and a MEA. Sheltered habitats showed higher densities of juvenile H, plana than exposed areas, and sand with boulders showed the highest crab densities, followed by shell hash with boulders. Differences in mean densities were detected for all benthic stages among sheltered substrates, except for megalopae. Bare substrates (without boulders) showed the lowest density. Throughout the settlement period, abundance of smaller instars (<J2) was 3 times higher in 1995 than in 1996, while densities of >J4 were twice as high in 1996 than in 1995. Neither intra- nor interspecific space competition seems to explain the distribution of juvenile stone crabs in the field. However, cannibalism among juveniles may have an important effect on survival. Cannibalism among juveniles is density-dependent, and may have greater effects as the abundance of larger conspecifics increases since mutual interference does not affect proportional prey mortality per predator. We suggest that losses are high in low quality habitats (probably through emigration, predation or habitat disturbance due to wave impact), and cannibalism is an important source of mortality in high quality habitats (where crab density is high). Although substrate type and post-settlement processes can help explain the distribution of juvenile stone crabs, wave action seems to be the major determinant of juvenile distribution. Neither sheltered habitats nor the most suitable substrate are common in the MPA and MEA studied. These factors are not currently being considered in the assignation of MEAs or planning of MPAs, although they could explain the lack of effect of both protection strategies in increasing the abundance of the stone crabs in Chile in comparison to other exploited benthic species.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile","Fernandez, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",mfernand@genes.bio.puc.cl,,,,,,41,20,20,1,20,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In Argentina, six species of Pseudacteon parasitoids (Phoridae) attack Solenopsis richteri, one of the two species of South American fire ant that are exotic pests in North America. 2. The presence of these Pseudacteon species significantly reduces the number of ants at food resources in the field, as well as foraging activity generally. 3. Some Pseudacteon not only attack ants walking on trails or at feeding sites, but also at mound entrances, inhibiting workers from leaving to forage. 4. The average size of foraging ants (which prescribes their suitability as hosts) decreased in the presence of phorids. 5. The number of attacking phorids was correlated positively with the number of ants walking towards the food on the trail before the attack. 6. Solenopsis richteri workers responded to manipulations of food size and presence or absence of parasitoids in a risk-adjusting way, i.e. although more foragers were recruited to larger food items, attacking phorids reduced ant foraging activity by the same factor regardless of the size of the food offered. 7. The data suggest that S. richteri colonies juggle the needs to harvest food efficiently, reduce competition, and avoid excess risks from parasitoids in complex ways.","Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, IFEVA, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Texas, Brackenridge Field Lab, Austin, TX USA; Univ Texas, Dept Zool, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Folgarait, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Quilmes, Ctr Estud & Invest, Ave Roque Saenz Pena 180, RA-1876 Bernal, BA, Argentina.",pfolgarait@unq.edu.ar,,,,,,35,54,55,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Averaging densities over whole populations in such organisms gives a more or less inaccurate description of the real variation in competitive intensity over time and space. The potential for local density dependence in more mobile organisms is less well understood, particularly for organisms living in continuous habitats. To test for local density-dependent processes in such an organism, we manipulated egg density (the number of eggs nest(-1)) among ten artificial nests of Atlantic salmon along an 1,848-m long river during two consecutive years. Eggs in different nests were given unique thermal otolith-banding patterns to allow identification of juvenile nest origin. At capture, 1-2 months after emergence, the spatial distribution of juveniles reflected nest locations, with the median absolute dispersal distance being 92 and 41 m in the 2 years. Estimated nest-specific survival rates were strongly negatively related to hatched-egg density in both years (r(2)=0.72 and 0.62), despite dramatic differences in overall mean survival (0.22 and 0.02). Thus, density-dependent survival following emergence in Atlantic salmon juveniles occurs on spatial scales much smaller than that of whole populations. The consistency across years suggests that the phenomenon is likely to occur over most environmental conditions. Our observation of local-scale density dependence is consistent with strong juvenile territoriality, which forces individuals emerging in high-initial density areas to disperse farther, and a high cost (metabolic or predation) of dispersal. We conclude that for mobile organisms with patchy distributions of propagules and constrained juvenile dispersal, increased emphasis on local-scale dynamics should enable a more mechanistic understanding of population regulation even in continuous habitats, and hence increase the predictive power of population models.","Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; Univ Massachusetts, US Forest Serv, Res Unit NE4251, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Einum, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Tungasletta 2, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway.",sigurd.einum@nina.no,,"Einum, Sigurd/0000-0002-3788-7800",,,,42,114,116,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2005,143,2,,,,,203,210,,10.1007/s00442-004-1793-y,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,907SN,WOS:000227738400004,15654640,,,,2021-09-27,

A 2-factor laboratory experiment was conducted, where juveniles (0+) and adults (1+) were kept in experimental jars for 2 mo at densities of 2000, 4000 and 8000 ind. m(-2), which corresponds to natural abundances in the Baltic Sea. The amphipods were fed on a mixture of naturally occurring algae at 3 food levels: zero, medium (representing a diatom spring-bloom) and high (representing a 2 x diatom spring-bloom). The level of food added to the experimental jars determined whether food competition occurred, both within and between the 2 age classes. Growth of juveniles was riot density-dependent, at any food level, in the absence of adults, but clearly dependent on presence or absence of fresh algal material. In presence of high adult densities, the growth of juveniles was significantly reduced at food levels that corresponded to a single and twice a diatom spring-bloom, while such reduction was not found in jars without added algae. Growth of adults was both density- and food-dependent. Juveniles did not affect the survival and growth of adults. As high densities of amphipods in jars without added food affected neither growth nor mortality, we conclude that crowding effects such as predation or directly damaging interference are not important regulating mechanisms. The results indicate that exploitative intraspecific competition for food occurs both between and within year classes, but depends on the resource levels and is likely to be most intense under a regime of low to medium input of phytodetritus. The experiment lends support to the hypothesis that intraspecific competition for food acts as an important process causing fluctuations in the Baltic Sea populations of M. affinis.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Wenngren, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.wenngren@zoologi.su.se,"Olafsson, Emil/D-4916-2012",,,,,56,15,15,0,2,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

A mechanism explaining these findings based on competitive hindrance by non-prey, or decoy species is put forward. It is shown that this hindrance tends to damp out predator-prey oscillations, and therefore reduces the probability of prey extinction. Possible experiments to verify this theory are discussed. The decoy effect may play a role in any system with high densities of bacteria or other particulate matter, such as activated sludge or biofilms.

Three populations of H. axyridis were used in this study: a long-term laboratory population (since 1998) and a melanic and non-melanic population originating from field collected individuals in Belgium. The insects were allowed to develop and reproduce on frozen eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae), frozen moist bee pollen or an even mixture of the two. Females of the field population offered the mixed diet initiated oviposition sooner than those fed only E. kuehniella eggs, but other developmental and reproductive traits were similar on these diets. A diet of pollen alone allowed 35-48% of the larvae of the field population of H. axyridis to successfully reach adulthood. However, developmental time for these individuals was prolonged by 31-49% and adult body weight was reduced by 37-68%, compared to individuals offered the diets containing E. kuehniella eggs. When fed exclusively on pollen in their larval and adult life, about 40% of the adult females of either field population were able to produce a small number of viable eggs. The laboratory and field strains differed in their response to diet for a number of developmental and reproductive traits. The exploitation of pollen and other plant foods at times when insect prey is scarce, may offer a further competitive advantage to the non-indigenous coccinellid H. axyridis over native European predatory lady beetles that share the same niche and are less capable of using pollen as an alternative food.","[Berkvens, Nick; Bonte, Jochem; Tirry, Luc; De Clercq, Patrick] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Crop Protect, Lab Agrozool, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Berkvens, Dirk] Inst Trop Med Prince Leopold, Dept Anim Hlth, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Deforce, Koen] Flemish Heritage Inst, Brussels, Belgium","Berkvens, N (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Crop Protect, Lab Agrozool, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Nick.Berkvens@UGent.be; Jochem.Bonte@UGent.be; dberkvens@itg.be; koen.deforce@rwo.vlaanderen.be; Luc.Tirry@UGent.be; Patrick.DeClercq@UGent.be,"De Clercq, Patrick/B-5721-2015","De Clercq, Patrick/0000-0003-0664-1602; Deforce, Koen/0000-0003-3075-2564",,,,46,82,90,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-6141,1573-8248,,BIOCONTROL,Biocontrol,FEB,2008,53,1,,,,,201,210,,10.1007/s10526-007-9128-7,,,10,Entomology,Entomology,245WL,WOS:000251969400013,,,,,2021-09-27,

We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) on community interactions between two sympatric North American anurans: Fowler's toad. Bufo fowleri, and the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. Recent studies have identified chytridiomycosis as an emerging infections disease, whose widespread occurence poses a significant risk for amphibian populations. We manipulated the presence of B. dendrobatidis in replicated experimental tanks and examined if exposure to this fungus during development could influence recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Bufo and Hyla. Tanks were followed throughout larval development, and we recorded survival. time to metamorphosis. and body mass at metamorphosis. We also tested the effects of competitive and pathogen-mediated stress on developmental stability by measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of surviving metamorphs. B. dendrobatidis had no significant effect on larval survival, but the pathogen reduced metamorphic body mass and increased larval-period length. B. dendrobatidis had different effects oil larval growth depending on the community sructure; in the presence of the pathogen, both Bufo and Hyla metamorphosed at smaller body masses when reared together compared to when reared separately. Bit also had strong negative effects oil Hyla development, but Only in the presence of B. dendrobatidis. FA of hind-limb length was significantly higher for metamorphs front pathogen tanks, but was not associated with density or competitive environment. Our results suggest that chytridiomycosis may impact Bufo and Hyla directly by reducing life-history performance and increasing developmental instability, and indirectly by inducing interspecific competitive effects in mixed-species environments.","Univ Memphis, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Parris, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",mparris@memphis.edu,,,,,,79,117,120,2,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2004,85,12,,,,,3385,3395,,10.1890/04-0383,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,887HV,WOS:000226297500019,,,,,2021-09-27,

In this study, we simplified the community assemblage to reduce interspecific competition and gain a better understanding of the role biotic conditions play in creating Yellow Perch fisheries. Yellow Perch were introduced into three recently renovated lakes in an attempt to increase growth rates through reduced interspecific competition and hypothetically allow fish to reach an acceptable size for angler harvest in a shorter period of time compared with four mixed-species lakes. Yellow Perch-only populations exhibited faster growth, potentially resulting from reduced interspecific competition, increased piscivory, and lower levels of activity. Yellow Perch-only populations also had more consistent recruitment, onset of maturation at age 1, and an earlier onset of sexual size dimorphism compared with mixed-species lakes and published literature. While limitations of density dependence were noted, natural resource managers are encouraged to investigate methods that would capitalize on the improved population dynamics of Yellow Perch-only lakes and the release from biotic controls.","[Munter, R.

Such nonlethal predator effects have been abundantly demonstrated empirically in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. But the extent to which changes in species traits alter short-term responses such as growth rate or probability of survival is not clear. Here we develop models to examine the nonlethal effects of predators on prey growth. Our analyses illustrate how the nonlethal effects of predators on individual prey growth depend on environmental context; e.g., factors such as focal species density, competitor density, resource dynamics, and the timescale over which the interactions occur. This context dependence arises because of complex interactions of three mechanisms; (1) the direct negative effect of induced reduction in foraging rates, which is opposed by (2) the potential positive effects of reductions in intra- and interspecific competition, and (3) resource responses to reduced foraging. We present new empirical work, and review previous work, on larval-anuran growth that is in general support of model predictions. The framework presented here can serve to facilitate the design and interpretation of experimental results and predict how the nonlethal predator effect on prey growth in natural systems will vary over time and space.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Peacor, SD (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",peacor@msu.edu,,,,,,49,36,37,0,15,SCIENCE FROM ISRAEL-DIVISION OF LASER PAGES PUBL LTD,JERUSALEM,"PO BOX 34299, JERUSALEM 91341, ISRAEL",0021-2210,,,ISR J ZOOL,Isr.

Gall-makers that induce small galls are vulnerable to the attack of Eurytoma gigantea. This imposes upward directional selection on gall size. Insectivorous birds, predominantly the downy woodpecker, are more likely to attack larvae that induce large galls than small ones, and this imposes downward directional selection. We used path analysis to explore the relative contributions of these natural enemies to the net directional selection on gall size. The path models further examined several ecological factors that influence selection intensity through their effects on parasitoid and bird attack rates. Net directional selection varied more strongly with E. gigantea attack than bird attack. Competitive interactions among birds and the three parasitoid species, including E. gigantea, were evidenced by low winter bird attack rates in fields where a high proportion of galls contained the overwintering parasitoids. Eurytoma gigantea attack was heavier in fields where mean gall size was small and bird attack heavier in fields where mean gall size was large. Neither birds nor E. gigantea showed simple density-dependent attack.

The ratio of predator to prey body mass influences the predator's functional response (how consumption varies with prey density), and therefore, the strength and stability of the predator-prey interaction. The persistence of food chains is maximized when prey species arc neither too big nor too small relative to their predator. Nonetheless, we do not know if (i) food web persistence requires that all predator-prey body mass ratios are intermediate, nor (ii) if this constraint depends on prey diversity. We experimentally quantified the functional response for a single predator consuming prey species of different body masses. We used the resultant allometric functional response to parametrize a food web model. We found that predator persistence was maximized when the minimum prey size in the community was intermediate, but as prey diversity increased, the minimum body size could take a broader range of values. This last result occurs because of Jensen's inequality: the average handling time for multiple prey of different sizes is higher than the handling time of the average sized prey. Our results demonstrate that prey diversity mediates how differences between predators and prey in body mass determine food web stability.","[Guzman, Laura Melissa; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Guzman, Laura Melissa; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Guzman, LM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.; Guzman, LM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",guzman@zoology.ubc.ca,,"Srivastava, Diane/0000-0003-4541-5595",NSERC CGS-D FellowshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC Discovery GrantsNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); UBC Four Year Fellowship,L.M.G. is supported by NSERC CGS-D and UBC Four Year Fellowships.

Two nonexclusive assumptions can be made: an increase in cottontail abundance would lead to a larger fox population, magnifying their predatory impact (hyperpredation) on hares; alternatively, cottontails attract foxes in patches where they live, which are also important resting sites for hares and consequently the increased presence of foxes results in a higher predation rates on hares.

Its age makes it a key site for studying the behavior of the early hominin groups of the Iberian Peninsula and western Europe and the ecological context in which they developed. At La Mina locality, three archaeostratigraphic levels have been identified, with level 2 being the richest in terms of the archaeological remains recovered. It exhibits high taxonomic diversity, with the most common taxa belonging to open and partially open habitats, although aquatic and riparian taxa have also been identified. Carnivore remains are present, although scarce. Coprolites from a hyaenid have also been found. Both hominin and carnivore activity has been documented at the site. Evidence of carnivore activity suggests at least one bone-cracking carnivore had access to the assemblage. The anatomical ratios employed suggest that La Mina was formed at a time of high competition (intra and/or inter-specific), with a high number of predators in this ecological context.

These species periodically reach outbreak densities, but it is unknown if they impact the population dynamics of later developing egg-overwintering grasshopper species. Two experiments were conducted in a northern mixed-grass prairie to examine the effects of herbivory by nymph-overwintering grasshoppers on survival of an egg-overwintering grasshopper, Ageneotettix deorum. When very high densities of nymph-overwintering grasshoppers reduced grass biomass by 80%, survival of A. deorum nymphs was significantly reduced. There was no effect of early season herbivory at a lower density of 16/m(2) on survival of A. deorum nymphs. The effects of early season herbivory appear consistent with exploitative competition. Although a strong reduction in peak grass biomass caused by early season herbivory negatively affected late season grass-feeding grasshopper densities, additional research is needed to examine the potential importance of early summer herbivory on population dynamics of later developing grasshoppers.","ARS, USDA, No Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Branson, DH (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, No Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA.",dave.branson@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,28,4,5,0,10,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,ANNAPOLIS,"3 PARK PLACE, STE 307, ANNAPOLIS, MD 21401-3722 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

However, its populations have significantly declined in recent decades, principally as the result of agricultural intensification on arable land. Its abundance has also undergone a significant decline in forested areas over the last few decades, where wild ungulate management and abundance have increased. In this scenario, we aimed to test the factors that affect red-legged partridge abundance in relation to high wild ungulate (wild boar and red deer) abundance in south-central Spain. The factors included as predictors were carnivore, wild boar and red deer abundances, vegetation features, nest predation rate and invertebrate availability. Red deer abundance showed a negative relationship with partridge abundance in spring (non-significant negative trends were also evident for carnivore and wild boar), whereas variables related to food availability (grass biomass, Hemipteran abundance and total invertebrate mass) had a positive effect in the same season. Moreover, deer and carnivore abundances and spring nest predation rate were negatively associated with partridge abundance in autumn. Plant biomass and Hemipteran abundance were negatively correlated with wild boar abundance, whereas maximum pasture height was negatively related to red deer and wild boar abundance. Overall, our results show that high ungulate densities may negatively affect partridge abundance, which may be mediated by (i) a reduction in food availability (invertebrate and herbaceous plant biomass) and (ii) nest predation by wild boar. This research has shown that current intensive big-game hunting management schemes in south-central Spain are often incompatible with red-legged partridge conservation, and that these effects should be taken into account when defining big-game management and conservation policies.","[Carpio, A.

Habitat preferences of organisms can therefore play a large role in determining the severity of interactions such as competition or predation. Previous laboratory studies have shown that the introduced mussel species Perna viridis can decrease the settlement and early survival of the native oyster species Crassostrea virginica. Both species can often be found in the same general areas, but it is unknown whether this habitat overlap is complete, or whether there are certain locations that may act as refuges for native bivalve species. The present study investigated the settlement patterns of the introduced P. viridis and two groups of native bivalves, oysters (C. virginica and Ostrea equestris) and mussels (Ischadium recurvum, Brachidontes exustus and Geukensia demissa), to determine whether preferential settlement depths and habitats differed among the groups. Most of these groups showed significantly greater settlement on deeper substrates that were located in the main channel of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway of northeast Florida. While native oysters also settled in adjacent feeder creeks in fairly large numbers, settlement of P. viridis in these areas was relatively rare. In main channel locations, the overlap in settlement depth is likely to result in competition between introduced and native bivalve species, but feeder creeks may provide areas of refuge for native oysters. The spatial and temporal overlap of all three groups suggests that competition among nonnative and native bivalves may occur in nature.","[Raabe, Jennifer M.; Gilg, Matthew R.] Univ North Florida, Dept Biol, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Raabe, Jennifer M.] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, 410 E St Mary Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70503 USA","Gilg, MR (corresponding author), Univ North Florida, Dept Biol, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",mgilg@unf.edu,,,University of North Florida (UNF) Graduate School; UNF Coastal Biology Program,"We would like to thank the University of North Florida (UNF) Graduate School and the UNF Coastal Biology Program for providing funding for this research.

One important factor driving the degree of interspecific territoriality is competition for resources. Other influential factors are, for instance, population density, phylogenetic relatedness, fighting asymmetries, and shared predation. Although the degree of competition is usually a composite of several factors potentially influencing competition, it is possible to determine the degree of competition without knowing all influential factors and their importance. In line with this, we used the strength of behavioural interactions between species under standardized experimental conditions. In particular, we investigated the degree of interspecific competition using the territorial song of male Eurasian Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) as a low-risk response variable and the crossing flights and nearest approach distance to an intruder as high-risk defence behaviours. To simulate an interspecific intruder, we used male song playbacks of phylogenetic-related and more or less coexisting species. In line with our predictions, we found territorial defence to be most intense against conspecifics (positive control) and virtually non-existent against the allopatric Subalpine Warblers (S. cantillans) (negative control). In terms of the defence reaction to sympatric interspecific intruders, the response seemed strongest in relation to the Garden Warbler (S. borin) and weakest in relation to the Barred Warbler (S. nisoria). Our results further show that the vegetation characteristics of a territory influence behavioural responses to intruders, but only in relation to low-risk defence.","[Darolova, Alzbeta; Kristofik, Jan] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia; [Knauer, Felix] Univ Vet Med, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Savoyenstr 1, A-1160 Vienna, Austria; [Hoi, Herbert] Univ Vet Med, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Savoyenstr 1a, A-1160 Vienna, Austria","Darolova, A (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia.",alzbeta.darolova@savba.sk,,,"Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA)Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA) [2/0097/16]","This study was funded by Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA Grant Nr. 2/0097/16).",,59,3,3,3,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Early theory predicted that omnivory would decrease the probability of food webs being stable. While early empirical data appeared to support the prediction that omnivory should be rare, detailed study of food webs later revealed that omnivory is ubiquitous across ecosystems and taxa. Recent years have seen renewed interest in the omnivory-stability debate, and advances in mechanistic non-equilibrium models demonstrated that omnivory can both increase and decrease stability. Current efforts have therefore focused on identifying biological mechanisms that promote the persistence of food webs with omnivory. We synthesize recent evidence that omnivory often stabilizes food webs when it occurs as life-history omnivory, when prey experience reduced predation rates due to refuges or adaptive antipredator defences, and when omnivores interfere with each other or feed adaptively. Empirical research has lagged behind theory and there remains a shortage of studies directly measuring the stability of diverse natural communities that vary in the number and strength of omnivorous interactions. Early microcosm experiments indicated a narrow range of conditions for the persistence of simple omnivorous modules, while studies of omnivory embedded within larger natural networks have demonstrated its stabilizing effects. These new findings alter our view of food web dynamics and show that rather than looking for a simple and general omnivory-stability relationship, we should focus on identifying conditions under which omnivory is a stabilizing feature of more complex natural systems.","[Kratina, Pavel; LeCraw, Robin M.; Ingram, Travis] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Kratina, Pavel; LeCraw, Robin M.; Ingram, Travis] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Zool, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ingram, Travis] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Anholt, Bradley R.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada","Kratina, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Watershed Sci Ctr, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",pkratina@ucdavis.edu,"Kratina, Pavel/O-5192-2019","Kratina, Pavel/0000-0002-9144-7937",Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"This research was funded by the Canada Research Chairs Program to B.R.A. and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada to P.K., R.M.L, T.I. and B.R.A.",,139,68,71,1,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,JUN,2012,3,6,,,,,,,50,10.1890/ES12-00121.1,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,256IC,WOS:000327302000004,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-09-27,

Densities of rainbow smelt cohorts alternated during the 2-year study; age-0 rainbow smelt were very abundant in 2001 (up to 6 fish per m(2)) and age-1 and older were abundant (up to 1.2 fish per m(2)) in 2002. Growth rates and densities varied among areas and years. We used model selection on eight area-year-specific variables to investigate biologically plausible predictors of rainbow smelt growth rates. The best supported model of growth rates of age-0 smelt indicated a negative relationship with age-0 density, likely associated with intraspecific competition for zooplankton. The next best-fit model had age-1 density as a predictor of age-0 growth. The best supported models (N = 4) of growth rates of age-1 fish indicated a positive relationship with availability of age-0 smelt and resulting levels of cannibalism. Other plausible models were contained variants of these parameters. Cannibalistic rainbow smelt consumed younger conspecifics that were up to 53% of their length. Prediction of population dynamics for rainbow smelt requires an understanding of the relationship between density and growth as age-0 fish outgrow their main predators (adult smelt) by autumn in years with fast growth rates, but not in years with slow growth rates.","[Parrish, Donna L.] Univ Vermont, US Geol Survey, Vermont Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Parker-Stetter, Sandra L.; Rudstam, Lars G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Biol Field Stn, Bridgeport, NY USA; [Sullivan, Patrick J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Parrish, DL (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, US Geol Survey, Vermont Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Dparrish@uvm.edu,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of CommerceNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA16RG2206]; U.S. Geological Survey, Vermont Department of Fish and WildlifeUnited States Geological Survey; University of Vermont; Wildlife Management Institute","We thank the crews of the University of Vermont R/V Melosira and Vermont Fish andWildlife's Dore and many others: Kristian Omland, Marc Eisenhower, Gary Nelson, Heidi Keller, Peter Hyde, Pete Meier, Jesse Wheeler, Eric Symmes, Irene Chan, Steve Midway, Isaiah Gratton, Richard Balouskus, Martha Mather, and Alexander Zale.

Here, we present a first quantification of the interaction structure of a herbivore-centered food web from the High Arctic. Targeting the Lepidoptera of Northeast Greenland, we introduce generalized overlap indices as a novel tool for comparing different types of indirect interactions. First, we quantify the scope for top-down-up interactions as the probability that a herbivore attacking plant species i itself fed as a larva on species j. Second, we gauge this herbivore overlap against the potential for bottom-up-down interactions, quantified as the probability that a parasitoid attacking herbivore species i itself developed as a larva on species j. Third, we assess the impact of interactions with other food web modules, by extending the core web around the key herbivore Sympistis nigrita to other predator guilds (birds and spiders). We find the host specificity of both herbivores and parasitoids to be variable, with broad generalists occurring in both trophic layers. Indirect links through shared resources and through shared natural enemies both emerge as forces with a potential for shaping the herbivore community. The structure of the host-parasitoid submodule of the food web suggests scope for classic apparent competition. Yet, based on predation experiments, we estimate that birds kill as many (8%) larvae of S. nigrita as do parasitoids (8%), and that spiders kill many more (38%). Interactions between these predator guilds may result in further complexities.

In addition to these food-web elements, we monitored ground-surface arthropods; they are expected to be affected directly; as well as indirectly via A. sagrei, by L. carinatus. Five islands were randomly selected for invasion while six others served as controls. In addition, four islands without A. sagrei were monitored to determine the natural state of the sagrei-free food web. We also monitored a variety of A. sagrei's traits, from behavioral through physiological and demographic to morphological, to elucidate the mechanisms whereby L. carinatus might affect the smaller lizard and to evaluate trait-mediated as well as density-mediated effects. Comparison of unmanipulated islands with and without A. sagrei showed that A. sagrei appeared to be affecting web-spider density and diversity, numbers of small aerial arthropods, number of large ground-surface arthropods, and two types of leaf damage, scars and mines. All effects were negative save one: Small aerial arthropods were more abundant with A. sagrei; this variable and parasitoid abundance were negatively related to web-spider density, implicating an indirect effect pathway from A. sagrei via web spiders. Introduction of L. carinatus had major and immediate effects on A. sagrei density and perch height; effects on perch diameter, percentage hatchlings, and the width of the body,size distribution followed over time. Behavioral shifts in habitat use continued to the end of the experiment, after changes in population density had mostly leveled off. Adult-male body condition became poorer after introduction of L. carinatus. Among islands, percentage use of the ground was correlated negatively with percentage vegetated area of the island and positively with premanipulation relative hindlimb length. We hypothesize that longer-legged individuals do better on the ground because they are faster there. Conditional evidence for an increase in adult-male relative hindlimb length suggested that, when the ground-inhabiting L. carinatus was introduced, such individuals were differentially able to escape predation. Introduction of L. carinatus significantly reversed A. sagrei's effect on number of species and density of web, spiders but had no other major effects on lower level food-web elements. Thus, a relatively short-chained (two links) effect, with a relatively strong second link (A. sagrei on spiders), showed the greatest indirect effect of the manipulation. Another potentially strong indirect effect, that on large ground-surface arthropods, did not occur, possibly because of compensatory (direct) predation by L. carinatus. Thus presence of omnivory may also be relevant to whether reversal of effects occurs. Although most A. sagrei effects were not reversed in the time available for the experiment, this may be typical, as natural L. carinatus colonizations can dwindle away to extinction over about the same time span, producing at best only short-term indirect effects. Population-density estimates from other sites and comparisons to other experimental studies suggest that, in general, predators on Anolis may have erratic effects in space and time.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Schoener, TW (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,105,61,71,1,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Colonisation is a critical process driving the abundances and diversity of species in spatially discrete communities. Although patch size and patch quality are well known as determinants of post-colonisation species richness and abundance, less is known about how patch size affects colonisation. 2. Patch size and quality may not be independent, so assessment of potential interactions is necessary for understanding patterns of species abundance in natural systems. In freshwater systems, presence and identity of predators is a dominant determinant of patch quality, with larger habitat patches often supporting larger and more diverse predator assemblages. 3. To examine potential interactions, we manipulated patch size and quality (fish presence/absence) using naturally colonised experimental landscapes and assayed oviposition by Culex mosquitoes. 4. Culex restuans selected patches that were smaller, did not contain fish, and had higher temperatures. We demonstrate that patch size, along with patch quality, can generate patterns of abundance at the colonisation stage that are contradictory to traditional patch size-based models of species distributions.","[Bohenek, Jason R.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, Oxford, MS 38677 USA; [Bohenek, Jason R.] Univ Mississippi, Ctr Water & Wetland Resources, Oxford, MS 38677 USA","Bohenek, JR (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, Oxford, MS 38677 USA.; Bohenek, JR (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Ctr Water & Wetland Resources, Oxford, MS 38677 USA.",jason.bohenek@gmail.com,"Pintar, Matthew/AAP-1876-2020; Bohenek, Jason/D-7613-2013","Pintar, Matthew/0000-0003-0165-3882; Bohenek, Jason/0000-0001-9171-302X; Breech, Tyler/0000-0002-7118-0606",Grace Doherty Foundation; University of Mississippi,"We would like to thank the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation and the University of Mississippi for support, and the University of Mississippi Field Station for facilities and natural environments.

Using aphids as model organism, we tested the hypothesis that herbivore abundance increases in fragmented habitats Lis a result Of reduced predator and parasitoid densities. In a 3 year-study, we examined the population dynamics of aphids with respect to host plant abundance and ant nest density in experimentally fragmented calcareous grasslands at two sites in the northern Jura mountains. Fragments of different size (area: 20.25 m(2). 2.25 m(2) and 0.25 m(2)) were isolated by a 5 in wide strip of frequently mown vegetation and corresponding control plots were situated in the adjacent undisturbed grassland. Aphid density was higher in fragments than in control plots. This was a combined result of a higher frequency of aphid-infested plants and larger aphid colonies in fragments than in control plots. Furthermore, a larger proportion of aphid colonies was ant-attended in fragments than in control plots. Aphid colonies were also more frequently visited by ants in fragments than in control plots in one of the 3 years. Parasitoid pressure on aphids was not influenced by the experimental fragmentation. Neither were aphid species richness and diversity affected by the fragmentation. Our study shows that even small-scale habitat fragmentation can have profound effects on the abundance of herbivorous insects. The effect on aphid density was consistent over 3 years and two sites with slightly different aphid communities.","Univ Basel, Dept Integrat Biol, NLU, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; Univ Fribourg, Inst Zool, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland","Braschler, B (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Dept Integrat Biol, NLU, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",brigitte.braschler@unibas.ch,"Braschler, Brigitte/N-6953-2017","Braschler, Brigitte/0000-0003-0088-3651",,,,48,28,31,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2003,100,3,,,,,581,591,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12220.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,662TD,WOS:000181963700018,,,,,2021-09-27,

Because there have been limited studies to determine how snakes regulate prey populations, and because Kingsnake declines may result in ecosystem impacts, we evaluated the hypothesis that Kingsnakes regulate the abundance of one of their prey, the venomous Copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix). We generated a database of captures of the two species across the southeastern United States and, while controlling for large-scale habitat preferences, identified a negative relationship between the relative abundance of Kingsnakes and the relative abundance of Copperheads. Our results are correlative but consistent with the hypothesis that Copperhead populations experience a release from predation pressure where Kingsnake abundances are low. We suggest that Kingsnake declines, which are occurring for unknown reasons, are having ecological effects in affected ecosystems. We further highlight the potential role that snakes play in influencing the population dynamics of their prey.","[Steen, David A.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [McClure, Christopher J.

The model parameters were estimated from field data, with the exception of three parameters, for which a range of plausible values was selected. Most parameter combinations generated high-amplitude, chaotic oscillations with a distinct periodic component; the median parameter values predicted dynamics closely resembling the observed 3-5 yr rodent oscillations in northern Fennoscandia. The results were not sensitive to a number of structural changes in the model, suggested by empirical observations: stochastic variation in the prey-carrying capacity, predator refuge at low density, predation on mustelids by large generalist predators in the years when rodents decline, and an alternative assumption about winter breeding in rodents. The model-predicted period and amplitude of oscillations agreed most closely with observations when the model included a low-density refuge for the mustelids. Another predator-prey model with ratio-dependent functional response did not predict dynamics resembling the observed dynamics. The present results provide further support to the hypothesis that the rodent oscillations are maintained by delayed density dependence imposed by specialist predators. Our results also suggest that the dynamics may be chaotic, with a periodic component, rather than a limit cycle with environmental stochasticity.","UNIV TURKU,DEPT BIOL,ECOL ZOOL LAB,SF-20500 TURKU,FINLAND","HANSKI, I (corresponding author), HELSINKI UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DIV ECOL,POB 17,P RAUTATIEKATU 13,SF-00014 HELSINKI,FINLAND.",,,,,,,55,138,139,2,45,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1995,76,3,,,,,840,850,,10.2307/1939349,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QU358,WOS:A1995QU35800014,,,,,2021-09-27,

We measured the extent to which the diets of barn owls (Tyto alba) and long-eared owls (Asio otus) in Israel overlap and examined whether yearly differences in diet overlap correlate with barn owl breeding success. Pianka's index of niche overlap was positively related to barn owl population size but not to its breeding success. The number of breeding barn owls was higher when long-eared owls consumed more rodents, suggesting that diet overlap most likely increased when rodents became more abundant. Therefore, in Israel, when these two owl species prey more often on rodents, their diets are more similar and interspecific competition is reduced. Unlike sympatric populations in Europe, in years when rodents are less abundant in Israel long-eared owls switch to hunting alternative prey (e.g., birds), perhaps to avoid competition with barn owls.","[Charter, Motti] Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, IL-1290000 Katzrin, Israel; [Izhaki, Ido] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Roulin, Alexandre] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Charter, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, IL-1290000 Katzrin, Israel.",chartermotti@gmail.com,"Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019; Charter, Motti/AAQ-9529-2021","Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683; Charter, Motti/0000-0003-3861-6356",Israel Hoopoe Foundation; Society for the Protection of Nature Israel; Israel Ministry of Agriculture; Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection; Addax and Oryx Foundation; University of Haifa; Minerva Center for Movement Ecology; Israel Meteorological Center for weather data,"We thank Maria Novoslov, Yuval Cohen, Tomer Chen, Inbal Segev, Hadas Sela for pellet cleaning, Kobi Meyrom for field assistance and Simon Birrer and Andrew Wolfenden for comments on the paper.

Although Escherichia coli is an important indicator of waterborne pathogens, the effects of environmental stressors on its survival in aquatic environments remain poorly understood. We manipulated organic nutrient, predation, and competition levels in outdoor microcosms containing natural river water, sediments, and microbial populations to determine their relative contribution to E. coli survival. The activities of predator (protozoa) and competitor (indigenous bacteria) populations were inhibited by adding cycloheximide or kanamycin. We developed a statistical model of E. coli density over time that fits with the data under all experimental conditions. Predation and competition had significant negative effects on E. coli survival, while higher nutrient levels increased survival. Among the main effects, predation accounted for the greatest variation (40 %) compared with nutrients (25 %) or competition (15 %). The highest nutrient level mitigated the effect of predation on E. coli survival. Thus, elevated organic nutrients may disproportionately enhance the survival of E. coli, and potentially that of other enteric bacteria, in aquatic habitats.","[Wanjugi, P.; Fox, G. A.; Harwood, V.

However in laboratory experiments - also those on crab-bivalve systems - workers never adequately disentangled interference competition from exploitative competition, as prey depletion was never compensated. Hitherto, experimental studies on crab-bivalve systems lack direct behavioural observations and have provided only indirect and thus inconclusive evidence of interference competition. We studied interference competition in adult male shore crabs Carcinus maenas that foraged on blue mussels Mytilus edulis. We developed a novel type of experimental tank to replenish each consumed mussel, and thus to keep prey levels constant. We conducted two experiments in which we varied number of crabs (1, 2, 4) and number of mussels (first experiment: 4, 8, 16, 32; second experiment: 8, 32, 128) and directly observed the foraging behaviour of crabs (foraging area=0.25 m(2)). In the first experiment, feeding rates decreased with increasing crab density only at mussel density 16 because both search time and time spent in agonistic interactions increased. At other mussel densities, variation in crab density did not affect feeding rates, possibly because of low statistical power and the narrow range of mussel densities offered. In the second experiment feeding rates decreased with increasing crab density because crabs spent more time in agonistic interactions and handling their prey. Feeding rates increased with increasing mussel density. Overall, crabs spent on average 14-18% of their foraging time in agonistic behaviours, while on three out of 64 occasions feeding rates decreased because mussels were stolen (kleptoparasitism). Concluding, we have shown that interference competition occurs in absence of prey depletion, while conducting direct behavioural observations aid to identify the behavioural processes that underlie interference competition.","Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NIOZ, Dept Marine Ecol & Evolut, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands","Smallegange, IM (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NIOZ, Dept Marine Ecol & Evolut, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands.",isabel@nioz.nl,"Kurvers, Ralf/Q-8830-2017; Smallegange, Isabel M./A-8198-2010; van der Meer, Jaap/C-6687-2011","Kurvers, Ralf/0000-0002-3460-0392; Smallegange, Isabel M./0000-0001-6218-7358; ",,,,36,58,59,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2006,113,1,,,,,157,167,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.14172.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,013OK,WOS:000235418400015,,,,,2021-09-27,

The reduction in the number of A. gundlachi resulted in a significant increase in the abundance of both adult and juvenile A. evermanni. We found no evidence for a, shift in structural habitat use in A. evermanni in experimental plots. Two possible mechanisms, interspecific competition and intraguild predation, could explain the increase in abundance of A. evermanni after the removal of A. gundlachi.

Interference competition in a wild population of European blackbirds was examined by comparing the feeding rates of individual birds feeding alone and with the addition of a competitor within small, experimental feeding patches. 2. Blackbirds showed type II functional responses. There was a highly significant decrease in feeding rate on addition of a competing individual to a patch: average declines in feeding rates of an individual on addition of a competitor, where nearest neighbour distance was always less than about 5 m, were between 16% and 43% of the feeding rate of a lone individual. 3. The decline in feeding rate was similar whether the individuals interacted aggressively or apparently ignored each other during feeding. When patch size was doubled, the effects on feeding rate of adding a single competitor remained similar. The high levels of interference recorded may therefore have been mainly a consequence of active rather than passive interference competition. 4. The results suggest that the costs to an individual blackbird of monitoring other individuals within a group in order to avoid interactions may be sufficiently high to counter any benefits of group feeding, such as vigilance benefits.",,"Cresswell, W (corresponding author), IBLS, DIV ENVIRONM & EVOLUT BIOL, APPL ORNITHOL UNIT, GRAHAM KERR BLDG, GLASGOW G12 8QQ, LANARK, SCOTLAND.",,"Cresswell, Will/B-1472-2013","Cresswell, Will/0000-0002-4684-7624",,,,48,68,69,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

However, group size alone will not always reliably determine the optimal level of vigilance. For example, variation in predation risk or food quality between patches may also be influential. In a field setting, we assessed how simultaneous variation in predation risk and intake rate affects the relationship between vigilance and group size in foraging Ruddy Turnstones Arenaria interpres. We compared vigilance, measured as the number of head-ups' per unit time, in habitat types that differed greatly in prey energy content and proximity to cover from which predators could launch surprise attacks. Habitats closer to predator cover provided foragers with much higher potential net energy intake rates than habitats further from cover. Foragers formed larger and denser flocks on habitats closer to cover. Individual vigilance of foragers in all habitats declined with increasing flock size and increased with flock density. However, vigilance by foragers on habitats closer to cover was always higher for a given flock size than vigilance by foragers on habitats further from cover, and habitat remained an important predictor of vigilance in models including a range of potential confounding variables. Our results suggest that foraging Ruddy Turnstones can simultaneously assess information on group size and the general likelihood of predator attack when determining their vigilance contribution.","[Fuller, Richard A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Fuller, Richard A.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bearhop, Stuart] Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Metcalfe, Neil B.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Piersma, Theunis] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Ecol, Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Piersma, Theunis] Univ Groningen, Anim Ecol Grp, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Groningen, Netherlands","Fuller, RA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",r.a.fuller@dunelm.org.uk,"Piersma, Theunis/D-1871-2012; Bearhop, Stuart/G-3105-2012; Metcalfe, Neil B./C-5997-2009; Fuller, Richard/B-7971-2008","Bearhop, Stuart/0000-0002-5864-0129; Metcalfe, Neil B./0000-0002-1970-9349; Fuller, Richard/0000-0001-9468-9678; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",Environment Programme of Northumbrian Water plc,"This work was funded through the Environment Programme of Northumbrian Water plc through a grant to Peter R.

Recordings of pairwise interactions between males showed that calls were highly synchronized, with individual calls interdigitating with each other. Males frequently switched between the leader and follower role with neither male dominating the interaction. Interactive playback experiments using synthetic calls revealed that males slightly but significantly increased the number of calls per call group with increases in stimulus call number. Males also significantly increased call rate with the number of calls in the playback stimulus. Furthermore, when presented with shortened intercall intervals, males increased their own intercall intervals, thus 'skipping' a call and avoiding overlap with the playback. The low degree of call matching suggests that repetitive calling, apart from maintaining a male's attractiveness to females relative to rival males, may mediate male-male competition. In addition, synchronized interdigitated calling may serve to reduce predation, while maintaining species-specific temporal features of advertisement calls important to females. Kuvangu running frogs may have reduced the costs associated with synchrony and alternation by using a signal timing scheme that allows them to do both simultaneously.

In European tomato greenhouses, the invasive alien pest Tuta absoluta may impact the population dynamics of other pests like whiteflies. Besides inducing damages to the host plant and competing for resources with local pests, this alien species may exert a predator-mediated interaction on local pests sharing common natural enemies. Biocontrol agents usually used against whiteflies may also prey upon T. absoluta and this could alter the dynamics of local pest populations. We evaluated possible resource competition and predator-mediated interactions in a system involving one mirid predator Macrolophus pygmaeus and two pests, T. absoluta and a local whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, on greenhouse tomatoes. Results showed that both resource competition and predator-mediated interactions occurred simultaneously. In the presence of the shared predator, there was a short-term positive effect of T. absoluta on B. tabaci [up to 5.9-fold increase of B. tabaci juveniles (egg + larvae) after four weeks]. However, in the long-term there was a negative predator-mediated interaction of T. absoluta on B. tabaci, i.e., after ten weeks the density of B. tabaci was 7.3-fold lower in the presence of the invasive pest. We emphasize the critical role of generalist predators in managing both local and invasive alien pest populations and that the strength and direction of predator-mediated indirect interactions can depend on the time scale considered.","[Bompard, Anais] Univ Paris 06, Lab Ecol & Evolut, UMR7625, F-75005 Paris, France; [Jaworski, Coline C.] Univ Toulouse UPS, CNRS, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, ENFA,UMR5174, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Bearez, Philippe; Desneux, Nicolas] French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, ISA UMR1355, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France","Desneux, N (corresponding author), French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, ISA UMR1355, 400 Route Chappes, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France.",nicolas.desneux@sophia.inra.fr,"Jaworski, Coline/AAI-2614-2021; Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013","Jaworski, Coline/0000-0002-6136-8656; ",Plant Health and Environment Department of INRA; Environment and Agronomy Department of INRA; French ministry of agriculture (CAS-DAR) [10063],"We thank Antonio Biondi (University of Catania, Italy), George Heimpel, Emily Mohl and James Eckberg (University of Minnesota, USA) for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript, Anais Chailleux, Helene Kazuro and Cecile Thomas for their assistance throughout the experiments and Jacques Frandon (Biotop, InVivo AgroSolutions) for providing some biological materials.

While studying the feeding ecology of these tiger beetles in rice paddy agro-ecosystems in Sringeri area of the central Western Ghats, we examined their potential as biocontrols on the major rice paddy pest populations available in this region. Earthworms and tadpoles were significant prey organisms during the early cultivation period, while other traditional prey organisms like ants and spiders (mainly wolf and jumping spiders) were more common as prey organisms toward the mid-season. The results showed that the feeding fauna of tiger beetles can extend to prey items beyond arthropods, to include vertebrates. Cicindela (Calochroa) duponti Dejean is another common species that occurs abundantly in the Areca orchards and on the bunds that separate rice paddy fields from adjacent uncultivated lands. We performed laboratory tests to determine the feeding guild of these beetles, and to investigate their possible role as a predator of the rice paddy pests. Although preliminary in nature, the results suggest that both C. whithilli and C. flavomaculata are ineffective as biocontrol agents of rice paddy agro-ecosystems. They appear to have only a marginal impact on the larvae of Leptocorisa acuta, a major insect pest of paddy rice, but further experimental and observational studies are needed to firmly establish the significance of this observation.","ATREE, Bangalore 24, Karnataka, India; Univ Calicut, Dept Zool, Calicut, Kerala, India","Sinu, PA (corresponding author), ATREE, 659,5 A Main, Bangalore 24, Karnataka, India.",sinu@atree.org,,"Sinu, Palatty Allesh/0000-0001-7391-7133",,,,30,5,10,0,9,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3606,,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,JUL,2006,38,4,,,,,500,507,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00174.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,050DB,WOS:000238066600007,,,,,2021-09-27,

An attempt is made to rank the three areas of conflict between wildlife and livestock: feeding competition, disease control and predation. Disease survey results reveal the lack of wildlife reservoirs, with the exception of some important problem areas. Research on trypanosomiasis identifies a variety of adaptations evolved in wild Bovidae. The most striking result is the isolation of serum proteins from buffalo with trypanocidal activity against all common species of trypanosomes. The importance of wild Bovidae as reservoir hosts for theileriosis of livestock is discussed. The African buffalo presents the only known reservoir host of economic importance. The use of parasite stocks derived from buffalo has been effective to immunize cattle under field conditions in spite of the presence of an unknown number of antigenic types. The occurrence of common antigens indicated by successful immunization in the field was also confirmed by the recognition of common antigenic epitopes by cloned cytotoxic T cells. These results are encouraging for the plans afoot for large scale immunizations in Kenya. The co-existence of livestock and wildlife is threatened by declining profits and increasing costs for wildlife production and the absence of a general policy to encourage the full economic use of wildlife in areas where it competes with livestock.","INT CTR INSECT PHYSIOL & ECOL,NAIROBI,KENYA",,,,,,,,35,18,18,0,6,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-2176,,,VET QUART,Vet.

The composition and spatiotemporal dynamics of biological communities are influenced by biotic processes, such as predation and competition, but also by physical disturbances, such as floods in running waters. However, the interplay of disturbance with predation is still poorly understood, especially in frequently disturbed streams. Further, different predator species can affect prey communities in different ways depending on their feeding mode and efficiency. 2. We investigated the individual and combined effects of flood-induced bed disturbance and fish predation on the benthos for 4 weeks in 18 streamside channels fed by a flood-prone New Zealand river. Bed movements caused by floods were simulated by tumbling the substratum in half the channels. Six channels each were stocked with introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) or native upland bully (Gobiomorphus breviceps) or had fish excluded. We studied algal biomass and both invertebrate density and daytime activity on surface stones on several dates after the disturbance, invertebrate community composition in the substrata of the entire channels on day 28 and leaf decomposition rates over the 28-day period. 3. Disturbance affected algal biomass and density, richness and activity of surface stone invertebrates, and overall density and richness of channel invertebrates. Presence or absence of fish, by contrast, did not influence overall invertebrate standing stocks when subsurface substrata were included but did affect invertebrate densities on surface stones in 45% of all analysed cases and invertebrate activity on surface stones in all cases. Leaf decomposition rates were not influenced at all by the experimental manipulations. 4. Native upland bullies featured more often than exotic brown trout in causing invertebrate density changes and equally often in causing changes to grazer behaviour. Overall, our results imply that fish predation can have strong effects on the benthic invertebrate community in frequently disturbed streams, especially via behavioural changes.","[Herrmann, Peter B.; Townsend, Colin R.; Matthaei, Christoph D.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Herrmann, PB (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",peterherrmann74@aol.com,"Matthaei, Christoph D./H-8928-2013; Townsend, Colin/AAZ-2027-2020",,,,,36,7,7,0,72,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

In the Baltic Sea, recently observed increases in their population densities have been attributed to declines of piscivorous predators. Concurrent with this predator release, an alternative hypothesis is that past and present consumption rates and resource limitation thresholds may have contributed to the recent increases in stickleback abundance. To evaluate this hypothesis, we estimated the size- and temperature-dependent attack rate and the critical resource density (CRD) of three-spined sticklebacks. We incorporated laboratory results with time series of zooplankton abundance to estimate historical trends in degrees of resource limitation in sticklebacks and evaluate if increases in individual consumption rates could be a plausible mechanism facilitating the suggested population increase. Attack rates increased with body size and temperature in laboratory experiments. Estimated CRD increased with size but decreased with temperature, suggesting that stickleback scope for individual and population growth might increase at temperatures above 15 degrees C. Our results further suggest that sticklebacks have been living closer to maximum consumption capacity in the coastal areas of the Bothnian Sea (BS) and Bothnian Bay (BB). Moreover, decreasing levels of resource limitation in the corresponding off-shore zones may have facilitated increases in stickleback densities for these areas. However, in the coastal zones of the Baltic proper (BP), resource levels have declined and are approaching the CRD, suggesting that stickleback populations in BP may not increase further. The decrease in CRD with temperature implies that increasing summer temperatures will increase the scope of individual and population growth in the three-spined stickleback and may favor the three-spined stickleback's competitive ability over other species under a warmer climate.

Although heterogeneity in shelter availability obscured the underlying patterns of density dependence in different ways, the combination of habitat and its interaction with density were two to six times more important than density alone in explaining variation in demographic parameters for juveniles.

Although the rates of cannibalism can vary from one group to another, studies indicate that the main factors contributing to an increase in the frequency of such behavior are the availability of food, population density, the behavior and availability of victims, and environmental stress. We carried out different laboratory experiments to assess whether different factors such as the presence or absence of food among siblings and non-siblings, and at different densities among conspecific and heterospecific individuals, affect longevity of recently emerged Brazilian brown recluse (Loxosceles intermedia Mello-Leitao, 1934) and Chilean recluse (Loxosceles laeta (Nicolet, 1849)) spiderlings during periods of starvation. The results revealed that the survivor-ship of L. laeta during starvation was significantly higher than that of L. intermedia and that the addition of conspecific individuals increased survival rates by 1.5- and 1.6-fold, respectively. The tolerance of conspecifics differed between the two species, and generally, cannibalism was not observed, probably due to the risk of predation and limited consumption by weakened spiders, which coincided with the continued availability of endogenous vitelline reserves, thus indicating that the use of these spiderlings as a food resource may act to regulate starvation in more resistant spiders. The greater longevity and conspecific tolerance of L. laeta may be important factors contributing to the establishment of large populations of this spider in restricted areas, whereas for L. intermedia, hunger probably functions as a trigger for dispersal.","[Fischer, Marta Luciane] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Sch Life Sci, R Imaculada Conceicao 1155, BR-80215182 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Parolin, Lays Cherobim] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Sch Educ & Humanities, R Imaculada Conceicao 1155, BR-80215182 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Neves, Felipe Marcel] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Zool, R Imaculada Conceicao 1155, BR-80215182 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Villanueva-Bonilla, German Antonio; Vasconellos-Neto, Joao] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Anim Biol, BR-13083854 Campinas, SP, Brazil","Fischer, ML (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Sch Life Sci, R Imaculada Conceicao 1155, BR-80215182 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",marta.fischer@pucpr.br,,,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88887.136354/2017-00],This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) (Finance Code 88887.136354/2017-00 to G.A.V.-B.).,,78,0,0,1,1,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Introducing spatial degrees of freedom and allowing for stochastic fluctuations generically invalidates the classical, deterministic mean-field picture. Already within mean-field theory, however, spatial constraints, modeling locally limited resources, lead to the emergence of a continuous active-to-absorbing state phase transition. Field-theoretic arguments, supported by Monte Carlo simulation results, indicate that this transition, which represents an extinction threshold for the predator population, is governed by the directed percolation universality class. In the active state, where predators and prey coexist, the classical center singularities with associated population cycles are replaced by either nodes or foci. In the vicinity of the stable nodes, the system is characterized by essentially stationary localized clusters of predators in a sea of prey. Near the stable foci, however, the stochastic lattice Lotka-Volterra system displays complex, correlated spatio-temporal patterns of competing activity fronts. Correspondingly, the population densities in our numerical simulations turn out to oscillate irregularly in time, with amplitudes that tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Yet in finite systems these oscillatory fluctuations are quite persistent, and their features are determined by the intrinsic interaction rates rather than the initial conditions. We emphasize the robustness of this scenario with respect to various model perturbations.","Univ Munich, Dept Phys, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, D-80333 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Dept Phys, Ctr Nanosci, D-80333 Munich, Germany; Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Ctr Stochast Proc Sci & Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Integrated Finance Ltd, New York, NY 10111 USA","Mobilia, M (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Dept Phys, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",mauro.mobilia@physik.lmu.de; igeorgiev@ifltd.com; taubcr@vt.edu,"Mobilia, Mauro/A-7045-2010","Mobilia, Mauro/0000-0002-1424-567X",,,,68,89,90,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-4715,1572-9613,,J STAT PHYS,J.

Having three direct consumer-resource links, three indirect numerical links, and a potential for indirect effects mediated by size structure and/or behavioral flexibility, a three-species omnivory system may exhibit complex population dynamics. In 2 x 3 m field enclosures in the littoral zone of a lake, I manipulated the dominating native benthivorous fish (greater than or equal to 2yr-old perch, Perca fluviatilis, omnivorous top consumer) and the dominating native benthic invertebrate predators (Sialis lutaria, Megaloptera, and odonates, intermediate consumers) in three gradients: increasing densities of perch in the near absence of Sialis and odonates, and increasing densities of Sialis and odonates in either the presence or absence of perch. The densities of their common prey (mainly chironomids) were left unmanipulated. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and size structure, as well as gut contents of perch and Sialis were sampled monthly over a 3-mo summer period. In the absence of perch, the experimental gradient of Sialis densities remained unchanged over time. In the presence of perch, Sialis decreased by about half at high initial densities, but remained unchanged at low initial densities. Perch also had a negative effect on odonates. In the near absence of Sialis and odonates, perch had a strong, negative effect on chironomids. Compared to enclosures without perch, chironomid abundance was strongly reduced at the lowest perch density, but leveled off with further increases in perch density. Sialis and odonates did not affect chironomid abundance when perch were absent. In contrast, chironomid abundance was positively affected by Sialis and odonates when perch were present. The overall effect of perch on chironomid abundance in the presence of Sialis and odonates was negative. The combined predatory and competitive effects of perch on Sialis and odonates raise the issue how Sialis and odonates coexist with perch. The lack of effect of perch on Sialis and chironomids at low densities of these prey suggests that prey refuges contribute significantly to their persistence in natural systems. The indirect positive effect of Sialis and odonates on chironomids indicates density dependence in per capita interaction coefficients and is most likely to be explained by a behavioral response of perch or chironomids to Sialis and odonates. I suggest that the theoretical and empirical investigation of model systems (such as three-component omnivory systems), which are sufficiently simple to be analytically and experimentally tractable, but still display a richness of common indirect effects, will contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of more complex food webs. Their study will benefit from experimental manipulations of more than one population at more than two densities.","UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN",,,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051",,,,78,93,94,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1995,76,6,,,,,1727,1740,,10.2307/1940706,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RQ248,WOS:A1995RQ24800004,,,,,2021-09-27,

Species within assemblages vary largely in body size, abundance, seed treatment and places of seed deposition, with possible delayed consequences for seed dispersal and plant regeneration. The variable outputs of the interaction may be magnified when considering different habitats and diplochoric plants that include more than one agent in subsequent steps of dispersal. Here we compared the contribution of birds and ants to the seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) of two species of Etythroxylum shrubs that grow in Atlantic forest and Cerrado savannas in Brazil. We compared the number of seeds dispersed by each one of 16 bird and 30 ant species and their delayed consequences for seed germination and seedling survival combining experimental and modeling approaches. We observed shifts in the role of different dispersal agents between habitats, with birds being more important in the forest while ants are highlighted in the savanna. Quantity and quality components of SDE were not correlated, but large body size emerged as an important trait driving the quantity (birds) and quality (ants) components of SDE. A high diversified assemblage of dispersal agents does not always result in redundant effects for SDE, with some species consistently providing better dispersal than others and several opportunities for complementary effects. Therefore, even in diversified assemblages operating in diplochoric dispersal systems, there is the opportunity for ecological specialization.","[Camargo, Paulo H. S.

Shaded treatments showed significant reductions in populations of Macoma balthica, Hydrobia ulvae and Corophium volutator, 3 of the dominant species at this site. Largely as a result of changes in the abundance of these species, multivariate analyses showed significant differences between shaded and control communities. The impacts of shading on individual species depended on the sediment characteristics. There were no significant differences between treatments in recorded sediment accretion/erosion rates. These results demonstrate the importance of microphytobenthos for the deposit feeders M, balthica, H. ulvae and C. volutator.

In the early 1980s he became interested in shrew dynamics, energetics, and of course, shrew metapopulations. He aimed at understanding the population biological consequences of body size in different shrew species. Feeding habits and environmental stochasticity affect shrew species in profoundly different ways: due to their short survival time small species have high extinction rates but their dispersal and colonization capacity is high which enables them to survive as metapopulations. After Hansson and Henttonen reported the Fennoscandian gradients in vole dynamics in the mid-1980s, Hanski became interested in vole and lemming cycles. The first models on this were published with Henttonen and Hansson in 1991 where the roles of specialist and generalist predators were assessed. Later, the models were further developed with Korpimaki and Turchin, with model parametrization from Microtus biology and including both specialist mammalian predators as well as avian predators. A special case was the model with Henttonen on competing vole species with a shared predator (apparent competition), which was related to the long-term fading out of vole cycles in Finnish Lapland in the mid-1980s (which though returned in the early 2010s). Later Hanski became interested in the work of Sittler and Gilg in Greenland. Together they modelled the very simple vertebrate community and showed how stoats played a pivotal role in generating a population cycle in the collared lemming. In addition to these specific works, Hanski was leading collaborator in several reviews on small rodent cycles and predation. He intended to return to shrew biology, but that never realized. Hanski was a fearless field biologist, but he always aimed at understanding natural phenomena at more general, theoretical level.","[Henttonen, Heikki] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, POB 2, FI-0790 Helsinki, Finland; [Gilg, Olivier] Grp Rech Ecol Arct, F-21440 Francheville, France; [Gilg, Olivier] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Equipe Ecol Evolut, UMR Biogeosci 6282, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Ims, Rolf A.; Yoccoz, Nigel G.] Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9047 Tromso, Norway; [Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Henttonen, H (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, POB 2, FI-0790 Helsinki, Finland.",,"Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014; GILG, Olivier/C-2588-2008","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; GILG, Olivier/0000-0002-9083-4492",,,,64,4,4,2,25,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,UNIV HELSINKI,"P O BOX 26, FI-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND",0003-455X,1797-2450,,ANN ZOOL FENN,Ann.

We examined low-DO effects on predation by hypoxia-tolerant ctenophores, Mnemiopsis leidyi, on less hypoxia-tolerant ichthyoplankton prey in laboratory experiments. We also examined the relationship between bottom DO concentrations and vertical distributions, and considered potential effects of biotic (predators and competitors) versus abiotic factors (low DO concentration, temperature, salinity, time of day) on vertical habitat overlaps between gelatinous zooplankton and their prey during summer in a Chesapeake Bay subestuary. Laboratory clearance rates of M. leidyi feeding on bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) eggs and yolk sac larvae, and naked goby (Gobiosoma bosc) larvae were as high at low DO (1.5 mg l(-1)) as at high DO concentrations (7 mg l(-1)). Multiple years of field sampling at 2 sites revealed that the proportions of motile species in the bottom layer of the water column, especially fish larvae and copepods, increased with increasing bottom DO concentrations during both day and night. Ctenophore densities remained high in the bottom layer even at low DO concentrations. Vertical habitat overlaps among 4 motile predator-prey pairs (M. leidyi-copepods, M. leidyi-naked goby larvae, bay anchovy larvae-copepods, and naked goby larvae-copepods) increased with increasing bottom DO concentrations (1st- or 2nd-order regression models). Vertical overlap between M. leidyi and fish eggs was significantly higher during the day than at night. Statistical models suggest that both bottom DO concentration and scyphomedusan predators influenced M. leidyi-fish egg nighttime and M. leidyi-copepod combined day-night overlaps. Hypoxia influences food web interactions more through altered habitat use and encounter rates than by directly affecting predation. Strong behavioral responses of larval fish and copepods to low bottom DO concentrations may decrease habitat overlap between M. leidyi predators and their prey.","[Kolesar, Sarah E.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA; [Kolesar, Sarah E.; Breitburg, Denise L.] Acad Nat Sci, Estuarine Res Ctr, St Leonard, MD 20685 USA; [Purcell, Jennifer E.; Decker, Mary Beth] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA","Kolesar, SE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, 307 Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",sarah.kolesar@oregonstate.edu,"Purcell, Jennifer E/E-9991-2011",,US Department of Commerce; NOAA-COPNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; US EPA-STARUnited States Environmental Protection Agency,"We thank W.

To partition costs into components of energy and predation, we converted field measurements of giving-up densities into harvest rates (J min(-1)), used these harvest rates as an estimate of total foraging costs, estimated energetic foraging costs from published physiological measurements of activity and thermoregulatory costs, and assumed that missed opportunity costs were either zero or negative. Our results showed that predation costs predominate. Energetic costs represented only 24%, 19%, 16% and 13% of the foraging costs for Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodornys merriami; Sonoran), the round-tailed ground squirrel (Spermophilus tereticaudus; Sonoran), the greater Egyptian sand gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum; Negev), and Allenby's gerbil (G. allenbyi; Negev), respectively. Equally important were predation-risk differences between bush and open microhabitats; the microhabitat differences in predation cost were often 2-4 times larger than the animals' energetic costs. Seasonal patterns in foraging costs also were predominantly influenced by predation rather than energetic costs. Predation costs appear to be greater in the Negev Desert, but rodents of the Sonoran desert experience greater seasonal and microhabitat variability in predation costs. As a result, predation risk may contribute more towards species coexistence in the community of the Sonoran Desert than that of the Negev Desert.","UNIV NEW MEXICO, DEPT BIOL, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131 USA; BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV, JACOB BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES, MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL, IL-84993 SEDE BOQER, ISRAEL","BROWN, JS (corresponding author), UNIV ILLINOIS, DEPT BIOL SCI, 845 W TAYLOR ST, CHICAGO, IL 60607 USA.",,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Valone, Thomas/0000-0002-7657-3126",,,,39,83,85,0,43,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",0004-959X,1446-5698,,AUST J ZOOL,Aust.

At sites north and south of Cape God, a major faunal and thermal boundary on the east coast of North America, we examined the interacting effects of thermal stress and recruit density on individual survivorship. At hotter southern sites, particularly in bays, high intertidal barnacle survivorship was enhanced by experimental shading or by neighbors which ameliorate heat and desiccation stresses. In contrast, at cooler northern bay and coastal sites, neither shading nor group benefits increased barnacle survival, and mortality patterns were driven primarily by predators with largely boreal distributions. Our field results, like recent laboratory microcosm studies, suggest that predicting even simple community responses to climate change may be more complex than is currently appreciated.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Bertness, MD (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904",,,,36,98,99,0,46,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1999,120,3,,,,,446,450,,,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,233PU,WOS:000082435900014,28308021,,,,2021-09-27,

According to bet-hedging theory, individuals can reduce variation in fitness outcomes by investing in different strategies at the same time. For arthropods, facultative summer diapause enables survival during dry and hot periods of the year, and can be triggered by a decrease in resource abundance. However, the effect of resource depletion on diapause induction has never been disentangled from the effect of the perception of the presence of competitors. Using two solitary parasitoid species of cereal aphids as a model system, Aphidius avenae (Haliday) and Aphidius rhopalosiphi (De Stefani-Perez) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), we tested whether (i) low absolute host density and/or (ii) high levels of parasitoid females' competition lead to maternal-induced summer diapause in parasitoid offspring. Under summer-like climatic conditions, emerging parasitoid females were (i) reared alone and exposed to different host densities (from 5 to 130 aphids), or (ii) reared together with competing females (from 2 to 20 females) and then exposed individually to 50 aphids. For both parasitoid species, low aphid densities did not induce summer diapause. However, the incidence of summer diapause increased up to a maximum of 11% with increasing levels of competition experienced by female parasitoids. More than 60% of the females produced both diapausing and nondiapausing offspring after being kept at the two highest competition densities. Such a spreading-the-risk strategy has likely evolved to optimize parasitoid fitness by preventing the following generation from exposure to low populations of suitable hosts and high mortality from superparasitism. These results provide the first experimental evidence of direct maternal competition-induced diapause in insects, and may change the way we apprehend the evolution of arthropod seasonal ecology, by considering intraspecific competition.","[Tougeron, Kevin; Le Lann, Cecile; van Baaren, Joan] Univ Rennes 1, UMR CNRS Ecobio 6553, 263 Ave Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Tougeron, Kevin; Le Lann, Cecile; van Baaren, Joan] Univ Bretagne Loire, Cit Int, Rennes, France; [Tougeron, Kevin; Hraoui, George; Brodeur, Jacques] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Tougeron, K (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, UMR CNRS Ecobio 6553, 263 Ave Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France.",tougeron.kevin@gmail.com,,"Le Lann, Cecile/0000-0002-3949-4066; Tougeron, Kevin/0000-0003-4897-3787; van baaren, joan/0000-0002-8552-9645",French Region Bretagne; Canada Research Chair in Biological Control; LTER France Zone Atelier Armorique,"KT was supported by the French Region Bretagne and the Canada Research Chair in Biological Control awarded to JB.

We measured the instantaneous growth of each species in the presence and absence of the other in 1-m(2) enclosures. We tested single-species (three slimy sculpins/m(2) or three brown trout/m(2)) and combined-species (three sculpins/m(2) and three trout/m(2)) combinations in each of six riffles. We placed a clay tile in each enclosure to evaluate the effects of fish combinations on benthic macroinvertebrates. Growth of brown trout was unaffected by the presence of slimy sculpins (P = 0.647, power [to detect 50% increase in growth] = 0.92), whereas slimy sculpin growth was less in the presence of brown trout (P = 0.038). Densities of total benthic macroinvertebrates, Chironomidae, Trichoptera, and Physa did not differ among fish combinations (P > 0.3). However, densities of Gammarus pseudolimnaeus were significantly less in the presence of brown trout irrespective of the presence of slimy sculpins (P = 0.024), which could be a causal factor underlying the interaction between brown trout and slimy sculpins. We found asymmetrical competition between brown trout and slimy sculpins in stream enclosures, with brown trout being the superior competitor. Nevertheless, the size of enclosures may have biased our results, making it more likely to detect an effect of brown trout on slimy sculpins than vice versa.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Fairfield Univ, Dept Biol, Fairfield, CT 06430 USA; Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Ruetz, CR (corresponding author), Lake Michigan Ctr, Annis Water Resources Inst, 740 W Shoreline Dr, Muskegon, MI 49441 USA.",,,,,,,45,22,23,1,14,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

The population size structure was obtained by distributing the colonies into diameter classes, each size class representing the average annual increment of diameter growth. The population was divided into ten classes, including a recruitment class. This size structure showed a fairly regular trend in the first four classes. The irregularity of survival in the older classes agreed with field observations on harvesting and predation. Demographic parameters such as survival, growth plasticity and natality coefficients were estimated from the experimental data. On this basis a discrete nonlinear model was implemented. The model is based on a kind of density-dependent Leslie matrix, where the feedback term only occurs in survival of the first class; the recruitment function is assumed to be dependent on the total biomass and related to inhibiting effects due to competitive interactions.

The best opportunity to test whether ongoing competition contributes to niche differentiation is to test for behavioral shifts by the subordinate competitor in controlled experiments in which the abundance of the dominant competitor is manipulated. Because these circumstances are difficult to coordinate in natural settings for wide-ranging species, researchers seize opportunities presented by species reintroductions. We tested for new competition between reintroduced wolves and resident cougars in the Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem to assess whether wolves might be impacting the realized niche of sympatric cougars. Results: Between 2002 and 2012, a period during which wolves increased from 15 to as high as 91 in the study area, cougars significantly increased the percentage of deer and decreased the percentage of elk in their diet in summer. Our top models explaining these changes identified elk availability, defined as the number of elk per wolf each year, as the strongest predictor of changing cougar prey selection. Both elk and deer were simultaneously declining in the system, though deer more quickly than elk, and wolf numbers increased exponentially during the same time frame. Therefore, we concluded that prey availability did not explain prey switching and that competition with wolves at least partially explained cougar prey switching from elk to deer. We also recorded 5 marked cougar kittens killed by wolves and 2 more that were killed by an undetermined predator. In addition, between 2005 and 2012, 9 adult cougars and 10 cougar kittens died of starvation, which may also be in part explained by competition with wolves. Conclusions: Direct interspecific predation and shifting cougar prey selection as wolves increased in the system provided evidence for competition between recolonizing wolves and resident cougars. Through competition, recolonizing wolves have impacted the realized niche of resident cougars in the Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem (SYE), and current resident cougars may now exhibit a realized niche more reflective of an era when these species were previously sympatric in the Yellowstone Ecosystem.","[Elbroch, L.

A potential mechanism for this replacement is competition mediated by resident species. Other Eurasian invaders, dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis), dominate rocky substrates throughout the system and might be promoting the rapid expansion of E. ischnus by providing habitat and refugia from predation. Using an in-situ predator-exclusion experiment, we tested the hypothesis that E. ischnus is better able than G. fasciatus to use Dreissena spp. colonies as refugia and thus is less susceptible to predators in the St. Lawrence River. Co-occurring E. ischnus and G. fasciatus showed similar increases in density in the presence of Dreissena spp., in spite of E. ischnus having evolutionary experience with Dreissena spp. Predators reduced the density of both amphipod species, but E. ischnus was more susceptible to predation on dreissenid substrates, which suggests that predation mediates the coexistence of G. fasciatus and E. ischnus in the river.","McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Ricciardi, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",tony.ricciardi@mcgill.ca,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",,,,39,22,23,2,19,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Their predatory effects have been the focus of much research and are suggested to cause declines in native fish abundance and diversity across the invaded range. However, little is known about their non-consumptive effects, or their effects on invertebrates. Lionfish use shelters on the reef, thus there is potential for competition with other shelter-dwelling organisms. We demonstrate similar habitat associations between invasive lionfish, native spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) and native long-spined sea urchins (Diadema antillarum), indicating the potential for competition. We then used a laboratory experiment to compare activity and shelter use of each species when alone and when lionfish were paired with each native species. Spiny lobsters increased their activity but did not change their shelter use in the presence of a lionfish, whilst long-spined sea urchins changed neither their activity nor shelter use. However, lionfish reduced their shelter use in the presence of spiny lobsters and long-spined sea urchins. This study highlights the importance not only of testing for the non-consumptive effects of invasive species, but also exploring whether native species exert non-consumptive effects on the invasive.","[Hunt, Christina L.; Hudson, Callum J.; Lewis, Owen T.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Hunt, Christina L.; Hudson, Callum J.; Bennett-Williams, Joshua; Noadesm, Frankie; Exton, Dan A.] Operat Wallacea, Spilsby, Lincs, England; [Andradi-Brown, Dominic A.] World Wildlife Fund, Ocean Conservat, 1250 24th St,NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Noadesm, Frankie] Univ Salford, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Salford, Lancs, England; [Curtis-Quick, Jocelyn] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Hunt, CL (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England.; Hunt, CL (corresponding author), Operat Wallacea, Spilsby, Lincs, England.",christina.hunt@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Hunt, Christina/ABG-3363-2020; Lewis, Owen/ABF-7627-2020","Hunt, Christina/0000-0001-6918-0175; Lewis, Owen/0000-0001-7935-6111",NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L002612/1]; Fisheries Society of the British Isles; Operation Wallacea,"CLH was funded by a NERC PhD studentship (NE/L002612/1, www.nerc.ukri.org) and a Small Research Grant from the Fisheries Society of the British Isles (www.fsbi.org.uk).This work was also financially supported by Operation Wallacea (www.opwall.com).Apart from Operation Wallacea, who supported data collection in the field, the funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,120,0,0,5,13,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 26,2020,15,8,,,,,,,e0236200,10.1371/journal.pone.0236200,,,22,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NJ7ED,WOS:000566205500052,32846430,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-27,

However, the impact of individual movements on the long-term stability of populations remains largely unexplored. We analyze deterministic and stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems, where mobile predators consume scarce resources (prey) confined in patches. In fragile systems (that is, those unfavorable to species coexistence), the predator species has a maximized abundance and is resilient to degraded prey conditions when individual mobility is multiple scaled. Within the Levy flight model, highly superdiffusive foragers rarely encounter prey patches and go extinct, whereas normally diffusing foragers tend to proliferate within patches, causing extinctions by overexploitation. Levy flights of intermediate index allow a sustainable balance between patch exploitation and regeneration over wide ranges of demographic rates. Our analytical and simulated results can explain field observations and suggest that scale-free random movements are an important mechanism by which entire populations adapt to scarcity in fragmented ecosystems.","[Dannemann, Teodoro] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Recursos Nat, Inst Conservac Biodiversidad & Terr, Lab Ecoinformat, Valdivia 5110566, Chile; [Dannemann, Teodoro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile; [Dannemann, Teodoro] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago 7800003, Chile; [Dannemann, Teodoro; Boyer, Denis; Miramontes, Octavio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fis, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Boyer, Denis; Miramontes, Octavio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Complejidad, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Miramontes, Octavio] Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Aeronaut & Espacio, Dept Matemat Aplicadas, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Boyer, D (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fis, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.; Boyer, D (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Complejidad, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",boyer@fisica.unam.mx,"miramontes, octavio/ABG-8963-2020","miramontes, octavio/0000-0001-8306-0014",Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion TecnologicaPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT) [IN105015]; Instituto de Fisica (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico),We thank M.

We compared the abundance and behavior of these reef fishes in response to the presence of reef sharks using Baited Remote Underwater Video System (BRUVS) deployments in two adjacent reef systems where sharks have either been exclusively targeted by fishing or protected by a no-take marine reserve. For a subset of videos, we also compared the behavior of mesopredatory reef fishes immediately before and after the appearance of sharks in the video. On reefs where sharks were more abundant, mesopredatory fishes spent less time swimming in midwater (i.e., away from shelter) and guarding bait compared to reefs where sharks have been selectively removed. The same responses occurred after the appearance of sharks in the video. Reactions to sharks varied both in strength and type among species of mesopredator and were mediated by the availability of shelter on the reef and, for one species, by the levels of activity of the reef sharks. In contrast, we did not find that the presence of sharks influenced the abundance of mesopredators at either reef system across hour-long videos or immediately before and after a shark appeared in the video. Collectively, our findings show that the presence of sharks reduces the propensity of mesopredatory fish to engage in potentially risk-prone behaviors over large spatial scales and that these interactions are mediated by the behavioral characteristics of both predators and prey, and the environment in which they co-occur. Our results are consistent with the idea that sharks as predators or larger competitors initiate changes in the behavior of mesopredatory reef fishes likely to affect trophic structuring within coral reef ecosystems.","[Lester, E.

We focused on the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and the field vole (Microtus agrestis) and found that bank voles were more numerous in all stages of succession while densities of both species were lowest in young (24-30-year-old) forest stands.

Along rocky, wave-swept shores in central California, the microphytobenthos (MPB) supports diverse assemblages of limpets and littorine snails, which, at current benign temperatures, could potentially partition food resources in a complementary fashion, thereby enhancing secondary productivity. Two limpet species in particular, Lottia scabra and L. austrodigitalis, may partition components of the MPB, and are likely to affect the composition of the MPB on which they graze. In this study, we describe the composition, nutritional value (C:N ratio), and fluorescence (an index of chlorophyll density) of ungrazed, L. scabragrazed and L. austrodigitalis-grazed MPB, each as a function of temperature. Fluorescence de creased with increased average daily maximum temperature for ungrazed MPB, but temperature had no discernible effects on either fluorescence or the composition of the MPB of grazed assemblages. L. austrodigitalis and L. scabra did not partition the MPB, and did not exhibit complementarity. Both species exhibited an ordered grazing scheme, in which limpets grazed down certain components of the MPB before others, and grazing increased the C:N ratio of the MPB, decreasing its nutritional value. Taken together, these results suggest that L. austrodigitalis and L. scabra may experience increased competition as warming temperatures reduce the available MPB.","[LaScala-Gruenewald, Diana E.; Miller, Luke P.; Denny, Mark W.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Bracken, Matthew E.

We evaluated direct effects of predation by large predators on small, specialist carnivores by estimating annual survival and cause-specific mortality. We used known fate models to estimate annual survival of 23 radio-collared short-tailed weasels (Mustela erminea) in western Oregon in 2012-2013. Further, we reviewed published and unpublished studies of radio-tracked weasels (Mustela spp.) in North America, to identify main predators of weasels and survival. If the study did not report survival but did report number of days tracked and cause-specific mortalities, we extrapolated an annual survival index, based on daily survival rates (Mayfield index), to facilitate comparisons between studies. Estimated mean +/- SD annual survival of short-tailed weasels in our study was 0.26 +/- 0.08, and did not vary by season or sex of the weasel. Most (80%) predation mortalities, however, occurred in winter, and were attributed to predatory birds, suspected to be barred owls (Strix varia). For seven North American studies, including ours, we estimated the average annual survival index for M. erminea and Mustela frenata to be 0.37 +/- 0.28. Across studies, most mortality was attributed to predation. Predators killed weasels >2x more frequently in winter when most mortality (86%) was attributed to predatory birds. Mammalian predators, in contrast, killed weasels most frequently in summer (75%). Our results support the hypothesis that predation may play an important role limiting weasel populations in North America.","[Linnell, Mark A.; Epps, Clinton W.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Forsman, Eric D.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Zielinski, William J.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, 1700 Bayview Dr, Arcata, CA 95521 USA","Linnell, MA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",marcolinnell@gmail.com,"Epps, Clinton/AAX-3971-2021","Epps, Clinton/0000-0001-6577-1840",USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research stationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Department of Fisheries and Wildlife Oregon State University; Oregon State University Fisheries and Wildlife Thomas G.

The productivity of the largest clutches in these two herons seems to be proximately Limited by their inability to hatch successfully clutches above four and six eggs, respectively. Major losses seem to involve hatching failures due to the parents' inability to incubate clutches above a certain size, or to early chick mortality due to competitive aggression among siblings. Clutch size and fledgling Success were stable or slightly increased during the season, an unusual trend that may be linked to a late peak in food availability. Among the hypotheses put forward to explain the discrepancy between most frequent and most productive clutches in birds, the evidence for Night Herons and Little Egrets contrasts with the predictions of the predation, the bad years, and the insurance hypotheses. A clutch size modification experiment, the first one accomplished on a ciconiiform species, was conducted for 3 years, and its results contrasted with the predictions of the individual optimum hypothesis. The limited information now available suggest that the incubation capacity and the adaptation in progress hypotheses may be applicable to these herons, who find particularly abundant food resources in the rice fields of this study area.","Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Fasola, M (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, Piazza Botta 9, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",,,"FASOLA, MAURO/0000-0002-7366-5893",,,,47,11,13,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

We studied the effects of an intraguild (IG) predator, the bug Orius laevigatus, on the population dynamics of IG-prey, the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, and a shared prey, the phytophagous two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, as well as on the performance of cucumber plants in a greenhouse. The interaction of the predatory mite and the spider mite is highly unstable, and ends either by herbivores overexploiting the plant or predators exterminating the herbivores. We studied the effect of IGP on the transient dynamics of this system, and compared the dynamics with that predicted by a simple population-dynamical model with IGP added. Behavioural studies showed that the predatory bug and the predatory mite were both attracted to plants infested by spider mites and that the two predators did not avoid plants occupied by the other predator. Observations on foraging behaviour of the predatory bug showed that it attacks and kills large numbers of predatory mites and spider mites. The model predicts strong effects of predation and prey preference by the predatory bugs on the dynamics of predatory mites and spider mites. However, experiments in which the predatory bug was added to populations of predatory mites and spider mites had little or no effect on numbers of both mite species, and cucumber plant and fruit weight.","Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, IBED, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands; Agr & Livestock Res Enterprise Minas Gerais EPAMI, Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, IBED, POB 94084, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Venzon, Madelaine/C-5856-2014","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Venzon, Madelaine/0000-0001-9184-6818",,,,44,32,36,0,32,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

The highest temperature of substrata measured at tidal heights colonized by N. emarginata in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, was 28.5 degrees C. This temperature was not lethal to hatchlings in laboratory tests. In laboratory and field desiccation experiments, all hatchlings died within 6 h of emersion. Early juveniles could not survive direct exposure to even moderate drying conditions for the duration of a low tide. Hence, intertidal microhabitats which dry up even for short periods during low tides would prove lethal. Of 45 intertidal animal species to which hatchlings were exposed in the laboratory, small decapod crustaceans were the only organisms to cause substantial hatchling mortality. Of these, Pagurus hirsutiusculus and Hemigrapsus nudus were by far the most abundant in the field, and are probably the only important predators of early juvenile N. emarginata at most sites. Total predator densities in the field were as high as 438 individuals m(-2), suggesting that predation pressure may be intense. Desiccation and predation by decapod crustaceans appear to be the most significant threats to early juvenile N. emarginata. These factors commonly occur on most temperate rocky shores and undoubtedly constitute major selective agents influencing population parameters and shaping life-history strategies and early juvenile traits of intertidal invertebrates.","UNIV ALBERTA,DEPT BIOL SCI,EDMONTON,AB T6G 2E9,CANADA",,,"Gosselin, Louis A/F-1284-2011",,,,,62,62,64,0,36,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Few studies have examined the role sponges play in community structure despite the fact that many sponges are competitively superior to reef-building corals in space acquisition. Surveys conducted throughout the Florida Keys indicated that Chondrilla nucula was involved in about 30% of all coral-sponge interactions; this sponge has also been observed in 40-50% of coral-sponge interactions on other Caribbean reefs. C. nucula is also the top prey item of the Hawksbill turtle, and among the preferred prey of several spongivorous fish. I examined how predation influenced sponge competitive abilities (particularly those of C. nucula), and whether this type of indirect effect had important consequences for community dynamics in the Florida Keys. Exclusion of sponge predators (primarily angelfish) resulted in increased sponge overgrowth, with a subsequent greater loss of coral cover, compared to uncaged pairwise interactions. When caged, the corals Dichocoenia stokesii and Siderastrea sideraea lost significantly greater surface area and number of polyps to the sponge C. nucula compared to uncaged interactions. For caged interactions involving the sponge Ectyoplasia fever, there was a trend for greater loss of S. sideraea surface area and polyps compared to uncaged interactions. Predation had a greater affect on C. nucula than on any of the other sponges examined. Predator exclusion experiments performed with naturally occurring coral-sponge interactions demonstrated a significant decrease in total coral cover compared to uncaged controls. It is proposed that indirect effects arising from spongivory (especially consumption of C. nucula) may have large community consequences. Species diversity on Caribbean reefs may be maintained, at least in part, by spongivores.","Univ Houston, Dept Biol, Program Evolut Biol & Ecol, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Hill, MS (corresponding author), Fairfield Univ, Dept Biol, Fairfield, CT 06430 USA.",mhill@umbsky.cc.umb.edu,"Hill, Malcolm/B-6204-2015",,,,,72,84,88,1,38,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1998,117,1-2,,,,,143,150,,10.1007/s004420050642,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,144YZ,WOS:000077344700019,28308480,,,,2021-09-27,

Ideal free models for unequal competitors predict a truncated competitor phenotype distribution among patches when relative payoffs of phenotypes vary across patches. Partial truncation is expected under field conditions. This prediction was tested in a field experiment with an overwintering population of mute swans (Cygnus olor). 2. Two food patches were generated in which adult and subadult swans were expected to have different relative success. In one patch ('clumped'), pieces of bread were thrown over a small area on the water surface. In the other patch, pieces of bread were scattered over a larger area. 3. When only one patch was offered at a time (no choice situation), adult swans were more successful than subadult swans in the 'clumped' patch, but were similarly successful in the 'scattered' patch. Relative payoffs of adult and subadult swans differed significantly between patches. 4. When the two patches were offered simultaneously, black-headed gulls (Larns ridibundus) competed with the swans to a considerable extent in some replicates. The gulls appeared to be the poorest competitors. They snatched more bread in the scattered than in the clumped patch. Both classes of swans avoided the scattered patch but not the clumped patch with increasing competition from gulls. Gulls preferred the scattered patch and swans increasingly preferred the clumped patch under gull competition, creating a partially truncated distribution. 5. Without the four replicates in which the gulls had consumed more than 25% of the bread, the percentage of adult swans that chose the clumped patch was significantly higher than the percentage of subadult swans that chose that patch. This is the first experimental verification of a partially truncated phenotype distribution. Subadult swans significantly preferred the scattered patch whereas adults tended to prefer the clumped patch. This distribution was predicted from the 'no choice' experiment, where competition by gulls had been similarly weak.",,"MILINSKI, M (corresponding author), UNIV BERN, INST ZOOL, VERHALTENSOKOL ABT, WOHLENSTR 50A, CH-3032 HINTERKAPPELEN, SWITZERLAND.",,,,,,,42,24,24,1,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Resource quality and availability also influence prey trophic behaviour, with potential effects on predator-prey dynamics. Although many studies have addressed these topics, little attention has been paid to the combined effects of predators and resources on prey species coexistence and nutrient transfer along food chains, especially in detritus-based systems. To determine the influence of predators and resource quality on the movement and P uptake of detritivores, we carried out a field experiment on the River Kelvin (Scotland) using P-32 to test the hypothesis of reduced prey vagility among resource patches as a strategy to avoid predation. Thirty leaf sacks containing alder leaves and two detritivore prey populations (Asellus aquaticus and Lymnaea peregra) were placed in cages, half of them with two predator species (Dendrocoelum lacteum and Erpobdella octoculata) and the other half without predators. Five alder leaf bags, each individually inoculated with a different fungus strain to simulate a patchy habitat, were placed inside each leaf sack. One bag in each sack was labelled with P-32, in order to assess the proportion of detritivores using it as food and thus their movement among the five resource patches. Three replicates for each labelled fungus and each predation treatment (i.e. with and without predators) were left on the riverbed for 7 days. The presence of predators had negligible effects on the number of detritivores in the leaf bags, but it did reduce the proportion of P-32-labelled detritivores and their P uptake. The most strongly affected species was A. aquaticus, whose vagility, trophic overlap with L. peregra and P uptake were all reduced. The results confirm the importance of bottom-up and top-down forces acting simultaneously to regulate nutrient transfer along food chains in patchy habitats.","[Calizza, Edoardo; Rossi, Loreto; Costantini, Maria Letizia] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Environm Biol, Rome, Italy","Rossi, L (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Environm Biol, Rome, Italy.",loreto.rossi@uniroma1.it,,"ROSSI, LORETO/0000-0001-8014-5397; Calizza, Edoardo/0000-0002-9457-4229; Costantini, Maria Letizia/0000-0001-6242-558X","National Academy of Lincei; PNRA (Ministero dell'istruzione, dell'universitae della ricerca); Provincia di Latina (Presidenza and Assessorato Ambiente)","Funding for experiment provided by National Academy of Lincei.

Rapid rates of anthropogenic warming make this classic ecological question especially relevant. We ask whether climate controls range limits by quantifying relationships between climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) and tree growth across the altitudinal ranges of six Pacific Northwestern conifers on Mt. Rainier, Washington, USA. Results for three species (Abies amabilis, Callitropsis nootkatensis, Tsuga mertensiana) whose upper limits occur at treeline (>1600 m) imply climatic controls on upper range limits, with low growth in cold and high snowpack years. Annual growth was synchronized among individuals at upper limits for these high-elevation species, further suggesting that stand-level effects such as climate constrain growth more strongly than local processes. By contrast, at lower limits climatic effects on growth were weak for these high-elevation species. Growth-climate relationships for three low-elevation species (Pseudotsuga menziesii, Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla) were not consistent with expectations of climatic controls on upper limits, which are located within closed-canopy forest (<1200 m). Annual growth of these species was poorly synchronized among individuals. Our results suggest that climate controls altitudinal range limits at treeline, while local drivers (perhaps biotic interactions) influence growth in closed-canopy forests. Climate-change-induced range shifts in closed-canopy forests will therefore be difficult to predict accurately.","[Ettinger, A. K.; Ford, K.

Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the foraging ecology of piscivores is needed for ecosystem-based fishery management plans to be successful. Abundance and stomach contents of seasonally co-occurring piscivores were examined to determine overlap in resource use for Summer Flounder (Paralichthys dentatus; 206-670 mm total length [TL]), Weakfish (Cynoscion regalis; 80-565 mm TL), Bluefish (Pomatornus saltatrix; 55-732 mm fork length [FL]), and Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis; 422-920 ram FL). We collected samples from monthly, fishery-independent trawl surveys conducted on the inner continental shelf (5-27 m) off New Jersey from June to October 2005. Fish abundances and overlaps in diet and habitat varied over this study period. A wide range of fish and invertebrate prey was consumed by each species. Diet composition (determined from 1997 stomachs with identifiable contents) varied with ontogeny (size) and indicated limited overlap between most of the species size classes examined. Although many prey categories were shared by the piscivores examined, different temporal and spatial patterns in habitat use seemed to alleviate potential competition for prey. Nevertheless, the degree of overlap in both fish distributions and diets increased several-fold in the fall as species left estuaries and migrated across and along the study area. Therefore, the transitional period of fall migration, when fish densities are higher than at other times of the year, may be critical for unraveling resource overlap for these seasonally migrant predators.","[Wuenschel, Mark J.; Able, Kenneth W.; Vasslides, James M.] Rutgers State Univ, Marine Field Stn, Tuckerton, NJ 08087 USA; [Byrne, Donald M.] New Jersey Dept Environm Protect, Nacote Creek Res Stn, Port Republic, NJ 08241 USA","Wuenschel, MJ (corresponding author), NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 166 Water St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",mark.wuenschel@noaa.gov,,"Wuenschel, Mark/0000-0002-9307-7319",collaborative Bluefish/Striped Bass Dynamics Research Program of Rutgers University; National Marine Fisheries Service,"This study was funded through a grant from the collaborative Bluefish/Striped Bass Dynamics Research Program of Rutgers University and the National Marine Fisheries Service.

It is known that these volatiles can be attractive to natural enemies of herbivores. We hypothesise that the plant volatiles constitute part of the induced plant defence and that herbivores will be affected by the odours as well. In laboratory and semi-field studies this hypothesis was tested for the aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) (Rhynchota, Sternorrhyncha, Aphididae). In a Y-tube olfactometer significantly more aphids chose the odour of healthy, undamaged maize seedlings when tested against clean air or plants treated with regurgitant. Clean air was chosen more often when tested next to the odour of treated plants. This apparently repellent effect of the odour of treated plants was significant for winged aphids, but not for the wingless aphids. In field experiments aphids were released in the centre of circles of eight potted maize plants. Four plants in each circle were damaged and treated with caterpillar regurgitant while the other plants were left unharmed. At different intervals after aphid release, the number of aphids was counted on each plant. Significantly fewer winged and wingless aphids were found back on treated plants than on healthy plants. We suggest that herbivores may be repelled by the odours because they could indicate that: 1) the plant has initiated the production of toxic compounds; 2) potential competitors are present on the plant; 3) the plant is attractive to parasitoids and predators. Aphids may be particularly sensitive to induced maize volatiles because one of the major compounds emitted by the plant is (E)-beta-farnesene, which is a common alarm pheromone for aphids. Collections and analyses of the odours emitted by crushed R. maidis confirmed that it too emits (E)-beta-farnesene when stressed. The results are discussed in context of plant defence strategies and their possible exploitation for the control of pest insects.","ETH Zurich, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Plant Sci Appl Entomol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Stn Fed Ric Agron, Ctr Cadenazzo, CH-6593 Cadenazzo, Switzerland","Turlings, TCJ (corresponding author), Univ Neuchatel, Inst Zool, CH-2007 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",,"Turlings, Ted CJ/E-8671-2012","Turlings, Ted CJ/0000-0002-8315-785X",,,,46,195,227,3,90,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Pacific Northwest and southern temperate rainforests possess about the same numbers of amphibian species, but most in the former are salamanders while the latter has only anurans. Southern anurans tend to be more terrestrial than Pacific Northwest anurans, and more frequently have localized distributions. Pacific Northwest forests have higher numbers of reptile species overall, but fewer lizard and more snake species than southern temperate rainforests. Both regions show a decline in the importance of reptile species proceeding towards polar regions; polarward declines in numbers of amphibian species in the Pacific Northwest are largely due to the progressive loss of salamanders. Pacific Northwest forests also possess much higher total and site species densities of mammals due principally to the following groups: 1) members of the order Insectivora (shrews and moles) absent in South America, 2) higher numbers of bats, and 3) sciurids (squirrels) and arvicolids (voles) also absent in southern South America. A larger proportion of Pacific Northwest mammals are trophically insect/invertebrate consumers, and a smaller proportion are true carnivores. However, if these categories are combined, the overall proportion of broadly defined carnivores is very similar to that in southern rainforests. Proportions of herbivorous and omnivorous species are also very similar in the two regions. Both forests have at least some partially mycophagous (= fungivorous) species, and a relative scarcity of granivorous/frugivorous mammals. A smaller proportion of southern rainforest mammals are arboreal, somewhat more are fossorial, and similar proportions are terrestrial/scansorial, and aquatic. Important questions that need to be addressed include the nature of resource availability and utilization, the role of biotic interactions such as competition and predation, and the importance of coevolutionary relationships such as that suggested between mycophagous small mammals and forest tree-mycorrhizal symbionts.

We investigated the individual and spatial patterns in the feeding of two dominant zooplanktivorous clupeids-herring Clupea harengus membras and sprat Sprattus sprattus-in the Baltic Sea in summer, by means of a taxonomic analysis of stomach content. Both species consumed predominantly the small-sized copepods (Temora longicornis, Eurytemora affinis, and Acartia spp.). E. affinis and T. longicornis were generally positively selected by both species. Centropages hamatus was selected only by sprat. With the exception of Pleopis/ Podon spp. in the case of small sprat, the remaining prey, i. e. the zooplankton taxa that were found in fish stomachs, were consumed at similar proportions as they occurred in zooplankton. Stomach fullness of fish increased with the increasing proportions of prey in the zooplankton community. The share of empty stomachs was lower for sprat, and among smaller fish in both species. Pairwise dietary overlap between fish decreased when zooplankton diversity increased. Dietary overlap was also lowest among the individuals of sprat, probably due to the wider diet spectrum and diversity of stomach content compared to herring. Our results point to high interspecific competition, where sprat seems to be more successful than herring in finding and consuming prey, and therefore may have an advantage over herring when the zooplankton community is dominated by small-sized taxa.","[Ojaveer, Henn; Lankov, Ain; Klais, Riina] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80032 Parnu, Estonia; [Raid, Tiit; Pollumae, Arno] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia","Ojaveer, H (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80032 Parnu, Estonia.",henn.ojaveer@ut.ee,"Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016","Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Klais-Peets, Riina/0000-0003-2895-1273","BONUS - European Union [Art 185]; Estonian Research Council [2012-60]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [SF0180005s10]","We thank Sally Clink for language editing.

Although much work has examined the effects of inducible defences, less understood is how inducible offences in predators affect predator-prey interactions and predator and prey phenotypes. Here, we examine the impacts of an inducible offence on the interactions and life histories of a cohort of predatory Hynobius retardatus salamander larvae and their prey, Rana pirica tadpoles. We examined larval (duration, survival) and post-metamorphic (size) traits of both species after manipulating the presence/absence of tadpoles and salamanders with offensive (broadened gape width) or non-offensive phenotypes in pond enclosures. Offensive phenotype salamanders reduced tadpole survival and metamorph emergence by 58% compared to tadpole-only treatments, and by over 30% compared to non-offensive phenotypes. Average time to metamorphosis of frogs was delayed by 30% in the presence of salamanders, although this was independent of salamander phenotype. Thus, offensive phenotype salamanders reduced the number of tadpoles remaining in the pond over time by reducing tadpole survival, not by altering patterns of metamorph emergence. Offensive phenotypes also caused tadpoles to metamorphose 19% larger than no salamander treatments and 6% larger than non-offensive phenotype treatments. Pooled across salamander treatments, tadpoles caused salamanders to reach metamorphosis faster and larger. Moreover, in the presence of tadpoles, offensive phenotype salamanders metamorphosed 25% faster and 5% larger than non-offensive phenotype salamanders, but in their absence, neither their size nor larval period differed from non-offensive phenotype individuals. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that inducible offences in predators can have strong impacts on predator and prey phenotypes across multiple life stages. Since early metamorphosis at a larger size has potential fitness advantages, the impacts of offensive phenotypes on frog and salamander life histories likely have significant consequences for individuals and populations. Furthermore, increased predation on tadpoles likely causes offensive phenotype individuals to have strong impacts on pond communities. Future studies should examine the fitness consequences of morphological and life-history plasticity across multiple life stages and should address the population and community level consequences of offensive phenotypes.","[Kishida, Osamu; Tezuka, Ayumi] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan; [Costa, Zacharia] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Michimae, Hirofumi] Kitasato Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Clin Med Biostat, Tokyo 108, Japan","Kishida, O (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan.",bulgy_tadpoles@hotmail.com,"Kishida, Osamu/B-7970-2011",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24370004, 23247004, 70447069]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23570036] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank Kunio Takatsu, Tomoko Sato, Emiko Taniguchi, Shiho Chiba and all of members of Teshio Experimental forest for their unwavering support for our research.

Three-dimensional structural complexity is central to facilitating resource partitioning between many forest species, but is underrepresented in field-based studies. We examined resource selection by sympatric northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), a threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act, and nonnative barred owls (S. varia) in western Oregon, USA to explore the relative importance of canopy heterogeneity, vertical complexity of forest, and abiotic features to resource selection and identify potential differences that may facilitate long-term coexistence. We predicted that within home range selection of understory densities, measured with airborne lidar, would differ between species based on proportional differences in arboreal and terrestrial prey taken by each owl species. We used discrete choice models and telemetry data from 41 spotted owls and 38 barred owls monitored during 2007-2009 and 2012-2015. Our results suggested that while both species used tall canopy areas more often than low canopy areas, spotted owls were more commonly found in areas with lower tree cover, more developed understory, and steeper slopes. This is the first evidence of fine-scale partitioning based on structural forest properties by northern spotted owls and barred owls.","[Jenkins, Julianna M.

Cladocera dominated numerically the prey taxa, but were recorded in only four of the individual sturgeon examined and therefore excluded from stomach content analyses. Mayfly larvae (Ephemeroptera), primarily Hexagenia, were numerically the next most abundant (34% of all prey items) and the most widely taken (75% of all sturgeon) of the 10 prey categories. Others were Odonata, Annelida, Mollusca, Diptera and Trichoptera, each at 5-8% of all prey items. The remaining dietary categories represented < 3% of all prey items. No dietary partitioning was found over the length range of juvenile sturgeon, suggesting that fish throughout this size range are almost certainly competing for food. Lake Sturgeon diet did not differ from that for suckers, Lake Whitefish and, to some extent, Burbot, but was different from that for Northern Pike and Walleye. Extremely low invertebrate densities (95 individuals x m(-2)) and occurrence of all benthic species in the diet of juvenile Lake Sturgeon and several of the other dominant fishes suggests niche breadth to be wide and thus competition for food to be severe. The low food abundance is reflected in the comparatively slow growth rate of sturgeon in our study area. Apparently sturgeon are at survival threshold in this area. Further depletion of their food base likely would have serious repercussions for their growth and survival.","Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Noakes, DLG (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,47,26,30,0,26,OTTAWA FIELD-NATURALISTS CLUB,OTTAWA,"PO BOX 35069, WESTGATE PO, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 1A2, CANADA",0008-3550,,,CAN FIELD NAT,Can.

We hypothesized that prey populations inhabiting short-lived, species-poor, aquatic environments should lack significant morphological, developmental, and behavioral responses to predators and are therefore highly susceptible to predation. Furthermore, we predicted that the resultant decrease in prey density and increase in per capita resources due to high susceptibility to predators should enhance overall cohort survival because of enhanced growth of surviving prey. To test these ideas, we performed laboratory and outdoor mesocosm experiments to disentangle multiple effects of predators on an anuran (Scaphiopus couchii); a species highly adapted to breeding in ephemeral habitats and that has one of the shortest larval periods of all anurans. Chemical (presence of predator) and lethal predator cues (predator plus consumed conspecific) elicited no response in behavior, development, or morphology, indicating a lack of defensive mechanisms. Survivorship was significantly reduced in treatments where tadpoles were exposed to predators. However, this reduction in prey density led to accelerated time to metamorphosis, conferring an advantage to survivors who must metamorphose before ephemeral ponds dry. Our experiments demonstrated that in short-lived environments, prey may exhibit little or no response to the presence of predators presumably because selection for anti-predator defenses is countered by selection for rapid metamorphosis. However, predation actually resulted in an increase in overall cohort survival. Although predators are relatively rare in highly ephemeral aquatic environments, they may play an important role in facilitating the long-term persistence of their prey by reducing prey density.","[Dayton, Gage H.; Fitzgerald, Lee A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, Interdisciplinary Res Program Ecol & Evolutionary, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Dayton, GH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, UCSC Nat Reserves, ENVS, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",ghdayton@ucsc.edu,"Fitzgerald, Lee A/I-5193-2013","Fitzgerald, Lee/0000-0001-5648-9480",National Park Service; Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; US Geological Survey's ARMI (Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative); Tom Slick Graduate Fellowship; Frances Bacon Memorial Fund; Society of Wetlands Scientists student research; Texas Water Resource Initiative Mills Scholarship,"This work would not have been possible without the tremendous support of the staff at Big Bend National Park.

Although the insight into the function of the endobenthos of mangrove forests is crucial for their management, very few cage experiments have so far been carried out in such areas. The present paper summarises the results of such experiments in a typical East African mangrove forest at Gazi Bay about 60 km south of Mombasa, Kenya. Epibenthic animals were excluded for one year in two mangrove zones which differed in forest morphology and intertidal position (Ceriops tagal and Avicennia marina). Environmental factors and meiobenthic and macrobenthic densities were followed in a randomised block design, and procedural and exclusion effects were statistically detected. In confronting the separate responses of all faunal groups in the two mangrove zones, this synthesis gives a better insight into the tropho-dynamical interactions than the earlier separate reports on the same experiment. The ecosystem of the mangrove zones and the competitive interactions within this system provided an ideal opportunity to discover the existence of two food systems. This confirmed a strong involvement of the majority of the endobenthos in an isolated decompositional pathway in the mangrove sediment. It became clear that this exploitative competition was more important than the epibenthic predation in structuring and regulating the global endobenthic community. This synthesis therefore both demonstrates the decisive role of the endobenthos as regenators of mangrove material, and suggests that endobenthos plays a minor role as prey for the demersal or pelagic carnivores.","State Univ Ghent, Dept Morphol Systemat & Ecol, Marine Biol Sect, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Schrijvers, J (corresponding author), State Univ Ghent, Dept Morphol Systemat & Ecol, Marine Biol Sect, Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",,,,,,,55,10,12,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1385-1101,,,J SEA RES,J.

I examined the effect of a dominant ant, Iridomyrmex purpureus, on epigaeic arthropod assemblages on rock outcrops using an exclusion experiment. I compared arthropod assemblages on four replicate outcrops allocated to each of the following treatments: I. purpureus present; I. purpureus absent; I. purpureus excluded; and procedural control. Nests of I. purpureus were caged in summer 2001 and epigaeic arthropod assemblages were sampled at all sites using pitfall traps in autumn and spring 2001 and summer 2002. I also collected items from foraging workers to determine the diet of I. purpureus. Exclusion cages successfully reduced the abundance of I. purpureus workers in pitfall traps by more than 97%. Exclusion of I. purpureus did not affect the size distribution, biomass or abundance of arthropod predators or non-predatory arthropods, although the total biomass of ants was greater at sites with I. purpureus. Spider biomass, species richness, abundance and composition were also not affected by the presence of I. purpureus, although the I. purpureus mimic and specialist predator, Habronestes bradleyi, became less abundant at sites from which I. purpureus was excluded. Predation by I. purpureus on other arthropods may not have a significant effect on epigaeic arthropod communities, but the complex role of L purpureus in this ecosystem and the high diversity of species belonging to multiple trophic levels may obscure its effects in this system.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Wildlife Res, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Gibb, H (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Wildlife Res, Heydon Laurence Bldg AO8, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",hgibb@bio.usyd.edu.au,"Gibb, Heloise/B-8338-2013","Gibb, Heloise/0000-0001-7194-0620",,,,40,22,22,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2003,136,4,,,,,609,615,,10.1007/s00442-003-1299-z,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,721MX,WOS:000185321100015,12844254,,,,2021-09-27,

Two major broadleaf weeds, which were found in LINTS, red root pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus and lambsquarters Chenopodium album, and two major grass weeds, large crabgrass Digatara sanguinales and fall panicum Panicum dichotoflorum were tested singularly and in pairs (always one broadleaf with one grass) in the study. These seed pairings were exposed to (1) seed-predators (carabids and field crickets found in LINTS) which were at different densities, (2) wheat straw residue, (3) seed-predators and residue, and (4) a control (no seed-predators or residue). Seed-predators reduced the plant relative yield (PRY) of broadleaf weeds to the same extent as the wheat residue. Seed-predators preferred to feed on the broadleaf seeds which reduced the broadleaf weeds competitive ability when grown with grasses. Decreasing seed-predators by 50% resulted in almost no change in broadleaf plant relative yields compared with the control (no seed-predators). The decrease in seedling PRY caused by seed-predators was still evident as the plants matured. There was a significant interaction between seed-predators and residue in reducing broadleaf PRY probably because of differing effects of each on plant growth.","PURDUE UNIV,DEPT ENTOMOL,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907",,,,,,,,25,36,39,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

The effect of species richness is not well understood in landscapes where variation in 'top-down' factors, such as the abundance of predators or herbivores, has a strong influence competitor communities. I asked how phytoplankton species richness directly influenced standing phytoplankton biomass in replicate microcosm regions where one patch had a population of herbivores (Daphnia pulicaria) and one patch did not have herbivores. The effect of phytoplankton richness on standing phytoplankton biomass was positive but weak and not statistically significant at this regional scale. Among no-Daphnia patches, there was a significant positive effect of phytoplankton richness that resulted from positive selection effects for two dominant and productive species in polycultures. Among with-Daphnia patches there was not a significant effect of phytoplankton richness. The same two species dominated species-rich polycultures in no-and with-Daphnia patches but both species were relatively vulnerable to consumption by Daphnia. Consistent with previous studies, this experiment shows a measurable positive influence of primary producer richness on biomass when herbivores were absent. It also shows that given the patchy distribution of herbivores at a regional scale, a regional positive effect was not detected.","[Weis, Jerome J.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT USA; [Weis, Jerome J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, 1980 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN USA","Weis, JJ (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT USA.; Weis, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, 1980 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN USA.",jerome.weis@gmail.com,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Lee Pierce Fund; Yale University,"This study was funded by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and a grant from the Lee Pierce Fund awarded to JJW.

This species threatens soybean production through direct feeding damage and virus transmission. A diverse guild of insect predators feeds on soybean aphid in Michigan including the exotic coccinellid Harmonia axyridis, the native gall midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza and the native lacewing Chrysoperla carnea. In addition to feeding on A. glycines some members of this guild may also engage in intraguild predation. These interactions may produce positive, negative, or neutral impacts on A. glycines biological control. We explored the impact of intraguild predation on soybean aphid population dynamics by comparing aphid populations in microcosms with either A. aphidimyza larvae or C carnea larvae alone, with both a H. axyridis adult and either A. aphidimyza or C carnea larvae, and without predators. When H. axyridis was present with larval A. aphidiinyza or C carnea, the lady beetle acted as an intraguild predator. However, intraguild feeding did not result in a release of aphid populations compared with microcosms containing only the intraguild and aphid prey. A similar result was found in field cages. Cages allowing large predators had reduced numbers of A. aphidimyza and C carnea larvae but also significantly fewer aphids compared with predator exclusion cages. Thus, in both lab and field studies the direct impact of H. axyridis on A. glycines overcame its negative impact as an intraguild predator. Together, these studies indicate that while the exotic H. axyridis does act as an intraguild predator and may contribute to local declines in A. aphidimyza and C carnea, it is also currently important in overall biological control of A. glycines.

The ability of these predators to successfully suppress aphid populations is nevertheless highly variable. The development of operative conservation biological control strategies is mostly hindered by the lack of knowledge of the specific roles of the aphidophagous assemblage components, their intra-guild relationships and the predatory attributes that chiefly determine their effectiveness. The role of predation in the biological control of aphids in perennial agroecosystems was assessed through exclusion experiments in aphid infested citrus crops. Important predator attributes such as recruitment, aphid consumption rates, and foraging strategies were related to their efficacy. Predation greatly affected aphid colony phenology as well as size. Predators with lower aphid consumption rates (Micro-coccinellid species and Cecidomyiidae) were revealed to be the most efficient aphidophaga. These predators encountered aphid colonies at earlier colony stages and significantly reduced their population growth rates. Later more voracious aphidophaga groups (Chrysopidae and Macro-coccinellids) did not present effective biological control of the colonies. Contrarily to what was widely believed, the less voracious aphidophaga groups such as the Micro-coccinellids and Cecidomyiids are probably the groups who are mostly responsible for aphid suppression.

Prior work has found that the particular time that a species colonizes a patch can affect the performance of co-occurring species, but it is less clear whether it affects the biodiversity of the patch. Our objective was to evaluate how two components of colonization history affect biodiversity - the total duration of the colonization window in which a predator is able to colonize the patch and the particular time in the patch's colonization history (i.e. early versus late in community development) that colonization by a predator occurs. We conducted an experiment to examine how the duration and timing in which predatory dragonflies colonize recently filled ephemeral ponds affects insect biodiversity. Dragonfly colonization history had an important effect on insect biodiversity. Ponds with a longer colonization history by dragonflies had fewer insect morphotypes than ponds with a shorter colonization history. The timing of dragonfly colonization (i.e. early versus late in community development) had no effect on the number of insect morphotypes present despite altering both the rate of dragonfly metamorph production and the abundance of larval dragonflies present at the end of the study. The effect of duration of long-term dragonfly colonization on biodiversity stemmed from early colonists weakening the influence of later colonists on insect biodiversity. Though colonization by dragonflies reduced adult insect abundance, differences in the time in which dragonflies colonized ponds had no effect on total insect abundance. Moreover, differences in patch biodiversity appears to be affected more by variation in the duration a patch was colonized by a predator than variation in the time in which a patch was colonized by a predator.","[Amoroso, Natalie; Chalcraft, David R.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Amoroso, Natalie; Chalcraft, David R.] E Carolina Univ, Ctr Biodivers, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Amoroso, N (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",chalcraftd@ecu.edu,,"Chalcraft, David/0000-0002-2165-0948",National Science Foundation grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716558],"The authors wish to thank L.

As in other ecosystems, recruitment at deep-sea hydrothermal vents is controlled by the interplay of propagule supply and behavior, gradients in physical-chemical conditions, and biotic interactions during pre- and post-settlement periods. Recent research along the East Pacific Rise indicates that inhibition of recently settled larvae by mobile predators (mainly limpets) influences patterns of recruitment and subsequent community succession. We conducted a manipulative experiment at the same sites (similar to 2510m water depth) to test whether high-density assemblages of the mussel Bathymodiolus thermophilus also inhibit recruitment. In a preliminary study, recruitment of vent invertebrates within the faunal zone dominated by B. thermophilus was strikingly different at two sites, East Wall and Worm Hole. East Wall had high densities of mussels but very low total recruitment. In contrast, Worm Hole had few mussels but high recruitment. Using the submersible Alvin, we transplanted a large number of mussels from East Wall to Worm Hole and quantified recruitment on basalt blocks placed in three treatments: (1) naturally high densities of mussels at East Wall; (2) naturally low densities of mussels at Worm Hole; and (3) high densities of transplanted mussels at Worm Hole. After 11 months, a total of 24 taxa had recruited to the basalt blocks. Recruitment was 44-60% lower in the transplanted high-density mussel patch at Worm Hole and the natural high-density patch at East Wall than within the natural low-density patch at Worm Hole. Biotic processes that may have caused the pattern of recruitment observed included predation of larvae via water filtration by mussels, larval avoidance of superior competitors, interference competition, and enhanced predation by species within the mussel-bed community. Our results indicate that biotic interactions affecting recruitment must be understood to explain patterns of invertebrate community organization and dynamics at hydrothermal vents.

The size of an individual is an important determinant of its trophic position and the type of interactions it engages in with other heterospecific and conspecific individuals. Consequently an individual's ecological role in a community changes with its body size over ontogeny, leading to that trophic interactions between individuals are a size-dependent and ontogenetically variable mixture of competition and predation. 2. Because differently sized individuals thus experience different biotic environments, invasion success may be determined by the body size of the invaders. Invasion outcome may also depend on the productivity of the system as productivity influences the biotic environment. 3. In a laboratory experiment with two poeciliid fishes the body size of the invading individuals and the daily amount of food supplied were manipulated. 4. Large invaders established persistent populations and drove the resident population to extinction in 10 out of 12 cases, while small invaders failed in 10 out of 12 trials. Stable coexistence was virtually absent. Invasion outcome was independent of productivity. 5. Further analyses suggest that small invaders experienced a competitive recruitment bottleneck imposed on them by the resident population. In contrast, large invaders preyed on the juveniles of the resident population. This predation allowed the large invaders to establish successfully by decreasing the resident population densities and thus breaking the bottleneck. 6. The results strongly suggest that the size distribution of invaders affects their ability to invade, an implication so far neglected in life-history omnivory systems. The findings are further in agreement with predictions of life-history omnivory theory, that size-structured interactions demote coexistence along a productivity gradient.","[Schroder, Arne] Present address Wageningen IMARES, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands; [Schroder, Arne; Nilsson, Karin A.; Persson, Lennart; van Kooten, Tobias; Reichstein, Birte] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Schroder, A (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",arne.schroder@emg.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","Reichstein, Birte/0000-0002-0551-6896",Memorial of J.C.

We assessed the effects of browsing by deer and seed predation by rodents, ants and birds on the densities of seeds entering the seed bank of Ceanothus cuneatus var. rigidus, a maritime chaparral shrub in coastal California. Ceanothus produced many more seeds when protected from browsers in long-term experimental exclosures than did browsed plants, but the seed densities in the soil beneath browsed and unbrowsed Ceanothus were the same at the start of an intensive one-year study. The density of seeds in the soil initially increased in both treatments following summer seed drop: while densities returned to pre-drop levels within a few weeks under browsed plants, soil seed densities remained high for 5-8 months beneath unbrowsed plants. Rodent abundance (especially deer mice) was higher near unbrowsed plants than > 30 m away, and rodents removed Ceanothus seeds from dishes in the experimental plots. At least in the short term, rodent density and rates of seed removal were inversely related to the intensity of browsing. Our data have management implications for maintaining viable Ceanothus populations by regulating the intensity of browsing and the timing, intensity and frequency of fires.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Fox, LR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, A316 EMS, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",fox@biology.ucsc.edu,,,,,,49,19,20,0,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2006,150,1,,,,,69,77,,10.1007/s00442-006-0503-3,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,098WB,WOS:000241552400008,16896769,,,,2021-09-27,

We manipulated the food resources available to juvenile spot subject to predation from southern flounder in a 60-day replicated pond experiment to test the hypothesis that spot growing slowly would experience higher predation mortality and stronger selection against small individuals than those growing rapidly. A nearly threefold difference in average growth rate between fast- and slow-growth treatments led to twofold higher predation mortality of slow-growing spot. Relative to no-flounder controls, larger spot were overrepresented at the end of the experiment in both treatments, but the magnitude of flounder size selection was much greater in the slow- growth treatment. The experimental results agreed qualitatively, but not quantitatively, with predictions from a prior size-dependent foraging model. In particular, the model significantly underestimated observed shifts in spot size structure to larger sizes. We hypothesized that competitive release and associated increases in spot growth due to thinning by flounder might reconcile this difference, and extended the model to incorporate this process. We then used the model to estimate the relative contribution of these two confounded predator effects (size-selective predation and thinning) to observed shifts in spot size structure. Model simulations indicated that the combined effects of size-selective predation and thinning could account for nearly all of the observed shift in spot size structure, but that thinning was the more important process. Our results highlight the utility of combining experimental and modeling approaches to unravel the complexities underlying interactions between growing, size-structured predator and prey cohorts.","Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; NOAA, Fish Ecol Div, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; Duke Univ, Ctr Marine Conservat, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Craig, JK (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, 135 Duke Marine Lab Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.",kevin.craig@duke.edu,,,,,,34,31,31,0,11,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2006,87,9,,,,,2366,2377,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2366:PGASPI]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,080MW,WOS:000240253000026,16995637,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

The important role of omnivores is implicated by the paradoxical results of a food-supplementation experiment. The experiment was designed to test theories that predict how habitat change affects the distribution of habitat-selecting species. According to theories of habitat selection, a quantitative change in habitat (as caused by supplemental food) should increase consumer population size and alter habitat selectivity. Related theories of patch use predict that consumers should increase their use of enriched patches. A two-year experiment on two species of small mammals in Canada's boreal forest failed to alter population densities of red-backed voles, but did cause a dramatic shift in vole habitat use. Rather than increasing their use of feeding stations as predicted by classical theory, voles avoided them. Deer mice did not respond to the experimental treatments. The paradoxical results occurred because omnivorous black bears altered prey behavior by increasing predation risk at feeding stations. Revised theory confirms the indirect omnivore effect, and demonstrates that the behavioral paradox is far more likely for omnivores than for other types of predators. The behavioral paradox of enrichment highlights not only important new, and potentially stabilizing, roles for omnivores, but also the pervasive influences of behavior and habitat selection on population dynamics and regulation.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; Lakehead Univ, Fac Forestry & Forest Environm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,,,,,31,22,25,1,25,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2005,86,10,,,,,2568,2577,,10.1890/04-0909,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,971DP,WOS:000232361800003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Patella occurs in the diets of various predators, but Siphonaria is rarely eaten. The possibility of chemical defence in Siphonaria was tested using co-occurring predators. Live limpets were used to establish that predators differentiate between the two species; limpet tissue to establish that this was not due to behavioural defence; and chemical extracts from Siphonaria to eliminate the possibility of physical effects such as tissue toughness. The predators capable of taking live limpets (clingfish, starfish and two species of whelks) took Patella in preference to Siphonaria (chi(2) tests, P < 0.05 in all cases). Of 331 limpets eaten during trials, only 12% were Siphonaria. Whelks refused the tissue of Siphonaria while accepting Patella. Gobies ate Siphonaria tissue, but were then reluctant to feed again. Anemones showed no difference in their response to tissues of the two species. Coating Patella tissue with the ether-soluble organic fraction of a chemical extracted from Siphonaria using acetone did not affect feeding by gobies. However, starfish which were touched by a glass rod smeared with Siphonaria mucus or extract suffered temporary paralysis of the tube-feet. Patella which had their shells coated with Siphonaria extract were eaten significantly less often by starfish. This effect was strongly dose dependent. We conclude that avoidance of Siphonaria by those predators capable of attacking live individuals was due to chemical defence, the active components being present in both the mucus and the foot tissues.

While small-scale individual-level studies on normative-native fish interactions have helped elucidate mechanisms of impact, very few investigations have occurred at a scale consistent with that of species replacement. Thus, large-scale population-level studies are needed to understand the effects of normative fish as well as to more effectively conserve native fishes in the presence of normative fish. For this reason, we conducted an evaluation of the effects of normative brown trout Salmo trutta on the individual- and population-level performance of native cutthroat trout using a field-experimental approach. We studied local populations of cutthroat trout in the presence and absence of brown trout in long stream reaches and subsequently compared growth, condition, stable-isotope-based measures of dietary habits, movement, and survival between treatment groups. We found clear evidence for reduced cutthroat trout growth owing to the presence of brown trout. Additionally, we observed differences in cutthroat trout dietary habits based on delta C-13 signatures resulting from our experimental manipulation of brown trout abundance. Finally, brown trout suppressed cutthroat trout movement but had no apparent effect on their survival. Considering previous studies, we concluded that the individual-level effects of brown trout on cutthroat trout are scale invariant. Higher-level impacts (i.e., on movement and survival), in contrast, appear to be more sensitive to the scale at which the investigation is conducted. Overall, our results indicate that brown trout can have strong negative effects on cutthroat trout performance and should therefore be more explicitly considered in native fish conservation plans.","Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources,Coll Nat, Logan, UT 84322 USA","McHugh, P (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources,Coll Nat, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",pam@cc.usu.edu,"Budy, Phaedra/B-2415-2012","Budy, Phaedra/0000-0002-9918-1678",,,,88,35,37,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

We assembled all possible food webs including one or more of the ciliate species and cross-classified them with four levels of enrichment of the bacterial medium. The qualitative outcome of food web interactions was independent of enrichment and always the same: Tetrahjrmena strongly depressed or excluded Colpidium, and Blepharisma strongly depressed or excluded both bacterivores. Consequently, in all sub-webs only the dominant ciliate species responded positively to enrichment. The total density of bacteria increased with enrichment irrespective of food web composition. In contrast, the response of singlecelled bacteria to enrichment depended on food web composition and was only weakly positive in most food webs with the omnivore. Enrichment had a positive effect on the relative success of (presumably more defended) bacterial aggregates. The outcome of interspecific interactions among ciliates could not be predicted from monoculture experiments and deviated from earlier experiments in which each bacterivore coexisted separately with the omnivore. As a potential explanation we suggest that changes in experimental protocol reduced spatial heterogeneity and increased attack rates. A simple, dynamical model shows that increased attack rates can indeed greatly decrease the upper limit and range of enrichment over which intermediate consumers can coexist with omnivores.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Limnol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Munich, Dept Biol 2, DE-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Liess, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Limnol, Norbyvagen 20, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",antonia.liess@ebc.uu.se,"Liess, Antonia/H-6789-2016; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Liess, Antonia/0000-0003-1556-3861; Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,53,15,15,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2006,114,1,,,,,15,26,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14516.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,070YP,WOS:000239563300003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Ecological theory predicts that these fast-growing genotypes are, in the absence of trade-offs with fast growth, better competitors than low-latitude conspecifics. While knowledge on key ecological traits along latitudinal clines is important for understanding how these clines are maintained, the relative competitive ability of high latitude individuals against low latitude conspecifics has not been tested. Growth and development rates of the common frog Rana temporaria increase along the latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia. Here we investigated larval competition over food resources within and between two R. temporaria populations originating from southern and northern Sweden in an outdoor common garden experiment. We used a factorial design, where southern and northern tadpoles were reared either as single populations or as mixes of the two populations at two densities and predator treatments (absence and non-lethal presence of Aeshna dragonfly larvae). Tadpoles from the high latitude population grew and developed faster and in the beginning of the experiment they hid less and were more active than tadpoles from the low latitude population. When raised together with high latitude tadpoles the southern tadpoles had a longer larval period, however, the response of high latitude tadpoles to the competition by low latitude tadpoles did not differ from their response to intra-population competition. This result was not significantly affected by density or predator treatments. Our results support the hypothesis that high latitude populations are better competitors than their low latitude conspecifics, and suggest that in R. temporaria fast growth and development trade off with other fitness components along the latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia.","[Lindgren, Beatrice; Laurila, Anssi] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Laurila, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Norbyvagen 18D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",beatrice.lindgren@ebc.uu.se; anssi.laurila@ebc.uu.se,,,Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Zoologiska Stiftelsen,"We thank Sofia Wennberg for help with the experiment, Gunilla Engstrom and Kerstin Santesson for help in the molecular laboratory, and Jon Loman, Gerard Malsher, German Orizaola and Katja Rasanen for valuable comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

Control of mosquito larvae involving the use of antagonists has focused mostly on predators. We hypothesized that cladoceran competitors have a strong potential to control larval populations of some species of mosquitoes that can be early colonizers of newly-filled waterbodies, and should be less efficient competitors. To test this hypothesis, the establishment and development of larval populations of wild Culex pipiens were investigated in outdoor microcosms varying in terms of Daphnia magna populations. When the population was well established (i.e., high densities of D. magna), oviposition was fully inhibited and there was consequently no mosquito larvae. When the population was more recently established (i.e., lower densities of D. magna), oviposition and larval development of Cx. pipiens occurred. In the absence of D. magna, oviposition, larval biomass, and abundance of Cx. pipiens reached high values. In this situation, conspecifics were inhibiting further oviposition of Cx. pipiens. Based on these results, we suggest that competing zooplankton species, such as D. magna, could be used for the control of mosquito species such as Cx. pipiens. This approach could be beneficial for the management of wetlands.","[Duquesne, Sabine; Kroeger, Iris; Kutyniok, Magdalene; Liess, Matthias] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Umwelt Forsch Zentrum, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Duquesne, S (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Dept Conservat Biol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",Sabine.Duquesne@uba.de,"Duquesne, Sabine/H-5575-2011; Liess, Matthias/A-8582-2009","Liess, Matthias/0000-0002-3321-8909",UFZHelmholtz Association,"We acknowledge the technical staff of the Department of System Ecotoxicology for help during the experimental work, and Kaarina Foit for support for statistical analyses.

Many species of Lycaenidae (Lepidoptera) have food-for-protection mutualism with ants in their larval stages, where larvae produce nectar for ants and in return ants exclude parasitoids as well as predators. Myrmecophilous relationships are divided into two categories, obligate and facultative, by degrees of myrmecophily. Although parasitoids attacking obligate lycaenids always encounter lycaenid-specific ant species, parasitoids that use facultative lycaenids are likely to encounter diverse ant species showing various defense systems. However, we know little about the parasitoid community of facultative lycaenid larvae. In this study, we investigated the mutualistic ant and parasitoid communities of a facultative myrmecophilous species, Arhopala japonica, in seven localities in Japan. The present field observation newly recorded four ant species attending A. japonica larvae, and combined with the previous data, the number of attending ant species reached 16, which is nearly the maximum number of reported attending ant species among myrmecophilous lycaenids. However, the present study revealed that almost all parasitized A. japonica larvae were attacked by a single braconid species, Cotesia sp. near inducta. We also assessed the efficiency of facultative ant defense against the parasitoid in the laboratory and revealed that oviposition by Cotesia sp. near inducta females was almost completely hindered when A. japonica larvae were attended by ants. This suggests that the dominant parasitoid does not have effective traits to overcome defensive behavior of ants and that the female wasps oviposit mainly in A. japonica larvae without intensive attendance.","[Nakabayashi, Yui; Ohshima, Issei] Kyoto Prefectural Univ, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068522, Japan; [Nakabayashi, Yui; Mochioka, Yukari; Tokuda, Makoto] Saga Univ, Lab Syst Ecol, Fac Agr, Saga, Japan","Nakabayashi, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Prefectural Univ, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068522, Japan.",e_chinensis@yahoo.co.jp,,,Kyoto Prefectural University (KPU) Academic Promotion Fund,"We thank the late N.

I examined the effects of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), an omnivorous fish, on the reproductive success of the red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena), an avian gape-limited predator, along a fish size gradient created by stocking distinct age-cohorts in seminatural ponds. Young-of-the-year (0+) carp were an essential food source for young grebes. Only adult birds were able to consume 1-year-old (1+) fish, while 2-year-old (2+) fish attained a size refuge from grebes. Amphibian larvae were the principal alternative prey to fish, followed by macroinvertebrates, but the abundance of both dramatically decreased along the carp size gradient. Fledging success was 2.8 times greater in ponds with 0+ versus 1+ carp; in ponds with 1+ carp, chicks received on average 2.6-3 times less prey biomass from their parents, and over 1/3 of broods suffered total failure. Breeding birds avoided settling on 2+ ponds. These results show that changes in prey fish size structure can account for shifts from positive trophic effects on the avian predator to a negative impact on the predator's alternative resources. However, competition did not fully explain the decrease in grebe food resources in the presence of large fish, as carp and grebes overlapped little in diet. In experimental cages, 1+ carp totally eliminated young larvae of amphibians palatable to fish. In field conditions, breeding adults of palatable taxa avoided ponds with 1+ and older carp. Non-trophic interactions such as habitat selection by amphibians or macroinvertebrates to avoid large fish may provide an indirect mechanism strengthening the adverse bottom-up effects of fish on birds.","Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Nat Conservat Dept, Inst Biol, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland","Kloskowski, J (corresponding author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Nat Conservat Dept, Inst Biol, Akad 19, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland.",januszkl@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,"Kloskowski, Janusz/0000-0002-0525-2421","State Committee for Scientific ResearchPolish State Committee for Scientific Research [KBN 6 PO4F06620, 3 PO4F03623]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [MNiSW 2 P04G05030]","Thanks to J.

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in North America purportedly caused the displacement and local extirpation of the native ninespotted lady beetle, Coccinella novemnotata Herbst (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), across most of its former range, and several reports have shown that C. septempunctata maintains competitive advantages over C. novemnotata. We investigated the role of aphid density on the retention time of these two species on fava bean plants, and the effect of con-versus heterospecific pairings of adult beetles on the foraging behavior of C. novemnotata. We found that aphid density did not affect C. novemnotata's retention time, but did affect the retention time of C. septempunctata, which left plants without aphids significantly faster than C. novemnotata. Additionally, C. septempunctata females left plants significantly faster than their male counterparts, whereas we observed no difference between the two sexes for C. novemnotata. Our test of pairs of beetles showed that C. novemnotata were together on plants more frequently than conspecific pairs of C. septempunctata and heterospecific pairs of beetles, and that all beetles were more likely to be found together on the aphid-infested plant versus the non-infested plant regardless of the pairs' composition. These results show that C. novemnotata spend more time foraging for aphids when aphids are scarce compared with C. septempunctata, and that C. novemnotata is less tolerant of occupying plants inhabited by C. septempunctata versus a conspecific beetle, adding additional mechanisms whereby C. septempunctata could outcompete C. novemnotata in the field.","[Ugine, Todd A.; Hoki, Evan; Losey, John E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 169 Helios Circle, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hoki, Evan] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Ugine, TA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 169 Helios Circle, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tau2@cornell.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We would like to thank the Lost Lady Project participants for helping us to collect Coccinella novemnotata to start our colony, the National Science Foundation for project and salary support, Allison Power, the Cornell University Statistical Consulting Service, and the many undergraduates who contributed their time and knowledge toward the completion of this project.",,21,1,1,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

These studies usually exclude effects of soil fauna, such as nematodes, soil arthropods, and earthworms, although these organisms are known to influence plant performance. Here, we aimed to explore effects of a model microarthropod community on PSFs. We performed a PSF experiment in microcosms with two plant species, Phleum pratense and Poa pratensis. We added a model microarthropod community consisting of three fungivorous springtail species (Proisotoma minuta, Folsomia candida, and Sinella curviseta) and a predatory mite (Hypoaspis aculeifer) to half of the microcosms. We measured seedling establishment and plant biomass, nematode and microbial community composition, microbial biomass, and mycorrhizal colonization of roots. Microarthropods caused changes in the composition of nematode and microbial communities. Their effect was particularly strong in Phleum plants where they altered the composition of bacterial communities. Microarthropods also generally influenced plant performance, and their effects depended on previous soil conditioning and the identity of plant species. Microarthropods did not affect soil microbial biomass and mycorrhizal colonization of roots. We conclude that the role of soil microarthropods should be considered in future PSF experiments, especially as their effects are plant species-specific.","[Kutakova, Eliska; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic; [Kutakova, Eliska; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Czech Acad Sci, Vvi, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Kutakova, E (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic.; Kutakova, E (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Vvi, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic.",kutakova.eliska@gmail.com,"Cesarz, Simone/AAA-8702-2020; Kutakova, Eliska/I-6469-2016; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Cesarz, Simone/A-8468-2012; Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013","Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Kutakova, Eliska/0000-0003-1442-2848; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220",Czech grant agencyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [16-09659 S]; Charles University Mobility Fund; project M.S.M.T.

Predator psychology, especially how the predator learns and forgets, has recently been recognized as an important factor in a predator-prey system. This idea is supported by both theoretical and experimental evidence, but is also the source of a good deal of controversy because of its novel prediction that in a Model/Mimic relationship even a moderately unpalatable Mimic increases the risk of the Model (quasi-Batesian mimicry). Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a psychology-based Monte Carlo model simulation of mimicry that incorporates a Pavlovian'' predator that practices an optimal foraging strategy, and examined how various ecological and psychological factors affect the relationships between a Model prey species and its Mimic. The behavior of the predator in our model is consistent with that reported by experimental studies, but our simulation's predictions differed markedly from those of previous models of mimicry because a more abundant Mimic did not increase the predation risk of the Model when alternative prey were abundant. Moreover, a quasi-Batesian relationship emerges only when no or very few alternative prey items were available. Therefore, the availability of alternative prey rather than the precise method of predator learning critically determines the relationship between Model and Mimic. Moreover, the predation risk to the Model and Mimic is determined by the absolute density of the Model rather than by its density relative to that of the Mimic. Conclusions/Significance: Although these predictions are counterintuitive, they can explain various kinds of data that have been offered in support of competitive theories. Our model results suggest that to understand mimicry in nature it is important to consider the likely presence of alternative prey and the possibility that predation pressure is not constant.","[Honma, Atsushi; Nishida, Takayoshi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Kyoto, Japan; [Takakura, Koh-ichi] Osaka City Inst Publ Hlth & Environm Sci, Osaka, Japan","Honma, A (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Kyoto, Japan.",honma@ethol.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Kyoto University","AH was supported in part as a member of the 21st Century COE program for Innovative Food and Environmental Studies Pioneered by Entomomimetic Science from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, and also financially supported in part by the Global COE Program A06 to Kyoto University.

Important to this process are the habitat selection behaviors and subsequent survival of colonists, both in the context of temporal changes in the abiotic characteristics and priority effects driven by earlier colonists. Aquatic beetles are prevalent in temporary freshwater systems, form speciose assemblages, and are often early colonists of temporary ponds. While beetles have the potential to influence community structure through post-colonization interactions (predation and competition), our goal was to determine whether the presence of beetle assemblages (versus patches without beetles) influences the colonization and oviposition of a diverse group of animals in a naturally colonized experimental landscape. We established mesocosms that either contained existing beetle assemblages or contained no beetles and assessed abundances of subsequent colonists. Treefrogs,Hyla chrysoscelis, and mosquitoes,Culex restuans, both deposited fewer eggs in patches containing beetle assemblages, while two beetles,Copelatus glyphicusandParacymus, colonized those patches at lower rates. One beetle,Helophorus linearis, colonized patches containing beetle assemblages at higher rates, while two beetles,Berosus infuscatusandTropisternus lateralis, exhibited no colonization differences between treatments. Overall, there were no differences in the assemblage structure or richness of beetles that colonized patches. Our results illustrate the importance of species-specific habitat selection behavior in determining the species composition of habitat patches, while emphasizing the role of priority effects in influencing patterns of community assembly. Habitat selection in response to abiotic and biotic characteristics of habitat patches can potentially create greater spatiotemporal niche separation among the numerous, often closely related species (phylogenetically and trophically), that can be simultaneously found in similar patches across landscapes.","Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; Univ Mississippi, Ctr Water & Wetland Resources, University, MS 38677 USA; Univ Mississippi, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Res, University, MS 38677 USA; [Pintar, Matthew R.] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Pintar, MR (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",matthew.pintar@gmail.com,,"Pintar, Matthew/0000-0003-0165-3882",Henry L. and Grace Doherty Charitable Foundation; University of Mississippi,Henry L. and Grace Doherty Charitable Foundation; University of Mississippi,,95,4,4,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Cover crops are suggested to facilitate seed predation, but it is difficult to disentangle reductions in weed recruitment attributable to granivores from those due to plant competition. Using common lambsquarters as a focal weed species, we used experimental seed subsidies and differential seed predator exclusion to evaluate the utility of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators in fallow, killed cover crop, and living mulch systems. Over two growing seasons, we found that seed predators were responsible for a 38% reduction in seedling emergence and 81% reduction in weed biomass in fallow plots following simulated seed rain, suggesting that granivory indeed overcomes safe-site limitation and suppresses weeds. However, the common lambsquarters densities in ambient seedbanks across fallow and cover crop treatments were high, and seed predators did not impact their abundance. Across the study, we found either neutral or negative effects of vertebrate seed predators on seed predation, suggesting that invertebrate seed predators contribute most to common lamnsquarters regulation in our system. These results imply that weed seed biocontrol by invertebrates can reduce propagule pressure initially following senescence, but other tools must be leveraged for long-term seedbank management.","[Blubaugh, Carmen K.; Kaplan, Ian] Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",carmen.blubaugh@wsu.edu,,,Ceres Trust; USDA OREI grant [10-51300-21305],"This work was funded by a Ceres Trust and USDA OREI grant 10-51300-21305.

Group age structure should influence these costs and benefits, particularly when old and young larvae differ in their feeding mode or apparency to predators. We investigated the relative value of gregarious feeding by aposematic larvae of Uresiphita reversalis that we observed feeding in groups of mixed ages and variable densities on wild Lupinus diffusus. In a manipulative field experiment, the survivorship and growth of young larvae were enhanced in the presence of older conspecifics, but not in large groups of similarly aged larvae. Estimates of insect damage and induced plant responses suggest that mixed-age groups enhance plant quality for young larvae while avoiding competition. We conclude that benefits of gregariousness in this species are contingent on group age structure, a finding of significance for the ecology and evolution of gregariousness and other social behaviours.","[Campbell, Stuart A.; Stastny, Michael] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Campbell, Stuart A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Campbell, SA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",sa.campbell@utoronto.ca,"Campbell, Stuart/B-1494-2012",,Cornell University Sage Graduate Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (PGS-D)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We are grateful to the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Cornell University, for supporting the field work in Florida, the ABS for housing and logistical support, Heron's Garden Restaurant and Lounge (Lake Placid, FL) for providing some experimental materials, Mark Deyrup (ABS), Marc Lajeunesse, Peter Marks, Dick Root and particularly Jed Sparks (Cornell University) for advice, and S.

The herbivores (hermit crabs: Pagurus spp.) have slow and/or weak functional and numerical responses to epiphytic diatoms (Isthmia nervosa), which show logistic growth in the absence of consumers. By isolating this interaction in containers in the field, I mimicked many of the physical and biological variables characteristic of the intertidal while controlling the densities of focal species. The per capita effects of consumers on the population dynamics of their resource (i.e., interaction strength) were defined by using the relationship between hermit crab density and proportional change in the resource. When this relationship is fit by a Weibull function, a single parameter distinguishes constant interaction strength from one that varies as a function of density. Constant interaction strength causes the proportion of diatoms to fall linearly or proportionally as hermit crab density increases whereas per capita effects that increase with density cause an accelerating decline, Although many mathematical models of species interactions assume linear dynamics and invariant parameters, at least near equilibrium, the per capita effects of hermit crabs on diatoms varied substantially, apparently crossing a threshold from weak to strong when consumption exceeded resource production. This threshold separates a domain of coexistence from one of local extinction of the resource, Such thresholds may help explain trophic cascades, resource compensation, and contest-dependent interaction strengths, while indicating a way to predict trophic effects, despite nonlinearities, as a function of vital rates.","Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Ruesink, JL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Ctr Biodivers Res, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",ruesink@zoology.ubc.ca,,,,,,53,42,42,0,22,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

They have been found to be preferentially active at night low tides. To understand the role of these (and other) predators, it is important to understand how they find their prey on tidal flats. Field observations revealed that the nemertine Lineus viridis feeds on post-spawn Nereis virens in the spring. Field experiments demonstrated that the placement of post-spawn or freeze-thawed N, virens on tidal flats can elicit a foraging response of L. viridis. Nemertines came to the sediment surface in large numbers and crawled toward the prey. Comparative experiments showed that more nemertines were attracted to the sediment surface at day low tides than at day high tides. More nemertines were attracted at night low tides than at day low tides. Numbers of active nemertines on tidal flat areas without prey were always much lower than on tidal flat areas with prey. In an experimental flume in the laboratory, starved nemertines were attracted to prey at current velocities of about 2 cm s(-1). Regardless of whether it was a simulated high tide or low tide in the flume, successful nemertines required about 30 min to cover a distance of 50 cm between the starting point and the prey. It is concluded that the high activity of nemertines during night low tides is due in part to the enhanced probability of locating prey, but is also influenced by prey behavior and potential competitors. Predatory nemertines such as L. viridis easily cover relatively large distances of 5-10 m in the field, and may thus effectively influence the small-scale distribution of their potential prey on tidal flats. It is proposed to take the activity pattern, mobility and foraging range of predators into account when examining their role in marine soft-bottom assemblages.","Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA","Thiel, M (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.",,,,,,,43,18,18,2,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,,1998,365,,,,,,241,250,,,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,114XX,WOS:000075635400021,,,,,2021-09-27,

Understanding the mechanisms that afford invasive species their ecological success as important agents of global change is key to addressing their biodiversity impacts. Species invasions that occur on small islands are especially detrimental and suggest that invaders intensify their ecological impacts by exploiting novel ecological functions. However, it remains unknown whether such strong impacts are also a consequence of an invader's indirect effect (e.g. causing physiological stress or reproductive failure) on island species. Therefore, it is valuable to quantify the physiological mechanisms through which invasive species can exert indirect effects on the performance, and ultimately the fitness of island endemics. 2. In this study, we investigated whether the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) caused indirect competitive impacts on the endemic Fijian ground frog (Platymantis vitiana) on the small (60ha) Viwa Island, Fiji. We used large (4x10000m(2)), natural and replicated enclosures to monitor ground frog stress hormone levels, reproductive hormone cycle, body condition, breeding and survival in the presence/absence of the cane toad. We conducted monthly sampling to analyse annual patterns in testosterone for males, estradiol and progesterone for females, corticosterone for both sexes and body condition of ground frogs in replicated enclosures or natural habitats with high/low cane toad densities. We also measured survival and reproductive success of ground frogs in enclosures. 3. Results showed that in both enclosures and natural habitats with high cane toad densities, ground frogs had a significant reduction in body condition, increased urinary corticosterone metabolites and suppressed sex steroid metabolites. Most importantly, annual field surveys showed significant reduction in ground frog reproductive success (fewer eggs were laid in enclosures with toads present); however, survival was not severely reduced. 4. Our study clearly demonstrated that on small islands, invasive species may exploit broader ecological roles with strong indirect effects that amplify their impacts beyond those seen on continents. Overall, the effects of cane toad competition had the capacity to strongly reduce ground frog reproductive success. We strongly advocate management actions that either minimize invasion or limit the strength of invasive-native species interactions (e.g. through habitat conservation) to prevent further extinctions on islands.","[Narayan, Edward J.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Anim & Vet Sci, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia; [Narayan, Edward J.; Hero, Jean-Marc] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Environm Futures Res Inst, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia; [Jessop, Tim S.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Jessop, Tim S.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Waurn Ponds, Vic 3220, Australia","Narayan, EJ (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Anim & Vet Sci, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.",enarayan@csu.edu.au,"Jessop, Tim/Q-2473-2019; Narayan, Edward/E-8238-2016","Narayan, Edward/0000-0003-2719-0900; Jessop, Tim S./0000-0002-7712-4373",Rufford Small Grants for Nature Conservation (Booster Grant) [10205-B],"We thank the people of Viwa Island for helping with the field experiments, and Viwa youths (Inoke Basoko and Taina Malo) for managing the day-to-day fieldwork.

Chemical effects on organisms are typically assessed using individual-level endpoints or sometimes population growth rate (PGR), but such measurements are generally made at low population densities. In contrast most natural populations are subject to density dependence and fluctuate around the environmental carrying capacity as a result of individual competition for resources. As ecotoxicology aims to make reliable population projections of chemical impacts in the field, an understanding of how high-density or resource-limited populations respond to environmental chemicals is essential. 2. Our objective was to determine the joint effects of population density and chemical stress on the life history and PGR of an important ecotoxicological indicator species, Chironomus riparius, under controlled laboratory conditions. Populations were fed the same ration but initiated at different densities and exposed to a solvent control and three concentrations of C-14-cypermethrin in a sediment-water test system for 67 days at 20 +/- 1 degreesC. 3. Density had a negative effect on all the measured life-history traits, and PGR declined with increasing density in the controls. Exposure to C-14-cypermethrin had a direct negative effect on juvenile survival, presumably within the first 24 h because the chemical rapidly dissipated from the water column. Reductions in the initial larval densities resulted in an increase in the available resources for the survivors. Subsequently, exposed populations emerged sooner and started producing offspring earlier than the controls. C-14-cypermethrin had no effect on estimated fecundity and adult body weight but interacted with density to reduce the time to first emergence and first reproduction. As a result, PGR increased with cypermethrin concentration when populations were initiated at high densities. 4. Synthesis and applications. The results showed that the effects of C-14-cypermethrin were buffered at high density, so that the joint effects of density and chemical stress on PGR were less than additive. Low levels of chemical stressors may increase carrying capacity by reducing juvenile competition for resources. More and perhaps fitter adults may be produced, similar to the effects of predators and culling; however, toxicant exposure may result in survivors that are less tolerant to changing conditions. If less than additive effects are typical in the field, standard regulatory tests carried out at low density may overestimate the effects of environmental chemicals. Further studies over a wide range of chemical stressors and organisms with contrasting life histories are needed to make general recommendations.","Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England; Syngenta Crop Proctect AG, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; AstraZeneca UK Ltd, Brixham Environm Lab, Brixham TQ5 8BA, Devon, England","Hooper, HL (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, POB 228, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England.",h.l.hooper@reading.ac.uk,,"Sibly, Richard/0000-0001-6828-3543; Hutchinson, Tom/0000-0001-8823-5442",,,,46,25,28,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

In such a one-predator-two-prey system, indirect interactions can occur between the two pest species, such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism. Whereas apparent competition is desired because it brings pest levels down, apparent mutualism is not, because it does the opposite. Because apparent competition and apparent mutualism. occurs at different time scales, it is important to investigate the effects of a shared natural enemy on biological control on a time scale relevant for crop growth. We evaluated the control efficacy of the predatory mites Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) and Euseius ovalis (Evans) in cucumber crops in greenhouse compartments with only thrips, only whiteflies or both herbivorous insects together. Each of the two predators controlled thrips, but A. swirskii reduced thrips densities the most. There was no effect of the presence of whiteflies on thrips densities. Whitefly control by each of the two predators in absence of thrips was not sufficient, yet better with E. ovalis. However, whitefly densities in presence of thrips were reduced dramatically, especially by A. swirskii. The densities of predators were up to 15 times higher in presence of both pests than in the single-pest treatments. Laboratory experiments with A. swirskii suggest that this is due to a higher juvenile survival and developmental rate on a mixed diet. Hence, better control may be achieved not only because of apparent competition, but also through a positive effect of mixed diets on predator population growth. This latter phenomenon deserves more attention in experimental and theoretical work on biological control and apparent competition. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Early instars of both species showed no significant effect of intraspecific larval density on mean growth rates, despite the observation that in the absence of competitors stoneflies ate on average, significantly more prey (Baetis bicaudatus, Ephemeroptera, Baetidae) than in the presence of competitors. However, larval size of stoneflies held at higher densities (two per chamber) diverged over time, resulting in a greater size variability (coefficient of variation) among Kogotus than in treatments with low densities of stoneflies (one per chamber). The effect of doubling the density of early-instar Megarcys larvae was also asymmetrical, resulting in one larger and one smaller individual. In contrast, doubling the density of last-instar stoneflies whose feeding rates declined significantly prior to emergence had few measurable consequences, except that male Megarcys, which continued to feed throughout the last instar, had lower average feeding rates in high-density than in low-density chambers, and emerged at a significantly smaller mean size. We conclude that competition between early-instar stonefly larvae results in an asymmetry of body sizes, but that competitive effects are reduced as larvae slow or cease feeding before emergence. Since larger females of both stonefly species produced more eggs, the probable cost to females of early-instar larval competition was a reduction in their potential contribution of offspring to the next generation. The cost of attaining a smaller body size for male stoneflies is unknown; but if, as in many other insects, larger males have greater reproductive success, larval competition may increase the opportunity for sexual selection among males. This hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA","PECKARSKY, BL (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,69,65,71,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,88,2,,,,,277,288,,10.1007/BF00320823,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GM331,WOS:A1991GM33100020,28312144,,,,2021-09-27,

Next to these engineering activities, competition, disturbance and predation may also affect the spatial distribution of these smaller organisms. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we studied the effects of 3 functionally different macrobenthic species on the vertical distribution of nematodes. Abra alba, a suspension-deposit feeding bivalve reworking the sediment randomly, Lanice conchilega, a suspension-deposit feeding, tube-irrigating polychaete and Nephtys hombergii, a burrowing predatory polychaete, were added in single-species treatments to sediment from a coastal subtidal station in the Belgian part of the North Sea, sieved (1 mm) to remove macrofauna. After 14 d, the control treatment without macrobenthos was found to be detrimental to nematode density and diversity, which points to the importance of macrobenthic engineering to sustain the smaller components of the food web. Nematode densities were highest at the sediment surface in all treatments, but subsurface density peaks were observed in A. alba (to 3 cm depth) and L. conchilega (to 7 cm depth) microcosms. In the A. alba treatment, the dominant non-selective deposit feeders and the epistrate feeders shifted downwards probably to avoid disturbance and exploitative competition by the bivalve siphons at the surface, while they might have benefited from the faecal pellets deposited in the subsurface. In the L. conchilega treatment, the several dominant species were redistributed over depth layers, indicating polychaete-mediated habitat extension from surface into depth.

These results reveal that functionally contrasting macrobenthic engineering effects shape nematode communities in different ways, which may maintain the role of nematodes in ecosystem functioning.

Attack by multiple enemies may give rise to indirect interactions, the nature of which may be influenced by the abiotic environment. We conducted a field experiment to determine (1) whether indirect interactions arose between Centaurea solstitialis, a foliar pathogen and three insect seed predators and (2) how the outcome was influenced by soil type (serpentine and non-serpentine). Because serpentine soils support high numbers of endemic species they are a priority for conservation. They also have very low calcium concentrations and Ca++ regulates plants' ability to defend against pathogen infection. C. solstitialis growing on serpentine soil may therefore be more vulnerable to the pathogen and this may in turn affect the plant's subsequent interactions with seed predators. We found that pathogen infection had a direct, negative impact on plant performance but its impact was not greater on serpentine plants. When attacked by the seed predators, inflorescences produced more viable seed when they were on plants infected with the pathogen than when they were on uninfected plants and the data suggest that this reflects reductions in larval seed-feeding. On the non-serpentine soil, the pathogen's direct, negative impact was entirely canceled out by its indirect, positive effect via reduced seed predation. On the serpentine soil, plants attacked by the pathogen and the insect seed predators produced half as many seeds than plants attacked only by the seed predators. Our results demonstrate that biocontrol agent interactions may be modified by the plant and by the abiotic environment in a way that fundamentally alters their net impact on the weed.","[Swope, Sarah M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Stein, Ilana R.] Mills Coll, Dept Biol, Oakland, CA 94613 USA","Swope, SM (corresponding author), USDA, Great Basin Rangeland Res Unit, 920 Valley Rd, Reno, NV 89512 USA.",sarah.swope@ars.usda.gov,,,"Jill Barrett Biology Research Program, Mills College; USDA ARS Exotic and Invasive Weeds Research Unit","Special thanks to John Harris (Mills College, Oakland, CA).

But many communities also include generalized species whose habitat use overlaps that of the specialists. Two hypotheses seem most likely to account for the pattern. iii Habitat generalists may coexist in competitively structured communities by exploiting habitats unused, or underused, by habitat specialists. (2) Population densities of the specialized species may be limited (e.g., by predation) below levels where the specialists can competitively exclude habitat generalists. I evaluated these ideas in a community of small mammals occupying mesic and xeric habitats at nine different locations in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, Canada. A chipmunk generalist coexists with two specialists, one with a distinct preference for xeric habitat (deer mouse), and another with a similar preference for mesic habitat (red-backed vole). Habitat selection appeared to depend primarily on the density of conspecifics. The generalist coexisted by responding to habitat al a larger scale than did the specialists. Shared predators, whose habitat selection operates on a larger scale than that of their prey, may augment coexistence of all species by reinforcing habitat selection by the specialists.","LAKEHEAD UNIV, FAC FORESTRY, THUNDER BAY, ON P7B 5E1, CANADA","Morris, DW (corresponding author), LAKEHEAD UNIV, DEPT BIOL, CTR NO STUDIES, THUNDER BAY, ON P7B 5E1, CANADA.",,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",,,,55,127,136,6,82,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1996,77,8,,,,,2352,2364,,10.2307/2265737,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VY497,WOS:A1996VY49700008,,,,,2021-09-27,

Its literature is classically scientific in the sense that it combines pattern discovery, theory, and empirical testing. It is, implicitly, one of the significant demonstrations that general ecological principles exist and can be discovered by hypothetico-deductive methodologies. I outline the development of the topic in the context of two questions, both of which take it as an assumption that habitat selection is an optimal-foraging process. How does habitat selection alter (or reinforce) the dynamics of population interactions? How do those interactions alter the optimal behavior? Competition within a single species forces the use of a wide variety of habitats. This has been shown in many taxa, and Fretwell's theory gives it a sound basis in evolutionary ecology. In other words, we ecologists know that the pattern exists, and we know why it exists. Ecologists are capitalizing on their understanding of single-species habitat selection to design methods for comparing fitnesses (and components of fitnesses) in different habitats. It has been known for 40 yr that a second, competing species can reverse the effects of competition within a species, producing habitat selection where it would not otherwise exist. For the past decade, however, we have been discovering that this effect is really a cluster of effects. Whether competition restores selectivity depends on the kind of competition at work and on the information-gathering abilities of foragers. So does the extent to which it is restored. Generally, the strongest separation of species by habitat selection results from distinct-preference competition between species whose individuals have very limited abilities to assess the density of food in a patch. (This model yields the ghost of competition past.) But if individuals have much ability to assess food density, there is little or no increase likely in their selectivity compared with the single-species case. Other sorts of competition produce intermediate results. The effects of interspecific competition on habitat selection have been investigated with theory and experiment working closely together. The by-products of the combination have been that new sorts of competitive relationship have been suggested and that it has been possible to compare these relationships with those suggested from other areas of investigation such as plant-herbivore interactions, succession, and plant specializations. Habitat selection may stabilize predation as well as competition. Sih has shown that the conditions required for stabilization closely resemble those predicted by optimal-foraging theory: Victims need to prefer the safer habitat most when their populations are lowest or when their chance of being killed in the riskier habitat is highest. Numerous experiments show that foragers behave appropriately to protect themselves from predation. Multispecies studies emphasize the potential for differential susceptibility and optimal habitat selection to maintain diverse communities. Despite, or perhaps because of, the rich understanding that the study of habitat selection has already engendered, many new and exciting topics are emerging. Perhaps the most challenging is the combination of time scales that allows pheotypes to change morphologically and physiologically as well as behaviorally. It seems probable that investigators interested in these topics will continue to receive substantial payoffs for their efforts.","UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,,,,,,57,407,410,2,141,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

The impact of A. amurensis on a soft sediment assemblage in SE Tasmania was quantified, with particular attention to effects of seastar predation on the survivorship of recently settled juveniles of the commercial bivalve Fulvia tenuicostata. In a manipulative experiment, densities of F tenuicostata juveniles were reduced by ca. 15 fold (from 580 to 35 m(-2)) in the presence of seastars at background densities relative to the treatment without seastars. In a feeding survey, A. amurensis exhibited preference for F tenuicostata following settlement of the bivalve over the period from December 1997 to January 1998, which comprised 80 and 50% of the seastar's stomach items in February 1998 and April 1998, respectively. However, A. amurensis preferred a variety of other prey taxa when the abundance of F tenuicostata was low, particularly other bivalves, gastropods and the echinoid Echinocardium cordatum. This indicates that the seastar may potentially affect the abundance of other prey taxa. The results provide further support to the hypothesis that predation by A. amurensis is largely responsible for the recent decline and subsequent rarity of large bivalves in its current distribution in Tasmania. The potential of seastar predation to have wider ecosystem level effects than the short-term direct effects reported here is a major concern.","Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Sandy Bay, Tas 7001, Australia; CSIRO Marine Res, Ctr Res Introduced Marine Pests, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Ross, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",rossdj@unimelb.edu.au,"Hewitt, Chad L/J-2105-2019; Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012; Johnson, Craig R/E-1788-2013; Hewitt, Chad L/C-4460-2008","Hewitt, Chad L/0000-0002-6859-6512; Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Johnson, Craig R/0000-0002-9511-905X; Hewitt, Chad L/0000-0002-6859-6512",,,,59,55,59,1,39,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Wintering shorebirds are often disturbed by people and raptorial predators, causing them to loose feeding time and making it more difficult for them to meet their high energy demands. Previous work on captive oystercatchers, Haematopus ostralegus, suggests that they may be able to compensate for the lost time by increasing the rate at which they feed, but it is not known whether free-living oystercatchers can do so. This paper tests this possibility on five individually marked wild oystercatchers feeding on mussels Mytilus edulis. 2. Each marked bird was monitored continuously throughout tidal exposure periods between August 1993 and February 1994 on days during which disturbance either did or did not occur. The disturbance was either natural (raptors) or human, this either arising from shellfishermen or being experimentally induced. 3. A multiple regression model was built for each bird using data only from undisturbed days to establish trends in intake rate associated with environmental factors, such as competitor density, the season and state of the tide. These were used to predict the intake rate that would have been expected to occur, had the disturbance not taken place. These expected 'undisturbed rates' were then compared to the actual rates after a disturbance had occurred. 4. The 'disturbed' and 'undisturbed' rates were not significantly different, either in the immediate post-disturbance period or over the remainder of the exposure period. Plots of cumulative biomass consumption showed that individual birds on disturbed days took longer to achieve a given consumption than on undisturbed days. Contrary to the hypothesis, there is no evidence that these birds increased their rate of feeding to compensate for lost feeding time. Instead, they extended their feeding time by remaining longer on the mussel bed. When time losses due to disturbance are rather short (30-60 min), the results suggest that there is some 'slack' in the system which oystercatchers are able to exploit to compensate for time lost through disturbance. 5. Studies on three sites with differing frequency of disturbance by people suggest that the birds are able to habituate to the frequent presence of people and to reduce the distance at which they take flight, thus reducing the amount of time lost to disturbance in the first place.","INST TERR ECOL, FURZEBROOK RES STN, WAREHAM BH20 5AS, DORSET, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,18,46,51,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

A next step in understanding these interactions is to decouple the impacts of both spatial and trophic ingredients of complexity to explicitly explore the trade-offs between the habitat, its effects on foraging success, and the competition that ensues as predator densities increase. We quantified the accumulation of spiders and their prey in habitat islands with different habitat complexities created in the field using natural plants, plant debris and plastic plant mimics. Spiders were observed at higher densities in the complex habitat structure composed of both live plants and thatch. However, the numerically dominant predator in the system, the wolf spider Pardosa milvina, was observed at high densities in habitat islands containing plastic mimics of plants and thatch. In a laboratory experiment, we examined the interactive effects of conspecific density and habitat on the prey capture of P. milvina. Thatch, with or without vertical plant structure, reduced prey capture, but the plastic fiber did not. Pairwise interactions among spiders reduced prey capture, but this effect was moderated by thatch. Taken together, these experiments highlight the flexibility of one important predator in the food web, where multiple environmental cues intersect to explain the role of habitat complexity in determining generalist predator accumulation.","[Schmidt, Jason M.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Rypstra, Ann L.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Schmidt, JM (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 212 Pearson Hall,700 E High St, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",schmid10@muohio.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI 0216776, DBI 0116947]; Department of Zoology and Hamilton Campus of Miami University","We thank M.

The disturbance regime is made up of drought periods in the marshes and of predation. The density of diaspores buried in the sediment was measured in 4 consecutive years together with the biomass produced during two growing seasons. The total density of diaspores in the sediment varied markedly from year to year but always remained at a high level for all species (between 73000 and 800000 per m(2)). These perennial seed banks allowed the populations to be maintained despite two successive years without any reproduction. In experimental conditions, the seed bank was not depleted after the sediment samples had been submerged during 5 successive periods. The majority of the seedlings emerged as soon as the first period of flooding and temporary droughts stimulated the germination of Zannichellia spp. and Ranunculus baudotii. The decrease in the number of seeds buried in the soil was essentially due to germination. This was stronger when the seeds were recently produced and situated at the surface of the sediment. The seed density varied only slightly with the depth of the marsh, except in the case of Ruppia maritima. The seed bank is highly variable on a spatial microscale bur no aggregation pattern could be demonstrated. In the field, the biomass of a population generally appeared not to be limited by the availability of the diaspores, notably because of the ability to propagate vegetatively which is shown by all species studied. Similarly, a high vegetative biomass does not guarantee a high reproductive output as the droughts occur in a density-independent way. The success of a species is related to the interaction between its life history traits and the environmental conditions met each year. The macrophyte communities we studied function in non-equilibrium, with patterns close to those described in lottery models of coexistence. Establishment, growth and reproduction fluctuate strongly from one year to another for all species, in a partially asynchronous way. This would enable competitive exclusion to be indefinitely delayed. The seed bank introduces a storage effect by magnifying the effect of the ''favourable years'' in comparison with the ''bad years''.","CNRS,CEFE,F-34033 MONTPELLIER,FRANCE; BIOL STN,F-13200 LE SAMBUC,FRANCE",,,,,,,,59,125,132,0,36,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1995,74,1,,,,,81,92,,10.2307/3545677,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TJ359,WOS:A1995TJ35900009,,,,,2021-09-27,

Anuran larvae are important components of pond food webs: they are abundant, consume large quantities of food and serve as prey for many organisms. However, there are very basic uncertainties about the feeding ecology of anuran larvae; for instance, as to which trophic level they belong and whether species differ in resource use. Because anuran larvae have been employed in model systems in experimental ecology for decades, these uncertainties could lead to misinterpretation of published experiments, or inadequate designs of experiments directed at general, conceptual issues in ecology. Using C-13 and N-15 stable isotope and gut content analyses of free-ranging and enclosed tadpoles of four ranid species (Lithobates sylvaticus, L. pipiens, L. clamitans, L. catesbeianus) in the food webs of six wetlands, we tested the following null hypotheses: (i) that anuran larvae are strict primary consumers; (ii) that they are non-selective feeders and therefore exhibit little feeding niche differentiation; (iii) that they are opportunistic consumers and (iv) that their diet remains unchanged through ontogeny. All four species consumed and assimilated substantial amounts of animal food; bullfrog larvae, in particular, appear to be predatory. Significant feeding niche differentiation among species occurred with respect to the sources of carbon, consumption of animal matter and nutritional quality of food ingested. We further documented opportunistic feeding habits and ontogenetic shifts in diet. Collectively, these studies revealed complex trophic relationships that might require a reconsideration of the role of anuran larvae in pond food webs, as well as a reinterpretation of results of previous studies employing anuran larvae in model experimental systems.","[Schiesari, Luis; Werner, Earl E.; Kling, George W.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Schiesari, L (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lschiesa@usp.br,"Kling, George W/C-7867-2015; Schiesari, Luis C/E-8624-2012","Kling, George W/0000-0002-6349-8227; Schiesari, Luis C/0000-0003-0814-591X","American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (Gaige Fund Award); American Museum of Natural History (Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Fund); University of Michigan, the National Science FoundationUniversity of Michigan SystemNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0423385, DEB-9911278]; Brazilian Government's Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [200093/97-5]","We thank Don Zak and Bill Holmes for the isotopic analysis and Jana Gastellum for C : N analysis.

Correlated with an estimated decline of similar to 89% in the red colobus population was an increase in encounter rates with chimpanzee parties. Our data, along with the unusually high rates of predation by chimpanzees on red colobus at Ngogo and the fact that the chimpanzee community at Ngogo is the largest ever recorded, support the conclusion that the red colobus decline was caused primarily by chimpanzee predation. This seems to be the first documented case of predation by one nonhuman primate causing the population decline in another. We evaluated disease and interspecific competition as other possible causes of the red colobus decline, but judged them to be relatively insignificant compared with predation by chimpanzees. Notable changes in encounter rates with other primate species may have resulted from forest expansion. Those for mangabeys, redtails, and black and white colobus increased significantly. Encounter rates increased for l'Hoest's monkeys too, but the increased sightings may have been an artifact of increased habituation. Sightings of blue monkey and baboon groups declined. There was no significant change in encounter rates for all species combined. The Ngogo primate community seemed to be in a nonequilibrium state, changing from one dominated by two species, a folivore (red colobus) and a frugivorous omnivore (redtails), to one dominated by three species of frugivorous omnivores (redtails, mangabeys, and chimpanzees).

Upon arrival in new environments, invaders must overcome biotic resistance from native competitors and predators if they are to establish successfully in natural habitats. We tested the hypotheses that (1) artificial structures (e. g., suspended aquaculture installations) present a niche opportunity for invasive species by providing a refuge from native benthic predators, and (2) native predators in natural benthic habitats suppress successful colonization by invaders. A recruitment experiment showed that the ascidians Pyura chilensis (native) and Ciona intestinalis (invasive) could recruit to both suspended artificial structures and natural benthic habitats. Ciona, however, was only able to establish adult populations on artificial structures. In natural benthic habitats Ciona only recruited and grew in predator-exclusion cages, because without this protection predation prevented its establishment. In predation experiments, native invertebrate and fish predators removed all invasive ascidians (recruits and adults) in benthic habitats, which contrasted with the high adult survival of the native ascidian P. chilensis. The refuge from a number of benthic predators facilitates the establishment of large populations of invasive species on suspended structures. We present a conceptual model of the invasion processes that includes the anthropogenic structures as a transitional stepping-stone that facilitates invasion by enhancing and prolonging propagule supply to surrounding natural communities. Those established invaders might then overcome biotic resistance during time periods when populations of consumers or competitors are weakened by natural or anthropogenic disturbances. Our results suggest that the conservation of natural habitats with a high diversity of native predators can be an effective means to prevent the spread of invasive species growing on suspended structures.","[Dumont, C.

Here we examined how territoriality and nest-digging by anadromous salmon mediate trophic subsidies to stream fishes. Salmon eggs become available for consumption primarily by the digging of salmon that superimpose their nests on previous nests. An individual-based model of spawning salmon predicted that territoriality and habitat saturation produce a nonlinear effect of salmon density on numbers of available eggs to resident predators. Field studies in Alaskan streams found that higher densities of salmon produce disproportionately more eggs in stream drift and in diets of resident fishes ( Arctic grayling and rainbow trout). Bioenergetics model simulations indicated that these subsidies produce substantially enhanced growth rates of trout. These results demonstrate that small changes in salmon abundance can drive large changes in subsidies to stream food webs. Thus, the ecological consequences of population declines of keystone species, such as salmon, will be exacerbated when behavior generates nonlinear impacts.","[Moore, Jonathan W.; Schindler, Daniel E.; Ruff, Casey P.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Moore, JW (corresponding author), NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",jonathan.moore@noaa.gov,,,,,,31,60,61,0,43,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2008,89,2,,,,,306,312,,10.1890/07-1269.1,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,276EN,WOS:000254124200002,18409419,,,,2021-09-27,

Nitrogen was depleted relative to phosphorus throughout most of the year. Increasing nitrogen (6-200% over ambient concentrations) enhanced algal productivity and cover of fast-growing annual algae, grazer, and predator densities, suggesting a three-level bottom-up effect. With increasing nitrogen loading, annual algae increasingly blocked perennial algal recruitment (65-98% decrease) and growth. Grazers counteracted the effects of nutrient enrichment on algal species composition through selective consumption of annual algae. Grazer exclusion had equivalent negative effects on perennial recruitment as a 85% increase in nitrogen loading. Nutrient enrichment increased algal nitrogen content and decreased tissue C:N ratios in spring and summer but not in fall. Carbon storage and nitrogen retention, measured as C and N retained in plant biomass at the end of the growth season, were increased by grazers (C: 39%, N: 24%) but decreased with increasing nitrogen loading (C: -71%, N: -74%). Our results emphasize the important role of grazers in buffering moderate eutrophication effects and illustrate how food web interactions and shifts in species composition are tightly linked to coastal ecosystem function.","Inst Meereskunde, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Worm, B (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",bworm@is.dal.ca,,"Worm, Boris/0000-0002-5742-8716; Lotze, Heike/0000-0001-6258-1304",,,,52,123,127,0,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

The short time required to hatch and develop from egg to adult, usually in temporary pools, suggests a strategy which allows for exploitation of transient pools, thus evading predation and interspecific competition. Under these conditions intra specific competition could represent a major density-dependent source of larval mortality, but the relative importance of density-dependent regulation of mosquito populations has generated controversy. Therefore we examined the effects of larval density on basic population characteristics of Ae. albifasciatus in the laboratory. Larvae were obtained by synchronous hatching of eggs laid by field-trapped females. Emerging larvae (L1) were used to build cohorts of different initial densities, kept in plastic trays with 400 ml of distilled water, and food supplied daily during the first 10 days (0.1 g per larvae day(-)1). Age-specific development time and specific and relative mortality were estimated, and their relation to initial larval density was assessed through linear and non-linear regressions and correlation analysis. First hatching was registered 3 h after flooding the eggs. Higher levels of pre-adult mortality were detected in groups with higher densities. Specific mortality and average time to enter a stage of L1 to L3 could directly be related to initial larval density, but no significant relations were found for L4 and pupae. Results suggest that crowding could be a factor capable of regulating the density of natural populations of Ae. albifasciatus.","Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, Mendoza & Entre Rios, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina","Gleiser, RM (corresponding author), Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, Mendoza & Entre Rios, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina.",,"Gorla, David/AAX-3360-2020","Gorla, David/0000-0002-9323-9365",,,,17,22,25,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

If particular functional traits characterize the favored plant species, then defaunation may alter community-wide patterns of functional trait composition. Changes in plant functional traits occurring with defaunation may help identify the species interactions affected by defaunation and the potential for other cascading effects of defaunation. We tested the hypotheses that defaunation would (1) disrupt seed dispersal, thereby favoring species whose dispersal agents are not affected (e.g., small birds, bats, and abiotic agents), (2) reduce seed predation, thereby favoring larger-seeded species, and (3) reduce herbivory, thereby favoring species with lower leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf toughness, and wood density. We examined how these six traits responded to vertebrate defaunation caused by hunters or by experimental exclosures among more than 30000 woody seedlings in a lowland tropical moist forest. Exclosures reduced terrestrial frugivores, granivores, and herbivores, while hunters also reduced volant and arboreal frugivores and granivores. The comparison of exclosures and hunting allowed us to parse the impacts of arboreal and volant species (reduced by hunters only) and terrestrial species (reduced by both hunters and exclosures). The loss of terrestrial vertebrates alone had limited effects on plant trait composition. The additional loss of volant and arboreal vertebrates caused significant shifts in plant species composition towards communities with more species dispersed abiotically, including lianas and low wood-density tree species, and fewer species dispersed by large vertebrates. In contrast to previous studies, community seed mass did not decline significantly in hunted sites. Our exclosure results suggest this is because reducing seed predators disproportionately benefits large-seeded species, partially compensating for the reduction of seed dispersers at hunted sites. Our results demonstrate that decreased seed dispersal and seed predation are important determinants of seedling community compositional change as a consequence of defaunation. Defaunation may also negatively impact carbon storage in tropical forests, by favoring lianas and low wood density tree species.","[Kurten, Erin L.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wright, S.

Natural enemies of herbivorous pests in cropping systems often benefit from the presence of natural habitats in surrounding landscapes, as they provide key resources such as alternative hosts. However, any benefits from a biological control perspective may be dampened if this also enhances enemies at the fourth trophic level. Remarkably, studies of the influence of landscape structure on diversity and interactions of fourth trophic-level natural enemies are largely lacking. We carried out a large-scale sampling study to investigate the effects of landscape complexity (i.e. the proportion of non-crop habitat in the landscapes surrounding focal study areas) on the parasitoid communities of aphids in wheat and on an abundant extra-field plant, stinging nettle. Primary parasitoid communities (3rd trophic level) attacking the cereal aphid, Sitobion avenae, had little overlap with the communities attacking the nettle aphid, Microlophium carnosum, while secondary parasitoids (4th trophic level) showed high levels of species overlap across these two aphids (25 vs 73% shared species respectively), resulting in significantly higher linkage density and lower specialization for secondary than primary parasitoid webs. In wheat, parasitoid diversity was not related to landscape complexity for either primary or secondary parasitoids. Rates of primary parasitism were generally low, while secondary parasitism rates were high (37-94%) and increased significantly with increasing landscape complexity, although this pattern was driven by a single secondary parasitoid species. Overall, our results demonstrate that extra-field habitats and landscape complexity can differentially benefit fourth, over third, trophic level natural enemies, and thereby, could dampen biological control. Our results further suggest that fourth trophic-level enemies may play an important, yet understudied, role in linking insect population dynamics across habitat types.","[Rand, Tatyana A.] ARS, USDA, No Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA; [van Veen, F.

To assess the putative ecological impact of such unconstrained foraging activities the infratidal macrofaunal assemblages at three exploited sites were contrasted with those at two adjacent non-exploited sites. Comparisons of community-level attributes were based on a variety of univariate, graphical and multivariate techniques. Two-way nested anovas revealed that trends in species richness and diversity were not consistent with the presence/absence of exploitation. The apparent conflict between these results and expectations based on Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis appear to be related to differences in the competitive abilities of ''early'' and ''late'' successional species on these shores. Macrofaunal biomass was the only univariate parameter to show significant treatment effects. Although the repeated pulse disturbance regime associated with exploitation differs from the sustained press regime imposed on pollution-impacted communities, their respective abundance/biomass curves show similar trends. Multivariate analyses, in the form of dendrograms, multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordinations and SIMPER routines, derived from Bray-Curtis measures of similarity based on abundance and biomass data, provided the most clear-cut discrimination between exploited and non-exploited sites. The difference in community structure appears to result from a reduction in the abundance of sessile filter-feeders, increase in abundance of certain seaweed-associated species, and decrease in biomass of exploited species and their associated fauna. Differences in community structure amongst sites within treatments were attributed to additional environmental variations. The putative effects of exploitation are also contrasted with those resulting from other forms of anthropogenic disturbance elsewhere.","UNIV CAPE TOWN, DEPT ZOOL, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, SOUTH AFRICA","LASIAK, TA (corresponding author), UNIV TRANSKEI, DEPT ZOOL, PRIVATE BAG X1 UNITRA, ZA-5100 UMTATA, SOUTH AFRICA.",,,,,,,45,58,62,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,1879-1697,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Zooplankton assemblages were established in 12 enclosures (2 m in diameter, 7.5 m deep). Three densities of fourth-instar Chaoborus trivittatus (0 l(-1), 0.1 l(-1) and 0.5 l(-1)) were introduced as predator treatments to the enclosures. Temperature, dissolved oxygen and zooplankton community composition were monitored for six weeks. To determine if the zooplankton community composition changed, a repeated measures multivariate analysis was performed on percent biomass of Bosmina and calanoid copepods. There were no significant differences in mean taxon percent biomass among predator treatments. There were significant differences in mean taxon percent biomass between water layers (epilimnion and metalimnion). There were also significant differences in lengths of Bosmina and calanoid copepods among predator treatments at the end of the experiment. Crop content analysis of C. trivittatus showed that Bosmina constituted 88-98% of the prey items found in the crops. These results demonstrate that the use of deep enclosures, a Chaoborus species which vertically migrates, and lower natural densities of Chaoborus may provide prey with an important natural refuge from predation and so allow a more accurate determination of the predation impact of Chaoborus trivittatus in temperate lakes where fish control Chaoborus densities.","Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; Louisiana State Univ, Dept Expt Stat, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Sutor, M (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 Ocean Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,30,11,11,0,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,NOV,2001,464,1-3,,,,,121,131,,10.1023/A:1013939201391,,,11,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,515TF,WOS:000173512200015,,,,,2021-09-27,

Previous studies have reported that the larvae of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) are suppressed by competition with the larvae of native anurans in Australia, but not in North America. We conducted laboratory trials to measure the effect of exposure to the larvae of Japanese frogs (Micro-hyla ornata, Fejervarya sakishimensis, Rhacophorus owstoni) on rates of survival, growth and development of cane toad tadpoles in Ishigaki Island, in southern Japan. Survival rates were not affected by native species, but competition with Dicroglossids and Rhacophorids (but not Microhylids) strongly reduced rates of growth and development in the tadpoles of cane toads. Dicroglossid tadpoles also reduced the body condition to toad tadpoles in addition to effects on SVL and mass. Encouraging populations of native frogs in toad-invaded areas of Japan thus may help to reduce the numbers of invasive cane toads.","[Haramura, Takashi] Kyoto Univ, Hakubi Ctr Adv Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Haramura, Takashi; Takeuchi, Hirohiko] Kyoto Univ, Field Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Wakayama 6492211, Japan; [Crossland, Michael R.; Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Haramura, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Hakubi Ctr Adv Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.; Haramura, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Field Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Wakayama 6492211, Japan.",haramura.takashi.2n@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Crossland, Michael R/G-1091-2012","Crossland, Michael R/0000-0001-9967-7158","Hakubi Center, Kyoto University; Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [4FR-1402]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council","This work was supported by an internal grant from The Hakubi Center, Kyoto University, the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (4FR-1402) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan, and the Australian Research Council.",,23,0,0,0,19,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 2,2016,11,6,,,,,,,e0156396,10.1371/journal.pone.0156396,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,DN6XB,WOS:000377218700024,27253973,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-27,

Over 18 weeks, deaths in single and mixed species replicates were monitored. Rates of 'mortality' (deaths not due to cannibalism or predation) did not differ between the species. Gammarus cl. celticus, however, was more cannibalistic than G. pulex and, in both species, males were more often cannibalized than females. In mixed species replicates, the mean proportions of animals preyed upon did not differ among replicates with differing starting proportions of the two species, nor was there a difference between the sexes in numbers preyed upon. G. pulex, however, preyed more frequently on G. d celticus than vice versa, and this became more pronounced over time. In 87% of mixed species replicates, G. pulex eliminated G. d. celticus. The results support the proposition that intraguild predation may be the primary mechanism whereby G. pulex rapidly replaces G. d. celticus in freshwater. Integrating behavioural observations with population level monitoring may thus link pattern and process in behaviour and ecology.","Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Biol, Sch Biol & Biochem, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland","Dick, JTA (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Biol, Sch Biol & Biochem, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",,,,,,,40,40,41,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Hence, these species can engage in both intraguild predation and cannibalism, which can pose a threat to mirid eggs. Ovipositing females may respond to such risks of predation on their eggs by reducing the number of eggs laid or selecting safer oviposition sites. We tested the oviposition behavior of Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) (Hemiptera: Miridae) females under the risk of cannibalism by M. pygmaeus males and intraguild predation by Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) males (Hemiptera: Miridae) under laboratory conditions. Intraguild predators and cannibals were introduced during or after the oviposition period. The number of eggs laid (using counts of newly hatched nymphs) and their proportion on each part of a tomato plant were both measured. The results reveal that only cannibalism by M. pygmaeus males after the period of oviposition significantly decreased the number of hatched eggs. Cannibalism thus represents a greater risk to mirid eggs than intraguild predation. The M. pygmaeus female responded to the presence of potential intraguild predators (or competitors) by decreasing the number of eggs laid in the upper leaves. The results suggest that M. pygmaeus females avoid competition by N. tenuis, by laying fewer eggs on upper leaves. Cannibalism could regulate zoophytophagous predator populations under prey scarcity conditions and minimize the risk of crop damage associated with those biological control agents.","[Dumont, Francois; Lucas, Eric] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dumont, Francois; Lucas, Eric; Alomar, Oscar] Inst Agrifood Res & Technol IRTA, Sustainable Plant Protect Programme, Cabrils, Catalonia, Spain","Dumont, F (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, CP 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",dumont.francois.3@courrier.uqam.ca,,,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2011-24349]; CERCA Programme of the Generalitat de Catalunya,"We thank Victor Munoz, Pilar Hernandez, Maria Vilas Gonzalez, Irene Fraile, and Marta Ramirez Boixaderas for their precious help during the laboratory experiments.

This lake is sited outside the natural range of the ruffe and has a lower fish diversity and a different fish species composition than within its native range. From June through September the ruffe was planktivorous and mainly caught at 4 to 6 m depth in the benthic zone. At other times of year ruffe was feeding on zoobenthos and caught deeper in the benthic zone. Ruffe was mainly day active. Zooplankton feeding during summer is the dearest difference compared to ruffe populations living within its natural range. Presence of large zooplankton organisms available for ruffe is suggested as the main reason for the difference found in food choice. The availability of large zooplankton is probably due to community structure caused by a predator and lack of interspecific competition for zooplankton in the deeper parts of the lake. Piscivorous brown trout, Salmo trutta, restrict the habitat of threespined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to the zone of littoral vegetation, allowing high densities of larger zooplankton species like Bythotrephes longimanus to be present in the lake.

Various models have been put forward to explain the relative effects of environmental filtering, dispersal, and species traits on community composition. Here, we focus on complex, three-dimensional webs of two social and two solitary spider species as habitat patches for associated communities of arthropods in a tropical rainforest in Ecuador. We used variance partitioning, constrained ordination, coherence analyses, and a colonization experiment to assess the role of environmental filtering and dispersal in this system. We found that the composition of communities associated with the four host species was mostly differentiated along two ordination axes, with the first axis roughly corresponding to level of sociality (solitary vs. social) and the other to web size. Associate abundance increased, but their density per unit volume decreased with host web size for all host species. Webs of social spider species had more variable communities and proportionally more aggressive (i.e., predatory) associates. After rarefaction to control for larger samples in larger webs, only one of the species showed a significant increase of species richness as a function of web size. The relatively quick colonization of experimentally established webs suggests high dispersal of more generalist species, but their lower proportion in older webs provides some evidence of a colonization-competition trade-off at longer temporal scales. The distinctness of the communities associated with the four host species, and the eventual change in proportion of associates in newly founded vs. old webs, despite high dispersal, is consistent with environmental filtering and species traits playing a major role in determining patterns of species distribution in this system.","[Fernandez-Fournier, Philippe; Aviles, Leticia] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Fernandez-Fournier, P (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",pfernandez.ubc@gmail.com,"Aviles, Leticia/AAL-8190-2020","Fernandez-Fournier, Philippe/0000-0003-3701-7386",NSERC Discovery (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); James S.

To increase our knowledge about the factors that influence crab predation on propagules in mangrove forests, we performed experiments in Gazi Bay, Kenya in July 2009. We tested whether: (1) crab density influences propagule predation rate; (2) crab size influences food competition and predation rate; (3) crabs depredate at different rates according to propagule and canopy cover species; (4) vegetation density is correlated with crab density; (5) food preferences of herbivorous crabs are determined by size, shape and nutritional value. We found that (1) propagule predation rate was positively correlated to crab density. (2) Crab competitive abilities were unrelated to their size. (3) Avicennia marina propagules were consumed more quickly than Ceriops tagal except under C tagal canopies. (4) Crab density was negatively correlated with the density of A. marina trees and pneumatophores. (5) Crabs prefer small items with a lower C:N ratio. Vegetation density influences crab density, and crab density affects propagule availability and hence vegetation recruitment rate. Consequently, the mutual relationships between vegetation and crab populations could be important for forest restoration success and management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, this stabilizing mechanism has rarely been tested, and was recently rejected as an explanation for maintaining diversity in natural populations of the freshwater herbivore Daphnia pulex(3). The primary limitation of competition theory is its failure to account for the alternative types of population cycles that are caused by size- or stage-dependent population vital rates - even though such structure both explains the fluctuating dynamics of many species(4) and may alter the outcome of competition(5). Here we provide the first experimental test of whether alternative types of cycles affect natural selection in predator - prey systems. Using competing Daphnia genotypes, we show that internally generated, stage-structured cycles substantially reduce the magnitude of selection ( thereby contributing to the maintenance of genetic diversity), whereas externally forced cycles show rapid competitive exclusion. The change in selection is ecologically significant, spanning the observed range in natural populations(3). We argue that structured cycles reduce selection through a combination of stalled juvenile development and stage-specific mortality. This potentially general fitness-equalizing mechanism may reduce the need for strong stabilizing mechanisms to explain the maintenance of genetic diversity in natural systems.","Univ Calgary, Div Ecol, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; Univ Victoria, Natl Water Res Inst, Water & Climate Impacts Res Ctr, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada","Nelson, WA (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Div Ecol, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",wanelson@ucalgary.ca,"Nelson, William A/D-1405-2013; Wrona, Frederick J/B-8258-2014","Wrona, Frederick J/0000-0003-1894-351X",,,,28,35,36,0,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,JAN 27,2005,433,7024,,,,,413,417,,10.1038/nature03212,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,WOS:000226546200042,15674291,,,,2021-09-27,

This causes problems with data complexity, sampling (level) and independence. Many ecological programmes are currently conducting multi-scale investigation of organismal trends (e.g. diversity). In this study, by contrast, the assemblages analysed were the resources used by animals (rather than animals per se). Variability in shell use was studied in 5 members of a taxon (hermit crabs) from global to site spatial levels. The novel adaptation of an existing technique used 1-factor, 3-level ANOVA of Bray-Curtis similarity values based on 'centroids' for each scale. Similarity in the number of shells used, the proportional usage of shell types, shell diversity and other variables were examined at site (> 10 m apart), locality (> 1 km apart) and region levels (> 1000 km apart). There was significant variability amongst scales and between regions in shell use of all species. For some species, observed variability differed with location, while in others the trend was similar in all 3 regions. Between 18 and 3 shell types were used by different study species with diversity (Shannon H') values ranging from 2.54 to 0.1 and evenness values from 0.99 to 0.1. Shell use by hermit crabs was less similar (to each other) between regions than between the study hermit crab species. No significant spatial effects at any level were found on the proportion of damaged shells used by different species. The numbers of shell types used by hermit crabs had both a taxon-specific component and a global pattern. Data from the literature in combination with that from the present study showed Dardanus, Diogenes and Pagurus species used fewer shell types than Coenobita, Clibanarius and Calcinus species. No inter-oceanic patterns were evident in any genus. Shell numbers used by Clibanarius and Calcinus species both, however, exhibited distinct latitudinal clines. Adaptation of a novel technique has, thus, demonstrated global (and differential between scale) trends in resource use by a guild of animals, although interpretation of the mechanism or meaning underlying this is not straightforward.","FRONTIER, London EC2A 4QS, England; Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Cork, Ireland","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",dkab@bas.ac.uk,,,,,,60,12,13,0,5,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Groups of five target and five competitor snails were raised together in experimental aquaria and same number in separate aquaria as controls. Shell size, number of eggs and mortality rate were recorded for twelve consecutive weeks. The stocking density for C. gariepinus was one fish per aquarium. Fish were provided with adequate or inadequate supplementary food and fifteen B. pfeifferi were added to each aquarium. The snails and their eggs were counted daily. Significant differences in shell growth and fecundity were noted between B. pfeifferi and M. tuberculata. Physa acuta was noted to be voracious in food consumption. Snail consumption was faster by fish provided with inadequate supplementary food. Based on the present findings, it is suggested that the two competitor snails and African catfish could be used as biological control agents against B. pfeifferi. Nevertheless, the susceptibility of the competitor snails to other trematodes in Ethiopia must first be ruled out before introducing these snails into new habitats.

Host-switching may be driven by different parameters such as (1) mating strategies of symbionts, (2) foraging for resources or (3) avoiding overcrowded or diseased/dead host. Symbiotic marine crustaceans are suitable models to understand what underlies host-switching behavior. In this study, we investigated host desertion by the parasitic pea crab Dissodactylus primitivus associated with the echinoid host Meoma ventricosa. Mark-recapture field experiments, during which crabs were almost always found on their host in heterosexual combinations, suggest that host desertion occurs less frequently when 2 crabs (compared to 3) share the same host. During laboratory experiments with high crab density, the proportion of crabs leaving an echinoid was low when the 2 genders of crabs were present on the host, compared to 1 gender only (males or females). This suggests that host desertion is mostly driven by intersex selection and the search for a mate and, to a lesser extent, by competition between crabs. However, both field and laboratory experiments showed evidence that when they switch host, most crabs remained for a while in the sediment underneath their host. We propose that this behavior, associated with the aggregative behavior of their hosts, would allow the crabs to solve the trade-off between staying on their hosts (therefore suffering overcrowding and sub-optimal mate search) and moving too far from the host (therefore suffering loss of food source and high predation risk).","[De Bruyn, C.; Jossart, Q.; De Ridder, C.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Biol Marine CP 160 15, 50 Ave FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [De Bruyn, C.; David, B.; Motreuil, S.; Rigaud, T.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Biogeosci, CNRS, UMR 6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [David, B.] Museum Natl Hist Nat, 57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France; [Caulier, G.] Univ Mons, Lab Biol Organismes Marins & Biomimetisme, 20 Pl Parc, B-7000 Mons, Belgium","De Ridder, C (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Biol Marine CP 160 15, 50 Ave FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",cridder@ulb.ac.be,"Rigaud, Thierry/T-4053-2017; Rigaud, Thierry/ABE-2552-2020","Rigaud, Thierry/0000-0002-0163-6639; Rigaud, Thierry/0000-0002-0163-6639; Caulier, Guillaume/0000-0001-7414-1226; Jossart, Quentin/0000-0002-2280-243X","FRIA-FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique, FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; Academie Royale de Belgique - Fonds Agathon De Potter; FNRS-FRFCFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [T.0056.13]; Conseil Regional de BourgogneRegion Bourgogne-Franche-Comte","We are grateful to the staff of the Discovery Bay Marine Laboratory for providing accommodation and laboratory facilities and to the National Environment & Planning Agency of Jamaica (NEPA) for the research permit.

The role of the foraging behaviour in promoting species coexistence was also examined. We used giving-up densities (GUDs) in artificial food patches to measure the patch use of rodents and video trapping to directly record the foraging behaviour, vigilance, and interspecific interactions. Three potential mechanisms of coexistence were evaluated (1) microhabitat partitioning; (2) spatial heterogeneity of resource abundance with a tradeoff in foraging efficiency vs. locomotion; and (3) temporal partitioning on a daily scale. Compared to M. meridianus, D. sagitta generally possessed lower GUDs, spent more time on patches, and conducted more visits per tray per capita, regardless of microhabitat. However, M. meridianus possessed advantages in average harvesting rates and direct interference against D. sagitta. Our results only partly support the third mechanism listed above. We propose another potential mechanism of coexistence: a tradeoff between interference competition and safety, with M. meridianus better at interference competition and D. sagitta better at avoiding predation risk.

Conversely, food web interactions in reservoirs are more complex. Omnivorous gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) regulate reservoir food webs from an intermediate trophic position through a complex series of predation and competition interactions. To evaluate the potential impact of predation on zooplankton and intraspecific competition by age-0 gizzard shad, we conducted an in-lake enclosure experiment. Gizzard shad predation reduced crustacean zooplankton. In turn, reduced crustacean zooplankton permitted rotifer populations to increase such that no overall difference in total zooplankton occurred during the experiment. Age-0 gizzard shad growth was negatively related to age-0 gizzard shad density, but positively related to the density of crustacean zooplankton. Gizzard shad exerted strong predatory impacts on crustacean zooplankton and permitted a competitive shift toward smaller taxa in the zooplankton assemblage. Gizzard shad growth was affected by intraspecific competition and by food quality. Complex predatory and competitive impacts allow gizzard shad to structure reservoir zooplankton assemblages.","Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA","Dettmers, JM (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Lake Michigan Biol Stn, 400 17th St, Zion, IL 60099 USA.",,,,,,,32,9,9,1,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,APR,1999,400,,,,,,115,121,,10.1023/A:1003767331606,,,7,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,246PB,WOS:000083171500009,,,,,2021-09-27,

Competition, food quality, and pressure from natural enemies have all been established as important determinants of phytophagous insect densities. Examining how these forces interact, however, is important for furthering our understanding of insect population and community ecology. 2. In this paper the results of a factorial field experiment are reported in which the effects of within-trophic-level interactions on the top-down and bottom-up forces influencing the density of a salt marsh planthopper were examined. 3. Plant quality was increased by adding nitrogen fertiliser, and parasitism was decreased through the use of yellow sticky traps that removed hymenopteran parasitoids. These treatments were applied to plots with either low or high densities of a lepidopteran stem borer, which has been shown to negatively affect the planthopper. 4. Addition of nitrogen increased planthopper density significantly, but only on plots with low stem borer densities. Yellow sticky traps significantly reduced parasitism of planthopper eggs, but this resulted in increased planthopper density only on plots with low stem borer density. Thus, where stem borer densities were high, the effects of fertiliser and reduced parasitism on planthopper densities were suppressed. 5. The results of this study show that negative interactions between herbivores can affect vertical trophic linkages, and can greatly modify the strengths of top-down or bottom-up effects on herbivore density.","Univ N Florida, Dept Biol, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Moon, DC (corresponding author), Univ N Florida, Dept Biol, 4667 St Johns Bluff Rd S, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",dmoon@unf.edu,,,,,,52,6,7,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Invertebrate predation on planktonic communities depends on several factors (but major ones are defences and reproductive capacity of prey organisms). We evaluated the effects of different densities of herbivorous prey B. calyciflorus on the population growth of its predator A. brightwellii. Prey at four initial densities (1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10.0 ind. mL(-1)) and predators at one density (0.05 ind. mL(-1)) were grown together using the single-celled alga Chlorella vulgaris at two concentrations (0.5 X 10(6) and 2.0 X 10(6) cells mL(-1)). In the absence of predators (regardless of initial density), increase in algal food concentration promoted the population abundances of B. calyciflorus. In the presence of allelochemicals from predators, the population of B. calveiflorus was decreased at all initial densities (except at inoculation density of 10 ind. mL(-1), and high food level) but its population had positive growth. Predator's peak population density continued to increase with the availability of B. calyciflorus but remained stationary, when prey was cultured at high inoculation density and high algal food level. Thus, under conditions of high food level and high inoculation density of prey, the coexistence of B. calyciflorus with A. brightwellii was possible; however, the field verification is still needed.","[Sarma, S.

We used meta-analyses of published data to address the questions of how and over what time frames marine assemblages change within no-take marine reserves as they recover from fishing and other human uses. We used 20 studies of coastal fish assemblages from 31 temperate and tropical locations, reporting abundances, and in some cases biomass, of 10-134 species from reserve and reference conditions (i.e., conditions in nearby fished sites or before reserve establishment) spanning 1-25 years of protection. Synthesis of data from these diverse sets of assemblages showed that: (1) a species' level of exploitation, trophic level, and the duration of protection through the no-take reserve explain small but significant amounts of variation in individual species responses to protection, with only species that are targeted by fishing or by aquarium trade showing overall enhanced abundances in protected areas, and increasing positive effects of protection on abundances at top trophic levels through time; (2) up to a third of species in different studies (19% on average) appeared to be negatively affected by protection, indicating that indirect effects of protection through competitive or predatory interactions may be common; and (3) variation and lags in species, responses to protection resulted in protected assemblages diverging from reference conditions, with greater proportions of total fish biomass at top trophic levels in protected compared to fished assemblages. These results indicate that marine reserves are effective in enhancing local abundances of exploited species and restoring the structure of whole communities, though these changes occur through a series of transient states and, for-some communities, over long time frames (decades). In contrast with the more predictable increases of aggregate community variables such as total abundance and biomass, individual species and community structure exhibited broad variation in their responses to protection. Marine protected areas represent multiple human-exclusion experiments, replicated in a variety of ecosystem types and geographic locations, providing key insights on community-wide impacts of the removal of human extraction. Long-term monitoring of community trajectories in marine protected areas and modeling studies scaling up local effects to relevant spatial and temporal scales are needed to increase our ability to protect and restore whole marine systems and to set realistic targets for the conservation and restoration of specific assemblages.","Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Micheli, F (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.",micheli@stanford.edu,"Warner, Robert R./M-5342-2013","Warner, Robert R./0000-0002-3299-5685; Micheli, Fiorenza/0000-0002-6865-1438",,,,54,303,309,0,140,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Parts of the plots have had 25 years of unchanged management regimes. The regimes included three-cutting meadows (3), two-cutting meadows (3), mulched meadows (4), abandoned meadows (3), a horse pasture, a sheep pasture with rotational grazing, a continuously grazed sheep pasture, and a sheep pasture which had been abandoned in 1994. 5229 beetles representing 68 Carabidae species were caught in pitfall traps during the three years of investigation, 18 species (26%) could only be verified by one single individium. Meadows cut once or twice a year did not differ substantially from pastures regarding their mean number of species. But these three management forms show a significant higher number of species compared to mulched meadows or abandoned plots. The number of species on sample plots diminishes with decreasing land use intensity. The carabid species caught were divided into 5 classes according to their size: Large species (SCI, SC II) held percentages between 6 and 29% and between 0 and 29% respectively. Medium-sized and smaller species (SC III, SC IV) were more abundant with 8-54% and 15-63%. Very small species (SC V) were less frequent 0-19%. The percentage of large species increased along the gradient of land use intensity, while the percentage of medium-sized species decreased. Two classes were built regarding the food preferences of carabids: Phytohagous species held percentages between 14 and 41%, predominantly zoophagous species between 54 and 86%. The distribution of food preferences does not show any land use-specific influence. Three discriminant functions on the basis of 20 characters (variables) of the carabid assemblage were extracted, which significantly separated the carabid assemblages from the live groups of management forms.

We monitored the growth of newly-hatched tadpoles in unoccupied and occupied bamboo stumps in the field where the latter contained large tadpoles that hatched from earlier clutches. The growth of the small, late-hatching tadpoles in occupied nests was suppressed by the presence of large, early-hatching tadpoles. However, small tadpoles that were physically separated from large tadpoles in a perforated container grew at about the same rate as small tadpoles living in pools without large tadpoles. Thus. the slower growth of the late-hatching tadpoles was probably caused by behavioural interference competition with the early-hatching tadpoles. In the laboratory, we kept large and small tadpoles together in containers and did not feed them for 6 days. The large tadpoles did not cannibalize the small tadpoles. Although large tadpoles may scavenge dead tadpoles, the effects of scavenging on growth were negligible. Interactions among cohabiting C. eiffingeri tadpoles are similar to those among the oophagous tadpoles of several hylid species that use phytotelmata. Results suggest that behavioural interference competition is the principal type of intraspecific interactions among the oophagous. non-predatory tadpoles of hylid and rhacophorid frogs.","Natl Changhua Univ, Dept Biol, Changhua 50058, Taiwan; Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Zool, Taipei 10764, Taiwan","Kam, YC (corresponding author), Natl Changhua Univ, Dept Biol, Changhua 50058, Taiwan.",biyckam@cc.ncue.edu.tw,,,,,,38,8,9,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

The Asian needle ant, Pachycondyla chinensis, native throughout Australasia was introduced to the southeastern US where it has become established in woodland habitats, nests in close proximity to and consumes subterranean termites (Rhinotermitidae). P. chinensis do not occur in habitats lacking Rhinotermitidae. We suggest that subterranean termites are critical for P. chinensis success in new habitats. We demonstrate that P. chinensis is a general termite feeder, retrieving Reticulitermes virginicus five times more often than other potential prey near P. chinensis colonies. Odors produced by R. virginicus workers, as well as other potential prey, attract P. chinensis. Furthermore, P. chinensis occupy R. virginicus nests in the lab and field and display behaviors that facilitate capture of R. virginicus workers and soldiers. Termites are an abundant, high quality, renewable food supply, in many ways similar to the hemipteran honeydew exploited by most other invasive ant species. We conclude that the behavior of P. chinensis in the presence of termites increases their competitive abilities in natural areas where they have been introduced.","[Bednar, D.

Corallina elongata and Jania rubens, the dominant species which shared a niche at platforms of intermediate levels, showed an opposite behaviour, probably to avoid competence: C. elongata showed higher biomass in April-June and lower values in August-October-December, while biomass of J. rubens was higher in December-February and lower in April-August. Associated crustaceans, including mainly amphipods (gammarids and caprellids) were also present throughout the whole year with similar seasonality to seaweeds. However, crustacean density in the intertidal was not only influenced by distribution of algae as substrate, but also by external factors, such as hydrodynamism, oxygen, weather conditions, competition or predation.

It has been presumed that trophic niche differentiation through selective feeding may thwart competitive exclusion, promoting zooplankton diversity. Essential to such considerations is information on whether co-occurring zooplankters utilize the same or different food resources. During a cruise on the continental shelf off the southeastern U.S., determinations were made of the specific types of food ingested by adult females of ten copepod species, and adult males, females, and copepodites of an eleventh species. This was done by scanning electron microscope examination of fecal pellets, the contents of which reflected natural diets prior to capture. Fecal pellet contents were compared with assemblages of phytoplankton species in surface waters from which copepods were captured. In most cases, feeding habits of several copepod taxa of different sizes were examined at each of 16 stations where phytoplankton assemblages varied considerably in terms of abundance and composition. Copepods generally fed nonselectively, in that food items were ingested in approximate proportion to their availability. Contents of fecal pellets were usually similar to the composition of surface phytoplankton assemblages, and the most abundant phytoplankters in fecal pellets were usually the most abundant in the water. These patterns held regardless of the sizes of both the copepods and the phytoplankters. When different copepods of varying sizes were examined from the same station, they ate the same broad size and taxonomic array of phytoplankton cells. Different sexes and developmental states (copepodites) of the copepod Anomalocera ornata ate the same types of food. Some copepods ingested non-phytoplankton foods such as other crustaceans and pine pollen. The omnivorous and unselective feeding reported here is similar to patters recorded previously for some of the same and other copepod species in the Gulf of Mexico, using both fecal pellet analysis and quantitative grazing experiments. The answer to the question posed in the title is Yes, but the next question raised is Is such competition important?. Before we can further address the role of copepod feeding ecology in potential population competition, additional information is needed. Even though co-occurring copepods may ingest the same broad size array and taxonomic composition of food items, we do not know if these food resources are in such low amounts to be limiting to population growth. We need more information on not only feeding preferences, but also population food requirements and copepod feeding impact on populations of prey. Also, we know little of the feeding ecology of subadult copepods such as the nauplii that usually outnumber their parents by orders of magnitude, as well as the degree of mortality imposed upon various developmental stages of copepod populations by their predators. Thus, even though co-occurring copepod species may eat the same things, we need additional information to known if this diet overlap results in significant resource competition between species population.",,"TURNER, JT (corresponding author), UNIV MASSACHUSETTS,DEPT BIOL,DARTMOUTH,MA 02747, USA.",,,,,,,0,38,40,1,13,CRC PRESS INC,BOCA RATON,"2000 CORPORATE BLVD NW, BOCA RATON, FL 33431",0891-4117,,,REV AQUAT SCI,,,1991,5,2,,,,,101,195,,,,,95,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,GJ673,WOS:A1991GJ67300001,,,,,2021-09-27,

The effect of the removal of Timarcha lugens (Chrysomelidae), one of the main herbivores of Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae), on the abundance of co-occurring phytophagous insects, the abundance of non-phytophagous arthropods (detritivores, predators, and parasitoids), and the structure and diversity of the entire arthropod community, was studied for 3 years (1999-2001). 2. There was competition between T. lugens and co-occurring herbivores; the removal of T. lugens was correlated with an increase in the abundance of sap-suckers, flower-feeders, and, above all, folivores. 3. Timarcha lugens also had an indirect effect on arthropods belonging to other trophic levels; the abundance of predators increased significantly after the removal of T. lugens . 4. Community composition was affected by the experimental removal. In addition, the diversity of the overall community increased after removal of T. lugens . 5. The study demonstrated experimentally that T. lugens has a significant effect not only on other species belonging to the same trophic level, but also on the abundance of species belonging to higher trophic levels, and, consequently, on the entire structure and diversity of the complex community in which it is immersed.","Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Gonzalez-Megias, A (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",bgyagm@leeds.ac.uk,"Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017; Megias, Adela Gonzalez/P-8974-2016","Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664; Megias, Adela Gonzalez/0000-0002-2292-9334",,,,49,22,25,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Throughout its development, theoretical population biology has built on variants of the Lotka-Volterra equations and in nearly all cases has taken a single-currency approach to understanding population change, abstracting populations as aggregations of individuals or biomass. In this review, we explore how depicting organisms as built of more than one thing (for example, C and an important nutrient, such as P) in stoichiometrically explicit models results in qualitatively different predictions about the resulting dynamics. Fundamentally, stoichiometric models incorporate both food quantity and food quality effects in a single framework, allow key feedbacks such as consumer-driven nutrient recycling to occur, and generally appear to stabilize predator-prey systems while simultaneously producing rich dynamics with alternative domains of attraction and occasionally counterintuitive outcomes, such as coexistence of more than one predator species on a single-prey item and decreased herbivore performance in response to increased light intensity experienced by the autotrophs. In addition to the theoretical background, we also review recent laboratory and field studies considering stoichiometric effects on autotroph-herbivore systems, emphasizing algae-Daphnia interactions. These studies support the predictions of stoichiometric theory, providing empirical evidence for alternative stable states under stoichiometric constraints, for negative effects of solar radiation on herbivores via stoichiometric food quality, and for diversity-enhancing effects of poor food quality. Stoichiometric theory has strong potential for both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the predictive power of population ecology, a major priority in light of the multivariate anthropogenic and natural perturbations experienced by populations. However, full development and testing of stoichiometric population dynamics theory will require greater intellectual tolerance and exchange between researchers working in ecosystem and population ecology.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Andersen, T (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",tom.andersen@bio.uio.no,"Hessen, Dag Olav/AAO-5877-2021; Hessen, Dag/F-4039-2011; Elser, James J/AAL-6199-2020; Elser, James/A-7082-2008; Andersen, Tom/B-1950-2008","Hessen, Dag Olav/0000-0002-0154-7847; Elser, James J/0000-0002-1460-2155; Elser, James/0000-0002-1460-2155; ",,,,94,174,207,1,200,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We investigated the relative abundance and microhabitat selection of Northern Pygmy Salamander and Southern Pygmy Salamander in 3 forest types of different elevations across the mountains of North Carolina during the summer of 2015. We conducted 2-h time-constrained searches at 4 sites in Picea rubens (Red Spruce)-Abies fraseri (Fraser Fir) forests, northern hardwood forests, and mountain cove forests for each species. We quantified microhabitat characteristics at each pygmy salamander location and at a corresponding random location 2-30 m away. We captured a total of 98 pygmy salamanders (D. organi = 41, D. wrighti = 57): 52 in spruce-fir forests, 26 in northern hardwood forests, and 20 in cove forests, and recorded 655 other salamanders representing 15 species. Relative abundance of pygmy salamanders was greater in spruce-fir forests than in cove forests, but was not significantly different between spruce-fir and northern hardwood forests. Microhabitat did not differ between Northern Pygmy Salamander and Southern Pygmy Salamander for any of the variables examined, except for soil moisture, which was greater at Northern Pygmy Salamander locations and may have been a spurious result. We observed pygmy salamanders almost exclusively beneath wood cover-objects, and size of cover objects did not differ from the size available in the surrounding environments. Total area of small-sized down woody debris (DWD) and total area of large-sized DWD were the only variables associated with the presence of pygmy salamanders, suggesting that pygmy salamanders avoid predation and interspecific competition by selecting sites that minimize encounters with larger salamanders.","[Rossell, C.

We investigated the generality of this concept across ecosystems. Despite the conspicuousness of freshwater invasions, investigations of biotic resistance have focused mostly on terrestrial and, more recently, marine coastal communities. We collected in-situ studies that tested the impacts of native freshwater communities on invading primary producers and consumers. Meta-analysis demonstrated that evidence of competitive biotic resistance in freshwater habitats was not as strong as that in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In freshwater ecosystems consumptive resistance was significantly stronger than competitive resistance and consumptive resistance appeared to be as strong in freshwater as in marine and terrestrial systems. The limited number of studies considering freshwater biotic resistance hindered our ability to understand the importance of factors including latitude, experimental duration, and method. However, the strength of biotic resistance varied among freshwater habitats; specifically, biotic resistance was strongest in lentic environments. Our analysis identifies mechanisms underlying biotic resistance in freshwater ecosystems that warrant further investigation given the potential ongoing and future impacts of invasive species in these systems.","[Alofs, Karen M.; Jackson, Donald A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","Alofs, KM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",k.alofs@utoronto.ca,"Jackson, Donald A/J-6441-2013","Jackson, Donald A/0000-0002-6107-0753; Alofs, Karen/0000-0002-4161-3554",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); National Science Foundation International Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-1064658],"We thank C.

We developed a mathematical model that examines the relationships between the abundance of primary prey, patch exploitation (i.e., quitting harvest rates), and the rate of incidental predation on secondary prey items. The model's predictions are dependent upon the spatial scale over which a forager integrates foraging costs and thus determines its quitting harvest rate (QHR). At local (i.e., foraging) spatial scales, we predicted that incidental predation should increase with local food abundance. Also at the foraging scale, local food abundance should not influence QHRs, but local predation risk (from higher trophic levels) should increase QHRs. Therefore, we predicted that incidental predation rates should be negatively correlated with QHRs. Over large (i.e., landscape) spatial scales, greater food abundance and predation risk increase QHRs, and we predicted that predation rates should vary inversely with QHR through two complementary mechanisms: foragers use a greater proportion of space and spend more time foraging as quitting harvest rates decrease. We experimentally tested the qualitative predictions of the theory in the field using artificial Veery (Catharus fuscescens) nests depredated by white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, across three spatial scales. We used the technique of giving-up densities to measure QHRs and to determine the scale at which mice integrate different foraging costs. In accord with our predictions, nest predation was positively influenced by the local abundance of food at the foraging scale, and local predation risk to mice and perhaps interference competition from chipmunks resulted in higher giving-up densities and lower nest predation. At the landscape scale, there was an inverse relationship between giving-up densities and nest predation, which was probably the result of large-scale differences in resource abundance between plots. Our study demonstrates how linking theoretical development to the use of empirical behavioral indicators can help determine the relevant ecological scales and processes necessary for understanding predator-prey interactions.","Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Schmidt, KA (corresponding author), Williams Coll, Dept Biol, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",,,,,,,63,55,56,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2001,82,10,,,,,2937,2947,,10.2307/2679972,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,487FN,WOS:000171863100021,,,,,2021-09-27,

Arthropods, spiders in particular, were most abundant in upper tree parts and in the outer sections of branches. There was a high correlation between food abundance and bird density, based on proportional use of foraging sites over eight sections of spruce suggesting that food distribution is a major factor influencing the segregative distribution of the four bird species. However, the distribution of the bird species cannot be explained solely by food abundance. In outer tree parts there were fewer birds than expected from arthropod biomass. A possible explanation is that the risk of predation by Pygmy Owls Glaucidium passerinum is higher there, reducing the net benefit of foraging in the tree parts with highest food abundance. A further support for the impact of predation comes from the fact that it is the socially least dominant species, the Goldcrest and the Coal Tit P. ater, that use the outer tree parts. Crested Tits P. cristatus are highest in dominance rank, but they mainly forage in the inner tree parts. Willow Tits P. montanus are second in the dominance, but have the lowest food abundance in their foraging sites. Both interspecific competition over food, and the site-dependent risk of predation, seem to govern the ways in which the four bird species select their foraging sites in spruce in winter.","SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DEPT WILDLIFE ECOL,S-75007 UPPSALA,SWEDEN; UNIV UPPSALA,DEPT ZOOL,S-75122 UPPSALA,SWEDEN","SUHONEN, J (corresponding author), UNIV JYVASKYLA,DEPT BIOL,KONNEVESI RES STN,YLIOPISTONKATU 9,SF-40100 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND.",,,"Hoglund, Jacob/0000-0002-5840-779X",,,,44,38,39,0,23,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-5693,,,ORNIS SCAND,,OCT-DEC,1992,23,4,,,,,467,474,,10.2307/3676678,,,8,Ornithology,Zoology,KA562,WOS:A1992KA56200006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Based on two mesocosm experiments and 10 in vitro predation experiments, this work aimed to evaluate the impact of nutrient supply and Chaoborus predation on the structure of the zooplankton community in a small reservoir in Cote d'Ivoire. 2. During the first mesocosm experiment (M1), P enrichment had no effect on phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) but significantly increased the biomass of some herbivorous zooplankton species (Filinia sp, Ceriodaphnia affinis). During the second experiment (M2), N and P enrichment greatly increased phytoplankton biomass, rotifers and cladocerans (C. affinis, C. cornuta, Moina micrura and Diaphanosoma excisum). In both experiments, nutrient addition had a negative impact on cyclopoid copepods. 3. Larger zooplankton, such as cladocerans or copepodites and adults of Thermocyclops sp., were significantly reduced in enclosures with Chaoborus in both mesocosm experiments, whereas there was no significant reduction of rotifers and copepod nauplii. This selective predation by Chaoborus shaped the zooplankton community and modified its size structure. In addition, a significant Chaoborus effect on chlorophyll a was shown in both experiments. 4. The preference of Chaoborus for larger prey was confirmed in the predation experiments. Cladocerans D. excisum and M. micrura were the most selected prey. Rotifer abundance was not significantly reduced in any of the 10 experiments performed. 5. In conclusion, both bottom-up and top-down factors may exert a structuring control on the zooplankton community. Nutrients favoured more strictly herbivorous taxa and disadvantaged the cyclopoid copepods. Chaoborus predation had a strong direct negative impact on larger crustaceans, favoured small herbivores (rotifer, nauplii) and seemed to cascade down to phytoplankton.","IRD, UR 098, FLAG, Dakar, Senegal","Pagano, M (corresponding author), IRD, UR 098, FLAG, BP1386, Dakar, Senegal.",pagano@dakar.ird.sn,,,,,,55,20,22,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Because interacting species are likely to respond to fire differently, disruptions of the interactions are expected. We hypothesized that plants that regenerate after fire can benefit through the disruption of their antagonistic interactions. We expected stronger effects on interactions with specialist predators than with generalists. We studied two interactions between two Mediterranean plants (Ulex parviflorus, Asphodelus ramosus) and their specialist seed predators after large wildfires. In A. ramosus we also studied the generalist herbivores. We sampled the interactions in burned and adjacent unburned areas during 2 years by estimating seed predation, number of herbivores and fruit set. To assess the effect of the distance to unburned vegetation we sampled plots at two distance classes from the fire perimeter. Even 3 years after the fires, Ulex plants experienced lower seed damage by specialists in burned sites. The presence of herbivores on Asphodelus decreased in burned locations, and the variability in their presence was significantly related to fruit set. Generalist herbivores were unaffected. We show that plants can benefit from fire through the disruption of their antagonistic interactions with specialist seed predators for at least a few years. In environments with a long fire history, this effect might be one additional mechanism underlying the success of fire-adapted plants.","[Garcia, Y.; Castellanos, M. C.; Pausas, J.

However, all of these studies were conducted in clear-water systems with dense littoral vegetation, resulting in well-defined littoral and open-water habitats. In contrast, little is known about predator-prey interactions among fishes that inhabit turbid lakes and reservoirs. In these systems, turbidity reduces detection (reaction) distance for both predator and prey, and can eliminate submerged vegetation that serves as a refuge. In laboratory experiments, we quantified reaction distance of juvenile bluegills Lepomis macrochirus to a predator, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, and determined shifts by bluegills between nearshore and offshore habitats across a turbidity gradient. Bluegill reaction distance declined as a negative power function of turbidity from less than 2 m in clear water to 23 cm at 10 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) and 9 cm at 50 NTU. However, bluegill reaction distance was always greater than largemouth bass reaction distance. In tilted laboratory pools with a depth gradient of 0-50 cm and a largemouth bass predator, bluegills used deepwater habitat (>20 cm deep) less than 20% of the time in clear water and more than 80% of the time at all turbidities greater than 10 NTU. The presence of an obligate open-water prey for largemouth bass, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, did not influence bluegill habitat use. The apparent reduction in open-water predation risk with a relatively minor increase in turbidity suggests that size-specific habitat use by bluegills in turbid systems may not be as simply defined as in clear-water lakes.","OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,AQUAT ECOL LAB,COLUMBUS,OH 43210",,,,,,,,47,120,124,2,37,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

However, little empirical information exists on the real effect that these organisms have on plant populations. With a long-term (seven-year) ungulate exclusion experiment in two areas of southeastern Spain, I demonstrated that these organisms can affect not only individual performance, but also the population dynamics and spatial structure of two short-lived monocarpic herbs, Erysimum mediohispanicum and E. baeticum. There was between-year and among-microhabitat variability in damage, with plants growing under shrubs being less damaged than those growing in open sites. Ungulates consumed flowers and fruits, severely decreasing plant reproductive output. The postdispersal seed predation rate increased after ungulates were excluded, presumably as a consequence of the relaxation of competition between seed predators and ungulates. The effect of ungulates on Erysimum early establishment was nonsignificant, although > 50% of Erysimum seedlings died due to ungulate trampling. The exclusion experiment also revealed that, as a consequence of their impact on seed production, ungulates affected the population dynamics of their host plants; their removal produced a significant increase in the abundance of the two studied plant species. Furthermore, habitat distribution of plants was also influenced by the activity of ungulates. In control plots, most Erysimum individuals grew under the canopy of co-occurring shrubs. In contrast, a dramatic spatial redistribution of plants occurred in ungulate-excluded plots, where they started to colonize open sites. Consequently, the spatial structure of the plants excluded from ungulates significantly differed from that in control plots and became statistically similar to the structure expected according to the cover of every microhabitat. Finally, this experiment revealed that, for plants inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes, abundance and spatial structure are tightly related. Thus, I found that abundance increased in ungulate-excluded plots due not to a general and homogeneous increase, but to a significant increase in those microhabitats inaccessible to ungulates in control plots. These findings suggest that herbivory effects on plants are intricate, affecting not only their performance or population dynamics, but also their habitat distribution and niche structure.","Univ Granada, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, Grp Ecol Terr, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Gomez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, Grp Ecol Terr, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",jmgreyes@ugr.es,"Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017","Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664",,,,176,55,57,1,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

One experiment tested the effects of fixed densities of three species of grazers (the caddisfly Allomyia sp. and two mayflies, Epeorus deceptivus and Baetis bicaudatus) on periphyton. Baetis was tested with and without chemical cues from fish predators, which reduced grazer foraging activity to levels similar to the less mobile mayfly (Epeorus). Mean algal biomass (chlorophyll a; chl a) was reduced in grazer treatments compared to ungrazed controls, but there were no differences among grazer treatments. Algal heterogeneity (Morisita index) increased with grazer mobility, with the highest heterogeneity occurring in the Baetis-no fish treatment (most mobile grazer) and the lowest in the caddisfly treatment (most sedentary grazer). A second experiment used a three factorial design, and tested whether initial resource distribution (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous), Baetis density (high vs. low) and fish odor (present vs. absent) affected grazer impact on algal resources. Abundances of Baetis and chl a on individual rocks were recorded to explore the mechanisms responsible for the observed distributions of algae. Initial resource heterogeneity was maintained despite being subjected to grazing. Mean chl a was highest in controls, as in experiment I, and effects of Baetis on algal biomass increased with grazer density. There were no fish effects on algal biomass and no effects of grazer density or fish on algal heterogeneity. At the scale of individual rocks Baetis was unselective when food was homogeneously distributed, but chose high-food rocks when it was heterogeneously distributed. Results of these mechanistic experiments showed that Baetis can track resources at the scale of single rocks; and at moderate densities mobile grazers could potentially maintain periphyton distributions observed in natural streams.","Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36200, Spain; Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol & Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Alvarez, M (corresponding author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, 529 Crested Butte, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.",,"Alvarez, Maruxa/K-5925-2014","Alvarez, Maruxa/0000-0001-7486-3704",,,,70,34,34,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2005,142,4,,,,,576,587,,10.1007/s00442-004-1759-0,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,894CA,WOS:000226766400009,15688216,,,,2021-09-27,

A broad and flexible generalist diet has been suggested as key to the invasion success of Rattus spp. Here, we use an indirect approach to better understand foraging niche width, plasticity, and overlap within and between introduced Rattus spp. in anthropogenic habitats and natural humid forests of Madagascar. Results: Based on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values measured in hair samples of 589 individual rodents, we found that Rattus rattus had an extremely wide foraging niche, encompassing the isotopic space covered by a complete endemic forest-dwelling Malagasy small mammal community. Comparisons of Bayesian standard ellipses, as well as (multivariate) mixed-modeling analyses, revealed that the stable isotope niche of R. rattus tended to change seasonally and differed between natural forests and anthropogenic habitats, indicating plasticity in feeding niches. In co-occurrence, R. rattus and Rattus norvegicus partitioned feeding niches. Isotopic mismatch of signatures of individual R. rattus and the habitat in which they were captured, indicate frequent dispersal movements for this species between natural forest and anthropogenic habitats. Conclusions: Since R. rattus are known to transmit a number of zoonoses, potentially affecting communities of endemic small mammals, as well as humans, these movements presumably increase transmission potential. Our results suggest that due to their generalist diet and potential movement between natural forest and anthropogenic habitats, Rattus spp. might affect native forest-dependent Malagasy rodents as competitors, predators, and disease vectors. The combination of these effects helps explain the invasion success of Rattus spp. and the detrimental effects of this genus on the endemic Malagasy rodent fauna.","[Dammhahn, Melanie] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Anim Ecol, Fac Nat Sci, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Randriamoria, Toky M.; Goodman, Steven M.] Assoc Vahatra, BP 3972, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Randriamoria, Toky M.] Univ Antananarivo, Ment Zool & Biodiversite Anim, BP 906, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Goodman, Steven M.] Field Museum Nat Hist, 1400 South Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Dammhahn, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Anim Ecol, Fac Nat Sci, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",melanie.dammhahn@uni-potsdam.de,"Dammhahn, Melanie/AAD-5479-2019",,,,,88,10,11,2,34,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1472-6785,,BMC ECOL,BMC Ecol.,APR 17,2017,17,,,,,,,,16,10.1186/s12898-017-0125-0,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ES0BM,WOS:000399190900001,28412938,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-27,

Cercoapgis pengoi is most abundant in late summer and fall. Therefore, we hypothesized that abundance of small zooplankton (bosminids and cyclopoids) species would decrease at that time. To determine if the establishment of C. pengoi was followed by changes in the zooplankton community, seasonal patterns in nearshore zooplankton collected from May to October 1995-2000 were examined. Early summer density of small zooplankton was similar in all years while late summer and fall densities were significantly lower in 1998-2000 than in 1995-1997. The declines of small zooplankton coincided seasonally with the peak in C. pengoi density. Other possible causes for the observed changes in small zooplankton are less likely. High levels of fish predation should have resulted in smaller zooplankton in 1998-2000 than in 1995-1997 and larger declines in Daphnia than other groups. This was not observed. There was no significant decline in chlorophyll-a concentrations or changes in temperature between 1995-1997 and 1998-2000. There re, the declines in density of small zooplankton were most likely the result of C. pengoi predation. The effect of C. pengoi establishment on alewives is increased competition for zooplankton prey but C. pengoi has replaced a portion of the zooplankton biomass and adult alewife diet formerly dominated by Diacyclops thomasi and Bosmina longirostris.","USGS Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; Cornell Univ, Biol Field Stn, Bridgeport, NY 13030 USA; Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Marine Fish Sect, Gulf Fisheries Ctr, Moncton, NB E1C 9B6, Canada; Fisheries & Oceans Canada, GLLFAS Burlington, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada","Warner, D (corresponding author), USGS Great Lakes Sci Ctr, 1451 Green Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.",dmwarner@usgs.gov,"Warner, David/C-8858-2009",,,,,47,28,30,1,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Theory predicts that prey species will fluctuate in phase if predator-prey cycles are coupled through generalist predators, whereas they will fluctuate in anti-phase if predator-prey cycles are coupled through competition between prey species. Here, we investigate predator-prey oscillations in a long-term experiment with a marine plankton community. Wavelet analysis of the species fluctuations reveals two predator-prey cycles that fluctuate largely in anti-phase. The phase angles point at strong competition between the phytoplankton species, but relatively little prey overlap among the zooplankton species. This food web architecture is consistent with the size structure of the plankton community, and generates highly dynamic food webs. Continued alternations in species dominance enable coexistence of the prey species through a non-equilibrium 'killing-the-winner' mechanism, as the system shifts back and forth between the two predator-prey cycles in a chaotic fashion.","[Beninca, Elisa; Johnk, Klaus D.; Huisman, Jef] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Beninca, Elisa] Univ Wageningen, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Johnk, Klaus D.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Neuglobsow, Germany; [Heerkloss, Reinhard] Univ Rostock, Inst Biosci, D-18051 Rostock, Germany","Huisman, J (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 127, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.huisman@uva.nl,"Johnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008; Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013","Johnk, Klaus/0000-0002-5972-4201; Huisman, Jef/0000-0001-9598-3211",Earth and Life Sciences Foundation (ALW),"We thank Gilbert Compo, Christopher Torrence and Aslak Grinsted for helpful feedback on the wavelet analysis, Tom van Engeland, Marten Scheffer, Egbert van Nes and Mercedes Pascual for useful discussions, and the anonymous referees for their helpful comments on the manuscript.

Species may reach oceanic islands by three mechanisms: (1) mating flights of reproductives, (2) rafting, and (3) human-assisted dispersal. Past land bridge connections may be important for continental shelf islands. Patterns of species accumulation may be similar even when primary mechanisms of dispersal differ. Colonizing propagules are limited primarily by the presence of suitable habitat and interspecific competition or predation from other ants. Although island area is usually a significant predictor of species richness, the diversity of habitat types is often a better predictor. Distance, or isolation, has often been found to be only a weak predictor of ant species richness, probably because many islands that have been studied are not very distant relative to most species' dispersal abilities. Interspecific competition appears to result in mutually exclusive distributions within islands for some of the more aggressive species, although the effects of habitat affinities have not been well studied. With the exception of very small islands, competition does not appear to result in exclusions of species from entire islands, and robust patterns of nestedness have been observed. Populations go extinct from and immigrate to small islands in ecological time, although such turnover appears to be relatively low compared with other arthropods. Only a few archipelagoes, however, have been the focus of turnover studies. Some species may reach extremely high population abundances on islands but subsequently decline. The exact mechanisms underlying these population fluctuations are not known with certainty, although the presence of honeydew-producing insects has often been associated with the most dramatic cases. Endemicity varies greatly and ranges from 0 to > 96%, peaking at intermediate distances in the Pacific and reaching the highest levels on islands in the Indian Ocean. Anthropogenic disturbances appear to present the greatest driver of change to insular ant communities and result in increasing numbers and abundances of exotic ant species, which may have deleterious effects on the rest of the community.","[Morrison, Lloyd W.] Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, 901 S Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65897 USA","Morrison, LW (corresponding author), Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, 901 S Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65897 USA.",LloydMorrison@MissouriState.edu,,,National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society,"Thanks to Nicholas Gotelli and Florian Steiner for inviting me to write this article, and to Ken Helms and an anonymous reviewer for their insightful comments.

This frequently involves conspicuous changes in the abundance of one species (e.g., an oubreaking pest or keystone species). Alternate attractors in population dynamics could explain switches between low and high levels of abundance, and could underlie some cases of regime shifts in ecosystems; this longstanding theoretical possibility has been difficult to test in nature. We compared the ability of an alternate attractors model versus two competing models to explain population fluctuations in the tree-killing bark beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis. Frequency distributions of abundance were distinctly bimodal, a prediction of the alternate attractors model, strongly indicating the lack of a single, noisy equilibrium. Time series abundance data refuted the existence of strong delayed density-dependence or nonlinearities, as required by the endogenous cycles model. The model of alternate attractors was further supported by the existence of positive density-dependence at intermediate beetle abundances. Experimental manipulations show that interactions with competitors and shared enemies could create a locally stable equilibrium in small populations of D. frontalis. High variation among regions and years in the abundance of predators and competitors could permit switches between alternate states. Dendroctonus frontalis now provides the strongest case that we know of for alternate attractors in natural population dynamics. The accompanying demographic instability appears to underlie spatially extensive outbreaks that have lasting impacts on forest ecosystems. Understanding feedbacks in populations with alternate attractors can help to identify thresholds underlying regime shifts, and potentially manage them to avoid undesirable impacts.","[Ylioja, Tiina] Finnish Forest Res Inst, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland; [Sullivan, Brian T.] US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, USDA, Pineville, LA 71360 USA; [Billings, Ronald F.] Texas Forest Serv, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; [Ayres, Matthew P.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Martinson, SJ (corresponding author), 184 Running Iron Rd,5, Bishop, CA 93514 USA.",Sharon.J.Martinson@alum.Dartmouth.org,"Ayres, Matthew/AAI-6873-2020","Ayres, Matthew/0000-0001-6120-9068; Ylioja, Tiina/0000-0002-8840-7504",NRI/AFRI [2009-65104-05731]; Southern Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service,"Maria Lombardero was instrumental in teaching SJM how to identify the hundreds of insects we found in our traps.

In particular, the paradigm for strong, directly density-dependent (DDD) postsettlement mortality stands in contrast to recent evidence for inversely density-dependent (IDD) mortality. We review the processes responsible for DDD and IDD per capita mortality in reef fishes, noting that the pattern observed depends on predator and prey behavior, the spatial configuration of the reef habitat, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Specifically, predators tend to produce DDD prey mortality at their characteristic spatial scale of foraging, but prey mortality is IDD at smaller spatial scales due to attack-abatement effects (e. g., risk dilution). As a result, DDD mortality may be more common than IDD mortality on patch reefs, which tend to constrain predator foraging to the same scale as prey aggregation, eliminating attack-abatement effects. Additionally, adjacent groups of prey on continuous reefs may share a subset of refuges, increasing per capita refuge availability and relaxing DDD mortality relative to prey on patch reefs, where the patch edge could prevent such refuge sharing. These hypotheses lead to a synthetic framework to predict expected mortality patterns for a variety of scenarios. For nonsocial, nonaggregating species and species that aggregate in order to take advantage of spatially clumped refuges, IDD mortality is possible but likely superseded by DDD refuge competition, especially on patch reefs. By contrast, for species that aggregate socially, mortality should be IDD at the scale of individual aggregations but DDD at larger scales. The results of nearly all prior reef fish studies fit within this framework, although additional work is needed to test many of the predicted outcomes. This synthesis reconciles some apparent contradictions in the recent reef fish literature and suggests the importance of accounting for the scale-sensitive details of predator and prey behavior in any study system.","[White, J.

Both verbal and mathematical models suggest that host species with higher fitness costs associated with parasitism should bear a competitive disadvantage in the presence of parasites. However, few rigorous empirical tests exist. This study examined the effects of a tapeworm parasite (Hymenolepis diminuta) on competition between two flour beetle species (Tribolium confusum and T. castaneum). The flour beetles are the intermediate host of this rat tapeworm parasite. Previous studies demonstrated that T. castaneum is usually the superior competitor in competition with T. confusum in parasite-free environments. However, because T. castaneum is more susceptible to parasitism and shows higher fitness costs when infected than T. confusum, we expected that T. castaneum would bear a competitive disadvantage in the presence of the parasite. In contrast, we found that tapeworm infection significantly increased the likelihood of T. castaneum winning the competition, reduced the time needed for T. castaneum to win, and increased T. castaneum population density compared to parasite-free populations. Therefore, our results suggest that the tapeworm infection confers some advantage to T. castaneum and are in contrast to the expectation based on mathematical studies and verbal arguments. Disagreements between experimental results and the hypothesized predictions probably reflect the effect of parasite-induced changes in intraguild predation. Our results suggest that theories on parasite effects of competition need to consider the complex nature of host-parasite associations, including the effect of parasites on host behaviors.","Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Yan, GY (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biol Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",,"Goodnight, Charles/K-3208-2019","Stevens, Lori/0000-0003-3847-5979",,,,52,28,30,0,16,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1998,79,3,,,,,1093,1103,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1093:EOATPO]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZG985,WOS:000073060300029,,,,,2021-09-27,

Feeding on both plant and animal material and scavenging are probably more significant than currently acknowledged. The most important mortality sources are abiotic factors and predators; pathogens and parasites can be important for some developmental stages. Although competition among larvae and adults does occur, the importance of competition as a community organization is not proven.

Amphipods play a key role in various aquatic ecosystems. Gammarus aequicauda is an abundant widespread omnivorous species and the only known amphipod species of hypersaline waters. Its predation can suppress the populations of planktonic and benthic invertebrates. Males of G. aequicauda actively eat chironomid larvae but there is no data on predatory females. Experiments were conducted to study sex-related differences in feeding behavior including during precopulatory mate guarding (PCMG). There were significant sex differences in feeding characteristics. For females, calculations showed that maximum consumption could be 3-4 chironomid larvae per day and for males about 9-10 larvae per day. During PCMG, males did not feed and females fed as efficiently as single females. Males transported females and alone carrying the energetic costs of swimming during PCMG. Less expenditure of energy on swimming means more energy for reproduction for females. This allows more energy-efficient use of food resources and increases the reproductive success of the population. There are currently two alternative views on PCMG among crustaceans. 1. It is a sexual conflict between males and females serving as a male adaptive strategy to achieve a female during strong male competition, while females bear many costs during the long guarding period. 2. There is also the opposite view that pairs get energetic benefits from long PCMG. Obtained data suggest that PCMG is likely to be intersexual cooperation and not intersexual conflict.","[Shadrin, Nickolai; Yakovenko, Vladimir; Anufriieva, Elena] RAS, AO Kovalevsky Inst Biol, Lab Extreme Ecosyst, 2 Nakhimov Ave, Sevastopol 299011, Russia","Anufriieva, E (corresponding author), RAS, AO Kovalevsky Inst Biol, Lab Extreme Ecosyst, 2 Nakhimov Ave, Sevastopol 299011, Russia.",lena_anufriieva@mail.ru,"Nickolai V, Shadrin/C-5684-2016; Anufriieva, Elena/C-6458-2016","Nickolai V, Shadrin/0000-0002-2580-3710; Anufriieva, Elena/0000-0002-6237-7941",Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [18-16-00001] Funding Source: Medline; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [121041500203-3] Funding Source: Medline,,,46,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2471-5638,2471-5646,,J EXP ZOOL PART A,J.

In these programs, efficient sampling is a decisive factor for undertaking management measures. In this study, a one year survey of arthropods attacking stored barley and their natural enemies was conducted in two experimental piles, in which no fumigation was applied. Sampling was performed on a monthly basis with a grain sampling trier, with pitfall traps and yellow sticky traps. The parasitoid Anisopteromalus calandrae was released twice in one of the piles with the aim of testing its establishment and control capacity on the infesting beetles. Seven coleopteran and one psocid species formed the assemblage of pests that attacked the two barley piles, among which Sitophilus granarius, Rhyzopertha dominica and Latheticus oryzae were the most abundant species. Two parasitoids, A. calandrae and Cephalonomia waterstoni, and one predator, Withius piger, were the beneficial organisms found. Two releases of A. calandrae were successful in establishing the parasitoid, but they were not enough for controlling either S. granarius or R. dominica. Pitfall traps captured the same complex of species as the grain sample trier but the abundance of each species was not always the same in both devices. These traps were good for detecting the early presence of most species. Yellow sticky traps only captured some species from the pest complex and trapped high numbers of the parasitoid A. calandrae. They can be of help as indicators of the colonization of some specific pests, such as R. dominica, in the first weeks of the invasion process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

First, predation acts to increase growth rate by thinning the density of prey populations, which releases survivors from competition. At the same time, predators intimidate prey into decreasing their feeding activity and increasing refuge use, causing prey to grow more slowly. Both processes are known to affect individual growth rates in many systems, but their relative importances and interactive effects have not been measured. We designed an experiment to estimate the separate and joint effects of thinning and activity suppression, using Rana sylvatica tadpoles reared in 1100-L outdoor artificial ponds. The experiment manipulated the perceived risk of predation (using caged Anax dragonfly larvae) independently from the loss rate (by manually removing tadpoles every other day according to a predetermined mortality schedule). The presence of predators caused tadpoles to decrease time spent feeding and swimming, verifying that the conditions for behaviorally-mediated growth suppression were satisfied. During the first half of the experiment, when tadpoles were small and not yet competing for food, growth declined sharply with predation risk but was unaffected by thinning. During the second half of the experiment, when tadpoles were much larger and had presumably depleted food resources, growth rate increased under thinning but was unaffected by predation risk. Overall, there was an interaction among treatments because activity suppression was only important at low density, while thinning was especially important in the absence of predation risk. Our results suggest that the numerical effects of predators on prey will predominate in communities composed of strongly interacting species with resource depletion (e.g., communities with clear keystone predator effects), whereas growth costs of predator avoidance may quantitatively affect species interactions in communities with less severe exploitative competition.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Van Buskirk, J (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",jvb@zool.unizh.chj,,"Van Buskirk, Josh/0000-0002-0486-3626",,,,42,129,133,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1998,82,1,,,,,20,28,,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZP136,WOS:000073720000003,,,,,2021-09-27,

But it is unclear how the need for water interacts with the need for energy to drive trophic interactions under shifting conditions. Using manipulative field experiments, we show that water balance influences the effects of top predators on prey with contrasting ratios of water and energy, altering the frequency of intraguild predation. Water-stressed top predators (large spiders) negatively affect water-laden basal prey (crickets), especially male prey with higher water content, whereas alleviation of water limitation causes top predators to switch to negatively affecting energy-rich midlevel predators (small spiders). Thus, the relative water and energy content of multiple prey, combined with the water demand of the top predator, influences trophic interactions in ways that can alter the strength of intraguild predation. These findings underscore the need for integration of multiresource approaches for understanding implications of global change for food webs.","[Leinbach, Israel L.; McCluney, Kevin E.; Sabo, John L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Leinbach, Israel L.] USDA ARS, US Forest Serv, Hilo, HI USA; [McCluney, Kevin E.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Sabo, John L.] Arizona State Univ, Future H2O Knowledge Enterprise Dev, Tempe, AZ USA","McCluney, KE (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.; McCluney, KE (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",kmcclun@bgsu.edu,,"McCluney, Kevin/0000-0002-3574-0354",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0842410],"We thank Karl Wyant, Michael Quinlan, Robin Greene, Dan Allen, Martin Vega, Eric Moody, Ruben Marchosky, and Zach Lancaster.

As predatory effectiveness is influenced by the presence of other dominant ant species, understanding the ecological factors at work in agroecosystems lies at the basis of conservation biological control. Over three and a half years, the effect of ground vegetation management on the beneficial tree-nesting ant Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille) and its competitor, the ground-nesting ant, Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius), was studied in a citrus orchard in Tanzania. When ground vegetation was present, P megacephala tolerated O. longinoda and to some extent cohabited with this ant in citrus trees. However, after clean cultivation, P. megacephala displaced O. longinoda from tree crowns and became the sole occupant of the majority of trees. Displacement could be reversed by reversing the weed management regime, but this took time. Two years after the establishment of ground vegetation about half of the trees were colonized by Oecophylla only. Maintaining ground vegetation in tree crop plantations benefits the establishment and abundance of Oecophylla over Pheidole and is recommended in order to improve the efficiency of biological control of tree pests. The use of Amdro ant bait (hydramethylnon) to control P. megacephala is discussed. Boosting agroecological innovations, such as the one described in this paper, could benefit smallholder producers.

We assessed the impact of predation by the invertebrate predator Leptodora kindtii on Bosmina longirostris and B. fatalis, which show seasonal and reciprocal succession patterns in Lake Suwa, in a mesocosm experiment using 20-L tanks with or without the predator under different food conditions. We also analysed morphological responses of the two Bosmina species to the predator in the tanks. 2. Bosmina fatalis dominated B. longirostris regardless of predator presence under high food density. However, the presence of Leptodora induced the dominance of B. fatalis more rapidly than its absence. On the contrary, no dominance of B. fatalis was observed in tanks with low food density, irrespective of the presence of the predator. Only B. fatalis showed morphological changes in response to the presence of Leptodora. 3. Mucrone length and antennule shape (angle between body and antennule and angle between antennules) showed marked responses at both high and low food densities, but antennule length responded only at high food density. Mucrone length seems to be a more effective defence against Leptodora. 4. The results suggest that B. fatalis is a superior competitor against B. longirostris and is more resistant to Leptodora predation, especially in good food conditions. The repeatedly observed seasonal succession of the two Bosmina species in the eutrophic Lake Suwa - the replacement of B. longirostris by B. fatalis following the occurrence of abundant Leptodora- seems to be caused by the selective predation of Leptodora on B. longirostris as well as the competitive ability of B. fatalis.","Shinshu Univ, Res & Educ Ctr Inlandwater Environm, Suwa 3920027, Japan","Chang, KH (corresponding author), Shinshu Univ, Res & Educ Ctr Inlandwater Environm, 5-2-4 Kogandori, Suwa 3920027, Japan.",changkwang38@hotmail.com,,"chang, Kwang-Hyeon/0000-0002-7952-4047",,,,44,17,20,0,7,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Predators were excluded from 1996 to 2000 by eight predator-proof fences (each 0.5 ha) constructed on old fields. Despite a major increase in vole densities, the expected trophic cascade attenuated rapidly so that the indirect effects of predator exclusion were restricted to a few plant species. The cause for the rapid attenuation of the trophic cascade appeared to be strong seasonality, as peak densities of voles were attained at the end of the growing season of vegetation, and vole populations declined before the next growing season so that the herbivory pressure during the growing season remained low or moderate. Accordingly, most plants escaped the heaviest grazing pressure either in time (plants completed their reproduction and withered before winter) or in space (living parts hidden under frozen ground and ice). However, heavy winter herbivory reduced the biomass of available vegetation and killed woody species (willows) at vole peaks, which implies that predator exclusion may have a strong effect on secondary succession. During summer, voles reduced the coverage of only a few preferred food plants (Elymus repens, Phleum pratense, Vicia cracca). Voles also maintained annual and biennial species in the community by creating gaps in the closed vegetation. We conclude that abiotic factors (harsh winter conditions) limited peak numbers of herbivores below a threshold density where herbivores could have caused a community-level decline in the biomass of herbaceous plants during summer.","Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Agrifood Res Finland, Anim Prod Res, FIN-31600 Jokioinen, Finland","Norrdahl, K (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",kainor@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X",,,,64,52,54,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2002,99,3,,,,,419,430,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.12025.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,635YX,WOS:000180428700002,,,,,2021-09-27,

To test this hypothesis, several competition experiments were conducted that involved pairing O. maculosus from three size classes in a laboratory setting and observing their behaviour when presented with food or cover. When both fish attempted to procure food, the success rate of the larger fish was significantly higher than that of the smaller fish (Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test, T = 0, N = 6, p < 0.025). Furthermore, as the size difference between the two fish increased, the smaller fish made significantly fewer simultaneous attempts to procure the food (hierarchical log-linear test, partial chi(2)([5]) = 28.326, p < 0.001), and utilized the cover significantly less (ANOVA, F-[5] = 3.387, p = 0.008). The results from these experiments indicated that larger fish have a competitive advantage over smaller fish which extends to the acquisition of both food and cover. This is presumed to be the result of both greater competitive ability due to increasing size and an increased need for smaller fish to avoid detrimental aggressive interactions. In view of evidence from other papers indicating that the lower pools are more desirable to O. maculosus, it is suggested that intercohort competition is in part responsible for limiting the smaller fish to the upper tide pools.","Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada","Szabo, AR (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, STN CSC, POB 3020, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.",aszabo@uvic.ca,,,,,,32,25,25,0,20,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Komodo National Park in Eastern Indonesia, harbors the largest extant populations of the endemic Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis). Consistent with global trends, this species is expected to be increasingly exposed to human activities and in particular growing ecotourism activities. Here we comprehensively evaluated how human activities affected individual and population level attributes of Komodo dragons. We compared Komodo dragons phenotypic (behaviour, body size, and body condition) and demographic (age structure, sex ratio, survival, and density) responses to variation in human activities across national park. Komodo dragons were found to exhibit pronounced responses to high human activity level relative to sites with low and negligible human activities. Komodo dragons exposed to ecotourism exhibited significantly less wariness, larger body mass, better body condition, and higher survival. These results are entirely consistent with ecotourism activities that provided Komodo dragons with long-term and substantial nutritional subsidies as a consequence of feeding and human food refuse. However, we also noted the potential negative consequences of altered behaviour and adult-biased populations in ecotourism areas which may influence demographic processes through intraspecific competition or predation. To address this issue, we recommend that three management strategies to be implemented in future include: (1) removal of human-mediated nutritional subsidies, (2) alternative ecotourism, and (3) spatial regulation of ecotourism. Furthermore, we advocate the development of approaches to achieve a socio-ecological sustainabilitythat benefits both people and wildlife conservation.","[Ardiantiono; Purwandana, Deni; Imansyah, M.

We selected, a priori, three species pairs consisting of species that are morphologically and taxonomically similar and may therefore be likely to engage in interspecific, consumptive competition. We then examined a large-scale database of snake detection/nondetection data and used occupancy modelling to determine whether these species occur together more or less frequently than expected by chance while accounting for variation in detection probability among species and incorporating important habitat categories in the models. For some snakes, we obtained evidence that the probabilities that habitat patches are used are influenced by the presence of potentially competing congeneric species. Specifically, timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) were less likely than expected by chance to use areas that also contained eastern diamond-backed rattlesnakes (Crotalus adamanteus) when the proportion of evergreen forest was relatively high. Otherwise, they occurred together more often than expected by chance. Complex relationships were revealed between habitat use, detection probabilities and occupancy probabilities of North American racers (Coluber constrictor) and coachwhips (Coluber flagellum) that indicated the probability of competitive exclusion increased with increasing area of grassland habitat, although there was some model uncertainty. Cornsnakes (Pantherophis guttatus or Pantherophis slowinskii) and ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis, Pantherophis spiloides, or Pantherophis obsoletus) exhibited differences in habitat selection, but we obtained no evidence that patterns of use for this species pair were influenced by current interspecific interactions. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that competitive interactions influence snake assemblage composition; the strength of these effects was affected by landscape-scale habitat features. Furthermore, we suggest that current interspecific interactions may influence snake occupancy, challenging the paradigm that contemporary patterns of snake co-occurrence are largely a function of diet partitioning that arose over evolutionary time.","[Steen, David A.; Brock, Jean C.; Smith, Lora L.] Joseph W Jones Ecol Res Ctr, Newton, GA 39870 USA; [Steen, David A.; McClure, Christopher J.

Bark beetles and their predators are useful systems for addressing questions concerning diet breadth and prey preference in arthropod natural enemies. These predators use bark beetle pheromones to locate their prey, and the response to different pheromones is a measure of prey preference. 2. Trapping experiments were conducted to examine geographic variation in the response to prey pheromones by two bark beetle predators, Thanasimus dubius and Temnochila virescens. The experiments used pheromones for several Dendroctonus and Ips prey species (frontalin, ipsdienol, and ipsenol) and manipulated visual cues involved in prey location (black vs. white traps). The study sites included regions where the frontalin-emitter Dendroctonus frontalis was in outbreak vs. endemic or absent. 3. There was significant geographic variation in pheromone preference for T. dubius. This predator strongly preferred a pheromone (frontalin) associated with D. frontalis at outbreak sites, while preference was more even at endemic and absent sites. No geographic variation was found in the response by T. virescens. White traps caught fewer insects than black traps for both predators, suggesting that visual cues are also important in prey location. 4. The overall pattern for T. dubius is consistent with switching or optimal foraging theory, assuming D. frontalis is a higher quality prey than Ips. The two predator species partition the prey pheromones in areas where D. frontalis is abundant, possibly to minimise competition and intraguild predation.","[Reeve, John D.; Costa, Arnaud] So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Strom, Brian L.] USDA, So Res Stn, Forest Serv, Pineville, LA USA; [Rieske, Lynne K.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Ayres, Bruce D.] Great Lakes Inst Pine Ecosyst Res, Colfax, WI USA","Reeve, JD (corresponding author), So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",jreeve@zoology.siu.edu,"Costa, Arnaud/I-6359-2012",,USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); SIUC; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [LTREB-0314215],"This research was supported by a cooperative agreement with the Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, a Faculty Research/Creative Grant from SIUC, and NSF LTREB-0314215.

Periodic removal of predators effectively reduced the species richness and abundance of predators on removal reefs. The difference between the number of predators on control and removal reefs was greatest immediately following the removal of predators and attenuated between removals. During periods of recruitment, species richness and total abundance of recently-recruited, non-piscivorous fishes were generally greater on predator-removal reefs than on control reefs. Species richness and total abundance of resident non-piscivorous fishes were not affected by the removal of predators in the first year of the experiment. Both abundance and species richness of residents, however, were greater on the removal reefs during the second year of the experiment. The difference in the responses of the two age classes to the removal of predators suggests that predators may affect community patterns of older age classes through time-lagged effects on the survivorship of younger age classes. At the end of the experiment, species richness was positively related to abundance for recruits and residents. The effects of removing piscivorous fishes on the abundance of non-piscivorous fishes were similar for species considered separately. A greater number of species of recruit and resident fishes were more abundant on reefs from which predators had been removed. These data suggest that predators can play an important role in structuring communities of fishes on coral reefs.","UNIV SYDNEY, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2006, AUSTRALIA",,,"Caley, Julian/A-4042-2008","Caley, Julian/0000-0001-5739-749X",,,,54,90,90,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

However, few studies have quantified actual mortality during mate search, making it difficult to predict mate searching and mating strategies. Using a mark and recapture study, we examined mate-searching success in a highly sexually dimorphic species, the golden orb-web spider (Nephila plumipes). We show that despite the high-density aggregations of this species, male survival during mate searching is extremely low (36%) and is phenotype independent. Surprisingly, males that survived mate search were in better condition after recapture than prior to release, most likely due to kleptoparasitism on females' webs. In a complementary release experiment in a field enclosure, we show that males are choosy and adjust their choice of female depending on their own condition and weight. Thus, the high mortality rate of searching males in the field may be a cost of choosiness because released males traveled further than necessary to settle on females. Although males were choosy about female phenotypes, they did not avoid webs with rival males already present. This suggests that the cost of continued searching outweighs the cost of competition but not the cost of mating with certain females. Further examinations of mate-searching risk in other species in reference to their mating system and environmental conditions are necessary to determine the occurrence and effects of high mortality rates during searching.","Univ Toronto, Integrat Behav & Neurosci Grp, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia","Kasumovic, MM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Integrat Behav & Neurosci Grp, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",m.kasumovic@utoronto.ca,"Bruce, Matt/K-7948-2019; Kasumovic, Michael/F-1331-2011; Herberstein, Marie E./D-2042-2011; Bruce, Matthew/A-9882-2008","Bruce, Matt/0000-0002-9146-901X; Herberstein, Marie E./0000-0001-5071-2952; Bruce, Matthew/0000-0002-9146-901X; Kasumovic, Michael/0000-0003-0158-5517; Andrade, Maydianne/0000-0002-2931-5378",,,,45,97,99,0,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Further, a range of density-dependent and density-independent biotic and abiotic processes affect the phenology of mosquito populations, with potentially large knock-on effects for vector dynamics and disease transmission. Whilst it is understood that density-independent and density-dependent processes affect seasonal population levels, it is not clear how these interact temporally to shape the population peaks and troughs. Due to this, the paucity of high-resolution data for validation, and the difficulty of parameterizing density-dependent processes, models of vector dynamics may poorly estimate abundances, which has knock-on effects for our ability predict vector-borne disease outbreaks.ResultsWe present a rich dataset describing seasonal abundance patterns of each life stage of Culex pipiens, a widespread vector of West Nile virus, at a field site in southern England in 2015. Abundance of immature stages was measured three times per week, whilst adult traps were run four nights each week. This dataset is integrated with an existing delay-differential equation model predicting Cx. pipiens seasonal abundance to improve understanding of observed seasonal abundance patterns. At our field site, the outcome of our model fitting suggests interspecific predation on mosquito larvae and temperature-dependent larval mortality combine to act as the main sources of population regulation throughout the active season, whilst competition for resources is a relatively small source of larval mortality.ConclusionsThe model suggests that density-independent mortality and interspecific predation interact to shape patterns of mosquito seasonal abundance in a permanent aquatic habitat and we propose that competition for resources is likely to be important where periods of high rainfall create transient habitats. Further, we highlight the importance of challenging population abundance models with data from across all life stages of the species of interest if reliable inferences are to be drawn from these models, particularly when considering mosquito control and vector-borne disease transmission.","[Ewing, David A.; Purse, Bethan V.; Schafer, Stefanie M.; White, Steven M.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Benson Lane, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Ewing, David A.; Cobbold, Christina A.] Univ Glasgow, Dept Math & Stat, Univ Pl, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Ewing, David A.] Biomath & Stat Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell Bldg,Peter Guthrie Tate Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Cobbold, Christina A.] Univ Glasgow, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [White, Steven M.] Radcliffe Observ Quarter, Math Inst, Wolfson Ctr Math Biol, Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England","Ewing, DA (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Benson Lane, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.; Ewing, DA (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Dept Math & Stat, Univ Pl, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.; Ewing, DA (corresponding author), Biomath & Stat Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell Bldg,Peter Guthrie Tate Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland.",david.ewing@bioss.ac.uk,"Schafer, Stefanie/H-3070-2016; Purse, Bethan V/I-6640-2012","Schafer, Stefanie/0000-0002-8748-7725; Purse, Bethan V/0000-0001-5140-2710; Ewing, David/0000-0002-9974-8179",Natural Environment Research Council Doctoral Training Grant [NE/L501645/1]; Natural Environment Research Council National Capability allocation [NEC05100 HARM]; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/P004202/1],This work was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council Doctoral Training Grant (Grant no.

This study examines the effect of body size differences on intraguild predation (IGP) and cannibalism in regulating the relative abundance of two species of temperate marine amphipods throughout a season. Intraguild predation was asymmetrical, with primarily Jassa marmorata preying on Apocorophium acutum (with little predation by A. acutum on J marmorata). Intraguild predation increased significantly as body size difference increased. Cannibalism in J marmorata was only significant among individuals of different body sizes. Tube building by A. acutum was also found to be effective in protecting against IGP, especially in the presence of large J marmorata. Experimental results suggest an ontogenctic niche shift occurs in J marmorata, which may provide a potential explanation for observed patterns of abundance in a natural population.

Although trees and their cavities change as they age, with trees becoming softer and cavities becoming larger, it is not known how their value as nesting resources varies with age. In the context of wildlife and forest management, we investigated the relative value of generating a supply of fresh cavities, which are thought to be of high quality, versus protecting cavities as they age and expand in interior volume. For 21 years (1995-2016), we monitored the formation and occupancy of tree cavities used by >30 species of birds and mammals in interior British Columbia, Canada. Cavity occupancy by secondary users was highest 1 year post-excavation (53%), then declined to 40% after 2 years, remained at 337% (SD) between 3 and 16 years of age, and increased to 50% use from 17-20 years post-excavation. Excavators that reused cavities (woodpeckers [Picidae], nuthatches [Sitta spp.]) strongly selected 1- and 2-year-old cavities, large-bodied non-excavators (ducks, raptors, squirrels) selected mid-aged cavities, and mountain bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) selected most strongly for the oldest cavities. Cavities created in living aspen trees (Populus spp.), especially those excavated by northern flickers (Colaptes auratus), maintained high occupancy by secondary users across cavity age, and provided the bulk of cavities used in this system. Altogether, these results show that a diverse excavator community is needed to generate a supply of fresh cavities in the ecosystem, and retention of the mid-aged and older cavities will help support larger species. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society. We found that occupancy of tree cavities declined from 53% in the first year after excavation to 33% in cavities that are 3-20 years old, with small species and strong competitors selecting for fresh or young cavities. However, because occupancy by large species increased with cavity age, it is important to conserve both young and old cavities to sustain diverse and abundant cavity-nesting vertebrate communities.","[Edworthy, Amanda B.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, 100 Dairy Rd, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Trzcinski, M.

We collected 12,379 immature mosquitoes representing five species, primarily Culiseta inornata, and secondarily, the arboviral vector Culex quinquefasciatus. Dragonfly nymphs in the families Aeshnidae and Libelluhdae were the most common predatory invertebrates collected among a total of 32 non-mosquito invertebrate species. Eleven species of fishes were collected, with Gambusia affinis accounting for 76% of the catch. Diversity of fishes in swimming pools was positively correlated with proximity to a levee breach and the fish assemblage found in swimming pools was similar to that found along shorelines of Lake Pontchartrain and drainage canals that flooded the study area. Mosquito larvae were rare or absent from pools containing fishes; however, path analysis indicated that the presence of top predators or abundant competitors may somewhat mitigate the effect of Gambusia affinis on mosquito presence.","[Caillouet, Kevin A.; Wesson, Dawn] Tulane Univ, Dept Trop Med, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Carlson, John C.] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Jordan, Frank] Loyola Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Caillouet, KA (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Dept Trop Med, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",,,,ODCDC CDC HHS [T01/CCT622308] Funding Source: Medline,,,34,25,26,0,21,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,CORONA,"1966 COMPTON AVE, CORONA, CA 92881 USA",1081-1710,1948-7134,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

We established two types of experimental plots in the forest floor, one with sheets on the ground to prevent the emergence of belowground arthropods and the other without sheet, to test the hypotheses that 1) reduced input of detrital arthropods decreases the abundance and species richness of web spiders (major generalist predators in terrestrial ecosystems) and 2) lower number of spiders increases the abundance of herbivorous arthropods. We found that spiders were less abundant in plots where the emergence of detrital arthropods was reduced, while the abundance of herbivores did not significantly increase in these plots.

The consequences of omnivory have been studied theoretically, but empirical studies are still lacking. Omnivory is nevertheless common in nature and omnivorous predators coexist with specialists in many ecosystems, even when they are intraguild predators. This type of association is also common in agroecosystems in which biological control strategies are used. Our study provides an example of the outcome of such an association in the context of biological control of the invasive pest Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera) in a tomato agroecosystem. The two natural enemies involved, that is, a specialist (Stenomesius japonicus (Hymenoptera) parasitoid) and an omnivore (Macrolophus pygmaeus (Hemiptera) predator), were able to coexist for 3months in our experimental cages in the absence of metacommunity mechanisms (i.e., emigration and recolonization), contrary to theoretical expectations. However, they negatively affected each other's population dynamics. We found that spatial resource segregation was not a mechanism that promoted their coexistence. Regarding pest control, the specialist and omnivorous natural enemies were found to exhibit complementary functional traits, leading to the best control when together. Mechanisms that may have promoted the coexistence of the two species as well as consequences with regard to the inoculative biological control program are discussed.","[Chailleux, Anais] ISRA UCAD IRD, Biopass, Dakar, Senegal; [Chailleux, Anais] CIRAD, UPR HortSys, Montpellier, France; [Chailleux, Anais] InVivo AgroSolut, Paris, France; [Droui, Anthony; Bearez, Philippe; Desneux, Nicolas] Univ Cote dAzur, INRA French Natl Inst Agr Res, CNRS, UMR 1355 7254,Inst Sophia Agrobiotech, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France","Chailleux, A (corresponding author), IRD Joint Res Ctr, Biopass, Dakar, Senegal.",chailleux.anais@gmail.com,"Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013","Chailleux, Anais/0000-0001-5653-8019",ANRTFrench National Research Agency (ANR); InVivo AgroSolutions; French Ministry of Agriculture [10063]; CASDAR project [10063],"ANRT; InVivo AgroSolutions; French Ministry of Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: 10063; CASDAR project, Grant/Award Number: 10063",,80,10,11,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Furthermore, resource availability has been shown to be a fundamental driver of species diversity. Yet, we still do not have a clear understanding of how resource availability mediates the diversity generated by coevolution between hosts and parasitoids over time. We used experiments with bacteria and bacteriophage to test how resources affect variation in the competitive ability of resistant hosts and temporal patterns of diversity in the host and parasitoid as a result of antagonistic coevolution. Bacteria and bacteriophage coevolved for over 150 bacterial generations under high and low-resource conditions. We measured relative competitive ability of the resistant hosts and phenotypic diversity of hosts and parasitoids after the initial invasion of resistant mutants and again at the end of the experiment. Variation in relative competitive ability of the hosts was both time- and environment-dependent. The diversity of resistant hosts, and the abundance of host-range mutants attacking these phenotypes, differed among environments and changed over time, but the direction of these changes differed between the host and parasitoid. Our results demonstrate that patterns of fitness and diversity resulting from coevolutionary interactions can be highly dynamic.","[Forde, Samantha E.; Thompson, John N.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Holt, Robert D.] Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bohannan, Brendan J.

Polyphagous predators, such as spiders and beetles, perform a fundamental ecosystem service as regulators of agricultural pests, particularly aphids. They are most effective when they colonize the crop before the pest has reached its exponential growth phase. However, this is also when predators find themselves in a state of near-starvation. 2. Predator numbers can be enhanced by applications of different types of organic matter, but the mechanism is not clearly understood. One hypothesis is that compost applied to the field may introduce a new detrital food chain to maintain predators until the pest arrives, but this may also be detrimental to effective pest control, fostering a surplus of alternative prey and causing a switch away from the pest. To elucidate these possible outcomes, we report on the use of within-field compost applications on aphids and their predators, presenting 4 years of field-scale manipulations. 3. We found both direct and indirect links between compost, aphids and predators. In years when compost-treated plots had significantly higher numbers of predators, aphids were in significantly lower numbers than in plots without compost. Conversely, when there was a lack of response by predators, aphid numbers showed similar trends in all treatments. 4. In all years, alternative prey responded strongly to compost application and did not fluctuate at the level shown by predators, suggesting that these two prey groups were decoupled. Instead, the predicted positive feedback of compost on predators numbers was either weak or absent. 5. Synthesis and applications. The effect of compost on aphids clearly requires further practical refinement if it is to provide constant pest suppression, making it difficult to provide specific management recommendations at this stage. In the short term, compost application may not always confer immediate benefits in terms of pest control alone but this must be set against other better known benefits (moisture retention, nutrients). In the long term, experiments measuring the full trophic pathway are needed to unravel the effects of organic matter type, application time and the siting of compost relative to the crop in order to optimise pest suppression potential.","[Bell, James R.; Sunderland, Keith D.; Skirvin, David J.; Mead, Andrew; Kravar-Garde, Lidija; Reynolds, Kelly] Univ Warwick, Warwick HRI, Warwick CV35 9EF, England; [Bell, James R.; Traugott, Michael; Symondson, William O.

Effective management requires that the ecosystem-wide effects of removing invasive species be understood. We investigated the effects of large-scale rabbit control on the abundance (numerical response) and diet (functional response) of an invasive predator (ferret, Mustela putorius furo) that preys on rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), as well as the subsequent predation pressure experienced by alternative prey species (total response), in New Zealand's dryland habitats. Following rabbit control, ferret densities declined but surviving ferrets increased their per capita consumption of lizards and invertebrates, two key native prey groups. Rabbit control increased predation pressure on lizards, but reduced it on invertebrates. While rabbit control can negatively impact some groups of alternative prey up to 18 months post-control, it probably benefits them in the longer term because prey-switching by ferrets tended to reduce with time, and regeneration of vegetation previously over-grazed by rabbits is likely to reduce exposure of native prey to predation. While confirming these benefits will require longer-term monitoring, our results support management actions that limit short-term fluctuations in rabbit abundance and maintain them at low abundance.","[Cliff, Hannah B.; Jones, Menna E.; Johnson, Chris N.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia; [Pech, Roger P.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Heyward, Richard P.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Waldron Rd,RD 1, Alexandra 9340, New Zealand; [Norbury, Grant L.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 282, Alexandra 9340, New Zealand","Cliff, HB (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia.",hcliff11@gmail.com,"Johnson, Chris/J-7894-2014","Johnson, Chris/0000-0002-9719-3771; Cliff, Hannah/0000-0003-2504-2437; Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022",New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Australian Government through the Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects funding scheme [DP170101653],"We thank Don Robson and Dale Norbury for assistance in the field and with data processing, as well as the Campbell, Perriam and Urqhart families for hosting the research on Earnscleugh, Bendigo and Grays Hills stations, respectively.

We studied the influence of local factors (orchard management and adjacent habitats) and of landscape composition on the abundance and community composition of predatory arthropods in apple orchards in three European countries. To elucidate how local and landscape factors influence natural enemy effectiveness in apple production systems, we calculated community energy use as a proxy for the communities' predation potential based on biomass and metabolic rates of predatory arthropods. Predator communities were assessed by standardised beating samples taken from apple trees in 86 orchards in Germany, Spain and Sweden. Orchard management included integrated production (IP; i.e. the reduced and targeted application of synthetic agrochemicals), and organic management practices in all three countries. Predator communities differed between management types and countries. Several groups, including beetles (Coleoptera), predatory bugs (Heteroptera), flies (Diptera) and spiders (Araneae) benefited from organic management depending on country. Woody habitat and IP supported harvestmen (Opiliones). In both IP and organic orchards we detected aversive influences of a high-quality surrounding landscape on some predator groups: for example, high covers of woody habitat reduced earwig abundances in German orchards but enhanced their abundance in Sweden, and high natural plant species richness tended to reduce predatory bug abundance in Sweden and IP orchards in Spain. We conclude that predatory arthropod communities and influences of local and landscape factors are strongly shaped by orchard management, and that the influence of management differs between countries. Our results indicate that organic management improves the living conditions for effective predator communities.","[Happe, Anne-Kathrin; Bluethgen, Nico; Mueller, Ann-Kathrin; Mody, Karsten] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Biol, Darmstadt, Germany; [Happe, Anne-Kathrin] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Alins, Georgina] Inst Recerca & Tecnol Agroalimentaries, Lleida, Spain; [Boreux, Virginie; Klein, Alexandra-Maria] Univ Freiburg, Chair Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Freiburg, Germany; [Bosch, Jordi; Rodrigo, Anselm; Roquer-Beni, Laura] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Garcia, Daniel] Univ Oviedo, Unidad Mixta Invest Biodiversidad, Oviedo, Spain; [Hamback, Peter A.; Samnegard, Ulrika] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Martinez-Sastre, Rodrigo; Minarro, Marcos] Serv Reg Invest & Desarrollo Agroalimentario, Asturias, Spain; [Porcel, Mario; Tasin, Marco] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Protect Biol, Alnarp, Sweden; [Samnegard, Ulrika] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden","Happe, AK; Mody, K (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Networks, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",ahappe@posteo.net; mody@bio.tu-darmstadt.cie,"Alins, Georgina GA/L-9011-2014; Samnegard, Ulrika/V-6180-2019; Garcia, Daniel/A-1236-2011; Bluthgen, Nico/F-5983-2010","Alins, Georgina GA/0000-0002-2353-051X; Samnegard, Ulrika/0000-0002-3791-4688; Garcia, Daniel/0000-0002-7334-7836; Happe, Anne-Kathrin/0000-0002-9620-2832; MARTINEZ SASTRE, RODRIGO/0000-0003-3550-7103; Rodrigo, Anselm/0000-0001-6341-0363; Porcel, Mario/0000-0002-8445-5621",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (PT-DLR/BMBF) [BiodivERsA-FACCE2014-74]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MinECo) [01LC1403]; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [PCIN-2014-145-C02]; FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [2014-1784]; Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y AlimentariaInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [2013-934]; FPI-INIA fellowship [RTA2013-00039-C03-00]; FI fellowship (Generalitat de Catalunya)Generalitat de Catalunya [CGL2015-68963-C2-2-R],"We thank all apple growers for their participation, the members of KOB Bavendorf, FOKO e.V., Appelriket in Kivik, ADV Ecologica de Ponent, and ACTEL for their advice, M.

We studied the population dynamics of 0+ fish in a eutrophic gravel pit lake in which predation of 0+ Eurasian perch on other 0+ fish was suspected to influence perch growth and the structure of the fish community, with effects on the lake food web. 2. The adult fish community was dominated by piscivorous species, especially perch, and the 0+ fish community was dominated by perch and bream. Bream grew to a total length of 80 mm between May and the end of August, gradually decreased in numbers during the summer, and completely disappeared in autumn. Stomach analysis revealed that 0+ perch greater than or equal to28 mm fed on 0+ bream. 3. The initially unimodal cohort of 0+ perch gradually broadened and became bimodal by the end of July. Fish of the larger, piscivorous cohort grew faster (1.4 mm day(-1)) than the smaller, zooplankton-consuming fish (0.6 mm day(-1)). Although individuals of both cohorts later consumed zooplankton and grew at similar rates (0.5 mm day(-1)), only perch of the large cohort (mean TL 125 mm) were found by mid-October. Intraspecific competition for food or cannibalism of older perch may have contributed to the disappearance of the smaller perch. 4. Early piscivory of the fast-growing 0+ perch apparently resulted in the disappearance of 0+ bream by the end of the growing season and precocious maturation of male perch. In contrast to findings in other studies, these large 0+ perch thus avoided the juvenile bottleneck by switching to piscivory early during their ontogenetic development. 5. The observations of this study suggest that early piscivory of 0+ perch can have a long-lasting impact on fish communities in eutrophic lakes, particularly if prey fish are abundant and the structural complexity of the lake is low. Furthermore, early piscivory of 0+ perch may help prevent the expected increase in 0+ cyprinids following reduction of adult cyprinids, which is considered important to ensure the long-term success of biomanipulation experiments.","Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Dept Gen Ecol & Limnol, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Beeck, P (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Dept Gen Ecol & Limnol, Ecol Field Stn Grietherbusch, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861",,,,52,42,43,0,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Processes, mechanisms, and thresholds associated with ecosystem overfishing were investigated by combining traditional concepts in fisheries biology with recent advances in food-web modeling. Diverse coral-reef food webs were simplified by grouping species into guilds based on the way they capture, store, and transfer energy, rather than taxonomically, as is traditionally done. Biomass fluxes between the guilds were then quantified using an allometric trophic model. The model was calibrated by linking parameters describing growth, predation, and competition with known body size and metabolic constraints, and then adjusting the base rate of parameters to match fish biomass estimates from a pristine coral reef system. The calibrated model was then tested by replacing equilibrium fish biomasses with observations from fished systems across the Pacific, spanning nine islands and numerous major-reef habitats. Encouraging relationships were found between predicted algal accumulation and field observations, and between modelled and observed guild restructuring. In terms of food-web ecology, pristine food webs were characterized by asynchronous population dynamics between the guilds (i.e., offsetting fluctuations), which maximized their persistence and the net accumulation of biomass within food webs. Beneficial, offsetting fluctuations were driven by the contrasting roles of density dependence, apparent competition, and predation. Fishing for predators synchronized the population fluctuations between the guilds, resulting in larger amplitudes (i.e., highs and lows), and a growing dominance of small herbivores. Continued fishing for large herbivores eventually led to an inflection point where algal biomass accumulated exponentially, revealing an ecosystem-based fisheries benchmark. Management targets that maximized fisheries yields while controlling for algal accumulation required simultaneous exploitation across the guilds; a significant challenge because maximum yields of predators, large herbivores, and small herbivores were magnitudes of order apart. This strategy also represented a departure from modern commercial fisheries policies that place catch quotas on entire fish families taxonomically, committing systems to smaller fish, higher biomass turnover, and undesirable algal accumulation. Moving forward, the model provided a flexible and adaptable framework to consider economic and ecosystem objectives of fisheries simultaneously, ultimately balancing resilient food webs against higher fisheries productivity.","[Houk, P.; Cuetos-Bueno, J.; Kerr, A.

The biotic interactions are thus considered to be a possible driver of differential geographical distributions often observed between closely related sexuals and asexuals: a pattern referred to as geographical parthenogenesis (GP). We tested the RQH in Hieracium alpinum L., a vascular plant species exhibiting a striking pattern of GP, by assessing the frequency and intensity with which seed predator specialists occur and the level of interspecific plant-plant competition expressed through both the surrounding vegetation density and the species richness across its distributional range. Furthermore, we tested whether there were negative associations between intra-population genetic diversity, as assessed by amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, and incidences of seed predation. Our results indicate no significant differences in frequency and intensity of seed predation nor in the level of interspecific plant-plant interactions between diploid sexual and triploid asexual populations. Furthermore, there were no consistent latitudinal and/or altitudinal patterns for the assessed parameters. Contrary to our expectations, there were either positive or non-significant associations between genetic diversity and the level of seed predation. To conclude, the RQH cannot thoroughly explain the GP in H. alpinum, and other alternative scenarios should be considered and tested.","[Hartmann, Matthias; Stefanek, Michal; Zdvorak, Pavel; Chrtek, Jindrich; Mraz, Patrik] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12800 Prague, Czech Republic; [Herman, Petr] Krivoklat 190, CZ-27023 Krivoklat, Czech Republic; [Chrtek, Jindrich] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic","Hartmann, M (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12800 Prague, Czech Republic.",m.hartmann301187@gmail.com,"Hartmann, Matthias/AAL-8753-2021; Mraz, Patrik/I-5965-2016; Hartmann, Matthias/A-8142-2018; Mraz, Patrik/ABD-9484-2020","Hartmann, Matthias/0000-0001-9721-0925; Mraz, Patrik/0000-0002-1415-070X; Hartmann, Matthias/0000-0001-9721-0925; Mraz, Patrik/0000-0002-1415-070X",Czech Science Foundation (GACR)Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-02858S],"We thank V.

Humans who use scientific ecological methods can use species such as mollusks that lay down annual growth rings to detect past environmental variation and use statistical models to make predictions about future change. We used traditional ecological knowledge shared by local Inupiaq, combined with growth histories of two species of mollusks, at different trophic levels, to study local change in the coastal ecosystems of Kotzebue, Alaska, an area in the Arctic without continuous scientific monitoring. For the mollusks, a combination of the Arctic Oscillation and total Arctic ice coverage, and summer air temperature and summer precipitation explained 79-80% of the interannual variability in growth of the suspension feeding Greenland cockle (Serripes groenlandicus) and the predatory whelk (Neptunea hero), respectively, indicating these mollusks seem to be impacted by local and regional environmental parameters, and should be good biomonitors for change in coastal Alaska. The change experts within the Kotzebue community were the elders and the fishers, and they observed changes in species abundance and behaviors, including benthic species, and infer that a fundamental change in the climate has taken place within the area. We conclude combining traditional and scientific ecological knowledge provides greater insight than either approach alone, and offers a powerful way to document change in an area that otherwise lacks widespread quantitative monitoring.","[Ambrose, William G., Jr.] Bates Coll, Dept Biol, 44 Campus Ave, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA; [Ambrose, William G., Jr.; Greenacre, Michael; Carroll, Michael L.] Akvaplan Niva, FRAM High North Res Ctr Climate & Environm, Tromso, Norway; [Clough, Lisa M.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Polar Programs, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Johnson, Jeffrey C.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Sociol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Johnson, Jeffrey C.; Griffith, David C.] East Carolina Univ, Inst Coastal Sci & Policy, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Johnson, Jeffrey C.] Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Greenacre, Michael] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Greenacre, Michael] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Griffith, David C.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Anthropol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Whiting, Alex] Native Village Kotzebue, Kotzebue, AK USA","Ambrose, WG (corresponding author), Bates Coll, Dept Biol, 44 Campus Ave, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA.",wambrose@bates.edu,,,US National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of Polar ProgramsNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OPP-0222423]; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission; BBVA FoundationBBVA Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Education and Competitiveness [MTM2012-37195]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute through Bates College,"This work was funded by a grant from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of Polar Programs (OPP-0222423) to William G.

Using camera-trap grids established in two important deciduous forests, Ankarafantsika National Park and Andranomena Special Reserve, we explore the activity patterns of endemic and exotic carnivores and evaluate how exotics may be influencing fosa temporal activity across these two protected areas. Three methodologies, kernel density, circular and wave analysis, were used to evaluate the activity pattern overlap between exotic free-ranging cats Felis sp. and dogs Canis familiaris, exotic small Indian civets Viverricula indica and the endemic fosa. Our results showed fosas to be cathemeral, peaking in activity in the evening and at dawn. Cats were nocturnal, whilst also highly active at dusk. Civets did not display a dominant period of activity, but were relatively more active in the night, and at dusk. In contrast, dogs were diurnal and also active at dawn, in alignment with human activity. Fosa activity significantly overlapped with the nocturnal cat and civet, whilst being distinct from the diurnal dog and humans. Our results suggest that there is potentially a competitive impact of exotic free-ranging dogs and cats when present across fosas' dry forest habitat. This highlights the need for further examination into the impact of Madagascar's exotic carnivores, and the experimental trial to investigate the impact of their removal (or reduced abundance), on Madagascar's wildlife.","[Merson, S.

Rodent removal led to increased dominance of the winter annual flora by initially rare, but competitively superior, large-seeded annuals. The greater densities of these plants eventually suppressed populations of small-seeded annuals. In contrast, ant removal produced higher densities of small-seeded species, whose increases had no measurable effect on populations of large-seeded winter annuals. Competition between large-seeded and small-seeded winter annuals is highly asymmetric and consistently favors species with greater seed reserves. As selective predators of large-seeds, rodents behave as keystone consumers, differentially suppressing the dominant competitors and helping to maintain the diversity of winter annuals. The population dynamics of winter and summer annuals were linked through interactions with biseasonal annuals early in the study but not in later years when densities of the biseasonal annuals declined sharply in response to summer droughts. Nevertheless, the periodic abundance of biseasonal annuals (and some herbaceous perennials) during germination of summer annuals might help to explain the insignificance of large-seeded annuals in the summer flora. Large-seeded summer annuals were rare and showed little response to rodent removal, and both rodents and ants used the seeds of small-seeded summer plants. Although rodent predation on winter annuals may facilitate harvester ants indirectly by increasing the availability of small seeds, ants and rodents appear to compete exploitatively through populations of summer annuals. The conflicting influence of rodents on ant populations through the two seasonal classes of annuals may help to explain why ant populations have shown little response to rodent removal during the ten-year experiment. Results here contrast with earlier experiments in the Sonoran Desert, where ants and rodents interacted principally through populations of winter annuals, and increasing dominance of large-seeded annuals on rodent-removal plots eventually led ant populations to decline. However, the climatic and biotic differences between the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts fail to mask the importance of rodents as keystone consumers of winter annuals. This strong indirect pathway is the most prominent feature of consumer-resource interactions in these deserts.","UNIV UTAH,DEPT BIOL,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112","SAMSON, DA (corresponding author), EMORY UNIV,DEPT BIOL,ATLANTA,GA 30322, USA.",,,,,,,58,89,95,0,27,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1992,65,1,,,,,61,80,,10.2307/3544888,,,20,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JH676,WOS:A1992JH67600008,,,,,2021-09-27,

Zoological Studies 51(6): 733-744. Invasive filter-feeding mussels and clams are well-known for profoundly impacting the invaded systems. Many studies in South America documented interactions of the Asian mussel Limnoperna fortunei with several components of the local biota. However, few experiments have examined in detail the effect of the mussels on zooplankton abundances and the species composition. We conducted a 72-h experiment to assess the impacts of L. fortunei on the composition and abundance of Parana River floodplain zooplankton using experimental mesocosms. Three treatments with 3 replicates each were used in the experiment: control (without mussels) and 2 treatments with mussels at different concentrations. Densities of the most abundant genera of rotifers (Keratella) and cladocerans (Bosmina and Diaphanosoma) significantly declined in mollusc-containing mesocosms compared to the control. Phytoplankton density was significantly lower in the presence of the mollusc. Mesocosms with higher mollusc concentrations had lower zooplankton densities than those with fewer predators. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that L. fortunei has negative impacts on this community, affecting the abundance and composition of species, and the size structure. The ability of the mussel to control the zooplankton can be explained by its direct consumption or by competition for trophic resources. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/51.6/733.pdf","[Rojas Molina, Florencia; Jose de Paggi, Susana; Frau, Diego] Univ Nacl Litoral, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, INALI, Inst Nacl Limnol, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Jose de Paggi, Susana] Univ Nacl Litoral, Fac Bioquim & Ciencias Biol, Escuela Sanidad, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina","Molina, FR (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Litoral, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, INALI, Inst Nacl Limnol, Ciudad Univ,Paraje El Pozo S-N, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina.",frojasmolina@inali.unl.edu.ar,"Frau, Diego/V-2613-2019","Frau, Diego/0000-0002-7000-8863","CAI+D (Univ.

The purpose of this experiment was twofold, 1) to determine if the separate effects of each predator group on prey abundance increased as prey productivity increased and 2) to determine if the relative impacts of the two predator groups diverged as prey productivity increased. In this experiment, the separate impact of each predator group increased with increasing prey productivity. However, the relative impact of each predator group did not diverge with increasing prey productivity. Unlike previous studies that suggested with increasing prey productivity the relative effect of two predator groups should diverge, this experiment suggested that communities can have more redundant predator groups than originally thought. The results of an analysis using a proportional hazards model suggested that despite increasing prey productivity, birds and the sea star were equal in their ability to curb population increases by M californianus. These results highlight the need to carefully consider what type of species to species comparisons to make when attempting to discern the relative roles of different predator groups in a community.

What is less investigated is that predators have a variety of indirect effects on prey that could potentially have large evolutionary responses. We conducted a pond experiment to test whether differences in predation risk in different habitats caused shifts in behavior of prey that, in turn, would affect their morphology. We also tested whether the experimental data could explain the morphological variation of perch in the natural environment. In the experiment, predators caused the prey fish to shift to the habitat with the lower predation risk. The prey specialized on habitat- specific resources, and there was a strong correlation between diet of the prey fish and morphological variation, suggesting that resource specialization ultimately affected the morphology. The lack of differences in competition and mortality suggest that the morphological variation among prey was induced by differences in predation risk among habitats. The field study demonstrated that there are differences in growth related to morphology of perch in two different habitats. Thus, a trade- off between foraging and predator avoidance could be responsible for adaptive morphological variation of young perch.","Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Limnol Sect, Dept Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Eklov, P (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Limnol Sect, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Norbyvagen 20, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",peter.eklov@ebc.uu.se; richard.svanback@ebc.uu.se,"TATSUTA, HARUKI/F-2997-2010",,,,,56,107,109,2,60,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Sensitive species may be impaired by sublethal effects or decimated by lethality, and this ecological alteration may initiate a trophic cascade or a release from competition that secondarily leads to responses in tolerant species. Contaminants may exert direct effects on keystone facilitator and foundation species, and contaminant-induced changes in nutrient and oxygen dynamics may alter ecosystem function. Thus, populations and communities in nature may be directly and/or indirectly affected by exposure to pollutants. While the direct effects of toxicants usually reduce organism abundance, indirect effects may lead to increased or decreased abundance. Here we review 150 papers that reference indirect toxicant effects in aquatic environments. Studies of accidental contaminant release, chronic contamination and experimental manipulations have identified indirect contaminant effects in pelagic and benthic communities caused by many types of pollutants. Contaminant-induced changes in behavior, competition and predation/grazing rate can alter species abundances or community composition, and enhance, mask or spuriously indicate direct contaminant effects. Trophic cascades were found in 60% of the manipulative studies and, most commonly, primary producers increased in abundance when grazers were selectively eliminated by contaminants. Competitive release may also be common, but is difficult to distinguish from trophic cascades because few experiments are designed to isolate the mechanism(s) causing indirect effects. Indirect contaminant effects may have profound implications in environments with strong trophic cascades such as the freshwater pelagic. In spite of their undesirable environmental influence, contaminants can be useful manipulative tools for the study of trophic and competitive interactions in natural communities.

We manipulated perch type and density by the addition of artificial perches to patches of coastal prairie grasslands, varying perch height in the first year and canopy density in the second year. American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) used areas with artificial perches more often than they used natural woody vegetation and areas without woody perches. Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus) patch use did not vary with treatment type. Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) used areas of natural woody vegetation more than patches with artificial perches and patches with no perches. Patch use by Loggerhead Shrikes was also influenced by the presence of complex woody vegetation and interspecific interactions, whereas American Kestrel use was limited by landscape matrix and ground cover density.

By limiting populations of prey and/or competitors, apex predators can increase the diversity of systems, often exerting influences that cascade through several trophic levels. In Australia, emerging evidence points increasingly towards the dingo (Canis lupus dingo) as a strongly interactive species that has profound effects on ecosystem function. Through predatory and competitive effects, dingoes can alter the abundance and function of mesopredators including the introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cat (Felis catus), and herbivores including the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). These effects often benefit populations of native prey, and diversity and biomass of vegetation, but may not occur under all circumstances. For example, the social structure of dingoes is of great importance; a pack subject to minimal human interference regulates its own numbers, and such packs appear to have fewer undesirable impacts such as predation on livestock. Despite abundant observational evidence that the dingo is a strong interactor, there have been few attempts to test its ecological role experimentally. Given the well-recognized importance of species interactions to ecosystem function, it is imperative that such experiments be carried out. To do this, we propose three broad questions: (i) do dingoes limit the abundance of other predators or prey? (ii) do dingoes affect the ecological relationships of other predators or prey (e.g. by altering their spatial or temporal activity patterns)? and (iii) does the removal or reintroduction of dingoes entrain ecological cascades? Finally, we discuss the design of appropriate experiments, using principles that may also be applied to investigate species interactions on other continents. Research might seek to clarify not only the impacts of dingoes at all trophic levels, but also the mechanisms by which these impacts occur.","Dwellingup Res Ctr, CRC, Dept Environm & Conservat & Invas Anim, Dwellingup, WA 6213, Australia; Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Wildlife Res, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, Coll Sci, Sch Resources Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Glen, AS (corresponding author), Dwellingup Res Ctr, CRC, Dept Environm & Conservat & Invas Anim, Banksiadale Rd, Dwellingup, WA 6213, Australia.",al.glen@dec.wa.gov.au,"Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020; Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064; Glen, Al/0000-0002-7777-7630",,,,102,104,122,4,199,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,AUG,2007,32,5,,,,,492,501,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01721.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,181LM,WOS:000247438200003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Brown hares seem to prefer more open habitat such as arable crops and this resulted in them being less selective than European rabbits. The differences found in habitat use have probably enabled the two species to coexist for many decades and can be used to manage these lagomorphs.","[Santilli, F.] Game & Wildlife Management Consulting, I-57021 Campiglia Marittima, Livorno, Italy; [Bagliacca, M.; Paci, G.] Univ Pisa, Dept Vet Sci, I-56124 Pisa, Italy","Santilli, F (corresponding author), Studio Gest Faunist, Via F Dini 3, I-57021 Campiglia Marittima, Livorno, Italy.",perdix@teletu.it,,"PACI, GISELLA/0000-0003-2711-7017",,,,38,3,3,0,43,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

The number of studies increased strongly during the last decade. in most of the studies (79%) shoot biomass of plants significanty increased in the presence of earthworms. However, knowledge on effects of earthworms on plant growth is very biased; most studies investigated crop plants, particularly cereals, and pastures; very little is known on plant species in more natural communities. Recently, interest in tropical plant species has increased considerably, however, the studies have considered almost exclusively agricultural plant species. Generally, experiments focused on the response of plant shoots but 45% of the studies also considered roots. Most of the studies investigated European earthworms (Lumbricidae); very little is known on other earthworm species. Some early studies indicated that earthworms affect the composition of plant communities but only very recently has it been documented that earthworms affect plant competition. However, there is virtually no information on how earthworms affect plant performance in detail including fitness parameters such as flowering and seed production. It has been realized recently that earthworms not only modify plant growth and vegetation structure but also the susceptability of plants to herbivores. Herbivore performance might be stimulated but also reduced due to the presence of earthworms. Furthermore, earthworms function as subsidiary food resources to generalist predators when herbivore prey is scarce. The complex indirect interactions between earthworms and the aboveground system deserve further investigation in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The imperative for future research is adopting an ecological rather than an agricultural perspective in studying earthworm-plant interrelationships and viewing earthworms as driving factors of the aboveground food web. It is suggested that studies on earthworm-plant interactions may contribute significantly to a more comprehensive understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and to the development of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices.","Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany","Scheu, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",scheu@bio.tu-darmstadt.de,"Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015",,,,,86,262,291,4,175,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0031-4056,1873-331X,,PEDOBIOLOGIA,Pedobiologia,,2003,47,5-6,,,,,846,856,,10.1016/s0031-4056(04)70279-6,,,11,Ecology; Soil Science,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture,767CB,WOS:000188421700068,,,,,2021-09-27,

Three initial densities of 50, 150 and 400 Aphis fabae third instar nymphs and a control without aphids were provided to six combinations of predator life stages (2nd and 3rd larval instars of lacewing and 3rd and 4th instars and adult females of ladybird). The remaining aphid density and occurrence of IGP were checked after 24, 48 and 72 h. The IGP intensity (IGP level, IL) was similar in the simple arena (reaching 0.6 between larvae in absence of EGP and 0.3 between lacewing larvae and ladybird females) and microcosm environment (0.3 without EGP). In both environments, increasing EGP density lowered IL according to negative exponential relationship.

Simply managing for multiple positive influences will often aid in recovery; however, the relative impacts of multiple threats and/or interactions among them are not always predictable. We used a series of experiments and quantitative observational studies to examine the importance of five potential limiting factors to the abundance of a state-listed endangered hemiparasitic annual forb, Cordylanthus rigidus ssp. littoralis (C.r.l., California, USA): host availability, mammalian herbivores, insect seed predators, fire suppression, and exotic species. While this initial assessment is certainly not a complete list, these factors stem from direct observation and can inform provisional recommendations for management and further research. Methodology and Principal Findings: Studies were conducted at five sites and included assessments of the influence of host availability, exotic species, exclusion of mammalian herbivores and insect seed predators on C.r.l. productivity, and simulated effects of fire on seed germination. C.r.l. was limited by multiple threats: individuals with access to host species produced up to three times more inflorescences than those lacking hosts, mammalian herbivory reduced C.r.l. size and fecundity by more than 50% and moth larvae reduced seed production by up to 40%. Litter deposition and competition from exotic plant species also appears to work in conjunction with other factors to limit C.r.l. throughout its life cycle. Conclusions and Significance: The work reported here highlights the contribution that a series of small-scale studies can make to conservation and restoration.

Consequently, the structure of carnivore guilds can be critical to ecosystem patterns. Body size is a crucial influence on intraguild interactions, because it affects access to prey resources, effectiveness in scramble competition, and vulnerability to intraguild predation. Coyotes (Canis latrans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) occur sympatrically throughout much of North America and overlap in resource use, indicating potential for interspecific interactions. Although much is known about the autecology of the individual species separately, little is known about factors that facilitate coexistence and how interactions within this guild influence distribution, habitat use, and temporal activity of the smaller carnivores. To assess how habitat autecology and interspecific interactions affect the structure of this widespread carnivore guild, we conducted a large-scale, non-invasive carnivore survey using an occupancy modeling framework. We deployed remote cameras during 3-week surveys to detect carnivores at 1,118 camera locations in 357 2.6-km(2) sections (3-4 cameras/section composing a cluster) in the 16 southernmost counties of Illinois (16,058 km(2)) during January-April, 2008-2010. We characterized microhabitat at each camera location and landscape-level habitat features for each camera cluster. In a multistage approach, we used information-theoretic methods to evaluate competing models for detection, species-specific habitat occupancy, multispecies co-occupancy, and multiseason (colonization and extinction) occupancy dynamics. We developed occupancy models for each species to represent hypothesized effects of anthropogenic features, prey availability, landscape complexity, and vegetative land cover. We quantified temporal activity patterns of each carnivore species based on their frequency of appearance in photographs. Further, we assessed whether smaller carnivores shifted their diel activity patterns in response to the presence of potential competitors. Of the 102,711 photographs of endothermic animals, we recorded photographs of bobcats (n=412 photographs), coyotes (n=1,397), gray foxes (n=546), raccoons (n=40,029), red foxes (n=149), and striped skunks (n=2,467). Bobcats were active primarily during crepuscular periods, and their activity was reduced with precipitation and higher temperatures. The probability of detecting bobcats decreased after a bobcat photograph was recorded, suggesting avoidance of remote cameras after the first encounter. Across southern Illinois, bobcat occupancy at the camera-location and camera-cluster scale (local=0.240.04, camera cluster cluster=0.750.06) was negatively influenced by anthropogenic features and infrastructure. Bobcats had high rates of colonization (</mml:mover>=0.86) and low rates of extinction (E</mml:mover>=0.07), suggesting an expanding population, but agricultural land was less likely to be colonized. Nearly all camera clusters were occupied by coyotes (</mml:mover>cluster=0.95 +/- 0.03). At the local scale, coyote occupancy (</mml:mover>local=0.58 +/- 0.03) was higher in hardwood forest stands with open understories than in other areas. Compared to coyotes, gray foxes occupied a smaller portion of the study area (</mml:mover>local=0.13 +/- 0.01, </mml:mover>cluster=0. 29 +/- 0.03) at all scales. At the scale of the camera cluster, gray fox occupancy was highest in fragmented areas with high proportions of forest, and positively related to anthropogenic features within 100% home-range buffers. Red foxes occupied a similar proportion of the study area as gray foxes (</mml:mover>local=0.12 +/- 0.02, </mml:mover>cluster=0.26 +/- 0.04) but were more closely associated with anthropogenic features. Only anthropogenic feature models made up the 90% confidence set at all scales of analysis for red foxes. Extinction probabilities at the scale of the camera cluster were higher for both gray foxes (E</mml:mover>=0.57) and red foxes (E</mml:mover>=0.35) than their colonization rates (gray fox </mml:mover>=0.16, red fox </mml:mover>=0.06), suggesting both species may be declining in southern Illinois. Striped skunks occupied a large portion of the study area (</mml:mover>local=0.47 +/- 0.01, </mml:mover>cluster=0.79 +/- 0.03) and were associated primarily with anthropogenic features. Raccoons were essentially ubiquitous within the study area, being photographed in 99% of camera clusters. We observed little evidence for spatial partitioning based on interspecific interactions, with the exception of the gray fox-coyote pairs, and found that habitat preferences were more important in structuring the carnivore community. Habitat had a stronger influence on the occupancy of foxes than did the presence of bobcats. However, the level of red fox activity was negatively correlated with bobcat activity. Gray fox occupancy and the number of detections within occupied sites were reduced in camera clusters occupied by coyotes but not bobcat occupancy. Overall, gray fox occupancy was highest at camera locations with fewer hardwood and more conifer trees. However, gray foxes were more likely to occupy camera locations in hardwood stands than conifer stands if coyotes were also present indicating that hardwood stands may enhance gray fox-coyote coexistence. The 2 fox species appeared to co-occur with each other at the local scale more frequently than expected based on their individual selection of habitat. Similarly, occupancy of camera location by red foxes was higher when coyotes were present. These positive spatial associations among canids may be a response to locally high prey abundance or unmeasured habitat variables. Activity levels of raccoons, bobcats, and coyotes were all positively correlated. Overall, our co- occurrence and activity models indicate competitor-driven adjustments in space use among members of a carnivore community might be the exception rather than the norm. Nevertheless, although our results indicate that gray foxes and red foxes currently coexist with bobcats and coyotes, their distribution appears to be contracting on our study area. Coexistence of foxes with larger carnivores may be enhanced by temporal partitioning of activity and by habitat features that reduce vulnerability of intraguild predation. For instance, hardwood stands may contain trees with structure that enhances tree-climbing by gray foxes, a behavior that probably facilitates coexistence with coyotes. Efforts to enhance gray fox populations would likely benefit from increasing the amount of mature oak-hickory forest. Additionally, the varying results from different scales of analyses underscore the importance of considering multiple spatial scales in carnivore community studies.

Similar reciprocal indirect effects may emerge even when the signal is not mimicked; termed associational effects, such interactions are well known in plants sharing herbivores but have received little attention in animal studies. We investigated associational interactions in a system where unequally defended prey (chemically defended Bufo bufo and undefended Rana temporaria tadpoles), sharing general morphology but not an aposematic signal, were exposed to predation by the carp Cyprinus carpio along a gradient of relative prey abundance. In the absence of fish, the assemblage composition had no effect on the survival of Rana, while that of Bufo decreased with increasing abundance of Rana. Fish reduced the survival of tadpoles from both species. However, increased relative abundance of Bufo in the community led to enhanced survival in both Bufo and Rana. Increasing relative proportions of heterospecifics reduced metamorph mass only in Bufo, indicating greater sensitivity to interspecific competition compared to Rana; the effect was reduced in the presence of fish. Our results show that undefended non-mimetic prey enjoy reduced predation with increasing relative abundance of chemically defended prey, which in turn suffer greater mortality with an increasing proportion of the undefended species. Associational resistance/susceptibility, driven by current assemblage composition, not by selection for resemblance, can shape the dynamics of mixed communities of defended and undefended prey in the absence of mimicry.","[Kaczmarek, Jan M.; Kaczmarski, Mikolaj; Kloskowski, Janusz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Zool, Ul Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Mazurkiewicz, Jan] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Inland Fisheries & Aquaculture, Ul Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland","Kaczmarek, JM (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Zool, Ul Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.",kaczmarq@up.poznan.pl,"KACZMARSKI, MIKOLAJ/AAA-3643-2021","KACZMARSKI, MIKOLAJ/0000-0002-3341-0933; Kaczmarek, Jan/0000-0002-4152-6928; Mazurkiewicz, Jan/0000-0002-3344-1094; Kloskowski, Janusz/0000-0002-0525-2421",Poznan University of Life Sciences Grant Program for Young Scientists [507.511.60/2016],"The project was funded by Poznan University of Life Sciences Grant Program for Young Scientists (project no. 507.511.60/2016) awarded to JMK.

Scat analyses revealed that these predators consumed 11 different prey species including livestock and rodents, of which leopards consumed 11. The combined relative occurrence of the three species, sambar Cervus unicolor, muntjac Munticus muntjac and wild pig Sus scrofa, constituted 42.7, 33.7 and 71.1% of the tiger, leopard and dhole diets, respectively, while livestock comprised 44.5, 73.4 and 15.9% of the prey consumed, respectively. Regression equations from earlier feeding trials were used to estimate the relative biomass and the numbers of prey consumed. Results showed that sambar featured more frequently than did muntjac and wild pig in the diets of tiger, leopard and dhole and contributed more relative biomass than did muntjac and wild pig. Sambar, muntjac and wild pig together provided 36.9, 28 and 63.1% of the biomass consumed by tigers, leopards and dholes respectively. All else being equal, there was evidence that all three predators ate livestock less than might have been expected on the basis of the abundance and high biomass of this prey category in the area. There was a high dietary niche overlap between the predators (Pianka's overlap index of 0.58-0.92), with a greater overlap between the two felid species than between the felids and the canid. This study provides evidence of a substantial diet overlap among the three sympatric carnivores, and thus highlights the potential for high intra-guild competition among them, especially given the relatively low density of prey.","[Wang, S.

Between 2009 and 2011, densities of gobies in the Rhine increased while their condition decreased, assuming that the populations are approaching or even reached the capacity of the ecosystem. Consequently, we hypothesized a high level of competition on food resources within this group of invasive gobies that all exhibit the same sedentary life style, which might strengthen the differentiation of the ecological niche on a spatial and temporal axis. Invasive gobies were caught with electro fishing and beach seining in different types of habitats over a period of two years in the Lower Rhine, analyzing the food of more than 1500 gobies of the three species Neogobius fluviatilis (NF), Neogobius melanostomus (NM) and Ponticola kessleri (PK). All species showed an opportunistic feeding strategy. In NF and PK, a clear shift in preferred food resources was observed between individuals smaller and larger 50 mm that occurred in parallel with a habitat shift from sandy areas to riprap structures in PK, but not in NF that were only found on gravel and sand. In contrast, there were no distinct changes in food and habitat preference in NM. Small NM were found from spring to autumn on the sandy nearshore areas where they competed on food resources with juvenile PK in spring, and with NF in late summer, respectively. Abundance of juvenile NF and NM increased during the night in sandy nearshore areas in October: This behavior is assumed as predator avoidance against large piscivorous NF as well as native pikeperch, because active feeding occurred mainly during the day. The results on the three invasive Gobiids in the Lower Rhine give important hints how fine-tuned spatial and temporal characteristics in intra- and inter-specific competition shape the ecological niche of these invaders in their new environment.

Assessment of these sequential stages and corresponding subprocesses may be useful in identifying the most critical stages. Accordingly, to assess the factors that may determine the altitudinal range limits of the high mountain Mediterranean plant Silene ciliata, a set of demographic stages, from flower production to establishment of 2-yr-old plants, and their influence on recruitment probability were examined using a step-by-step approach. We integrated florivory, pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation as pre-dispersal factors, and seedling emergence and survival as post-dispersal determinants of recruitment. Three populations were monitored at the southernmost margin of the species along its local altitudinal range. Previous studies suggest that seediness is strongly limited by summer drought especially at the lower boundary of the species, a situation that may worsen under current global warming. Our results showed that recruitment was mainly limited by low seed production in the pre-dispersal stage and low seedling emergence and survival in the post-dispersal stage, probably due to environmental harshness in summer. By contrast, biotic factors responsible for propagule loss, such as flower and fruit predation, had a minor effect on the probability of plant recruitment. Although the relative importance of transition probabilities was similar among populations along the altitudinal range, comparatively lower flower production significantly reduced the number of recruited plants at the lowest altitude population. This demographic bottleneck, together with increased competition with other species favoured by climate warming, might collapse population growth and limit persistence at the lower altitudinal range of the species, raising its low local altitudinal edge.","[Gimenez-Benavides, Luis; Escudero, Adrian; Iriondo, Jose M.] Univ Rey Juan Carlos ESCET, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, ES-28933 Madrid, Spain","Gimenez-Benavides, L (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos ESCET, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, Tulipan S-N, ES-28933 Madrid, Spain.",luis.gimenez@urjc.es,"Escudero, Adrian/H-5046-2015; Gimenez-Benavides, Luis/A-3751-2009; Iriondo, Jose M/B-3112-2008","Escudero, Adrian/0000-0002-1427-5465; Gimenez-Benavides, Luis/0000-0001-6319-1180; Iriondo, Jose M/0000-0003-2710-3889",Spanish Government CICYTConsejo Interinstitucional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CICYT) [CGL2006-09431],"We are grateful to the staff of Parque Natural de las Cumbres, Circo y Lagunas de Penalara for permission to carry out this study, and to R.

One pervasive form of intraspecific trait variation is sexual dimorphism in animals and plants, which might exert large effects particularly on the communities of host-associated organisms, but the extent of these effects is not well understood. We investigated whether host-associated microbial communities developed differently in the floral nectar of female and male individuals of the dioecious shrubs, Eurya emarginata and E. japonica. We found that nectar-colonizing microbes such as bacteria and fungi were more than twice as prevalent and, overall, more than 10 times as abundant in male flowers as in female flowers. Microbial species composition also differed between flower sexes. To examine potential mechanisms behind these differences, we manipulated the frequency of flower visitation by animals and the order of arrival of microbial species to nectar. Animal visitation frequency affected microbial communities more greatly in male flowers, while arrival order affected them more in female flowers. These sex-specific effects appeared attributable to differences in how animals and microbes altered the chemical characteristics of nectar that limited microbial growth. Taken together, our results provide evidence that sexual dimorphism can have large effects on the structure of host-associated communities.","[Tsuji, Kaoru] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 2 Hirano, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Tsuji, Kaoru; Fukami, Tadashi] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Tsuji, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 2 Hirano, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.; Tsuji, K (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tsuji@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Fukami, Tadashi/A-2934-2010; Tsuji, Kaoru/AAT-2773-2021","Fukami, Tadashi/0000-0001-5654-4785; Tsuji, Kaoru/0000-0001-5020-5184","JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25451, 40645280]; Kyoto University Foundation; Stanford University's Office of International Affairs","We thank Griselda Morales, Shin-ichi Nakano, Rika Ozawa, Jiro Sugisaka, Rie Shimizu-Inatsugi, and Junji Takabayashi for laboratory support, Noboru Katayama for advice on HPLC, Shohei Fujinaga for laboratory support and comments, and Callie Chappell, Manpreet Dhami, Po-Ju Ke, Andrew Letten, Avery Russell, Robert Schaeffer, Na Wei, two anonymous reviewers, and members of the community ecology group at Stanford University for comments.

The palm Attalea humilis goes against this trend by reaching high abundances in small remnants. Productivity, seed dispersal and seed predation of A. humilis were investigated in two large (2400 and 3500 ha) and three small (19, 26 and 57 ha) Atlantic Forest fragments in southeastern Brazil. Palms in the small fragments produced more female inflorescences, resulting in a higher fruit production in these places. Seed dispersal rates were higher in the large fragments, where scatter hoarding was more frequent. Scolytine beetles were the main seed predators and damaged a larger number of seeds in small fragments, but predation by rodents and bruchine beetles was low irrespective of fragment size. As scolytines do not necessarily kill the seeds, low predation by bruchines and rodents, together with its own high productivity, allow A. humilis to be more abundant in small fragments despite the scarcity of its main dispersers. This increased abundance, by its turn, can increase competitive interactions between A. humilis and other plants in small fragments. Thus, abundance patterns of A. humilis are a good example of fragmentation affecting the balance of ecological interactions in a complex way, emphasizing the role of preserving ecological processes for conserving biodiversity in fragmented tropical landscapes.","[Andreazzi, Cecilia S.; Pimenta, Clarissa S.; Pires, Alexandra S.; Fernandez, Fernando A.

Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is to manipulate predator movement using semiochemicals. However, selective manipulation is impeded by attraction of both predators and pests to bark beetle pheromones. 2 The primary bark beetle affecting pine plantations in Wisconsin, U.S.A., is the pine engraver, Ips pini (Say). Other herbivores include Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff) and Dryophthorus americanus Bedel (Curculionidae). The predominant predators are the beetles Thanasimus dubius (Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Histeridae). 3 We conducted field assays using two enantiomeric ratios of ipsdienol, and frontalin plus alpha-pinene. Ipsdienol is the principal pheromone component of L pini, and frontalin is produced by a number of Dendroctonus species. alpha-Pinene is a host monoterpene commonly incorporated into commercial frontalin lures. 4 Thanasimus dubius was attracted to frontalin plus alpha-pinene, and also to racemic ipsdienol. By contrast, I. pini was attracted to racemic ipsdienol, but showed no attraction to frontalin plus alpha-pinene. Platysoma cylindrica was attracted to 97%-(-)-ipsdienol and, to a lesser extent, racemic ipsdienol, but not to frontalin plus alpha-pinene. Ips grandicollis was attracted to frontalin plus alpha-pinene but not to ipsdienol. Dryophthorus americanus was attracted to both ipsdienol and frontalin plus alpha-pinene. 5 This ability to selectively attract the predator T. dubius without attracting the principal bark beetle in the system, L pini, provides new opportunities for research into augmentative biological control and basic population dynamics. Moreover, the attraction of T. dubius, but not P. cylindrica, to frontalin plus alpha-pinene creates opportunities for selective manipulation of just one predator. 6 Patterns of attraction by predators and bark beetles to these compounds appear to reflect various degrees of geographical and host tree overlap with several pheromone-producing species.","Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Biometry Program, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Aukema, BH (corresponding author), Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, 506 W Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.",baukema@pfc.forestry.ca,,,,,,88,18,20,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-9555,1461-9563,,AGR FOREST ENTOMOL,Agric.

While both competition and predation can control the size of animal populations, changes in the relative importance of these two density-dependent processes remain poorly documented during ecological succession. Here, we combined habitat selection and optimal foraging theory to identify the processes that can explain the increase in red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) during post-logging forest succession in boreal ecosystems. Specifically, we assessed the extent to which changes in intra- and interspecific competition and in predation risk can explain variation in abundance and distribution of voles during post-harvest forest succession. We estimated the abundances of the red-backed vole and of its main competitor, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), in adjacent pairs of logged (5-66years old) forest stands and uncut stands (>120years old). We found that voles increased their preference for uncut stands with increasing conspecific density. Foraging experiments revealed that in early-seral forest stands, voles increased their feeding effort in the presence of deer mice, particularly in safer food patches. This behaviour is expected from foraging theory when interspecific competitors increase predation risk. Apparent competition would thus limit the density of red-backed voles, and changes in the relative strength of this process during forest succession would control patterns of distribution and abundance of the species.","[Le Borgne, Helene; Dupuch, Angelique; Fortin, Daniel] Univ Laval, Univ Laval Sylviculture & Faune, Dept Biol, Chaire Rech Ind CRSNG, Pavillon Alexandre Vachon,1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Le Borgne, Helene; Dupuch, Angelique] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada","Le Borgne, H (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Univ Laval Sylviculture & Faune, Dept Biol, Chaire Rech Ind CRSNG, Pavillon Alexandre Vachon,1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.; Le Borgne, H (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",helene.le.borgne.1@gmail.com,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)-Laval University Industrial Research Chair in Silviculture and WildlifeNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank Orphe Bichet, Andreanne Beardsell, Maxime Cotnoir, Pascal Royer-Boutin, Marie-Helene Chabot, Gabriel Emond, Adam Moreira and Jean-Pierre Michaud for their help at different stages of the study, and W.F.J.

However, the management of the aphids can still be improved. Recently, the predatory mirids Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae) and Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) (Hemiptera: Miridae) have been found to be effective in the control of aphids, thrips and whiteflies when tested alone. Hence, integrating one of these two mirids with A. swirskii might enhance sweet pepper pest management. In this work, we began by investigating the co-occurrence of both mind species when released together with A. swirskii. This was compared to the standard release of 0. laevigatus with A. swirskii. N. tenuis and A. swirskii were involved in a bidirectional intraguild predation (IGP). On the contrary, this interaction (IGP) was apparently unidirectional in the case of M. pygmaeus with A. swirskii and O. laevigatus with A. swirskii. Both, M. pygmaeus and 0. laevigatus significantly reduced the abundance of A. swirskii. Secondly, in a greenhouse experiment, where the same release combinations were tested (either N. tenuis, M. pygmaeus or 0. laevigatus combined with A. swirskii), IGP seemed to be neutralized. Mirids with A. swirskii significantly suppressed thrips, whitefly, and aphid infestations. Contrarily, the combined use of a laevigatus with A swirskii did not reached a satisfactory control for aphids, despite the reduction in thrips and whitefly densities. Therefore, our results suggest that the use of mirids combined with A swirskii could result in more efficient and robust biological control programs in sweet pepper crops.","[Bouagga, Sarra; Urbaneja, Alberto; Perez-Hedo, Meritxell] IVIA, Ctr Protect Vegetal & Biotecnol, Unidad Asociada Entomol UJI IVIA, CV-315,Km 10-7, Valencia 46113, Spain","Perez-Hedo, M (corresponding author), IVIA, Ctr Protect Vegetal & Biotecnol, Unidad Asociada Entomol UJI IVIA, CV-315,Km 10-7, Valencia 46113, Spain.",meritxell_p@hotmail.com,"Perez-Hedo, Meritxell/O-6441-2019; Bouagga, Sarra/AAB-8113-2020; Urbaneja, Alberto/C-9071-2011; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/AAW-6198-2020","Perez-Hedo, Meritxell/0000-0003-3411-0761; Bouagga, Sarra/0000-0003-2293-6144; Urbaneja, Alberto/0000-0001-5986-3685; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/0000-0001-5986-3685","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [AGL2014-55616-C3, RTA2017-00073]; Conselleria d'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio of the Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat Valenciana; INIA Spain (Subprogram DOC-INIA-CCAA); Russell IPM Ltd.","The research leading to these results was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (AGL2014-55616-C3 and RTA2017-00073) and the Conselleria d'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio of the Generalitat Valenciana.

Insect exclusion by insecticides, vegetation perturbation at the start of the experiment by removing the top soil layer, and sowing extra seeds were applied at one site (Site 1) on 32 plots, and only insect exclusion at another site (Site 2) on 14 plots, respectively, in the plant's natural habitat. The number of seedlings was influenced most by perturbation at Site 1. There were 2-4 times more seedlings on bare plots in comparison with vegetation-covered plots, although significant difference was detected only in 1993, 1994 and 1997. Density of adult plants was lower on vegetation-covered plots. Dry matter, height, length of branches, and of pods were positively affected by perturbation on Site 1. The number of seeds infested by pre-DSPs was generally low, however, it was higher on unsprayed plots, regardless whether the plot was perturbed or not. Overall, seed loss to pre-DSPs was only ca. 10%. Sowing extra seeds among vegetation increased net plant recruitment demonstrating that microsites were available in the habitat. V angustifolia is assumed to be a weak competitor and, in spite of the low percentage of seed loss to pre-DSPs, it is most likely limited by seed number. The deficit in using available microsites might be caused by post-dispersal mortality factors.","Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Dept Zool, Budapest, Hungary","Szentesi, A (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Anim Systemat & Ecol, Pf 120, H-1518 Budapest, Hungary.",szentesi@cerberus.elte.hu,,,,,,52,16,17,0,27,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1439-1791,1618-0089,,BASIC APPL ECOL,Basic Appl.

Food caching is a widely studied, taxonomically diverse behavior that can modify competitive relationships and affect population viability. We address predictions that food caching would not be observed in the marine environment by summarizing recent caching reports from two marine mammal and one marine reptile species. We also provide multiple caching observations from disparate locations for a fourth marine predator, the leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx (de Blainville, 1820)). Drawing from consistent patterns in the terrestrial literature, we suggest the unusual diversity of caching strategies observed in leopard seals is due to high variability in their polar marine habitat. We hypothesize that caching is present across the spectrum of leopard seal social dominance; however, prevalence is likely to increase in smaller, less-dominant animals that hoard to gain competitive advantage. Given the importance of this behavior, we draw attention to the high probability of observing food caching behavior in other marine species.","[Krause, Douglas J.] NOAA Fisheries, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Rogers, Tracey L.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Krause, DJ (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",douglas.krause@noaa.gov,,"Rogers, Tracey/0000-0002-7141-4177; Krause, Douglas/0000-0002-2517-3106",US-AMLR Program,"This note was greatly improved by suggestions and comments from P.K.

The cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi is an abundant mollusc inhabiting the sheltered shores of New Zealand. This species, which lives just a few centimetres under the surface, plays a key role for many benthic invertebrate species, because in these habitats the cockle shell is the only available hard surface where invertebrates can establish. However, the behaviour of this cockle can be altered locally by a parasite, the trematode Curtuteria australis. Indeed, heavily infected cockles are unable to bury perfectly and typically lie entirely exposed at the surface of the mud. In this study we investigated the ecological consequences of this behavioural alteration for two invertebrate species commonly associated with cockles, the anemone Anthopleura aureoradiata and the limpet Notoacmea helmsi. A field study first demonstrated that in both infected and non-infected populations of cockles, there was a negative relationship between the number of anemones and limpets found on cockles. In the laboratory, we showed that predation of limpets by anemones is possible when they share the same cockle shell. In a heavily infected population of cockles, limpets were significantly more frequent and more abundant on cockles manipulated by C. australis than on cockles with a normal behaviour. A colonization test conducted in natural conditions demonstrated that the predominance of limpets on manipulated cockles results from a direct habitat preference. Conversely anemones were significantly less frequent and less abundant on manipulated cockles than on cockles manipulated by C. australis. A desiccation test revealed that, relative to limpets, they had a lower resistance to this physical stress. We discuss our results in relation to current ideas on ecosystem engineering by organisms.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; Univ Montpellier 2, Lab Parasitol Comparee, CNRS, UMR 5555, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France","Thomas, F (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",renaud@crit.univ-montp2.fr,"Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008","Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; THOMAS, Frederic/0000-0003-2238-1978",,,,43,111,114,4,67,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Although such variation may reflect divergent levels of predation, food availability or social stress in different environments, female competitive ability may also be balanced by significant reproductive costs and thus be subject to strong stabilizing selection, We report here that high-ranking female baboons (Papio cynocephalus anubis) at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, enjoy shorter interbirth intervals, improved infant survival, and accelerated maturation of their daughters.

Current theory predicts that fish primarily influence periphyton communities by controlling herbivore densities. But fish may also influence algal communities by increasing available nutrients via nutrient recycling. To separate these effects and to determine their relative importance, we made a number of specific predictions based on the literature and tested these predictions by manipulating the presence and absence of the molluscivorous redear sunfish, Lepomis microlophus, and snails, Physella heterostropha, in a replicated factorial experiment. We examined the effects of fish on nutrient concentrations in the water and on snail grazing activity and life history traits. We also evaluated the effect of fish and snails on cell number, biovolume, cell size, and growth form of all periphyton, green algae, diatoms, and blue-green algae. Concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen in the water were significantly higher in the presence of fish, but this had little effect on total periphyton. Although fish had only visual and waterborne (olfactory) contact with snails, their presence inhibited snail reproduction and/or increased mortality of small snails such that twice as many snails were produced in the absence of fish. Snail grazing activity was six times higher in the absence of caged fish than in their presence. In the absence of fish, snails reduced periphyton cell number and increased the average size of the periphyton cells, primarily through effects on green algae. Snails reduced the biovolume of diatoms and blue-green algae. Fish also reduced diatom biovolume by decreasing the average cell size of diatoms. Snails increased the proportion of gelatinous colonies in the periphyton. Previous research suggests that fish have a positive indirect effect on algae by removing grazers. Fish can augment this effect by negatively affecting snail life history traits and by reducing grazing activity. In addition, fish may have an important but less obvious direct effect on algae via changing nutrient concentrations and possibly altering competitive outcomes among taxa and growth forms.","Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Dept Zool, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","McCollum, EW (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, 135 Duke Marine Lab Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.",,,,,,,106,79,83,2,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1998,79,6,,,,,1980,1994,,,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,116YM,WOS:000075752700011,,,,,2021-09-27,

We examined the interaction of natural and sexual selection pressures on the behaviour of beaugregory damselfish, Stegastes leucostictus, by presenting territorial males with an egg predator and either a male or female conspecific, requiring males to prioritize brood defense with either courtship or intra-sexual competition. By measuring the time spent near stimuli, we examined the influence of several factors, including stimuli type, variation in predator number, and the presence of eggs in a nest site. Generally, males spent more time with conspecific stimuli than egg predators, suggesting that the sexual selection pressures of deterring rivals and attracting mates outweigh the natural selection pressure to engage in brood defense. This decision was affected by the sex of the conspecific presented, the presence of eggs in a male's territory, and a number of interactions of these factors, indicating that male damselfish consider multiple factors before investing in certain types and intensities of behaviours. Furthermore, observations of behaviours associated with courtship and intrasexual aggression show that a natural selection pressure impacts intra-and inter-sexually selected behaviours differently in this system.","[Leese, Joseph M.; Snekser, Jennifer L.; Itzkowitz, Murray] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Leese, JM (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",jml206@lehigh.edu,"Snekser, Jennifer L/J-1681-2019","Snekser, Jennifer L/0000-0002-2472-4412",University of the West Indies,We thank the staff of the Discovery Bay Marine Lab of the University of the West Indies for their support and assistance in field work.

Vertically suspended settlement substrata in the upper 6 in of the water column almost invariably become dominated by M. edulis within a few summer months. However, not all naturally available hard substrata bear mussel monocultures. In three in situ experiments we investigated the dominance of mussels and the influence of local consumers on establishment and dynamics of a benthic community: (a) the natural course of succession in the absence of benthic consumers was followed on vertically suspended settlement substrata, (b) settling plates were exposed to natural recruitment being either accessible or inaccessible to all benthic consumers, and (c) the three major local consumer species, viz. the shore crab Carcinus maenas, the starfish Asterias rubens and the periwinkle Littorina littorea, were enclosed separately in cages containing a settling panel to assess species-specific consumer effects on recruitment. The results illustrate that in this region of the Baltic Sea mussels do have the potential to dominate ungrazed substrata within a few weeks and that top-down effects (predation and grazing) may control community structure. While some species - mussels in particular - were suppressed by consumption, others seemed to benefit from the presence of consumers. Thus, barnacles and algae thrived when consumers were present. Blue mussels being the locally dominant competitor, the beneficial effects of consumers on barnacles and algae were presumably indirect ones through consumer-caused release from asymmetrical competition. The isolated effects of C maenas, A. rubens and L. littorea, on recruitment differed in quality (positive vs. negative), quantity (strength of effect) and specificity. Barnacle recruitment was significantly reduced in the presence of both starfish and shore crabs. Diatom recruitment was significantly reduced by snails and shore crabs. Scyphozoan recruitment was significantly reduced by crabs only, but was significantly increased by snails. The influence of the shore crabs was most remarkable: recruitment by any potential coloniser species was impeded to a point where in the presence of single individuals of C. maenas the plates stayed perfectly clean macroscopically.

Here we tested the hypothesis that a seed-hoarding species (Pere David's rock squirrel [Sciurotamias davidianus]) rapidly scatter hoards seeds near seed sources to maximize harvest rate, and then subsequently recaches seeds to further reduce cache losses. We tracked the caches of wild walnut (Juglans mandshurica) scatter hoarded by S. davidianus, the exclusive dispersal agent of this highly preferred nut species. We followed dispersed nuts in both the field and in a large enclosure in a manner that allowed us to follow patterns of recaching through the scatter-hoarding process. In the field, S. davidianus initially cached close to nut sources and then subsequently recached nuts on multiple occasions progressively farther from sources, always in the same direction, at lower densities, and at sites with more vegetative cover (e.g., under shrubs). In enclosures, each of 6 squirrels first cached nuts closer to the nut source on the 1st day of observation, and then subsequently recached nuts closer to the nest, sometimes at decreasing densities. We suggest that, in addition to pilferage risk, cache spacing by S. davidianus may be influenced by the potential for competition at the seed source and proximity to the burrow or the core of the home range, and that caches might be managed to accommodate all of these factors. Future studies should consider how such recaching behavior influences patterns of cache recovery, the ultimate distribution of dispersed nuts, and seed fates.","[Zhang, Hongmao] Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Mol & Behav Res Grp, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongmao; Zhang, Zhibin; Wang, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Steele, Michael A.] Wilkes Univ, Dept Biol, Wilkes Barre, PA 18766 USA; [Wang, Wei] China West Normal Univ, Dept Biol, Nanchong 637002, Peoples R China","Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Mol & Behav Res Grp, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",zhanghm@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,,,"H.

The recognition that even simple ecological systems can undergo chaotic behaviour has made chaos a topic of considerable interest among theoretical ecologists(1-4). However, there is still a lack of experimental evidence that chaotic behaviour occurs in the real world of coexisting populations in multi-species systems. Here we study the dynamics of a defined predator - prey system consisting of a bacterivorous ciliate and two bacterial prey species. The bacterial species preferred by the ciliate was the superior competitor. Experimental conditions were kept constant with continuous cultivation in a one-stage chemostat. We show that the dynamic behaviour of such a two-prey, one-predator system includes chaotic behaviour, as well as stable limit cycles and coexistence at equilibrium. Changes in the population dynamics were triggered by changes in the dilution rates of the chemostat. The observed dynamics were verified by estimating the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. Such a defined microbial food web offers a new possibility for the experimental study of deterministic chaos in real biological systems.","Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Dept Gen Ecol & Limnol, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; Max Planck Inst Limnol, D-24302 Plon, Germany; Balt Sea Res Inst, D-18119 Rostock, Germany","Arndt, H (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Dept Gen Ecol & Limnol, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",hartmut.arndt@uni-koeln.de,"Becks, Lutz/I-8256-2012; Arndt, Hartmut/K-9364-2017; Hilker, Frank/B-8624-2008","Arndt, Hartmut/0000-0003-2811-3595; Hilker, Frank/0000-0001-5470-8889; Jurgens, Klaus/0000-0002-7999-9368",,,,30,152,158,0,71,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,JUN 30,2005,435,7046,,,,,1226,1229,,10.1038/nature03627,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500042,15988524,,,,2021-09-27,

However, many pathogens exhibit cyclic abundance patterns (e. g., seasonality), and temporal asynchrony between interacting pathogens could reduce the impact of those interactions. Here we use an extension of our previously published model to investigate the effects of cycles on pathogen interaction. We demonstrate that host immune memory can maintain the impact of an interaction, even when the effector pathogen abundance is low or the pathogen is absent. Paradoxically, immune memory can result in pathogens interacting more strongly when temporally out of phase. We find that interactions between species can result in changes to the temporal pattern of the affected species. We further demonstrate that this may be observed in a natural host-pathogen system. Given the continuing debate regarding the relevance of pathogen interactions in natural systems and increasing concern about treatment strategies for coinfections, both the discovery of a shift in cycle in empirical data and the mechanism by which we identified it are important.

To sort out, among the many coexistence mechanisms suggested by theory and experiments, which ones actually maintain diversity in natural ecosystems, long-term field studies are paramount. We analysed a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series using dynamic, multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models. Phytoplankton was counted and identified down to the genus level, every 2 weeks over 20 years, at 10 sites along the French coastline. MAR models allowed to estimate biotic interaction networks while also accounting for abiotic variables that may drive part of the phytoplankton fluctuations. We then analysed the ratio of intra to intertaxa interactions (a measure of niche differentiation), the frequency of negative versus positive interactions, and how stability metrics (both at the network and genus level) relate to network complexity and genus self-regulation or abundance. We showed that a strong self-regulation, with competition strength within a taxon (genus) an order of magnitude higher than between taxa, was present in all phytoplanktonic interaction networks. This much stronger intragenus competition suggests that niche differentiation-rather than neutrality-is commonplace in phytoplankton. Furthermore, interaction networks were dominated by positive net effects between phytoplanktonic taxa (on average, more than 50% of interactions were positive). While network stability (sensu resilience) was unrelated to complexity measures, we unveiled links between self-regulation, intergenera interaction strengths and abundance. The less common taxa tend to be more strongly self-regulated and can therefore maintain in spite of competition with more abundant ones. Synthesis. We demonstrate that strong niche differentiation, widespread facilitation between phytoplanktonic taxa and stabilizing covariances between interaction strengths should be common features of coexisting phytoplankton communities in the field. These are structural properties that we can expect to emerge from plausible mechanistic models of phytoplankton communities. We discuss mechanisms, such as predation or restricted microscale movement, that are consistent with these findings, which paves the way for further research.","[Picoche, Coralie; Barraquand, Frederic] Univ Bordeaux, Integrat & Theoret Ecol, LabEx COTE, Pessac, France; [Picoche, Coralie; Barraquand, Frederic] Univ Bordeaux, Inst Math Bordeaux, CNRS, Talence, France","Barraquand, F (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, Integrat & Theoret Ecol, LabEx COTE, Pessac, France.; Barraquand, F (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, Inst Math Bordeaux, CNRS, Talence, France.",frederic.barraquand@u-bordeaux.fr,"Barraquand, Frederic/G-1599-2011","Barraquand, Frederic/0000-0002-4759-0269",Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [ANR-10-LABX-45],"Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-45",,76,1,1,4,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Since bass can effectively prey on bluegill only along the periphery of dense macrophyte beds, mowing vegetation to create additional edge may improve growth rates and size structure of both species. While this concept is straightforward, determining the optimal vegetation configuration for the two species is difficult because mechanisms such as feeding, competition, and mortality together determine the population response and may interact in complex ways. This paper describes a model that simulates the interactions of bluegill, largemouth bass and their invertebrate prey in the context of vegetation structure. The model is calibrated to data from a heavily vegetated temperate lake and is used to examine the fish response to additional edge created by mowing channels through plant beds, Bass growth rates and numbers increased after most simulated vegetation removals because their access to prey increased, Bluegill grew fastest when about 30% of the vegetation was cut, but responded negatively to mowing more than about half the plants. Bluegill responded to the manipulations more by changing growth rates, while bass responded more by increasing numbers. Moderate plant removals accomplished by mowing many narrow channels are most likely to simultaneously benefit both species. The model synthesizes current understanding of the relationship between macrophytes, bluegill and largemouth bass, and suggests which vegetation manipulations are most informative to test in large scale experiments.

The current model of horticultural intensification in south-eastern Spain produces high yields but has also resulted in a landscape almost completely covered by plastic. Promoting natural areas among greenhouses could enhance biodiversity, by being beneficial insects, and reduce pest pressure outdoors. The first step is to ascertain how pests and their natural enemies (NEs) use Mediterranean vegetation for selecting the best plants for pest suppression outdoors. The abundance of the two major horticultural pests, the tobacco whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, and the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, together with their NEs, were assayed in 22 flowering perennial plants, which were newly planted in an experimental field surrounded by greenhouses. Eight plant species were identified as the most critical species for sustaining pest populations outdoors. A set of five plant species supported a medium level of pests, and another set of ten plant species supported the lowest level of both pests. Tobacco whitefly occurred in a few plants species, whereas western flower thrips occurred on almost all the plant species studied, and was favoured by the presence of flowers in perennial plants. The results suggest that plant diversity may provide relatively few acceptable host plants for tobacco whitefly than for western flower thrips. NEs were generally collected in plants that also supported abundance of pests, indicating that host/prey availability, more than food resources from flowers, was a stronger predictor of NE abundance in perennial plants. Field trials using the plants with the lowest host acceptance by pests are needed in order to ascertain whether pest abundance outdoors is reduced.","[Rodriguez, E.] IFAPA, La Mojonera Ctr, Almeria, Spain; [Gonzalez, M.] Cajamar Expt Stn Las Palmerillas, El Ejido, Almeria, Spain; [Paredes, D.; Campos, M.; Benitez, E.] CSIC, Dept Environm Protect, Zaidin Expt Stn EEZ, Granada, Spain","Rodriguez, E (corresponding author), IFAPA, La Mojonera Ctr, Almeria, Spain.",mestefania.rodriguez@juntadeandalucia.es,"Benitez, Emilio/L-3110-2014; Paredes, Daniel/A-2183-2009; Navarro, Estefania Rodriguez/C-3183-2016","Benitez, Emilio/0000-0002-8435-066X; Paredes, Daniel/0000-0002-2681-2256; Navarro, Estefania Rodriguez/0000-0003-0083-2950; Gonzalez-Fernandez, Monica/0000-0002-6832-4074",ERDF (Regional Development Fund) - grant RECUPERA 2020 from the CSIC (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness); TRANSFORMA [PP.TRA.TRA201600.9]; FEDEREuropean Commission; Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA)Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA); European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF),"This work was supported by ERDF (Regional Development Fund) co-financed grant RECUPERA 2020 from the CSIC (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness), by TRANSFORMA (PP.TRA.TRA201600.9) and FEDER.

Hence, there is a great interest in disentangling the factors involved in their population dynamics. We conducted an intensive 2-year field study to test the relative role of seasonality in seed abundance, shrub cover and wild boar interference on the population dynamics of wood mice, Apodemus sylvaticus, in a Mediterranean oak forest. Wood mice demographic parameters varied strongly with the seasonal variations in acorn availability on the ground. Mice survival and abundance dropped drastically during summer, the period of acorn scarcity, but rose again in autumn when acorn-fall began. Specifically, female abundance was associated with the temporal changes in acorn availability on the ground, but were randomly distributed in space whereas males showed a spatially aggregated pattern during the acorn-abundant seasons (autumn-winter). In contrast to studies conducted in sparse oak forests in drier environments, spatial variability in shrub cover and wild boar foraging activity did not affect directly the population dynamics of wood mice. This could be due to the presence of an abundant shrub layer and a closed canopy in our forest that enhance environmental conditions and provides shelter against predators and ungulates. Our study highlights that the relative importance of environmental factors and intraguild competition on rodent dynamics may be highly context-dependent, varying greatly among different sites. We suggest that the relationships between acorn dispersers and oaks are more reciprocal than previously considered.

We trapped small mammals in the main habitat types in 21 owl territories, and simultaneously identified prey items cached by the same owls in their nest boxes. The main prey of owls in western Finland are the common vole (Microtus epiroticus), field vole (M. agrestis), bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), and common shrew (Sorer araneus). Common voles were the preferred prey of owls, followed by field voles, bank voles, and common shrews. Prey captured by owls tended to be lighter and smaller than those available in the field. This tendency was significant for field voles and common shrews. Field voles, common voles, and female common shrews captured by owls tended to have more internal fat than those available in the field.

Sedentary infaunal species are limited to some extent in escapes from sudden temperature changes, rather modifications to their physiology and behaviour are expected. This may lead to strong ecological and economic impacts on commercial bivalve species, such as Venerupis corrugata, Ruditapes decussatus, the introduced Ruditapes philippinarum and Cerastoderma edule, the most relevant in NW Spain. We investigated lethal and sublethal effects of heat during low tide on these species in the laboratory. Summer temperatures experienced within field, shallow sediments at approximately 2 cm depth i.e. 20 degrees C (control), 27 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 37 degrees C, were replicated during four consecutive days and the diffusion of heat at the burrowing depth of each species was estimated; temperature exposure was expressed as degree hours above 22 degrees C. After two days of tidal exposure, C. edule and V. corrugata suffered significant mortalities, and also the most dramatic decrease in scope for growth (SFG) as well as reduction in burrowing activity. After four days under stress, all species had negative SFG. On recovery, species showed compensation at longer exposures, particularly C. edule. These effects of temperature on mortality, growth potential and burrowing ability may increase the time to achieve commercial size and exposure to predation. Particularly, V. corrugata, with a center of distribution lower in the intertidal and subtidal, and C. edule, shallower in the sediment, may be the most affected. Clearly the intensity and frequency of heat waves will affect these key species in the intertidal sediment flats changing ecosystem functioning and fisheries management strategies.","[Dominguez, Rula; Olabarria, Celia; Peteiro, Laura G.; Macho, Gonzalo; Vazquez, Elsa] Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N,Illa Toralla S-N, Vigo 36331, Spain; [Dominguez, Rula; Olabarria, Celia; Peteiro, Laura G.; Macho, Gonzalo; Vazquez, Elsa] Univ Vigo, Ctr Invest Marina, Illa Toralla S-N, Vigo 36331, Spain; [Woodin, Sarah A.; Wethey, David S.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, 715 Sumter St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Peteiro, Laura G.] CSIC, Inst Invest Marinas, C Eduardo Cabello 6, Vigo 36208, Spain","Dominguez, R (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N,Illa Toralla S-N, Vigo 36331, Spain.; Dominguez, R (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Ctr Invest Marina, Illa Toralla S-N, Vigo 36331, Spain.",rula.domgz@gmail.com,"Wethey, David/K-8063-2014; Garcia Peteiro, Laura/B-6179-2014","Wethey, David/0000-0002-2549-1606; Garcia Peteiro, Laura/0000-0001-9382-2502","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CTM2014-51935-R]; Autonomous government Xunta de Galicia-FEDER [GRC2013-004]; US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX11AP77G, 80 NSSC20K0074]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE1129401];  [BES-2015-074211]","This research was supported by grants CTM2014-51935-R from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad to the project MARISCO, a pre-doctoral grant for RD (BES-2015-074211), and the Autonomous government Xunta de Galicia-FEDER (project GRC2013-004) and grants NNX11AP77G and 80 NSSC20K0074 from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and OCE1129401 from the US National Science Foundation to DSW and SAW.

Classic theory predicts that individuals will care for offspring when the fitness benefits through increased offspring survival and growth outweigh the cost to the parents through decreased future reproductive opportunities. Yet, a puzzling observation not explained by this basic theory is the fact that in some species individuals defend and provision unrelated offspring and thus exhibit alloparental care. The tessellated darter, Etheostoma olmstedi, represents one of the first known examples of allopaternal care in fishes. In this species, males often clean and guard eggs fertilized but deserted by other males. Allopaternal care has been argued to occur in the tessellated darter because of competition for a limited number of mating sites where less dominant males accept territories with eggs when other breeding sites are not available. Here, we test this hypothesis using male territory choice experiments. When allowed to choose between two otherwise identical territories either containing eggs fertilized by another male or with no eggs, males spent significantly more time at territories with eggs. This demonstrates that competition for mating territories is not the primary factor explaining the existence of allopaternal care in the tessellated darter. Instead, males of this species may exhibit allopaternal care to dilute predator pressure on their own eggs or because females prefer to mate with males whose territories contain eggs.","[Farmer, Miles B.; Alonzo, Suzanne H.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Alonzo, SH (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",Suzanne.Alonzo@Yale.edu,,,Yale University; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate ResearchHoward Hughes Medical Institute; MBF; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOB-0450807],"We thank Joanne Klein for help collecting and maintaining the fish in captivity.

It was introduced to the western Soviet Union during the first half of the twentieth century, and has since then spread to, and established in, many European countries where it now is considered invasive. Raccoon dogs are suspected to have negative impacts on biodiversity, for example through nest predation, but empirical evidence is scarce. In this study we used GPS monitoring combined with camera traps on both artificial and natural nests to find out: (1) if raccoon dogs find and scavenge eggs from artificial nests, (2) if the scavenging from raccoon dogs is additive or compensatory to the scavenging from native species, and, (3) if raccoon dogs actively scare brooding birds off their nests and prey on their eggs. We found that raccoon dogs effectively located artificial nests and scavenged their eggs. There was a significantly higher scavenging frequency on experiment islands with both raccoon dogs and native scavengers, than on control islands with only native scavengers. There was no difference in native scavenging frequency on islands with versus without a raccoon dog, suggesting an additive effect from the raccoon dog on top of the native scavenging. GPS-tracked raccoon dogs moved intensively in the archipelago during the bird breeding season, swimming long distances to reach new islands if needed. Raccoon dogs that arrived on islands with natural nests actively scared brooding hens, up to the size of graylag goose, off their nests and preyed on their eggs. Raccoon dogs preyed on all the eggs they found, but discarded the egg shells. Not consuming the egg shells consequently leads to few visible traces of eggs in their stomachs or faeces, which in turn may explain why egg predation by raccoon dogs has been largely overlooked in previous studies. We discuss the potential impact of raccoon dogs on biodiversity, in the light of our new findings, and conclude that the raccoon dog may have a much larger effect on the breeding success of ground nesting sea birds than what has so far been the predominating view in the scientific literature.","[Dahl, Fredrik] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Dahl, Fredrik; Ahlen, Per-Arne] Swedish Assoc Hunting & Wildlife Management, S-61191 Oster Malma, Nykoping, Sweden","Dahl, F (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",fredrik.dahl@slu.se,,,"Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) [NV-03383-16, NV-03794-15]; Swedish Ethics Committee on Animal Research [A18-16]; county administrative board of Norrbotten [522-7213-2016, 522-10291-2017]","Funding for the study and exemption for releasing raccoon dogs for the nest predation study (NV-03383-16, NV-03794-15) was kindly provided by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA).

The relationship between prey availability and flounder distribution was also investigated. Juvenile flounder diet included 21 taxa of macroinvertebrates and fishes, sand and plant debris. According to numerical, occurrence, and gravimetric dietary indices, macroinvertebrates, namely Chironomidae and Corophium spp. were the main prey items. The diet diversity tended to increase as juveniles grew, although some dietary overlap occurred between the early juveniles (50-149 mm total length (TL)). In fact, the diet diversity of the newly settled juveniles (<50 mm TL) was particularly low, evidencing the importance of Chironomidae. Moreover, an ontogenetic shift was evident, since older juveniles (1(+)) presented a distinct diet, including new items absent from the diet of the 0(+) juveniles, namely Teleostei, Carcinus maenas, and Nemertea. The juvenile flounder presented an overall generalist behavior, feeding on the most abundant macroinvertebrates namely Chironomidae and Corophium spp., as evidenced by the Strauss linear index. The spatial distribution of the 0(+) flounder in the Lima estuary was associated with salinity and prey (Chironomidae and Corophium spp.). These preys were characteristic of the upper estuary where most of the juveniles, especially the newly settled, were found. Hence, this study reinforces the importance of both abiotic and biotic factors as environmental driven controls of habitat use during the early phases of the demersal life of European flounder.

For directly transmitted pathogens, non-host species may dilute infection directly (1) and indirectly (2). Competitors and predators may (1) alter host behavior to reduce pathogen transmission or (2) reduce host density. In a well-studied system, we tested the dilution of the zoonotic Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) by two competitors and a predator. Our study was based on long-term PUUV infection data (2003-2013) in northern Sweden. The field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the common shrew (Sorex araneus) are bank vole competitors and Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) is a main predator of bank voles. Infection probability in bank voles decreased when common shrew density increased, suggesting that common shrews reduced PUUV transmission. Field voles suppressed bank vole density in meadows and clear-cuts and indirectly diluted PUUV infection. Further, Tengmalm's owl decline in 1980-2013 may have contributed to higher PUUV infection rates in bank voles in 2003-2013 compared to 1979-1986. Our study provides further evidence for dilution effect and suggests that owls may have an important role in reducing disease risk.","[Khalil, Hussein; Ecke, Frauke; Magnusson, Magnus; Hornfeldt, Birger] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Skogmarksgrand, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Ecke, Frauke] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Gerda Nilssons Vag 5, SE-75651 Uppsala, Sweden; [Evander, Magnus] Umea Univ, Dept Clin Microbiol, Virol, SE-90185 Umea, Sweden","Khalil, H (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Skogmarksgrand, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Hussein.khalil@slu.se,"Magnusson, Magnus/L-2072-2018; Ecke, Frauke/AAW-6468-2021; Evander, Magnus/AAF-5665-2019","Magnusson, Magnus/0000-0001-7275-9006; Ecke, Frauke/0000-0003-4208-345X; Evander, Magnus/0000-0001-6034-4807",Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [221-2012-1568]; Swedish Natural Science Research Council; Stiftelsen Seth M.

We investigated interactions between predatory ladybirds and the ant Lasius neoniger, which engages in a facultative association with the aphid Aphis fabae. We found that ants disrupted predator aggregation and deterred foraging, but that this effect varied with aphid density. In the field, smaller aphid colonies had higher numbers of ants per aphid (higher relative ant density), whereas plants with larger aphid colonies had lower relative ant density. Ants deterred ladybird foraging when relative ant density was high, but when relative ant density was low, ladybirds aggregated to aphids and foraged more successfully. This difference in ladybird foraging success appeared to be driven by variation in the ants' distribution on the plant and the ladybirds' reaction to ants. When relative ant density was high, ants moved around the perimeter of the aphid colonies, which resulted in faster detection of predators and a greater likelihood of ladybirds leaving. However, when relative ant density was low, ants moved only in the midst of the aphid colonies and rarely around the perimeter, which allowed predators to approach the aphid colony from the perimeter and feed without detection. Such predators were less likely to leave the aphid colony when subsequently detected by ants. We suggest that differences in relative ant numbers, ant distribution, and predator reaction to detection by ants could lead to complex population-level consequences including density-dependent mutualisms and the possibility that predators act as prudent predators.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Ctr Community Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Harmon, JP (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jharmon@wisc.edu,"Harmon, Jason/AAW-3036-2021","Harmon, Jason/0000-0002-2533-5005",,,,32,19,19,2,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2007,116,6,,,,,1030,1036,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15578.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,167EW,WOS:000246435000013,,,,,2021-09-27,

Using a rare data set on collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) winter nest location spanning more than two decades, we show that lemmings actively select for Salix snow beds, likely due to its favorable micro-climate, and that lemming habitat selection was density-dependent. Lemmings nevertheless exhibited some flexibility in their habitat selection, which appeared to be influenced by the year-to-year variation in snow conditions. The likelihood of both lemming breeding and nest predation by stoats (Mustela erminea) was not directly linked to habitat despite a delicate interplay between habitat, nest size, breeding, and predation. Hence, the larger lemming nests were found in Salix snow beds, and these were more often used for breeding, but both larger nests and nests used for breeding were also predated more often than other nests. Our study provides a clear example of how density-dependent habitat selection acts to balance fitness in the various habitats utilized by collared lemmings.","[Schmidt, Niels M.; van Beest, Floris M.; Hansen, Lars H.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Schmidt, Niels M.; van Beest, Floris M.] Aarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Ny Munkegade 116, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Dupuch, Angelique] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Desforges, Jean-Pierre] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Quebec City, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Schmidt, NM (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.; Schmidt, NM (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Ny Munkegade 116, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",nms@bios.au.dk,"Schmidt, Niels Martin/G-3843-2011; van Beest, Floris/C-6745-2019","Schmidt, Niels Martin/0000-0002-4166-6218; van Beest, Floris/0000-0002-5701-4927",Danish Environmental Protection Agency,"We are indebted to the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring program for access to ecosystem data and to the many dedicated field workers over the years, and to the Danish Environmental Protection Agency for their financial support.",,49,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2021,195,4,,,,,927,935,,10.1007/s00442-021-04882-2,,FEB 2021,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RO1EP,WOS:000619897600001,33609167,,,,2021-09-27,

It also highlights many areas in which additional research is needed. Living turritellines are mainly sessile, semi-infaunal suspension feeders, in shallow waters of full-marine salinity and temperatures below 20 C, but they can occasionally be more active and diverse in their habits, crawling on the surface and thriving in a variety of depths, salinities, and temperatures. They are eaten by a surprising diversity of predators, and infected by numerous parasites, especially trematodes, but little is known about interactions with predators, parasites, competitors, or commensals in nature. Their reproductive patterns (broadcast spawning and spermatophores) appear to depend on high abundance, which may help explain why they are the dominant species in many marine communities. The larvae of most species float (or swim) and feed in the plankton for no more than 2 weeks, but nothing is known about settlement. Several fossils and at least one modern species are brooders. Spermatozoa are dimorphic, and frequently paired and/or multiflagellate. Soft anatomy is known for only a few species, and ranges of variation remain largely undocumented. Radulae in particular have been strangely neglected, and this paper presents only the second published SEM image of a turritelline radula. Shell growth rates are variable but can be relatively rapid. Most species appear to live less than three years. Little is known about shell function or development. Although there is strong evidence for a positive correlation of abundance with available nutrients and/or primary productivity, this has not been examined quantitatively or experimentally. Gathering such natural history information on marine gastropod groups should be as high a priority as systematic and phylogenetic analyses. Information scattered in the literature is now much more available via internet search tools, and this approach should be used for other groups.","[Allmon, Warren D.] Cornell Univ, Paleontol Res Inst, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Allmon, Warren D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Allmon, WD (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Paleontol Res Inst, 1259 Trumansburg Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",wda1@cornell.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0719642],"For information and/or discussion, I am grateful to Donald Dan, Graham Edgar, Rod Feldmann, Jonathan Hendricks, Austin Hendy, Patricia Kelley, Amy McCune, Paula Mikkelsen, Robert Poulin, Robert Robertson, Gary Rosenberg, Carrie Schweitzer, Paul Shin, Chris Vos, Richard Waite, Sally Walker, and Anders Waren.

To elucidate the zooplankton response to nutrient depletion (oligotrophication), an experiment was performed in mesocosms simulating real scenarios. Phytoplankton and zooplankton inocula were collected in the Upper Parana River Floodplain and subjected to combinated nutrient and transparency treatment. We evaluated whether resource limitation and increased transparency (both associated with oligotrophication) affect the size structure of planktonic crustaceans. The effects of predation were corroborated in the treatments with low nutrient concentrations. Thus, the oligotrophic scenario (high transparency and low nutrient concentration) indicated a decreased size structure of zooplankton, probably because of the predation pressure, supporting the predictions of the size-efficiency hypothesis (SEH). When resources were abundant (in treatments with high nutrient concentrations), the decrease in the size structure indicated that the enrichment of nutrients favoured small individuals. Our results showed that nutrient and transparency manipulation affected species richness, the abundance of individuals, and the zooplankton community size structure. Therefore, we suggest that oligotrophication affects predation and competition dynamics in zooplankton.","[Braz, Joyce Ernestina Monteiro] Univ Fed Para, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade & Conservacao, Campus Altamira, Altamira, Brazil; [Dias, Juliana Deo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Oceanog & Limnol, Posgrad Ecol, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Bonecker, Claudia Costa] Univ Estadual Maringa, Nupelia, Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Simoes, Nadson Ressye] Univ Fed Sul Bahia, Posgrad Ciencias & Tecnol Ambientais, Ctr Formacao Ciencias Agroflorestais, Itabuna, Brazil","Simoes, NR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sul Bahia, Posgrad Ciencias & Tecnol Ambientais, Ctr Formacao Ciencias Agroflorestais, Itabuna, Brazil.",nadsonressye@yahoo.com.br,"Simoes, Nadson/J-9701-2012","Simoes, Nadson/0000-0002-4577-9033",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento a Pesquisa (CNPq) from BrazilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"We would like to thank Universidade Federal do Para and Universidade Estadual de Maringa by logistic support.

These altered communities may become attractive to gravid mosquitoes searching for oviposition sites when the disturbances decrease the abundance of mosquito antagonists such as competitors, which often results in an increase in mosquito food resources. However, flash flood disturbances in intermittent riverbeds can also remove mosquito food resources such as algae, so that the net effect of flash floods could be either to increase or decrease mosquito abundance. We conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment to assess the effects of flash floods on mosquito oviposition habitat selection and larval abundance during the post-disturbance period of community recovery. Mesocosms were artificially flooded. Mosquito oviposition, immature abundance, invertebrate species diversity, chlorophyll a, and abiotic parameters were monitored. Our results showed that the flash flood negatively affected phytoplankton and zooplankton, leading to a decrease of mosquito oviposition in flooded mesocosms compared to non-flooded mesocosms. More broadly, this study indicates how disturbances influence mosquito oviposition habitat selection due to the loss of food resources in ephemeral pools, and it highlights the importance of considering the effects of disturbances in management, habitat restoration, and biodiversity conservation in temporary aquatic habitats.","[Duchet, C.; Moraru, G.

Information on space requirements is especially important for carnivore species which range over very large areas and often come into direct conflict with human interest. We used long-term telemetry-location data from a recovering wolf population in Scandinavia to investigate variation in home range size in relation to environmental and social characteristics of the different packs. Wolves showed considerable variation in home range size, which ranged from 259 to 1,676 km(2). Although wolf density increased fourfold during the study period, we found no evidence that intraspecific competition influenced range size. Local variation in moose density, which was the main prey for most packs, did not influence wolf home range size. Home ranges increased with latitude and elevation and decreased with increased roe deer density. Although prey biomass alone did not influence range size, our data suggest that there is a correlation between habitat characteristics, choice of prey species and possible hunting success, which currently combine to shape home range size in Scandinavian wolves.","[Mattisson, Jenny; Gervasi, Vincenzo; Linnell, John D.

Larval anurans are models to examine activity level-predation risk tradeoffs, as they occupy a variety of lentic habitats that impose constraints on the distribution and abundance of species. Ephemeral ponds have a low abundance and diversity of predators and as a result tadpole species tend to have high foraging rates for rapid development. Permanent ponds generally possess a greater diversity and abundance of predators and tadpoles inhabiting these locations tend to have low activity rates or chemical defenses to minimize predation risk. The objective of this research was to examine how interspecific variation in activity level and response to predation risk, corresponds to the distributions of tadpole species along the hydroperiod gradient. Furthermore, we examined the intraspecific variation in activity level among the species. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments in which we quantified baseline activity patterns and the change in activity after the addition of a predator or exposure to alarm cues, for 12 species of larval anurans native to East Texas. Species that maintained a high activity level generally occupied ephemeral ponds and species that maintained low activity levels generally occupied permanent ponds. Only one species (Gastrophryne carolinensis) decreased their activity level in the presence of predator cues or conspecific alarm cues. These results highlight this tradeoff can have consequences on the life histories of multiple species, providing insight into how it affects the organization of ecological communities.","[Schiwitz, Nicholas C.; Schalk, Christopher M.] Stephen F Austin State Univ, Arthur Temple Coll Forestry & Agr, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA; [Saenz, Daniel] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, Nacogdoches, TX 75965 USA","Schiwitz, NC (corresponding author), Stephen F Austin State Univ, Arthur Temple Coll Forestry & Agr, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA.",nschiwitz@gmail.com,,,McIntire-Stennis from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,We thank Cory K.

Notophthalmus viridescens (the red-spotted newt) occurs primarily in temporary ponds, while Enneacanthus obesus (the banded sunfish) is restricted to permanent ponds. Larval anurans are an important prey assemblage found in both kinds of ponds. We stocked both predators in artificial ponds together with six species of larval anurans, forming different species assemblages, to assess whether a similar abundance and biomass of each predator would have comparable impacts on community patterns. The predators differed in their effects on prey species composition but had similar impacts on composite community attributes, including prey species diversity and total prey biomass. Enneacanthus eliminated Pseudacris crucifer, Hyla andersonii, Hyla versicolor, and Scaphiopus holbrookii, creating a community dominated by Bufo woodhousii and Rana sphenocephala. Notophthalmus eliminated Bufo, creating an assemblage dominated by Pseudacris but also containing four additional species. Very few anurans survived in ponds containing both newts and fish. The different consequences of predation by newts and fish reflect different effectiveness of anuran antipredator defenses against these predators. Mechanisms that reduced predation by fish, such as unpalatability, were ineffective against newts. Our findings suggest that a patchy distribution of functionally distinct predators across a landscape of discrete habitats will contribute to predictable patterns of spatial variation in community composition and will create a mosaic of communities dominated by different prey species.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA","Morin, PJ (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",,,,,,,73,52,53,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1998,79,2,,,,,477,489,,,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZA653,WOS:000072387600010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Likewise, of the many factors that may affect demography, it is often unknown which are the major factors responsible for spatial variation in demographic rates. In this study, we estimated rates of growth and examined age distributions within nine populations of black perch (Embiotoca jacksoni) distributed across similar to 350 km of coastline. We tested whether spatial variation in demography was associated with several explanatory variables including population density, predator density, food availability, and fishing activity. Our study revealed a substantial amount of spatial variation in demographic rates. Among-population variation in growth accounted for 55% of the total variation, and the coefficient of variation for mean age within a population was 27%, suggesting substantial variation in mortality. Spatial variation in growth was most sensitive to variation in food availability and mean age was lowest at locations with high levels of spearfishing activity. Although the fishery for black perch is not a major one, fishing mortality rates may be very high in some areas. Overall, our results shed light on the ecological forces that shape demographic variation of this species, and suggest that fishing mortality may have a major influence on the dynamics of perch populations.","[Johnson, Darren W.; Stirling, Brian S.; Paz, Janelle; Satterfield, Darien R.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA","Johnson, DW (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",Darren.Johnson@csulb.edu,,,"CSULB marine lab; California State University Council on Ocean Affairs, Science and Technology [COAST-GDP-2017-004]; Department of Biological Sciences at California State University, Long Beach; College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at California State University, Long Beach; Office of Research and Sponsored Programs at California State University, Long Beach","We acknowledge the support of the CSULB marine lab and we are especially grateful to Yvette Ralph and Brian Cohn help with field collections.

The intermediate response was characterized by a strong increase in both Daphnia biovolume and size, and an increase in the abundance of the invertebrate predator Chaoborus flavicans. After 12 years, the larger and darker C. obscuripes, typical of fishless lakes, successfully colonized and displaced the smaller species C. flavicans within three years. Subsequently in 1995, zooplankton biovolume and size decreased dramatically, caused by heavy predation of C. obscuripes on all zooplankton from small rotifers to large daphnids. Zooplankton biovolume was substantially lower than in an adjacent reference lake dominated by planktivorous fish. In the reference lake also most of the crustaceans were eliminated but a high biovolume of rotifers remained. Phytoplankton biovolume was considerably higher in the experimental lake than in the reference lake, although no evident differences in primary production and Secchi could be detected between the two lakes. We clearly showed that the total absence of planktivorous fish can lead to worse water quality (in terms of phytoplankton biovolume) than a very high biovolume of planktivorous fish.","Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrobiol, D-01217 Dresden, Germany","Wissel, B (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",,,,,,,63,51,56,0,14,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

Both resource competition and predation have been suggested as mechanisms driving this process(4,5), although the former is better studied than the latter(6,7). Here we show experimentally how predation by a protist, Tetrahymena thermophila, affects diversification in a model adaptive radiation of the bacterial prey, Pseudomonas fluorescens. We estimate the frequency-dependent fitness functions of competing niche-specialist prey in the presence and absence of predation, and use these to test hypotheses about the extent ( measured as the number of new genotypes) and rate of diversification. Competition and predation independently generated diversifying selection that we show is capable of driving prey diversification to similar extents but at different rates, diversification being markedly delayed in the presence of predators. The cause of this delay stems from weaker diversifying selection due to the reduction in prey density caused by predation. Our results suggest that predation may play an under-appreciated role in driving adaptive radiations.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; Univ Ottawa, Ctr Adv Res Environm Genom, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Meyer, JR (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",justin.raymond.meyer@gmail.com,,,,,,30,138,139,2,96,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,MAR 22,2007,446,7134,,,,,432,435,,10.1038/nature05599,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148MO,WOS:000245079500038,17377581,,,,2021-09-27,

Their inter-specific interactions can further complicate effects on community dynamics as a consequence of infra-guild competition. The capacity for competitive mammalian carnivores to segregate their hunting and activity regimes is in major part a function of their similarity, in terms of body-size and dietary niche; termed the 'niche variation hypothesis'. In this study, we used camera-trapping to investigate infra-guild interactions and spatio-temporal partitioning among five mesocarnivores, the golden jackal (Canis aureus), European badger (Metes meles), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European wildcat (Felis sylvestris) and stone marten (Martes foina), in the Stara Planina Mountains, Bulgaria. We collected a total of 444 images of golden jackals, 236 images of European badgers, 200 images of red foxes, 171 images of stone martens, and 145 images of European wildcats, from 6612 camera-days across fifteen camera-trapping stations. With respect to body size, the three smaller species (fox, wildcat and marten) were active in different time periods than the two larger competitors (jackal and badger) through both the warm and cold season. The more similar the trophic niche between species pairs (particularly relating to rodent consumption), the greater the spatio-temporal partitioning we observed within the pair; however, this adapted to seasonal dietary shifts. In conclusion, spatial and temporal (fine-scale and seasonal) niche partitioning appeared to reduce encounter probabilities and competition and may act to facilitate sympatric coexistence among this regional mesocarnivore guild.","[Tsunoda, Hiroshi] Ctr Environm Sci Saitama, 914 Kamitanadare, Kazo, Saitama 3470115, Japan; [Newman, Chris; Buesching, Christina D.] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Peeva, Stanislava; Raichev, Evgeniy] Trakia Univ, Fac Agr, Students Campus, Stara Zagora 6000, Bulgaria; [Kaneko, Yayoi] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, 3-5-8 Saiwaicho, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan","Tsunoda, H (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Sci Saitama, 914 Kamitanadare, Kazo, Saitama 3470115, Japan.",tsunoda.hiroshi@gmail.com; chris.newman@zoo.ox.ac.uk; st.peeva@abv.bg; eraichev@uni-sz.bg; christina.buesching@zoo.ox.ac.uk; ykaneko@cc.tuat.ac.jp,"Tsunoda, Hiroshi/L-2974-2019; Kaneko, Yayoi/G-1162-2013","Tsunoda, Hiroshi/0000-0001-6214-5625; Kaneko, Yayoi/0000-0002-3688-4309","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP26257404]; Trakia University; Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology",We thank to Kairi Ito for his cooperation for field sampling.

For many animals, optimal habitats differ across age or size classes, and individuals shift habitat use through ontogeny. Although many studies document ontogenetic habitat shifts for various taxa, most are observational and do not identify the causal factor of size-specific habitat variation. Field observations of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) show that juveniles perch on shorter and thinner vegetation than adults. We hypothesized that this variation is due to adult males forcing smaller juveniles to less preferred habitat. To test this assertion, we manipulated adult male densities in mesh enclosures with artificial trees to examine the response of juvenile microhabitat choice. We found that adult male density had strong effects on juvenile perch height, perch width, and substrate use, suggesting that age-class competition contributes to the observed ontogenetic differences in habitat choice. We also found that time of day significantly affected juvenile perch height and substrate use. In many cases, our results suggest that juveniles distance themselves from adults using different microhabitats from those used in our control no-adult' treatment. However, these findings were often body size dependent and varied depending upon time of day. This study highlights the complexity of juvenile perching behavior and demonstrates the role of intraspecific interactions in shaping habitat use by juvenile animals.","[Delaney, David M.; Warner, Daniel A.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Delaney, David M.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Warner, Daniel A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Delaney, DM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dmdelane@iastate.edu,"Delaney, David/J-4135-2019","Delaney, David/0000-0002-7010-840X; Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785",,,,79,12,12,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,FEB,2017,123,2,,,,,157,167,,10.1111/eth.12586,,,11,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,EJ4JL,WOS:000393182800007,,,,,2021-09-27,

In all cases these prescriptions were compared to intensive crop management. The plant community regenerating from the seed bank was species-poor, highly dynamic and had a high proportion of undesirable crop weeds. Sowing a low-cost, simple mix of tall grasses resulted in a stable community dominated by competitive grasses. Creation of these habitats resulted in negligible shifts in the functional composition of the associated invertebrate community. Sowing a diverse mix of wildflowers resulted in a stable, perennial vegetation community with both legumes and regulating hemi-parasitic plants that supported significantly more pollinator and herbivore species, as well as higher abundances of beneficial arthropod predators. There were no measured synergies when a mix of tall grass and wildflower habitats were created adjacent to each other on the same margin.

Fish and ducks often belong to the same local food web, and several studies indicate that there is a general negative effect of fish on breeding ducks. This pattern has so far been addressed mainly within the framework of competition for common invertebrate prey, while predation by large fish as a force behind settlement and abundance patterns in ducks remains largely unknown. This is the first study to address the effect of fish predation on breeding ducks, isolated from that of competition, and the first experiment to explore the ability of ducks to identify and avoid lakes with high risk of fish predation. 2. We used a before-after control-impact design and 11 naturally fishless lakes. Waterfowl on the lakes were surveyed during the breeding season of 2005. Large adult pike (Esox lucius) were added to two lakes in early spring 2008, and waterfowl surveys were repeated on all 11 lakes. 3. Pike introduction did not affect the number of pairs on lakes during the nesting season in any of three focal duck species (mallard Anas platyrhynchos, teal Anas crecca, and goldeneye Bucephala clangula). During the brood-rearing season, however, there was a decrease in duck days in teal and goldeneye in lakes with pike, with similar trends observed in mallard. The number of goldeneye ducklings was also significantly lower in lakes with pike. We were unable to determine whether the response was attributable to direct pike predation or to broods leaving experimental lakes, but in either case, our study demonstrates high fitness costs for ducks breeding on lakes with pike. 4. The apparent inability of nesting ducks to detect pike and the clear fitness implications may influence the annual recruitment of ducks on a larger scale as pike are both common and widespread. Vegetation complexity and food abundance are likely to be of overriding importance when breeding ducks are choosing a nesting site. As pike have a strong influence on breeding birds, relying on vegetation and cues of food abundance, while ignoring indicators of predation risk from fish, could lead to lakes with pike acting as an ecological trap.","[Dessborn, Lisa; Elmberg, Johan] Kristianstad Univ, SE-29188 Kristianstad, Sweden; [Dessborn, Lisa] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Englund, Goran] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden","Dessborn, L (corresponding author), Kristianstad Univ, SE-29188 Kristianstad, Sweden.",lisa.dessborn@hkr.se,"Elmberg, Johan/H-1868-2014","Englund, Goran/0000-0001-5634-8602","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency [V-162-05, V-98-04]; Swedish Research Council for Environment and Agricultural SciencesSwedish Research Council Formas; Spatial Planning","We sincerely thank Per Wedholm, Stina Gustavsson, Fredrik Engdahl, Christer Olsson, Christian Otto, and Daniel Lussetti for skilful field work.

Restoration of a tributary stream to Utah Lake was undertaken in 2008 with the intent of increasing available spawning and nursery habitat for the endangered June Sucker Chasmistes liorus. Restoration efforts provided an opportunity to evaluate relationships between fish assemblages and variables related to the physiochemical environment, vegetation, and habitat connectivity at floodplain ponds. Fish were collected with beach seines and habitat variables were measured each month at 12 floodplain ponds during March 2010 to March 2011. Total catch was predominated by nonnative species: Green Sunfish Lepomis cyanellus, Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, Black Bullhead Ameiurus melas, Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas, and Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus. Both indirect and direct gradient analyses indicated a significant correlation between fish assemblages and site connectivity. The percentage and type of macrophyte cover (e.g., emergent, submergent) also played a significant role in structuring fish assemblages. Species richness was generally higher at sites with intermediate to high connectivity than at sites with lower connectivity. Sites with lower connectivity were predominated by Green Sunfish, Mosquitofish, and Fathead Minnow. June Suckers were collected from sites with intermediate values of connectivity and vegetation. Observed patterns suggested connectivity structured initial fish assemblages and macrophyte colonization dynamics; subsequent interactions between local habitat (i.e., percent vegetation) and biotic factors (e.g., competition, predation, etc.) provided site-specific interactions and structure. The results of this study indicate connectivity dynamics should be an important consideration in stream and floodplain restoration efforts.","[Landress, Chad M.] Utah Div Wildlife Resources, 1115 North Main St, Springville, UT 84663 USA; [Landress, Chad M.] US Forest Serv, Monongahela Natl Forest, POB 67, Bartow, WV 24920 USA","Landress, CM (corresponding author), Utah Div Wildlife Resources, 1115 North Main St, Springville, UT 84663 USA.; Landress, CM (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Monongahela Natl Forest, POB 67, Bartow, WV 24920 USA.",chadmlandress@fs.fed.us,,,June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program,"I am grateful for the extensive field assistance of David Tinsley, Mark Grover, and Jackie Watson.

Cues from aggressive competitors should be particularly likely to evoke behavioral and/or physiological responses, since they may be indicative of both direct (interference) and indirect (exploitative) threats. The danger posed by such competitors, and the fear they evoke, should be reduced at lower competitor densities and by the presence of individual conspecifics specialized for defense. We assessed how Reticulitermes flavipes termite workers and soldiers were affected by cues from conspecific nestmates, conspecific non-nestmates, and the heterospecific competitor R. virginicus. Competitor cues altered flavipes worker and soldier behavior, decreasing worker growth and increasing their mortality. The presence of flavipes soldiers largely ameliorated these negative impacts: adding even a single soldier (5% of flavipes individuals) decreased worker mortality by 50-80%. Although worker mortality increased with competitor density, increased soldier densities did not increase the benefit to workers. The small number of soldiers required to substantially alter cue-mediated interactions suggests that this caste, in addition to providing direct defense, also occupies a keystone role by providing homeostatic feedback to workers functioning in stressful environments.","[Tian, Li; Haynes, Kenneth F.; Zhou, Xuguo] Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Preisser, Evan L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Zhou, XG (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",xuguozhou@uky.edu,,,Vice President Research Grant [1012579960]; Hatch fund from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1004654]; project of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station [17-08-001],"The comments of M.

In this study, we experimentally monitored the temporal dynamic of the predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, and its prey, the bacterium Burkholderia stabilis in a structured habitat consisting of sand under various regimes of wetness. We constructed a dynamic model, and estimated its parameters by further developing the direct integral method, a novel estimation procedure that exploits the separability of the states and parameters in the model. We also verified that one of our parameter estimates was consistent with its known, directly measured value from the literature. The ability of the model to fit the data combined with realistic parameter estimates indicate that bacterial predation in the sand can be described by a relatively simple model, and stress the importance of prey refuge on predation dynamics in heterogeneous environments.","[Dattner, Itai] Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, 199 Abba Khoushy Ave, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel; [Miller, Ezer; Huppert, Amit] Chaim Sheba Med Ctr, Biostat Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Petrenko, Margarita; Jurkevitch, Edouard] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Dept Agroecol & Plant Hlth, Jerusalem, Israel; [Kadouri, Daniel E.] Rutgers Sch Dent Med, Dept Oral Biol, Newark, NJ USA; [Huppert, Amit] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Dattner, I (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, 199 Abba Khoushy Ave, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel.",idattner@stat.haifa.ac.il,,"Dattner, Itai/0000-0001-5316-8964","U.S. Army Research Office; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [W911NF-15-2-0036]; Israeli Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1583/12, 387/15]; GIF, German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and DevelopmentGerman-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development [I-2390-304.6/2015]","This research was sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Office and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-15-2-0036.

There is growing evidence that granivorous ants compete for seeds in desert ecosystems. But ants that diverge in diet may still interact strongly if existing colonies deter foundress queens. Granivores (seed eaters) and omnivores (ants that scavenge and feed on.plant exudates) are common components of desert ecosystems. 2. The results of a 15-year granivore reduction experiment to explore the responses of two common omnivorous ants, Forelius cf pruinosus and Dorymyrmex insana, in a desert grassland were analysed. The food competition hypothesis predicts that granivore removal will have no net effect on omnivores. The spatial competition hypothesis predicts compensatory increases in omnivores on granivore removal plots. 3. A grain-based gut poison significantly reduced the densities of three of the four common granivorous ants. Densities of the large-colony (10(5)-worker) omnivore Forelius did not increase with granivore removal. In contrast, and consistent with the hypothesis of competition for space, densities of the small-colony omnivore (10(2)-10(3) worker) Dorymyrmex increased on granivore removal plots; however, this effect was only observed in years of high Dorymyrmex abundance.","St Louis Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63103 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Valone, TJ (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, Dept Biol, 3507 Laclede Ave, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",Valone@slu.edu,,"Kaspari, Michael/0000-0002-9717-5768; Valone, Thomas/0000-0002-7657-3126",,,,33,14,14,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

To identify the biological cause of density dependence, we manipulated both population density and the availability of shelter (crevices used as refuges from predators) in small plots of continuous reef. We detected strong density-dependent mortality in plots with few refuges, but mortality was density independent in plots with abundant refuges, indicating that limited shelter causes density dependence. Predator density was unrelated to the density of gobies and refuges, suggesting that predators displayed a type III functional response in patches with few refuges. In a second experiment, we manipulated goby density within replicate plots of three sizes (4, 16, and 64 m(2)) that varied naturally in the availability of refuges. If refuge availability was ignored, mortality appeared to be density independent at all scales. If, however, plots were grouped by refuge availability, mortality was density dependent in plots with few refuges, but low and density independent in plots with many refuges at all spatial scales. Understanding the mechanism of density dependence (refuge shortage) was thus required to measure the strength of density dependence in natural, spatially variable, habitat. We suggest that density dependence was detectable in plots of different sizes because the relationships between the densities of gobies, refuges, and goby predators were similar across the spatial scales we studied. Our work demonstrates that identifying the biological interactions that cause density dependence, and characterizing the spatial domains at which those interactions operate, will be important to accurately assess the effects of density dependence on population dynamics.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Forrester, GE (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",gforrester@uri.edu,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X",,,,64,109,110,0,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2004,85,5,,,,,1332,1342,,10.1890/03-0184,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,821BC,WOS:000221433300016,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2021-09-27,

In addition, the effects of varying aphid prey density were considered and also whether any resulting response originated from differential nutritional status of females and/ or due to aphid odour stimuli. The existence of oviposition responses to conspecific egg chemicals was also considered. Gravid A. obliterata females were deterred from oviposition by conspecific larval tracks and the effect was density dependent. Females actively avoidedsearching in these contaminated areas. Tracks induced a significant effect onoviposition for up to three days. Heterospecific tracks of the coccinellid Adalia bipunctata ( Fabricius) or the chrysopid Chrysoperla carnea ( Stephens) did not induce any oviposition response in A. obliterata females. Increasing aphid density induced increased oviposition rate in A. obliterata females. Nutritional status of females was an important factor in the relationship between aphid density and oviposition rate, but aphid associated cues ( odours) were not. There was an inhibitory effect of extracts of conspecific egg-surface chemicals on oviposition by A. obliterata females. In the field, cannibalism, competition and limited food availability represent the major threats to egg and larval survival. Patch quality assessment mechanisms enable females to lay eggs at sites where offspring survival is maximized. Oviposition-deterring semiochemicals tend to promote more even distribution of predators over prey patches.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci & Technol, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Leather, SR (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci & Technol, Div Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",s.leather@ic.ac.uk,"Oliver, Tom/K-2670-2012; Leather, Simon R/H-7921-2019","Leather, Simon R/0000-0003-3007-8514; Oliver, Tom/0000-0002-4169-7313",,,,44,30,34,1,20,CABI PUBLISHING,WALLINGFORD,"C/O PUBLISHING DIVISION, NOSWORTHY WAY, WALLINGFORD OX10 8DE, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4853,,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

Mosses in streams attach primarily to stable substrata subject to low hydrological perturbation, serving as shelter and as substratum for epiphytic algae, which are a food source for many grazing macro-invertebrates. 2. Given the changes in the hydrodynamic conditions occurring at substrata surfaces and the increasing habitat complexity, predator-prey interactions may be altered in streams dominated by moss, compared with those dominated by diatom-covered rocks. However, little is known about the relative effects of the food and refuge functions of moss and how they influence grazers in streams. 3. Results from a field survey indicated that streams with greater moss cover supported higher densities of less mobile, armoured, predator-resistant but disturbance-vulnerable caddisfly grazers than streams where moss was rare. However, the abundance of more mobile, disturbance-resistant but predator-vulnerable mayfly grazers was unrelated to the extent of moss cover. 4. To distinguish potential mechanisms explaining those observed relationships, we performed a microcosm experiment comparing the responses of two grazer species, one caddisfly (Allomyia gnathos) and one mayfly (Baetis bicaudatus), to variation in substrata and risk of predation. We estimated grazer growth rates, algal accrual rates and the per capita effect of grazers on algal biomass in circular flow-through chambers that differed in substratum (artificial moss-covered tiles versus diatom-covered tiles) and predation risk (non-feeding predatory stoneflies present versus absent). 5. Results showed that, although artificial moss-covered tiles provided more food (epiphytic algae biomass - chl-a), only the mayflies grew faster with higher food resources available on the artificial moss compared with those feeding on diatom-covered tiles. Furthermore, algal resource depression was greater on diatom-covered tiles, which suggests that diatoms on bare tiles were more vulnerable to grazing than epiphytes on artificial moss. 6. Although non-feeding predators did not affect the biomass of either grazer species, algal accrual rates were higher in chambers where mayflies were exposed to predation risk, which is consistent with a behavioural trophic cascade. Mayflies also had a higher per capita impact on algal biomass in the absence of predatory stoneflies. 7. We conclude that armoured, less mobile and disturbance-vulnerable caddisfly grazers primarily colonise mossy substrata for protection, because we found no evidence that they benefit from the higher epiphytic food supply on moss. However, although disturbance-resistant mayflies can exploit increased food resources provided by moss, in nature they do not aggregate on mossy substrata in preference to diatom-covered mineral substrata. 8. Therefore, classical trade-offs between food acquisition and safety do not explain the observed distributions of caddisflies, which prefer habitats that both are safe and have the best food resources, nor of mayflies, which prefer neither the safest nor the most resource-rich habitats. These results demonstrate that mayflies and caddisflies have evolved different solutions to the problems of foraging under risks of predation and disturbance.","[Alvarez, Maruxa] Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Alvarez, Maruxa; Peckarsky, Barbara L.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO USA; [Peckarsky, Barbara L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool & Entomol, Madison, WI USA","Alvarez, M (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain.",maruxa@uvigo.es,"Alvarez, Maruxa/K-5925-2014","Alvarez, Maruxa/0000-0001-7486-3704",University of Vigo; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 96-29404],"This study was conducted in memory of Stanley Dodson, who inspired us to embrace counterintuitive results that do not agree with accepted dogma and encouraged us to create new dogma.

In a laboratory experiment, I raised larvae at a low density, low food level; high density, low food level; and high density high food level. An increased density of larvae fed low food levels significantly decreased mean body size yet increased the size ratio of the largest:smallest larva (a factor that may promote cannibalism), nigh density also significantly decreased production of metamorphs, although time to metamorphosis did not differ among the three treatments. Food supplementation did not ameliorate the effects of increased density on these variables. Survival was significantly reduced due to an increase in the proportion of larvae cannibalized at the high density. Food supplementation reduced the incidence of cannibalism and improved survival, although it was inadequate to enhance growth significantly. Behavioral trials revealed no difference in aggression across the three treatments, suggesting that it was not a major factor in the observed responses. Rather, density-dependent survival was more a consequence of cannibalism resulting from food limitation. These results provide experimental evidence that, for this species, food limitation may be of greater importance than interference as a mechanism of density dependence.","CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA","Walls, SC (corresponding author), Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5018, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.",,,"Walls, Susan/0000-0001-7391-9155",,,,43,33,36,0,10,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS,CHARLESTON,"UNIV CHARLESTON, GRICE MARINE LABORATORY, 205 FORT JOHNSON RD, CHARLESTON, SC 29412 USA",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,DEC 30,1998,,4,,,,,926,935,,10.2307/1447339,,,10,Zoology,Zoology,184VL,WOS:000079634400010,,,,,2021-09-27,

We compared visit rates of two pollinator species, hoverflies and honeybees, to 40 Chrysanthemum segetum patches in which we manipulated predation risk (patches with and without crab spiders) and nectar availability (rich and poor patches) using a full factorial design. Pollinators responded differently to the tradeoff between maximising intake rate and minimising predation risk: honeybees preferred rich safe patches and avoided poor risky patches while the number of hoverflies was highest at poor risky patches. Because honeybees were more susceptible to predation than hoverflies, our results suggest that, in the presence of competition for resources, less susceptible pollinators concentrate their foraging effort on riskier resources, where competition is less severe. Crab spiders had a negative effect on the rate at which inflorescences were visited by honeybees. This effect was mediated through changes in the foraging strategy of honeybees, and could, in principle, be reversed by increasing nectar productivity of inflorescences. Our study shows that both pollinator species responded simultaneously and differently to variations in food reward and predation risk, and highlights the importance of studying the foraging strategies of pollinators in order to fully understand how plantpollinator interactions are established.","[Llandres, Ana L.; De Mas, Eva; Rodriguez-Girones, Miguel A.] Estn Expt Zonas Aridas CSIC, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, ES-04120 La Canada De San Urbano, Almeria, Spain","Llandres, AL (corresponding author), Estn Expt Zonas Aridas CSIC, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Carretera Sacramento S-N, ES-04120 La Canada De San Urbano, Almeria, Spain.",anallandres@gmail.com,"Rodriguez-Girones, Miguel A/H-1859-2015; De Mas, Eva/H-9172-2015","Rodriguez-Girones, Miguel A/0000-0002-5619-9819; De Mas, Eva/0000-0001-8225-5805","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion/FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2007-63223/BOS, CLG2010-16795/BOS]; CSIC [PIE 2006 3 OI 073, I3P-BPD2005]","We thank Tina Calero, J.

We tested the influence of female moult stage, sex ratio and male size on the pre-mating behaviour of both sexes, and the ability of males to pair with females and aggressively compete for access to females. We observed crabs in field enclosures and surveyed pre-copulatory mate-guarding patterns in the field. Female behaviour changed as they progressed through the final moult cycle, such that early moult-stage females avoided males, but late moult-stage females initiated pair formation. The changes in female behaviour influenced both the behaviour and pairing capability of males. Males courted and paired with late moult-stage females on their first attempt, but pursued early moult-stage females because their first attempts to pair often failed. In the field, early moult-stage females were paired less often than late moult-stage females. The pre-mating behaviour of both sexes also varied with sex ratio; when males were abundant, males traded courtship for forced capture and females courted less. Large males were more successful at take-overs, but did not pair more often with late moult-stage females, suggesting that large males do not consistently guard for less time than small males. The changes in female behaviour are consistent with the female's need to avoid the costs of guarding and suggest that females influence how pre-copulatory mate guarding occurs in this species.

Species interactions frequently are cited anecdotally for establishment failure, but biotic resistance is not well supported by quantitative experimental studies in animal communities. In a 33-month experiment on Hawaii Island, exclusion of native and alien forest birds resulted in a 25- to 80-fold increase in the density of a single non-indigenous spider species (Theridiidae: Achaearanea cf. riparia). Caged plots held large aggregations of juveniles and more large-bodied individuals, suggesting potential reproductive individuals are more susceptible to bird predation.

Here we summarize some of the most important findings and discuss needs and opportunities for future work. Disproportionately large numbers of the most influential contributions are derived from studies of rocky shores and coral reefs because aspects of these Systems (accessibility) and of their most common species (sessile or weakly motile, high density, short generation time) make them well suited to manipulative experiments. Foremost among the research contributions from seashore and seafloor systems are increased understanding of (1) competition and consumer-prey interactions, (2) trophic cascades and other indirect species interactions, (3) the evolution of defense and resistance in consumer-prey systems, (4) the importance of propagule transport and recruitment variation to adult populations, (5) the impacts of physical disturbance, and (6) the generation and maintenance of species diversity on ecological time scales. We acknowledge the importance of manipulative experiments in the growth of marine ecology, but question whether a strict adherence to this approach will best serve future needs. Some of the most pressing needs for future knowledge are: (1) documenting the complex influences of spatial and temporal scales on ecological processes, (2) identifying the role of large, mobile predators in marine ecosystems, (3) understanding factors limiting marine autotrophs, (4) integrating historical biology and neontology, and (5) appreciating intersystem linkages. Increased attention to conducting arrays of experiments, taking measurements and observations, and documenting change at larger scales of space and time will provide insights that are unattainable by the commonly used methodological protocols. Novel approaches, including (1) evaluating and managing human disturbance for the joint purpose of conservation and learning, (2) developing stronger ties between scientists working in open-ocean and near-shore systems, and (3) developing collaborative projects among scientists in the academic, governmental, and private sectors are required to understand many of these processes.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Estes, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, A-316 Earth & Marine Sci Bldg, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jestes@cats.ucsc.edu,,,,,,103,29,30,0,21,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Most Agelenopsis aperta populations experience low prey abundances and competition for web-sites that provide shelter from thermal extremes. These conditions favour aggressiveness towards both prey and conspecifics (an 'arid-land behavioural phenotype'). The spider also occupies narrow stretches of riparian habitat bordering spring-fed streams and rivers. Here it is released from competition for prey and foraging sites, but is subject to predation by birds. A less aggressive/more fearful behaviour is selected for in these riparian habitats (a 'riparian behavioural phenotype'). Previous work with this spider indicates that there is genetic differentiation between arid-land and riparian populations. However, the degree to which genetic differentiation is achieved may be limited by gene flow. Reciprocal sets of enclosures were established in: (1) a dry evergreen woodland site (arid-land phenotype) and (2) a neighbouring riparian site (riparian phenotype) in south-eastern Arizona. Equal numbers of field collected, early instar A. aperta were introduced into native and transplant enclosures in each habitat. After 6 months of site-imposed selection, survivorship was determined and growth estimates and behavioural trials completed on spiders remaining in the different enclosures. The same behavioural test was subsequently applied to lab-reared offspring of the spiders surviving the respective selection regimes. Riparian transplants showed both poor survival and retarded growth in the dry woodland habitat when compared with both arid-land and riparian natives. Arid-land transplants that survived, however, grew equally well in riparian habitat as did dry woodland and riparian natives. Behavioural assays conducted on test subjects after selection and on their offspring reared in a controlled laboratory environment indicate that phenotypes that were inappropriate to the respective habitats were selected against in the transplant experiments. The frequency distribution of transplant spider behaviour on a continuum from fearful to aggressive was intermediate between that exhibited by respective native riparian and dry woodland spiders. It is concluded that while arid-land and riparian behavioural ecotypes do exist, directional gene flow of arid-land phenotypes into riparian habitat limits population subdivision.","Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; Amer Museum Nat Hist, SW Res Stn, New York, NY 10024 USA","Riechert, SE (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",sriecher@utk.edu,,,,,,41,46,48,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

Sustainable strategies to manage grasshopper populations through habitat management require knowledge of the forces that regulate grasshopper populations. This experiment was undertaken to determine whether populations of Melanoplus borealis (Fieber), a common pest species in Alaska, are food-limited in Alaska. Cages were set up in a fallow field near Delta Junction, AK, in 3 yr (2007-2009). In 2007 and 2008, fertilizer was added to half the plots to increase primary production, and, in all years, cages within each plot were stocked with 0, 5, 9, or 13 fourth-instar M. borealis ( equivalent to 0, 20, 36, or 52 grasshoppers/m(2)). Grasshoppers in each cage were counted weekly. Near the end of the growing season, surviving female grasshoppers (approximate to 40% of the original number) were collected. Femur length was taken as a measure of adult size, and functional ovarioles were counted as a measure of current fecundity. If the grasshoppers were food limited, we expected to see significant effects of either density or fertilizer on grasshopper survival, size, or fecundity. The fertilizer treatment greatly increased primary production in both years. Neither fertilizer treatment nor grasshopper density had consistent effects on survival, size, or potential fecundity, leading us to conclude that food is seldom limiting to populations in the interior of Alaska at densities <50 m(-2).","[Fielding, Dennis J.] USDA ARS, Subarctic Agr Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Zhang, Mingchu] Univ Alaska, Sch Nat Resources & Agr Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA","Fielding, DJ (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Subarctic Agr Res Unit, POB 757200, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",dennis.felding@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,42,11,11,0,7,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"10001 DEREKWOOD LANE, STE 100, LANHAM, MD 20706-4876 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

The increased number of weed species present could at least partly explain the rise. Negative effects of the conversion were observed for several staphylinid species, among them Philonthus cognatus and Tachyporus species, and the carabid Trechus quadristriatus. It is hypothesized that the reduction in staphylinids could partly be due to competition from the rising numbers of carabids.","Norwegian Crop Res Inst, Plant Protect Ctr, Dept Entomol & Nematol, N-1432 As, Norway; Apelsvoll Res Ctr, Norwegian Crop Res Inst, N-2858 Kapp, Norway","Andersen, A (corresponding author), Norwegian Crop Res Inst, Plant Protect Ctr, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Fellesbygget, N-1432 As, Norway.",,,,,,,28,55,62,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-2048,1439-0418,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

Aside from the unequal sample sizes involved with using this abundance-limited method, confounding factors potentially associated with levels of social interactions may also be introduced. The alternative, volume-limited method, i.e., varying the volume while maintaining equal numbers of animals, can provide a test for the presence of potentially confounding factors. Using tadpoles of Fowler's Toad, Anaxyrus fowleri, we examined the effect of density on growth rate, timing of metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis in both abundance-limited and volume-limited experiments. We found no difference in tadpole growth rate or timing of metamorphosis between these two methods, but the metamorphs emerging from abundance-limited low density treatments were significantly smaller when compared to those in volume-limited low density treatments. Because toad tadpoles may naturally form social aggregations and schools, this suggests that the actual number of animals present may be important for normal social behavior and optimizing feeding rate. If volume-limited and abundance-limited methods of manipulating density are not equivalent, treatment method may itself be a factor that can differentially affect growth variables.","[Yagi, Katharine T.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21111 Lakeshore Rd,Ste Anne Bellevue, Quebec City, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Yagi, Katharine T.; Green, David M.] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada","Green, DM (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada.",katharine.yagi@mail.mcgill.ca; david.m.green@mcgill.ca,,,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF); Wildlife Preservation Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Financial support for this research came from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF), Wildlife Preservation Canada, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grants to DMG).

The configuration of protected areas can significantly impact the richness and identity of the species found there; one large patch supports larger populations but can facilitate competitive exclusion. Conversely, many small habitats spreads risk but may exclude predators that typically require large home ranges. Identifying how best to design protected areas is further complicated by monitoring programs failing to detect species. Here we test the consequences of different protected area configurations using multi-trophic level experimental microcosms. We demonstrate that for a given total size, many small patches generate higher species richness, are more likely to contain predators, and have fewer extinctions compared to single large patches. However, the relationship between the size and number of patches and species richness was greatly affected by insufficient monitoring, and could lead to incorrect conservation decisions, especially for higher trophic levels.","[Hammill, Edd] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hammill, Edd] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Clements, Christopher F.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England","Hammill, E (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.; Hammill, E (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",edd.hammill@usu.edu,"; Hammill, Edd/F-9030-2013","Clements, Christopher/0000-0001-5677-5401; Hammill, Edd/0000-0001-8247-6106",USU Ecology center,The authors thank the USU Ecology center for providing financial assistance to purchase the custom microcosms.

White Perch size structure was closely tied to abundance, with truncated size structure as abundance increased. Among the other variables we tested, only Largemouth Bass abundance had a significant (negative) relationship with White Perch abundance. White Perch size structure appeared to be highly density dependent, and variables that commonly explain variation in abundance of introduced fishes did not explain differences in the four White Perch populations we studied.

These impacts occur mainly through two pathways. First, by the modification or removal of habitat which influences food supply, cover and the balance of competition between the species. Secondly, through direct competition for resources, particularly food supplies. Losses of woodland ground vegetation may provoke major changes in small mammal community structure which, in the extreme, may decrease from five to eight species, or more, to just wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Reduction of understorey species such as hazel (Corylus avellana) or loss of shrub diversity, would be expected to lead to declines in yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and common dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius). Reduction of early succession mixed scrub and grassland may reduce colonization by shrews, harvest mice (Micromys minutus) and field voles (Microtus agrestis), although in woodland rides, field voles may benefit from preferential grazing of grasses by deer. Impacts on regeneration which may delay or inhibit canopy/understorey closure may encourage the ground and shrub vegetation and so favour species with a preference for ground cover such as the bank vole (Cletbrionomys glareolus). Reductions in the availability of foods (e.g. mast crops) may reduce the potential for high population densities, particularly of bank voles, wood mice and yellow-necked mice, decrease the lengths of breeding seasons, and further affect community structure. If rodent densities are lowered, avian and terrestrial predators are likely to suffer reduced breeding success and tawny owls (Strix aluco) may prey more heavily on bank voles if their favoured ground cover is reduced. Studies at Wytham Woods, near Oxford, from 1949 to 1999, indicate that a significant reduction in bank vole, but not wood mouse, numbers has occurred; this is suggested to be the result of observed changes in the woodland vegetation, including a significant reduction in the ground cover of bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.).

Interspecific competition among specialised co-occurring predators capturing termites should be high. Here we investigated various niche dimensions, namely temporal, spatial and trophic, of a couple of jumping spider species of the genusStenaelurillus(Stenaelurillus guttigerandS. modestus) from South Africa, to find whether these two species co-exist and along which niche dimension(s) they differentiate. The two species co-occurred in two out of five study sites. Body size was not significantly different between the species. The phenology was shifted so that one species matured earlier. Circadian activity was not different, as both species were diurnal and active at similar times. Both species preyed almost exclusively on termites. The fundamental trophic niche was very similar and rather narrow. The realised trophic niche at the prey order level of both species was similar, but at the genus level it was different. InS. modestusit was narrower, as it captured mainlyOdontotermes, whileS. guttigerexploited a few termite species. The size of prey captured was also similar between the two species. The frequency of intraguild predation was negligible. We conclude that bothStenaelurillusspecies are specialised termitophagous predators. The two species can coexist across broad spatial scales due to spatial segregation on the landscape. At the sites where they co-occur, the two species specialise on different termite prey, promoting local coexistence.","[Pekar, Stano; Petrakova Dusatkova, Lenka; Michalek, Ondrej] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Haddad, Charles R.] Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, Bloemfontein, South Africa","Pekr, S (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic.",pekar@sci.muni.cz,,,Masaryk University [MUNI/A/1078/2017]; National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [112127],"We would like to thank E.

Hypothesis: Following the predictions of optimal diet theory, we hypothesized that seed predators will prefer to prey upon larger seeds, that seed selection should be frequency independent, and that only variation in the absolute density of the preferred seeds will influence predator behaviour by lowering their preference for larger seeds. Organisms: A colony of the desert harvester ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus and a community of heteromyid rodents (Dipodomys merriami and Dipodomys desertii). Site of experiments: Reserva de la Biosfera El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar and Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. Methods: We conducted two preference experiments in which we offered D. californica seeds that varied in size, relative frequency of sizes, and absolute density of seeds to a population of the harvester ant and to the community of heteromyid rodents of the Sonoran Desert. Results: We found that ants had a preference for larger seeds whereas rodents had an equal preference for large and small seeds, despite variation in seed frequency and density. In accordance with optimal diet theory, seed predation was frequency independent. Contrary to our predictions, neither changes in absolute density of larger seeds nor of smaller seeds had a significant influence on predator behaviour. Conclusion: Our results suggest that only Pogonomyrmex rugosus influenced selection on seed size, which it does by preferring larger seeds and counteracting the competitive effect of larger seeds in other life stages. Selection via seed predation conflicts with post-germination selection on seed size, when encountered by ants but not rodents.","[Larios, Eugenio; Burquez, Alberto] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Hermosillo 8300, Sonora, Mexico; [Valenzuela, Gilberto] Univ Estatal Sonora, Escuela Ecol, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico; [Chesson, Peter; Lawrence Venable, D.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA","Larios, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Hermosillo 8300, Sonora, Mexico.",elariosc@iecologia.unam.mx,"Larios, Eugenio/AAO-6169-2020","Larios, Eugenio/0000-0003-4501-4652",Estancias Posdoctorales Nacionales from CONACyT; PAPIIT-DGAPA from UNAM [IN-213814]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1353715],"The authors would like to thank Jonathan Horst for inspiring this experiment.

In the mesocosm experiment, gizzard shad growth and survival were negatively correlated with gizzard shad density and positively correlated with macrozooplankton prey. Bluegill growth was positively correlated with prey availability, but survival was uniformly high despite differences in zooplankton abundance and fish density. Macrozooplankton and copepod biomasses were negatively correlated with fish density. In Lake Shelbyville, co-occurrence of larval gizzard shad and bluegills in the limnetic zone was limited to a 3-week period, and the period of greatest larval gizzard shad abundance preceded the appearance of bluegills. Zooplankton abundance declined greatly after the peak in larval gizzard shad abundance and remained low when bluegills were present. Growth rates of gizzard shad were highest early and declined throughout the summer, whereas bluegill growth was highest during mid to late summer. Growth rates of gizzard shad and bluegills in the field were not correlated with fish density. However, as in the mesocosm experiment, zooplankton biomass was negatively correlated with fish density, bluegill growth was correlated with the abundance of zooplankton prey, and bluegill survival was uniform through time and not related to fish density or zooplankton abundance. Diet overlap was substantial; gizzard shad and bluegills fed selectively on smaller prey items in June, switching to larger cladocerans and copepods by July. Our results suggest that growth and survival of planktivorous larval gizzard shad and growth of larval bluegills are affected by availability of zooplankton prey, which may become limiting when larval fish densities are high.","EASTERN ILLINOIS UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,CHARLESTON,IL 61920; ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY,CTR AQUAT ECOL,KASKASKIA BIOL STN,SULLIVAN,IL 61951",,,,,,,,50,114,120,3,48,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Yet, in apparent defiance of the competitive exclusion principle, large numbers of species form natural communities while sharing a small number of limiting resources. Consumers not only coexist, but also show positive facilitative interactions among themselves. Since body size and functional responses may play important roles in these interactions, we investigate their joint effects on two consumers over a single resource. We find that two consumers with unimodal Type IV functional response can facilitate each other by increasing each other's intake rates. But, this facilitation does not necessarily impact their co-existence. When the consumers differ in their body sizes, the larger consumer receives greater absolute benefits, and the smaller consumer gains more relative benefits. These results are consistent with empirical observations, and do not require any additional assumptions over the parameters governing dynamics of resources to explain net positive interactions between consumers.

Habitat use often changes in the course of the cycle. Higher densities can either lead to spill-over into secondary habitats or to increased habitat specificity because of interspecific competition. Here we investigate whether voles in the shrub tundra of southern Yamal exhibit density dependent habitat use. Voles were trapped at the Erkuta Tundra Monitoring Site (N 68.2 degrees, E 69.2 degrees) in three characteristic habitats over five years covering all phases of the population cycle. Our analyses focused on the two most numerous species Microtus gregalis (52% of individuals caught) and M. middendorffii (36%). A small-scale spill-over effect was observed for M. gregalis, which increasingly used the open habitat adjacent to their preferred willow thickets at high abundance. At a larger scale no such effect was observed for the two Microtus species - a result which is explained by the overall moderate densities of voles and the large spatial extent of the primary habitat of M. middendorffii: moist moss dwarf shrub tundra.

Due in large part to the severity of the physical environment, individual plants and animals are frequently disturbed, turnover in the community is rapid, and experiments can be conducted in months which in other habitats would require years. However, the experimental advantage of rapid turnover must be weighed against our ability to account for its causes. Only if we can predict the rate of turnover can we predict the dynamics of the community. On wave-swept shores where disturbance is dominated by environmental effects, the ultimate ability to predict community structure rests on the the proximal ability to predict the physical environment and to understand its consequences. Some important aspects of the wave-swept environment (such as the tides) are well understood, but the effects of wave-induced hydrodynamic forces, perhaps the predominant environmental stress on shoreline organisms, has been thought to be unpredictable. Indeed, the stochastic nature of ocean waves precludes the short-term prediction of wave forces. However, as with the random motion of molecules in a gas, the short-term unpredictability of the ocean's surface can form the basis for a robust statistical approach to the prediction of long-term events. This study employs the statistics of the random sea to predict the largest wave to which a littoral site will be subjected in a year (approximate to 5.9 times the yearly average significant wave height), and uses hydrodynamic theory to predict the force that this large wave exerts on individual organisms. The result is a quantitative measure of wave exposure, a mechanistic link between local wave climate and species-specific survivorship that can be used as a tool for exploring the relationship between environmental severity and community ecology. The proposed method is tested by predicting the rate at which patches of bare substratum are formed in beds of the mussel Mytilus californianus, a dominant competitor for space on rocky shores in the Pacific Northwest. Predicted rates are very similar to those measured in the field, suggesting that this method can provide useful input into models of intertidal patch dynamics. Data from several sites around the world suggest that the yearly average ''waviness'' of the ocean at any particular site can (over the course of decades) vary by as much as 80% of the long-term mean. The methodology proposed here allows this decade-to-decade variation in wave climate to be translated into the resulting variation in survivorship; predicting, for example, that an increase of 1 m in yearly average significant wave height results in a fourfold increase in the rate of patch formation in a mussel bed. Such a shift would have substantial consequences for community dynamics. M. californianus is unusual in that the expected wave-induced stress is near the species' modal strength, and it will be of interest to determine if this characteristic is common among dominant competitors for space. To ease the application of this method by ecologists, a list of hydrodynamic force coefficients is provided to allow the method to be used with a wide variety of plants and animals, and several sources of information regarding wave heights are suggested. The assumptions, limitations, and procedures for practical application of the approach are discussed. The method described here for wave-swept shores can, in theory, be applied to the mechanistic study of physical stresses in other environments. In many habitats, however, multiple stresses (rather than one dominant stress) have strong effects on community dynamics, rendering prediction difficult. In this regard, the practical advantage of the wave-swept shore, where water velocity is of such overarching importance, is again evident.",,"DENNY, M (corresponding author), STANFORD UNIV, HOPKINS MARINE STN, DEPT BIOL SCI, PACIFIC GROVE, CA 93950 USA.",,,,,,,88,188,190,1,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

We take the case of delayed predator-induced dispersal (PID) in aphids to explore in which way current environmental conditions may be utilized as an appropriate signal for dispersal decisions. In aphids, the presence of predators triggers the production of winged offspring that may later leave the plant and shift their center of activity permanently. Using individual-based simulations as well as analytical approximations, we explore under which conditions PID is likely to evolve. We demonstrate that this requires substantial temporal correlation in predation risk and weak competition among prey; these conditions may be fulfilled in the aphid system. We discuss the analogy between the specific case of PID and the evolution of conditional emigration in the face of spatiotemporally correlated deterioration in reproduction or survival.","[Poethke, Hans Joachim; Hovestadt, Thomas] Univ Wurzburg, Field Stn Fabrikschleichach, D-96181 Rauhenebrach, Germany; [Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Hovestadt, Thomas] Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR 7179, F-91800 Brunoy, France","Poethke, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Field Stn Fabrikschleichach, Glashuttenstr 5, D-96181 Rauhenebrach, Germany.",poethke@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014","Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Hovestadt, Thomas/0000-0001-7368-6013","German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 554 Tp06, DFG PO 244/3-2]",We thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this article.

Low bicarbonate buffering capacity resulted in a distinctive seasonal oscillating pH between 5.0 and 5.6, defining a special acid-transition lake category. The pH values were highest in the productive period during summer, and lowest during ice break-up coinciding with the peak reactive aluminium concentrations of 250-300 mu g L-1. As in typical Norwegian boreal perch lakes, the most abundant cladoceran was Bosmina longispina due to perch predation on the genus Daphnia. Rotifer community structure was significantly related to temperature and oxygen (P=0.001 and P=0.022), illustrating the important effects of the seasonal cycle and vertical density stratification. The most significant competition indicator species were B, longispina and Eudiapiomus gracilis (both with P=0.001). A variance partitioning indicated that 14% of the total community composition variance could only he explained by biotic interactions, while 19% of the variance could be attributed to environmental gradients. Of the variance, 23% could not be resolved between biotic interactions and environmental gradients, while a residual of 44% was not explainable by any of the variables. Acid conditions alone cannot account for all the observed changes in the rotifer community of this lake with low humic content, since resource limitation and food competition are also important factors shaping rotifer population dynamics and the community structure.","[Waervagen, Svein Birger] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Nat Sci & Technol, Campus Hamar, N-2318 Hamar, Norway; [Andersen, Tom] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Blindernvn 31, N-0371 Oslo, Norway","Waervagen, SB (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Nat Sci & Technol, Campus Hamar, N-2318 Hamar, Norway.",svein.warvagen@inn.no,,,,,,149,4,4,0,9,PAGEPRESS PUBL,PAVIA,"MEDITGROUP, VIA G BELLI, 4, PAVIA, 27100, ITALY",1129-5767,1723-8633,,J LIMNOL,J.

Meta-analysts will vary in the criteria they use to screen studies and select data within studies, even when addressing exactly the same question. We summarize some of the many decisions that an ecologist must make in deciding what data to include in a synthesis. We then show, using multiple meta-analyses taken from the same literature on stream predation experiments, that meta-analytic conclusions can be colored by selection criteria that are not specifically a function of the relevance of the data. As a consequence, we recommend that meta-analysts perform several meta-analyses using different selection criteria to examine the robustness of reported findings. We also advise ecological meta-analysts to minimize use of selection criteria that are based on judgments of study quality when extracting data from the literature, because of the potential for unconscious bias. The influence of quality criteria on patterns in the data set can then be examined empirically. Our comparisons of mean effect size,for studies included vs. excluded on the basis of quality criteria, provided no evidence that rejected studies were aberrant or more variable than acceptable studies. One result of excluding such studies was a loss of statistical power. We urge ecologists to be more explicit about how data are selected for a meta-analysis, to examine the robustness of the patterns they report, and to conduct meta-analyses to describe as well as to infer.","Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Englund, G (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",,"Englund, Goran/A-7434-2008","Englund, Goran/0000-0001-5634-8602",,,,40,132,140,1,46,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1999,80,4,,,,,1132,1141,,10.2307/177060,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,215EG,WOS:000081368500004,,,,,2021-09-27,

That detail, generated by small-spatial-scale but often lengthy experiments, is essential to managing and even restoring ecosystems. My essay focuses primarily on the ecology of exposed rocky intertidal shores, but I believe the derived implications are generalizable to all ecosystems. A mainly experimental approach has tended to avoid a preoccupation with niches but instead has focused on the ecological roles exercised by particular species. Attention to roles has produced a growing appreciation for trophic cascades and their consequences, with obvious implications for the management of fisheries and the conservation significance of apex predators. Some studies are more phenomenological and others more reductionist in focus, but all provide pathways toward understanding abundance and body size variation or a miscellany of indirect effects.

Kleptoparasitic interactions, whereby crabs take prey from whelks, have been documented, although results from previous experiments are not consistent with respect to the presence and frequency of such interactions, perhaps because of the sizes of crabs used. We conducted a lab experiment to clarify the effects of interactions among crabs and whelks on consumption of blue mussels. Crab density, size, and whelk presence were manipulated, and number of mussels and mussel sizes consumed by crabs were assessed during a series of 10-day trials. In the absence of whelks, two small crabs foraging together consumed no more prey than a single crab, suggesting substantial inhibition of feeding through interference competition or other negative intraspecific interactions. Presence of whelks led to increased consumption, either through a reduction of this interference or other stimulatory mechanisms. Such effects were less apparent for large crabs and small crabs feeding without conspecifics. We found clear evidence of kleptoparasitism in all crab treatments, though this feeding mode only contributed substantially to the diet of small crabs in the presence of conspecifics. Small crabs feeding in pairs kleptoparasitized larger mussels than they consumed independently, allowing them to exploit prey larger than they usually would. Our size-specific results highlight the importance of considering predator size when studying such interactions. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Competition between the two species was examined in field surveys using visual SCUBA quadrats and complementary laboratory experiments with both live and artificial kelp. Field surveys showed significantly higher crab densities (0.50/m(2) +/- 0.08 SE) found up the kelp versus on the ground (0.22/m(2) +/- 0.04 SE) when lobsters were present (P = 0.002). In contrast, crab densities were significantly higher on the ground (0.44/m(2) +/- 0.07 SE) as opposed to up the kelp (0.23/m(2) +/- 0.06 SE) when lobsters were absent (P = 0.023). However, the interaction between survey location * date was significant in five of the eight surveys, suggesting this pattern may not be ubiquitous in all subtidal kelp locations within our study region. Average size of crabs up the kelp or on the ground was not different when lobsters were present or absent (P>0.05), and no size correlation was found between lobsters and crabs, irrespective of crab position. Experimental trials in the laboratory confirmed field surveys regardless of the order crabs and lobsters were added into the tank, or the use of live versus artificial kelp, and significant differences were observed in five of the six 5-day experimental trials. Our results suggest that when shelter availability may be limited, kelp could serve as an alternative habitat for rock crabs, perhaps to minimize competition between the two most abundant decapods in the shallow subtidal zone of New England.

In maize, both species tend to infest the ear. The introduction of H. armigera in Brazil has created a new scenario, where these Helicoverpa species might cohabit and interact with one another, affecting the prevalence of each species in the agroecosystem, integrated pest management, and insect resistance management. In this study, larval occurrence and proportion of these species in maize was assessed in three regions of Brazil during three crop seasons. Interaction between the species was evaluated in interspecific and intraspecific scenarios under laboratory and field conditions. Helicoverpa zea was predominant in Rio Grande do Sul and the Planaltina, DF (central Brazil). In western Bahia, H. zea was predominant in the first collection, but approximately equal in number to H armigera in the second crop season. Both species exhibit high cannibalism/predation rates, and larval size was the primary factor for larval survival in the interaction studies. Larva of H. zea had higher survival when interacting with H. armigera, indicating that H. zea has an advantage in intraguild interactions with H. armigera in maize. Overall, the results from this study indicate that maize might play a role as a source of infestation or a sink of insecticide or Bt protein unselected H. armigera populations, depending on the H. zea:H. armigera intraguild competition and adult movement in the landscape.","[Bentivenha, Jose P.

In Crystal Lake, native yellow perch experienced significant overlap in distribution and diet with smelt.

Here, we present a large (528 foraging trips, 169 individuals), multi-year, multi-colony GPS tracking dataset mostly collected simultaneously at 4 breeding colonies across the core breeding range of a colonially breeding pelagic seabird, the Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus. Foraging areas were identified by filtering GPS locations (using speed, time of day, and turning angle), validated on a subset of 25 birds carrying co-deployed depth loggers to maximise inclusion of foraging and feeding behaviour. Foraging areas showed high annual variation, but consistent patterns emerged. Birds from each colony consistently foraged locally, showing little overlap between colonies, but birds from all 4 colonies sometimes travelled large distances to forage within a single relatively restricted area. This combined pattern may be driven by density-dependent competition relatively locally, with high overlap and resource sharing at a distance, facilitated by a dual foraging strategy of mixing short and long trips. The key shared area was located near to a tidal front system, the Irish Sea Front, and the stratified waters of the Western Irish Sea to its north and west, which are characterised by high productivity. Visits to this area declined with increasing colony distance, suggesting that foraging advantages are balanced by the energetic costs of travel. Nevertheless, this area is probably of key importance to birds breeding at colonies across the species' core breeding range, highlighting the potential connectedness, and therefore vulnerability, of a pelagic species via a single foraging location, despite apparent segregation more locally around the breeding colonies.","[Dean, Ben; Kirk, Holly; Fayet, Annette; Guilford, Tim] Dept Zool, Anim Behav Res Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Freeman, Robin] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk NW2 4RY, England; [Leonard, Kerry] Copeland Bird Observ, Bangor BT19 1RZ, County Down, North Ireland; [Perrins, Christopher M.] Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Guilford, T (corresponding author), Dept Zool, Anim Behav Res Grp, South Pk Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",tim.guilford@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,"Kirk, Holly/0000-0002-8724-3210; Fayet, Annette/0000-0001-6373-0500","Microsoft Research, Cambridge; UK Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Northern Ireland Environment Agency; Scottish Natural Heritage; Royal Society for Protection of Birds; Birds of Lundy Fund; Merton College, Oxford; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [1095480] Funding Source: researchfish","We thank the Skomer and Skokholm Islands Advisory Committee, Copeland Bird Observatory, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Landmark Trust, and the National Trust for Scotland for permission to conduct the project on each of the Islands.

HOIs are considered potentially significant because their presence is assumed to mean that the dynamic behavior of a full community of species is unpredictable based on observations of interactions between subsets of the species within the community. Despite such attention, the causal mechanisms that produce HOIs have been inadequately discussed. We discuss three different usages of the term HOIs and provide insight as to why HOIs might be found within a given community. HOIs may be detected for three reasons: inappropriate assumptions made concerning species interactions that influence statistical tests, unmeasured parameters and variables, and interaction modifications (i.e., a functional change in the interaction of two species caused by a third species). This confusion concerning the defining attributes of HOIs has made their detection problematic. While the statistical tests being used in the ecological experiments to detect HOIs are described in detail in most papers, the dynamic models underlying these tests are often not made explicit. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalency of three different statistical tests: the Case and Bender (1981) test, analysis of variance, and a multiplicative test(Wootton 1994). However, the choice of a response variable (i.e., population densities, population growth rates, per-capita growth rates, etc.) and different data transformations applied to these response variables alter the underlying dynamics model that is being tested. The result is that the statistical test applied does not always perform the intended comparison but instead tests a different and sometimes unjustified or even inappropriate dynamic model. Finally, we review the relationship between indirect effects and HOIs. Whereas some researchers have lumped HOIs and indirect effects, we argue that the two represent completely unique and separate phenomena. Additionally, indirect effects can complicate detection of HOIs, and we review several methods by which to separate the two processes.",,"BILLICK, I (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,DEPT BIOL,0116,9500 GILMAN DR,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,30,189,193,2,54,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,,,,,1529,1543,,10.2307/1939614,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,WOS:A1994PE26700002,,,,,2021-09-27,

We used a set of field methods to assess species presence and relative frequency of observation. The network of ponds was inhabited by six species of amphibians, two salamanders and four frogs. The breeding phenology of the six species did not vary remarkably among ponds, but there were significant differences among species in use of ponds. Factorial analysis of pond similarity drawn from percentage composition of the amphibian fauna, revealed that each of the four ponds was treatable as independent units, with no influence of relative inter-pond distance. PCA analysis allowed us to spatially arrange the amphibian species into three main groups: two were monospecific groups (i.e., Triturus Vulgaris and Bufo bufo) and the third consisted of those species that selected not only the largest-deepest ponds, but also the ephemeral ones (i.e., Triturus carnifex, Hyla intermedia, the green frogs and Rana dalmatina). Our results suggest that the inter-pond differences in riparian vegetation, water depth, aquatic vegetation structure/abundance, and soil composition may produce differences among pond ecological characteristics (i.e., water turbidity and temperature, shelter availability, abundance of oviposition micro-sites), which may in turn influence different patterns of use by amphibians. To our knowledge, this is the first study emphasizing the potential role of heterochrony in the maintenance of a high species richness in Mediterranean amphibian communities. Preservation of freshwater vertebrate biodiversity requires management and protection not only of the main ponds and water bodies but also the temporary and ephemeral shallow ponds.

The strength of this effect depends partly on the spatial and temporal overlap of different age groups of the two species; therefore, we need a better understanding of factors affecting alewife and rainbow smelt distributions in Lake Champlain. We used hydroacoustics, trawls, and gill nets to document vertical fish distribution, and recorded environmental data during 16 day-night surveys over two years. Temperature, temperature change, and light were all predictors of adult and age-0 rainbow smelt distribution, and temperature and light were predictors of age-0 alewives' distribution (based on GAMM models evaluated with AIC). Adult alewives were 5-30 m shallower and age-0 alewives were 2-15 m shallower than their rainbow smelt counterparts. Adult rainbow smelt distribution overlapped with age-0 rainbow smelt and age-0 alewives near the thermocline (10-25 m), whereas adult alewives were shallower (0-6 m) and overlapped with age-0 alewives and rainbow smelt in the epilimnion. Adult rainbow smelt were in water <10-12 degrees C, whereas age-0 rainbow smelt were in 10-20 degrees C, and adult and age-0 alewives were in 15-22 degrees C water. Predicting these species distributions is necessary for quantifying the strength of predatory and competitive interactions between alewife and rainbow smelt, as well as between alewife and other fish species in Lake Champlain.

Foraging activity of birds in these trees was then compared to the foraging activity of birds in neighboring spruce trees, where ants were allowed to continue foraging. Birds which foraged in the foliage showed the effects of competition with ants: they visited the trees without ants more frequently, and for longer periods. In addition, the insects and spiders that they utilized as food were more abundant in the foliage of trees without ants. Cone-foraging birds, however, which fed on seeds in cones at the tops of the trees, did not show a preference for trees without ants. The differences of tree usage between foliage-gleaning and cone-foraging birds can be explained by alteration of the birds' food supply by wood ants: ants did not feed on seeds in cones, and so did not compete with cone-foraging birds.

To investigate the efficacy of different behavioral tactics adopted for their acquisition (locomotion, attendance at shell-supplying sites, interactions with conspecifics in aggregation) we conducted observations and experiments at a salt marsh in New England (USA). Locomotion, fast and meandering, significantly increased the chances of encountering empty shells and conspecifics. However, shell exchanges were rare. Simulated gastropod predation sites quickly attracted a larger number of hermit crabs than the other shell-supplying sites tested (live and dead conspecifics, live snails) and induced the rapid occupancy of all the empty shells offered, usually by the first crabs arriving at the site. Aggregations seemed not to function as shell exchange markets, as previously suggested for several other species. In the short run, exploitation seems to be more efficient for the acquisition of new shells by Pagurus longicarpus. In the long run, it is the density of nondestructive gastropod predators that regulates the availability of new shells of good quality in the pool available to this hermit crab species.","Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet Leo Pardi, I-50125 Florence, Italy","Gherardi, F (corresponding author), Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet Leo Pardi, Via Romana 17, I-50125 Florence, Italy.",francesca.gherardi@unifi.it,,,,,,66,29,29,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Salmonid species are typical examples of native invaders whose abundance is increased after stocking with hatchery fish. This study evaluated the effects of hatchery chum salmon fry on sympatric wild masu salmon fry, benthic invertebrate prey, and algae, after a single stocking event in Mamachi stream, Hokkaido, northern Japan. The results suggested that the stocked hatchery chum salmon fry decreased the foraging efficiency and growth of the wild masu salmon fry through interspecific competition, and depressed the abundance of Ephemerellidae and total grazer invertebrates (Glossosomatidae, Heptageniidae, and Baetidae) through predation. Also, the hatchery chum salmon fry may increase algal biomass through depression of grazer abundance by predation (top-down effect). These results suggested that a single release of hatchery chum salmon fry into a stream may influence the recipient stream ecosystem.","[Hasegawa, Koh; Takahashi, Satoru] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan; [Ohta, Tamihisa] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038047, Japan","Hasegawa, K (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan.",hasekoh@affrc.go.jp,"Hasegawa, Koh/H-9926-2019",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP16K07857]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K07857] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank the staff of the Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute for helping with the field work, and Dr Yoshikazu Takashima for sorting and identifying benthic invertebrates.

We used relationships between prey abundance and predator space use to create equations to predict the home range size of lions Panthera leo and leopards Panthera pardus. We then successfully tested these predictions using published data (Phinda, Makalali) and home range estimates from radio collared individuals reintroduced to Addo Elephant National Park. Spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta ranges also seem food dependent. Lion home ranges in Addo (114 +/- A 5 km(2)) required 180 fixes to be accurately estimated, spotted hyaena ranges (91 +/- A 10 km(2)) required 200 fixes, and the solitary leopard had 295 fixes for a range of 38 km(2). There were no sexual differences in home range sizes of lions or hyaenas. The daily food intake rate of lions, measured during continuous follows, was 9.8 kg per female equivalent unit. Dominant male lions (14.3 km for 8.3 kg) traveled furthest but obtained the least amount of food per day compared to subordinate males (8.9 km for 16.0 kg) and females (5.8 km for 17.9 kg). Subordinate males traveled the fastest and during the day, to avoid competition and harassment from the dominant males. From an evolutionary viewpoint, the use of fences for conservation has not affected the natural behaviour of the predators as they still conform to predictions derived from unfenced reserves; that is, prey abundance is the key factor in determining space use of large predators.","[Hayward, Matt W.] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, EU Ctr Excellence, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Hayward, Matt W.; Hayward, Gina J.; Druce, Dave J.; Kerley, Graham I.

Intraguild predation may suppress the distribution and abundance of mesopredators, but spatial resource partitioning may facilitate coexistence, with the subordinate carnivore utilizing suboptimal habitats. In arid systems, free-standing water was historically scarce, limiting the distribution of larger-bodied predators and offering large areas of refugia for smaller, arid-adapted species, such as the kit fox (Vulpes macrotis). In these systems, the development of artificial water sources may facilitate an increase in the distribution and abundance of larger carnivores (e.g., coyotes [Canis latrans]), perhaps to the detriment of kit foxes. We coupled noninvasive genetic sampling and dynamic occupancy models to evaluate the spatial dynamics of kit foxes and their intraguild predators, coyotes, in western Utah, United States. We evaluated the influence of habitat characteristics on coyote occupancy patterns, and then investigated the role of habitat and coyotes on kit fox space use at multiple scales. Coyote occupancy was unrelated to water availability, but was positively related to the proportion of shrubland and woodland cover, a pattern consistent with predictions of the resource availability hypothesis. Supporting predictions of IGP theory, kit fox occupancy was negatively related to shrubland and woodland cover, minimizing overlap with land-cover types favoring coyote occupancy. Furthermore, kit fox probability of local extinction was positively related to coyote activity. Interestingly, kit fox detection was positively related to coyote activity (i.e., kit fox detection was higher on spatial surveys with greater coyote sign), suggesting that at finer scales, kit foxes utilized riskier habitats to secure sufficient resources. Our results identified two alternative states predicted by IGP theory (i.e., intraguild predator dominated and coexistence of intraguild predator and intraguild prey) in a single system and elucidated the importance of considering dynamic processes and scale when investigating IGP.","[Lonsinger, Robert C.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Lonsinger, Robert C.; Waits, Lisette P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Gese, Eric M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, USDA, Wildlife Serv,Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Bailey, Larissa L.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Lonsinger, RC (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA.; Lonsinger, RC (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",robert.lonsinger@uwsp.edu,"Bailey, Larissa/ABH-3513-2020; Bailey, Larissa/A-2565-2009","Waits, Lisette/0000-0002-1323-0812; Lonsinger, Robert/0000-0002-1040-7299",National Geographic Society's Conservation TrustNational Geographic Society [C248-13]; U.S. Army Research LaboratoryUnited States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL); U.S. Army Research Office through the U.S. Department of Defense's Environmental Security Technology Certification [12 EB-RC5-006]; Legacy Resource Management Programs [W9132T-12-2-0050],"Funding was provided by the National Geographic Society's Conservation Trust (C248-13) and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the U.S. Army Research Office through the U.S. Department of Defense's Environmental Security Technology Certification (12 EB-RC5-006) and Legacy Resource Management (W9132T-12-2-0050) Programs.

We quantified the degree of spatial and temporal co-occurrence of the small carnivores using camera trap data over a year-long period. Carnivores separated into two temporal groups: nocturnal species (wildcat, polecat and genet) and diurnal species (mongooses). In addition, carnivores within the same temporal group had strong patterns of reduced spatial co-occurrence. The smaller bodied carnivores showed lower co-occurrence with the larger bodied African wildcat than expected by chance, supporting the idea of dominant competitor avoidance. Thus, small carnivores likely minimise competitive interactions through spatio-temporal habitat partitioning.","[de Satge, Jacques] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Antwerp, Belgium; [Teichman, Kristine] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Teichman, Kristine; Cristescu, Bogdan] Cape Leopard Trust, Cape Town, South Africa; [Cristescu, Bogdan] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Cape Town, South Africa","de Satge, J (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Antwerp, Belgium.",jdesatge@gmail.com; kristine.teichman@ubc.ca; cristescu.bog@gmail.com,,"Cristescu, Bogdan/0000-0003-2964-5040; de Satge, Jacques/0000-0003-1094-9642",Cape Leopard Trust; Conservation South Africa; South African National Parks; Woolworths Holdings Limited; ABAX Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Canada Graduate Scholarship-Doctoral at the University of British Columbia; Claude Leon Foundation postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cape Town,"We thank The Cape Leopard Trust, Conservation South Africa and South African National Parks for logistical and/or funding support throughout the project.

We examined effects of lion predation on Plain's zebra (E. quagga, IUCN Red List Near Threatened) and Grevy's zebra populations in a 2,105 km(2) area defined by lion movements. We used line transect surveys to estimate density of Grevy's (0.71/km(2)) and Plain's (15.9/ km(2)) zebras, and satellite telemetry to measure movements for lions and both zebras. We tracked lions to potential feeding sites to estimate predation rates on zebras. We compared field-based estimates of predation rates on both zebras to random gas models of encounters that result in predation to ask if lions prey preferentially on Grevy's zebra at a sufficient rate to drive population declines. Lions preyed on Grevy's zebra significantly less than expected in 15 of 16 (94%) scenarios considered and lions preyed on Plain's zebras as expected or significantly less than expected in 15 of 16 scenarios. Population trend of Grevy's zebra indicates that the Kenya population may be stabilizing. Recruitment rate to the population has tripled since 2004, making it unlikely that lions are having an impact on Grevy's zebras. In Laikipia County, competitive displacement by livestock (Livestock: Grevy's zebra ratio = 864: 1) and interference competition for grass with Plain's zebra (Plain's zebra: Grevy's zebra ratio = 22: 1) are most likely the predominant threats to Grevy's Zebra recovery.","[O'Brien, Timothy G.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Global Programs, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [O'Brien, Timothy G.; Kinnaird, Margaret F.; Rubenstein, Daniel] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Ekwanga, Steven; Frank, Laurence G.] Living Lions, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Wilmers, Christopher] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Williams, Terrie] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Ocean Hlth, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne] Ewaso Lions, Nairobi, Kenya; [Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney, England; [Rubenstein, Daniel] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Frank, Laurence G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","O'Brien, TG (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, Global Programs, Bronx, NY 10460 USA.; O'Brien, TG (corresponding author), Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya.",tobrien@wcs.org,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI:0963022, DBI:1255913, IOB:9874523, IIS:0705822, IBN:030923]; Chester Zoo; Cleveland Metroparks Zoo; Disney Foundation; San Francisco Zoo; Meeker Family Fund; Banovich Wildscapes Foundation; Zeitz Foundation; Donald and Maureen Green Foundation; Wildlife Conservation Society; Australian 60 Minutes","Funding was provided by: NSF grants DBI:0963022, DBI:1255913, IOB:9874523, IIS:0705822 and IBN:030923, Chester Zoo, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Disney Foundation, San Francisco Zoo, Meeker Family Fund, Banovich Wildscapes Foundation, Zeitz Foundation, Donald and Maureen Green Foundation, the Wildlife Conservation Society, Australian 60 Minutes, Bruce Ludwig, Frank Levinson, and Cindy Calderon.

There is a shortage of studies investigating how different size classes of a single species interact with one another to generate multiple predator effects. Here, we used a comprehensive experimental design, consisting of calculation of per capita consumption rates, to examine multiple predator effects on prey when swimming crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) of multiple sizes foraged on manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) using a video recording analysis system in the laboratory. We identified multiple predator effects on prey by comparing observed predation rate to that predicted from the multiple risk model. The observed predation rate of crab was significantly lower than predicted value when a conspecific competitor appeared. Swimming crab significantly decreased foraging time budgets when a conspecific competitor appeared. The proportion of time medium-sized crabs spent searching for and handling clam decreased in the presence of competitors. The encounter rate between crabs and clam decreased while the probability of capture upon encounter and the probability of consumption upon capture increased when a conspecific competitor appeared. The handling time per clam significantly decreased when a conspecific competitor appeared. Most encounters between crabs were fighting (2.31-4.14 times/h), secondly chasing (1.02-3.07 times/h), and threatening (1.24-2.09 times/h), and the fewest encounters were non-aggression (0.13-0.49 times/h). The results indicated that swimming crab foraging behavior was affected by the chasing, threatening and fighting behavior of a conspecific competitor and this affected the predation rate on prey, which led to non-independent multiple predator effects in the swimming crab-Manila clam system.","[Sun, Yunfei; Wang, Fang; Liu, Dapeng; Wang, Xin; Su, Xianpeng] Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mariculture, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yunfei; Wang, Fang; Liu, Dapeng; Wang, Xin; Su, Xianpeng] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Prod Proc, Funct Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food, 1 Wenhai Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Chao] Ocean Univ China, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, F (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mariculture, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wangfang249@ouc.edu.cn,,,Project of National Basic Research Priorities Program of China [2015FY110600]; Project of Shandong Key Research & Development Plan [2016ZDJS11A06],"We thank Heinrich Dircksen and Nick West for providing language help and writing assistance.

The first experiment used pair-wise trials, analyzing the preference by Chi-square tests using two different constructions of the null hypothesis. One hypothesis was based on a no-preference among shell species, the second on comparing the number of crabs changing for a particular shell species when two options were given versus the changing when no options were offered. The second experiment was a multiple-alternative test based on a rank ordering of the shell preference. This method has both statistical and resource-saving advantages over the traditional pair-wise comparisons. The sequence of shell preference was similarly independent of the procedure used. The preferred shell species are heavy and might be associated with hydrodynamic advantages and with the protection against predation. The shell preference matches with the pattern of shell occupancy indicating that the shell use in nature is determined by the crab's preference. The information generated may be used for further research on shell preference as a methodological alternative.","[Arce, Elsah] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Programa Posgrado Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mexico City 04360, DF, Mexico; [Alcaraz, Guillermina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Lab Ecofisiol, Mexico City 04360, DF, Mexico","Arce, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Programa Posgrado Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mexico City 04360, DF, Mexico.",elsahau@gmail.com; alcaraz@ciencias.unam.mx,,"Alcaraz, Guillermina/0000-0002-5485-0671","PAP-IIT-UNAMPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN207209-3]; Posgrado en Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia, UNAMUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","This study was supported by the program PAP-IIT-UNAM (IN207209-3).

In Poland, three different species of those beetles develop on the same host plant and use the same resources, which can lead to increased competition. We tested preferences of weevil females towards acorn size chosen for oviposition as well as reproduction time and other characteristics of their breeding behavior. The results clearly indicate that particular species prefer acorns of different masses and breeds in different periods corresponding to different stages of fruit growth. In other words, this enables weevils to pass each other during reproduction. Furthermore, one of the studied species varies distinctly also in terms of the number of laid eggs and the manner of locating them within the acorn tissues. Our observations support the hypothesis that niche partitioning among the species appears to be occurring when the resources-acorns, are limited. The work helps to understand how multi-species communities of insects cope in order to survive in a shared habitat. Oak seed predatory weevils occurring in Poland are prone to increased interspecific competition due to the limited number of Quercus species, compared to southern Europe, in which they can develop. Therefore, analyses on the preferences of three weevil species for acorn sizes chosen for reproduction, as well as on reproductive period duration, were performed. Cafeteria-type experiments were set for females of three species associated with one oak species. Females were allowed to choose and oviposit in acorns of different sizes and growth stages. Research revealed statistically significant differences between the masses of acorns chosen for oviposition by females of Curculio glandium (the biggest), C. pellitus (medium), and C. venosus (the smallest). Studied weevils also differed in terms of the beginning of the reproductive period, which corresponded with the increasing mass of growing acorns. Moreover, C. glandium was observed to be the only species to perform radial egg galleries and lay a considerably higher and varied number of eggs. The results support the hypothesis of a strategy aimed at reducing interspecific competition between Curculio spp. in terms of limited host plant species number.","[Reut, Michal; Moniuszko, Hanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Hort Sci, Dept Plant Protect, Sect Appl Entomol, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Chrabaszcz, Mariusz] Univ Wroclaw, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Ecol Biogeochem & Environm Protect, Kanonia 6-8, PL-50328 Wroclaw, Poland","Reut, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Hort Sci, Dept Plant Protect, Sect Appl Entomol, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",michal_reut@sggw.edu.pl; mariusz.chrabaszcz@uwr.edu.pl; hanna_moniuszko@sggw.edu.pl,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,AUG,2021,12,8,,,,,,,687,10.3390/insects12080687,,,11,Entomology,Entomology,UG3QR,WOS:000689171900001,34442253,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-27,

The ability to monitor the population size of species potentially affected by Southern Ocean fisheries, i.e., the Ad,lie penguin, is critical for effective management of those resources. However, for several reasons, direct estimates of population size are not possible in many locations around Antarctica. In this study, we combine high-resolution (0.6 m) satellite imagery with spectral analysis in a supervised classification to estimate the sizes of Ad,lie penguin breeding colonies along Victoria Land in the Ross Sea and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Using satellite images paired with concurrent ground counts, we fit a generalized linear mixed model with Poisson errors to predict the abundance of breeding pairs as a function of the area of current-year guano staining identified in the satellite imagery. Guano-covered area proved to be an effective proxy for the number of penguins residing within. Our model provides a robust, quantitative mechanism for estimating the breeding population size of colonies captured in imagery and identifies terrain slope as a significant component influencing apparent nesting density. While our high-resolution satellite imagery technique was developed for the Ad,lie penguin, these principles are directly transferrable to other colonially nesting seabirds and other species that aggregate in fixed localities.","[LaRue, M.

To better understand its modulation, we analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of a synthetic, chemical-mediated ecosystem that consisted of two engineered Escherichia coli populations. Depending on the specific experimental conditions implemented, the dominant interaction between the two populations could be competition for nutrients or predation due to engineered communication. While the two types of interactions resulted in different spatial patterns, they demonstrated a common trend in terms of the modulation of biodiversity. Specifically, biodiversity decreased with increasing cellular motility if the segregation distance between the two populations was comparable to the length scale of the chemical-mediated interaction. Otherwise, biodiversity was insensitive to cellular motility. Our results suggested a simple criterion for predicting the modulation of biodiversity by habitat partitioning and cellular motility in chemical-mediated ecosystems.","[You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA; Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC USA","You, LC (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",you@duke.edu,"Song, Hao/G-6207-2010","Song, Hao/0000-0001-5553-2539; Payne, Stephen/0000-0001-9727-7409",US National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5R01CA118486]; David and Lucile Packard FellowshipThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; DuPont Young Professor Award; US National Institute of General Medical Sciences Biotechnology Predoctoral Center for Biomolecular and Tissue Engineering FellowshipUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS); Duke University Pratt Fellowship; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R01CA118486] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank F.

Competition between livestock and wild ungulates is commonly perceived to occur on shared rangelands. In the Henry Mountains (HM) of Utah, a free-ranging population of bison Bison bison has raised concerns among ranchers holding grazing permits on these public lands. Bison are the most conspicuous potential competitors with cattle, but lagomorphs (mainly jackrabbits Lepus californicus) are also abundant in this area. The local ranching community is applying political pressure on state and federal agencies to resolve 'the bison problem', but the relative grazing impacts of bison, cattle and lagomorphs have not previously been quantified. 2. We constructed 40 grazing exclosures (each 5.95 m(2)) in the conflict area: 20 excluded bison + cattle ('partial') and 20 excluded bison + cattle + lagomorphs ('full'). All exclosures, each with a paired open reference plot, were monitored for 1 year, and above-ground plant production was measured. GPS telemetry (bison) and scheduled grazing (cattle) allowed visitation to be quantified for each ungulate species based on the number of 'animal days' in the area. Rancher perceptions of wildlife-cattle interactions were recorded in a questionnaire survey. 3. Ranchers perceived bison as a high-level competitor with cattle, whereas lagomorphs were perceived as low-level competitors. 4. Grazed reference plots yielded an average (+/- SE) of 22.7 g m(-2) (+/- 5.16) of grass, compared to 36.5 g m(-2) (+/- 7.33) in the partial exclosures and 43.7 g m(-2) (+/- 7.61) in the full exclosures. Exclusion of large herbivores thus resulted in a 13.8 g m(-2) increase in grass biomass relative to the reference plots (P = 0.005), with the additional exclusion of lagomorphs resulting in a further 7.18 g m(-2) increase (P = 0.048). 5. Overall, lagomorphs accounted for 34.1%, bison 13.7% and cattle 52.3% of the total grass biomass removed by all herbivores on the shared range. 6. Synthesis and applications. Cattle face a greater competitive challenge from lagomorphs than from bison in the study area. This case study illustrates the need for science-based management of social-ecological systems in which even long-term resource users might underestimate the complexities of trophic interactions. Attention should be redirected at the lagomorphs and their main predators, coyotes Canis latrans, which are currently subject to population control. To reduce negative perceptions among local ranchers, options should be explored to incorporate benefit-sharing into the management of the bison population.","[Ranglack, Dustin H.; du Toit, Johan T.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Ranglack, Dustin H.; Durham, Susan] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Ranglack, DH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",dhranglack@gmail.com,"du Toit, Johan T/D-3390-2009; Ranglack, Dustin/AAU-6451-2020","du Toit, Johan T/0000-0003-0705-7117; Ranglack, Dustin/0000-0003-4534-9487",U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Utah Division of Wildlife Resources,"Funding was provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources with facilitation by Frank Howe.

Unlike common Lagrangian dynamics, additional ghost-fields, which have dual roles, appear in S-Lagrangian dynamics equations. These fields design hierarchical structures of a system and generate ghost-forces. In addition, the dynamics of these fields could lead to time irreversibility of the dynamics equations. Because the inference of S-Lagrangian equations is based only the causality principle, the common local topology of a system's state space, and assumptions that infinite velocities are impossible and that the system's state can be described by a compact fuzzy set, S-Lagrangian dynamics can be applied to physical and nonphysical systems as well. We applied S-Lagrangian dynamics to describe the behavior of populations of living species in the environment, assuming that the system's Lagrangian is defined by the dependence of velocity of changing of the population's stress on population densities, food supply, and environmental damage. The results show that even the first approximation of the Lagrangian allows the description of almost all types of species co-evolution: competition, coexistence, prey predator dynamics, and ecological catastrophes.

Clarifying what species are being consumed at what times can improve our understanding of how anthropogenic change affects food web dynamics, with implications for community assembly including restoration. This includes human-based changes to plant communities via species introductions, which can interact with consumer feeding preferences to indirectly alter assembly outcomes including reduced restoration success if planted species are preferentially targeted. 2. We used DNA barcoding of plant material in rodent scat, combined with field-based feeding trials, rodent trapping, and rodent exclosures to test for dietary preferences and assembly impacts of native rodents on a restored and regionally rare tallgrass prairie of central North America. We examined whether native rodents preferred non-targeted and mostly non-native oldfield plants that are more locally abundant, thus protecting the rarer native planted species from consumption, or if rodents preferred native plants regardless of abundance. 3. Our results supported the latter outcome. Barcoding revealed that native rodents consumed mostly non-planted oldfield species for 10 months of the year (92% of the diet). The exceptions were August-September, when planted prairie species accounted for 87% of plants consumed and coincided with their peak seed production. Cafeteria trials suggested diet sea-sonality to be explained by food limitation - native prairie seeds were consumed year-round when made available. Non-targeted oldfield species thus appeared to be of sufficient quality to support rodent populations (peaking at 23 individuals ha(-1) in summer), but without rescuing rarer prairie species from targeted granivory and resulting in reduced prairie diversity outside of experimental exclosures. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our work illustrates how anthropogenic-based changes to producer communities may affect feeding pathways in grassland food webs, potentially facilitating establishment by non-target species via indirect consumer effects that can be difficult to detect. These findings suggest that rodents may reduce the restoration success of tallgrass prairie in our region, with some planted species likely to suffer future recruitment difficulties due to granivory. Managers may need to consider multiple trophic levels with restoration, not just the commonly planted producer communities but also the consumers and predators associated with them.","[Schneider, Stefan; Steeves, Royce; Newmaster, Steve; MacDougall, Andrew S.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","MacDougall, AS (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",asm@uoguelph.ca,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada First Research Excellence Fund; Ontario government Early Researcher Award; rare charitable research reserve,"We thank J.

Does this history affect their ability to assess and respond to a snake that has this ability? As a test, we exposed gerbils to risk of predation from various predators, including snakes, owls, and foxes. The snakes included the Saharan horned viper (Cerastes cerastes) and the sidewinder rattlesnake (Crotalus cerastes). The former snake lacks sensory pits and shares a common evolutionary history with the gerbil. The latter snake, while convergent evolutionarily on the horned viper, has sensory pits and no prior history with the gerbil. The gerbils exploited depletable resource patches similarly, regardless of snake species and moon phase. While the gerbils did not respond to the novel snake as a greater threat than their familiar horned viper, the gerbils were cognizant that the novel predator was a threat. In response to both snakes, giving-up densities (GUDs; the amount of food left in a resource patch following exploitation) of the gerbils were higher in the bush than open microhabitat. In response to moonlight, GUDs were higher on full than on the new moon. Based on GUDs, the gerbils responded most to the risk of predation from the red fox, least from the two snake species, and intermediate for the barn owl.","[Bleicher, Sonny S.] Felidae Conservat Fund, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL USA; [Embar, Keren; Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Sede Boqer, Israel","Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Felidae Conservat Fund, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",bleicher@email.arizona.edu,"Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo/AAE-6272-2020; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Bleicher, Sonny S/0000-0001-8727-5901",US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF)US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [BSF-2008163],US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) [grant number BSF-2008163].,,30,16,16,0,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1565-9801,2224-4662,,ISR J ECOL EVOL,Isr.

Population densities and size distributions were sampled in the field with little error because the water is clear and the pools are kept free of sediment and vegetation by waves from winter storms on Lake Superior. We experimentally manipulated salamander densities in 12 natural pools (three replicates each of four densities) and simultaneously monitored salamander populations in 27 control pools on two islands. The experiment demonstrated that increasing density significantly reduced survival and growth, and increased the skew in the size distributions of individuals. Each of these responses was also observed in the undisturbed natural populations. Density effects were probably due to interference because (1) natural variation in the densities of prey taxa did not influence salamander performance in the experiment, (2) salamander density had no effect on prey availability, and (3) tail damage from attacks by conspecifics was widespread and positively correlated with density. We conclude that density dependence is commonplace in salamander larvae, and probably makes an important contribution to regulating the population size of Ambystoma laterale at Isle Royale.","WILLIAMS COLL,DEPT BIOL,WILLIAMSTOWN,MA 01267","VANBUSKIRK, J (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706, USA.",,,"Van Buskirk, Josh/0000-0002-0486-3626",,,,45,93,95,1,23,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1991,72,5,,,,,1747,1756,,,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GK823,WOS:A1991GK82300021,,,,,2021-09-27,

In mammalian carnivores, to reduce the risks of negative encounters between competitors, species can employ a strategy of temporal partitioning, adapting activity patterns to limit synchronous activity. This strategy of non-human competitor avoidance, however, may be influenced by the expansion of human activities, which has driven wild mammals towards nocturnality. We hypothesise that the disruption of temporal niche partitioning by humans and their activities could increase temporal overlap between carnivores, enhancing interspecific competition. We reviewed the published literature systematically and employed generalised linear models to evaluate quantitatively the relative influence of a range of human, meteorological and ecological variables on coefficients of temporal overlap within mammalian terrestrial carnivore communities (orders Carnivora and Didelphimorphia) on a global scale. None of the models investigated showed evidence of an impact of humans on temporal partitioning between carnivores on a global scale. This illustrates that temporal avoidance of humans and competitors does not always follow a consistent pattern and that its strength may be context-dependent and relative to other dimensions of niche partitioning (spatial and trophic). Similarly, the regulation of activity patterns may be strongly site-specific and may be influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic characteristics. Temporal avoidance of both humans and competitors by carnivores may take the form of short, reactive responses that do not impact activity patterns in the longer term. Although we did not detect a global disruption of temporal partitioning due to human disturbance, carnivore communities may still experience an increase in interspecific competition in other niche dimensions. Further research would benefit from using controlled experimental designs and investigating multiple dimensions of niche partitioning simultaneously. Finally, we recommend complementing the coefficient of temporal overlap with other metrics of fine-scale spatiotemporal interactions.","[Seveque, Anthony; Gentle, Louise K.; Yarnell, Richard W.; Uzal, Antonio] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0QF, Notts, England; [Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose] Oviedo Univ, Res Unit Biodivers UO CSIC PA, Mieres 33600, Spain","Seveque, A (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0QF, Notts, England.",anthony.seveque@ntu.ac.uk; louise.gentle@ntu.ac.uk; jv.lopezbao@gmail.com; richard.yarnell@ntu.ac.uk; antonio.uzal@ntu.ac.uk,,,"Nottingham Trent University; Ramon & Cajal research contract from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [RYC-2015-18932]","A.S. received funding from a Nottingham Trent University Vice-Chancellor's bursary scholarship.

Population densities of small rodents fluctuate greatly, providing a good study model to evaluate effects of competition on trophic niche. We studied resource use in five arctic small rodent populations of four species combining DNA metabarcoding of stomach contents and stable isotope analysis (SIA). Our results suggest that for small rodents, the most pronounced effect of competition on trophic niche is due to increased use of secondary habitats and to habitat-specific diets, rather than an expansion of trophic niche in primary habitat. DNA metabarcoding and SIA provided complementary information about the composition and temporal variation of herbivore diets. Combing these two approaches requires caution, as the underlying processes causing observed patterns may differ between methodologies due to different spatiotemporal scales.","[Soininen, Eeva M.; Ehrich, Dorothee; Lecomte, Nicolas; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway; [Tarroux, Arnaud; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Tarroux, Arnaud; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Gielly, Ludovic] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, Grenoble, France; [Brochmann, Christian; Gussarova, Galina] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Natl Ctr Biosystemat, Oslo, Norway; [Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Moncton, Canada Res Chair Polar & Boreal Ecol, Dept Biol, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada; [Tarroux, Arnaud] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Tromso, Norway","Soininen, EM (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway.",eeva.soininen@uit.no,"Ehrich, Dorothee/F-6492-2015; Soininen, Eeva/AAJ-5909-2021; Tarroux, Arnaud/AAE-5173-2021; Gussarova, Galina/E-4758-2015; Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014; Brochmann, Christian/A-4105-2009","Ehrich, Dorothee/0000-0002-3028-9488; Soininen, Eeva/0000-0003-4280-8350; Gussarova, Galina/0000-0001-5388-7491; Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985; Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Lecomte, Nicolas/0000-0002-8473-5375",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; Oskar Huttunen foundation; University of Tromso,"This study was funded by the Research Council of Norway (projects 'Ecosystem Finnmark', 'EcoFinn', 'Arctic Predators', 'BarFrost' and a Leiv Eiriksson mobility grant to EMS); Oskar Huttunen foundation (PhD Scolarship for EMS) and University of Tromso (mobility grant for EMS).

In both years, Daphnia dominated the zooplankton community in June and early July but disappeared in mid-July and early August. Age-0 yellow perch consumed primarily Daphnia and copepods until the Daphnia stocks were depleted then switched to benthic prey. Small age-0 gizzard shad primarily selected Daphnia and copepods while larger individuals consumed fewer zooplankton and more phytoplankton. Data from 1984 through 1993 indicated no direct effect of interspecific competition on growth rates of either species. The decrease in Daphnia populations in years with abundant age-0 gizzard shad occurs later in the year than in years with abundant age-0 yellow perch, and we suggest that this timing is crucial for the outcome of fish interactions. When Daphnia decline later in the season, larger age-0 yellow perch can switch to benthic prey and larger age-0 gizzard shad to phytoplankton; thus, the outcome of these interactions differs from the depression of age-0 bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) by competition from age-0 shad reported from many reservoirs.","CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NAT RESOURCES, BIOL FIELD STN, BRIDGEPORT, NY 13030 USA",,,,"Roseman, Edward/0000-0002-5315-9838",,,,37,43,43,0,8,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

The Mesopredator Release Hypothesis (MRH) suggests that top predator suppression of mesopredators is a key ecosystem function with cascading impacts on herbivore prey, but it remains to be shown that this top-down cascade impacts the large-scale structure of ecosystems. 2. The Exploitation Ecosystems Hypothesis (EEH) predicts that regional ecosystem structures are determined by top-down exploitation and bottom-up productivity. In contrast to MRH, EEH assumes that interference among predators has a negligible impact on the structure of ecosystems with three trophic levels. 3. We use the recolonization of a top predator in a three-level boreal ecosystem as a natural experiment to test if large-scale biomass distributions and population trends support MRH. Inspired by EEH, we also test if top-down interference and bottom-up productivity impact regional ecosystem structures. 4. We use data from the Finnish Wildlife Triangle Scheme which has monitored top predator (lynx Lynx lynx), mesopredator (red fox Vulpes vulpes) and prey (mountain hare Lepus timidus) abundance for 17 years in a 200 000 km2 study area which covers a distinct productivity gradient. 5. Fox biomass was lower than expected from productivity where lynx biomass was high, whilst hare biomass was lower than expected from productivity where fox biomass was high. Hence, where interference controlled fox abundance, lynx had an indirect positive impact on hare abundance as predicted by MRH. The rates of change indicated that lynx expansion gradually suppressed fox biomass. 6. Lynx status caused shifts between ecosystem structures. In the 'interference ecosystem', lynx and hare biomass increased with productivity whilst fox biomass did not. In the 'mesopredator release ecosystem', fox biomass increased with productivity but hare biomass did not. Thus, biomass controlled top-down did not respond to changes in productivity. This fulfils a critical prediction of EEH. 7. We conclude that the cascade involving top predators, mesopredators and their prey can determine large-scale biomass distribution patterns and regional ecosystem structures. Hence, interference within trophic levels has to be taken into account to understand how terrestrial ecosystem structures are shaped.","[Elmhagen, B.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ludwig, G.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Rushton, S.

Ideal-free distribution theory assumes that in a patchy environment foragers maximize fitness and hence their feeding rate by balancing gains from more food against losses from more competition. Ultimately, individuals cannot increase their feeding rate by moving to another patch and they distribute themselves over patches in proportion to prey density per patch. 2. In our experiments with shore crabs Carcinus maenas foraging on two adjacent patches with mussels Mytilus edulis, the implicit assumption of ideal-free distribution theory that catch should match time spent in a prey patch is not met, however. Despite aggregating their attack where it is most profitable shore crabs distributed themselves homogeneously across mussel patches: they 'take away' the prey caught and consume it elsewhere to reduce interference. 3. Thus, predator distributions can be quite different from prey-attack distributions. This is important because the latter is shown to be decisive for persistence of predator and prey populations in ecological models.","[Smallegange, Isabel M.; van der Meer, Jaap] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Ecol & Evolut, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [van der Meer, Jaap] Free Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sabelis, Maurice W.] Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Sect Populat Biol, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands","Smallegange, IM (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Div Biol, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",i.smallegange@imperial.ac.uk,"van der Meer, Jaap/C-6687-2011; Smallegange, Isabel M./A-8198-2010","Smallegange, Isabel M./0000-0001-6218-7358",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),"The authors would like to thank Wouter Vahl for discussion and comments, and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) for funding (research grant and Rubicon Fellowship).

The relative diversity of microbial communities was estimated by a fingerprinting based approach for both prey and predators. The results showed that the presence of grazers preserved the Shannon diversity of the bacterial community and shifted the size-structure distribution towards grazing- resistant forms. Absence of predation promoted competition for resources and resulted in a constant reduction of the relative diversity of the bacterial community. The change in the size-structure distribution of the bacterial communities in the treatments was accompanied by alterations in the relative operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition of the eukaryotic and bacterial communities. Bacterial OTUs grouped in two distinct fractions linked to their size-structure distribution, in dependence to the presence of the predators: Small and Edible cells were favoured by low grazing pressure whereas Filaments and Aggregates were stimulated by predator presence. Eukaryotic OTUs successful at high grazing activity resulted as rather different than OTUs successful at lower degree of grazing. Under high protistan grazing pressure, there was a clear shift in bacterial community composition regarding both size-structure distribution and genotypes. Nevertheless, diversity was preserved. The opposite situation characterized the predator-free, bacterial communities: a clear and constant reduction of the community diversity was indicated, confirming that moderate top-down control is fundamental to the shaping and preservation of natural bacterial communities, even in oligotrophic systems.","[Corno, Gianluca; Caravati, Emanuele; Callieri, Cristiana; Bertoni, Roberto] CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, I-28922 Verbania, Italy","Corno, G (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, I-28922 Verbania, Italy.",g.corno@ise.cnr.it,"Corno, Gianluca/K-1658-2018; CORNO, GIANLUCA/AAB-8889-2019","Corno, Gianluca/0000-0002-7423-8797; CORNO, GIANLUCA/0000-0002-7423-8797",,,,60,23,24,0,18,PAGEPRESS PUBL,PAVIA,"MEDITGROUP, VIA G BELLI, 4, PAVIA, 27100, ITALY",1129-5767,1723-8633,,J LIMNOL,J.

We studied the interaction between Aphis varians and Formica cinerea on fireweed(Epilobium angustifolium) in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. In 1988 we used two experiments to examine the interaction between ant tending and aphid density on the per capita growth of aphid populations at naturally occurring low aphid densities, and naturally occurring high aphid densities. In 1989, we conducted a similar experiment, but we manipulated aphid densities to include the full range from low to high. The results of these experiments were consistent: ant tending significantly improved the growth of small aphid populations, but the benefit from ant tending decreased or disappeared at higher aphid densities. We considered possible mechanisms for the density-dependent mutualistic effect by examining the relationships among aphid density, the number of ants tending, and predator abundance. We show that the relative number of ants tending declined as aphid density increased, and ant tending did not reduce predator abundance at any aphid densities. Therefore, the cause of the density-dependent mutualism is probably a decline in the direct effect of ants on aphids resulting from a decline in the relative number of ants tending aphids at higher aphid densities.

Moving land hermit crabs from worse shells to better shells decreases the number of crabs investigating shells, while moving crabs from better shells to worse shells increases the number of crabs investigating shells. Gravid females have better-fitting shells than nongravid females or males. Crabs from two different populations in Panama have different shell fits and show different levels of responses to shell-investigation cues. Land hermit crabs respond to volatile shell-investigation cues from both land and marine hermit crabs, but marine hermit crabs do not respond to cues from land hermit crabs.

However, one species of cardinalfish, Apogon notatus (Houttuyn, 1782), shows unusual sex roles: females alone defend their breeding territories to form pairs, even though the OSR is male-biased. This is inconsistent with the general rule that breeding territoriality is shown by the more abundant sex. We examined the function of female breeding territory in this fish using field observations. Prior to the breeding season, large females established their territories earlier than small females. Earlier settlers occupied deeper areas with larger boulders where conspecifics were less likely to aggregate. As the level of conspecific aggregation increased, spawning females suffered from frequent intraspecific interference and subsequent egg predation, leading to increased time or energy spent on territorial defense. For the females, territories that have more boulders and fewer conspecifics might be of higher quality because such places are safe from egg predation and less costly to defend. We conclude that females defend their breeding territories to avoid predation of spawned eggs rather than to guard high-quality mates or to increase mating opportunities.","[Fukumori, Kayoko; Okuda, Noboru] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Yanagisawa, Yasunobu] Ehime Univ, Fac Sci, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan","Fukumori, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",fuku@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Century Center of Excellence [A14]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","We are grateful to Motomi Genkai-Kato and Annamalai Subramanian for valuable comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

Thus, a study was undertaken to describe patterns of water beetle co-occurrence in a tropical environment and to compare these with water beetle community structure in temperate regions. Hydradephagan water beetles (Dytiscidae, Noteridae and Gyrinidae) were sampled quantitatively and qualitatively from a variety of habitats in the Atherton Tableland region of tropical Queensland from September 1990 to February 1991. Principal component analysis (PCA), using species occurrence in samples, supported a primary classification of sites as lotic, lentic and closed-forest lotic. Closed-forest lotic sites were tightly grouped in the PCA ordination, whereas the lotic and lentic groups of sites were more diffuse. Through analysis of species distributions in the PCA ordination it was inferred that factor 1 corresponded to habitat stability (e.g. permanence, water level fluctuation), especially among lotic sites, whereas factor 2 corresponded to the interrelated variables of water flow, substratum and vegetation. Quantitative samples taken from the shorelines of reservoirs showed that water beetle densities dropped sharply from the dry to the wet times of the year. Also, densities decreased and faunal mix changed with distance from shoreline. Quantitative samples from rice fields and a temporary pond demonstrated that a suite of species were quick to colonise and breed in newly formed habitat. Many of these species breed before other predators such as fish or Odonata become established. The lack of defined communities is due largely to the high mobility of many species which retreat to watered refuges during dry periods and opportunistically colonise new habitat as it is available. This mobile element obscures community boundaries, although characteristic species occur in certain habitat types such as closed-forest streams, permanent vegetation-rich ponds and particular regions along habitat continua. Patterns in size and habits of species of permanent habitats, and colonisation patterns of species occurring in temporary habitats, suggest that these represent mechanisms that reduce predation from other aquatic predators.",,"Larson, DJ (corresponding author), MEM UNIV NEWFOUNDLAND,DEPT BIOL,ST JOHNS,NF A1B 3X9,CANADA.",,,,,,,22,18,22,0,13,AUSTRALIAN ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC,CANBERRA,"CSIRO ENTOMOLOGY GPO BOX 1700, CANBERRA 2601, AUSTRALIA",1326-6756,,,AUST J ENTOMOL,Aust.

Resource partitioning may be facilitated by behavioural differentiation along three main niche dimensions: habitat, food and time. In this study, we investigate the extent to which these mechanisms can explain the coexistence of an assemblage of five sympatric felids in Borneo. Using multi-scale logistic regression, we show that Bornean felids exhibit differences in both their broad and fine-scale habitat use. We calculate temporal activity patterns and overlap between these species, and present evidence for temporal separation within this felid guild. Lastly, we conducted an all-subsets logistic regression to predict the occurrence of each felid species as a function of the co-occurrence of a large number of other species and showed that Bornean felids co-occurred with a range of other species, some of which could be candidate prey. Our study reveals apparent resource partitioning within the Bornean felid assemblage, operating along all three niche dimension axes. These results provide new insights into the ecology of these species and the broader community in which they live and also provide important information for conservation planning for this guild of predators.","[Hearn, Andrew J.; Ross, Joanna; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit WildCRU, Oxford, England; [Cushman, Samuel A.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Goossens, Benoit] Danau Girang Field Ctr, Sabah Wildlife Dept, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Goossens, Benoit] Sabah Wildlife Dept, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Goossens, Benoit] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Biosci, Organisms & Environm Div, Sir Martin Evans Bldg,Museum Ave, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Goossens, Benoit] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Pl Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Hunter, Luke T.

Adults preferred mineral materials over macrophytes and did not differentiate between natural and artificial plants. Juveniles did not avoid areas occupied by adults, but in their presence exhibited significantly stronger preferences for substrata providing them with suitable shelters. Habitats selected by gammarids in our study somewhat differed from those commonly used in the field, indicating their high plasticity.

The evolution of beak morphology in the Darwin's finches in response to competition for seed resources is a classic example of evolution by natural selection. The seeds of Tribulus cistoides are an important food source for the largest ground finch species (Geospiza fortis, G. magnirostris, and G. conirostris) in dry months, and the hard spiny morphology of the fruits is a potent agent of selection that drives contemporary evolutionary change in finch beak morphology. Although the effects of these interactions on finches are well known, how seed predation affects the ecology and evolution of the plants is poorly understood. Here we examine whether seed predation by Darwin's finches affects the ecology and evolution of T. cistoides. We ask whether the intensity of seed predation and the strength of natural selection by finches on fruit defense traits vary among populations, islands, years, or with varying finch community composition (i.e., the presence/absence of the largest beaked species, which feed on T. cistoides most easily). We then further test whether T. cistoides fruit defenses have diverged among islands in response to spatial variation in finch communities. We addressed these questions by examining seed predation by finches in 30 populations of T. cistoides over 3 yr. Our study reveals three key results. First, Darwin's finches strongly influence T. cistoides seed survival, whereby seed predation varies with differences in finch community composition among islands and in response to interannual fluctuations in precipitation. Second, finches impose phenotypic selection on T. cistoides fruit morphology, whereby smaller and harder fruits with longer or more spines exhibited higher seed survival. Variation in finch community composition and precipitation also explains variation in phenotypic selection on fruit defense traits. Third, variation in the number of spines on fruits among islands is consistent with divergent phenotypic selection imposed by variation in finch community composition among islands. These results suggest that Darwin's finches and T. cistoides are experiencing an ongoing coevolutionary arms race, and that the strength of this coevolution varies in space and time.","[Carvajal-Endara, Sofia; Hendry, Andrew P.; Davies, T.

We reared larval American toads (Bufo americanus), southern leopard frogs (R. sphenocephala), and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) with 0 or 5 overwintered bullfrog tadpoles in field enclosures located in ponds on golf courses or in experimental wetlands at a reference site. Survival to metamorphosis of American toads, southern leopard frogs, and spotted salamanders was greater in ponds on golf courses than at reference sites. We attributed this increased survival to low abundance of insect predators in golf course ponds. The presence of overwintered bullfrogs, however, reduced the survival of American toads, southern leopard frogs, and spotted salamanders reared in golf course ponds, indicating that the suitability of the aquatic habitats for these species partly depended on the biotic community present.

We tested the hypothesis that indirect food web interactions between some common, invertivorous fishes and their prey would positively affect growth of an algivorous fish species. Specifically, we predicted that orangethroat darter (Etheostoma spectabile) would increase periphyton biomass via a top-down pathway, indirectly enhancing growth of the algivorous central stoneroller minnow (Campostoma anomalum). Moreover, we predicted that sand shiner (Notropis stramineus) would increase periphyton biomass via a bottom-up pathway and indirectly enhance growth of the stoneroller minnow. 2. In an 83-day experiment in large, outdoor, stream mesocosms, we stocked two fish species per mesocosm (stoneroller and either darter or shiner), estimated the effects of the invertivorous and grazing fishes on periphyton biomass and estimated growth of the algivorous fish. 3. The darter consumed grazing invertebrates, indirectly increasing periphyton biomass. The shiner consumed terrestrial insects as predicted, but it did not affect periphyton biomass. 4. In support of our hypothesis, the darter indirectly enhanced stoneroller growth. As predicted, stonerollers consumed the increased periphyton in streams with darters, resulting in greater growth, condition and gut fullness compared to streams without darters. No indirect interaction was observed between stonerollers and shiners. 5. Our study suggests that some invertivorous fish species can positively affect growth of algivorous fishes through indirect food web interactions. Thus, in stream communities, it is possible that the loss of a single, invertivorous fish taxon could have negative consequences on algivorous fish populations via the removal of positive indirect food web interactions.","Univ Oklahoma, Biol Stn, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Hargrave, CW (corresponding author), Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 2116, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA.",cwhargrave@shsu.edu,,,,,,50,14,16,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Most research in this area is focused on large-bodied predators, despite the high extinction risk of small-bodied freshwater fish that often act as apex consumers. Consequently, it remains unknown if intermittent streams are affected by the consequences of top-predators' extirpations. The aim of our research was to determine how this global problem affects intermittent streams and, in particular, if the loss of a small-bodied top predator (1) leads to a 'mesopredator release', affects primary consumers and changes whole community structures, and (2) triggers a cascade effect modifying the ecosystem function. To address these questions, we studied the top-down effects of a small endangered fish species, Barbus meridionalis (the Mediterranean barbel), conducting an enclosure/exclosure mesocosm experiment in an intermittent stream where B. meridionalis became locally extinct following a wildfire. We found that top predator absence led to 'mesopredator release', and also to 'prey release' despite intraguild predation, which contrasts with traditional food web theory. In addition, B. meridionalis extirpation changed whole macroinvertebrate community composition and increased total macroinvertebrate density. Regarding ecosystem function, periphyton primary production decreased in apex consumer absence. In this study, the apex consumer was functionally irreplaceable; its local extinction led to the loss of an important functional role that resulted in major changes to the ecosystem's structure and function. This study evidences that intermittent streams can be affected by the consequences of apex consumers' extinctions, and that the loss of small-bodied top predators can lead to large ecosystem changes. We recommend the reintroduction of small-bodied apex consumers to systems where they have been extirpated, to restore ecosystem structure and function.","[Rodriguez-Lozano, Pablo; Verkaik, Iraima; Rieradevall, Maria; Prat, Narcis] Univ Barcelona, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol, Freshwater Ecol & Management FEM Res Grp, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Rodriguez-Lozano, P (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol, Freshwater Ecol & Management FEM Res Grp, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",pablorodriguezlozano@gmail.com,"GARCIA, SERGIO ERICK/X-9320-2018; Rodriguez-Lozano, Pablo/AAA-8873-2020","Verkaik, Iraima/0000-0002-7432-525X; Rodriguez-Lozano, Pablo/0000-0002-5130-8107","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana [CGL2008-03388/BOS]; FPU (Formacion de Profesorado Universitario) from Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte, Gobierno de EspanaGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FPU2009-1470]","This research was funded by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana, through the project CGL2008-03388/BOS (FURIMED-2; http://www.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/mineco/).

However, some predator-prey relationships may still remain undetected, due to the difficulty of observing rare predation events. We report the first observation of predation of arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) pups by common ravens (Corvus corax). The predation event was witnessed on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, through an automatic camera placed on a den. On June 8, 2013, the day following pup emergence from the den, the complete litter of four was killed and taken away by a pair of ravens despite the intermittent presence of the mother. This event lasted 2.5 h, occurred during a low lemming year, and resulted in the fox pair failing their reproduction. Only two other fox litters were present that summer in our 600 km(2) study area, so this litter predated by ravens accounted for 25 % (4/16) of the pups produced. Our report shows how continuous monitoring of dens using automatic cameras can allow documentation of rare events. In addition to food competition and cache raiding, pup predation contributes to the antagonistic interactions between arctic foxes and ravens in the High Arctic, which may intensify during low lemming years. This observation allows a better understanding of species interactions within the Arctic predator guild.","[Chevallier, Clement; Lai, Sandra; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Ctr Northern Studies, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Chevallier, Clement; Lai, Sandra; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada","Chevallier, C; Berteaux, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Ctr Northern Studies, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.; Chevallier, C; Berteaux, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",chevallier.clement@gmail.com; dominique_berteaux@uqar.ca,"Lai, Sandra/AAL-5346-2021","Lai, Sandra/0000-0003-0128-3738; Chevallier, Clement/0000-0002-0956-5978",Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies (FRQNT); Kenneth M Molson Foundation; Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada ArcticNet; Northern Ecosystem Initiative (Environment Canada); Northern Scientific Training Program (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada); NSERC CREATE training program in northern environmental sciences EnviroNorth; Nunavut Wildlife Management Board; Parks Canada Agency; Polar Continental Shelf Program (Natural Resources Canada)Natural Resources Canada,"We thank the many field workers who collected data on Bylot Island.

From a behavioral perspective, how shelter availability affects the way individuals allocate their activity in space has been extensively documented. However, how shelters affect the distribution of activity in time (i.e., diel activity) has been less studied in natural conditions. Here, we report results from a field study that used stream enclosures with either high or low shelter availability and stream-dwelling juvenile Arctic charr as a model species. We collected repeated measurements of individual activity 8 times a day (every 3 h) for six 24-h periods during a span of 9 days. In shelter-limited enclosures, fish were more active, became diurnal, and were active over a wider span of time each day, compared with fish with access to abundant shelters. In addition, fish were more aggregated and attacked prey over shorter distances and at lower rate when shelters were limited. Body mass did not affect individual activity rates, but smaller individuals extended their activity over longer periods, possibly as a result of interference competition, and were more isolated. Growth rates were similar across treatments and were positively correlated with individual activity rates and the average distance to the nearest competitor. However, additional nonmeasured effects on fitness may occur, such as increased predation risk associated with daytime feeding and extended activity in shelter-limited conditions.","[Larranaga, Nicolas; Steingrimsson, Stefan O.] Holar Univ Coll, Dept Aquaculture & Fish Biol, Haeyri 1, IS-550 Saudarkrokur, Iceland; [Larranaga, Nicolas] Univ Iceland, Inst Life & Environm Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland","Larranaga, N (corresponding author), Holar Univ Coll, Dept Aquaculture & Fish Biol, Haeyri 1, IS-550 Saudarkrokur, Iceland.",nicolas@mail.holar.is,"Steingrimsson, Stefan O/F-8797-2011","Larranaga, Nicolas/0000-0002-0796-0376",Icelandic Research Fund [120235021],This work was supported by the Icelandic Research Fund (120235021).,,80,13,15,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Analysis of predation traces produced by shell-drilling muricid snails on bivalve prey reveals that species interactions were substantially different before and after a Plio-Pleistocene mass extinction in the westerm Atlantic. Muricids edge- and wall-drilled their prey in the Pliocene, but Pleistocene and Recent snails attacked prey only through the shell wait. Experiments with living animals suggest that intense competition induces muricid snails to attack shell edges.

The most prevalent hypothesis explaining this relationship between fish density and shelter is that post-settlement predation causes greater mortality in areas with little shelter vs, areas with abundant shelter. This hypothesis was tested with a set of field experiments, in which the availability of shelter and exposure to predators were manipulated orthogonally. The effects of shelter and predators were measured for recruitment and survival of two temperate reef fishes: the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli Gilbert) and the blackeye goby (Coryphopterus nicholsii Bean). Shelter was manipulated by creating isolated l-mz reefs that were composed of three densities of rocks (16, 32 and 64 rocks/m(2)), which both species of goby used for shelter. A preliminary set of experiments done on reefs exposed to predators revealed that recruitment and survival of both fishes were positively affected by the density of rocks. The main set of experiments revealed the proximate causes of these effects of shelter. Replicate reefs of all three shelter treatments were either kept free of predators (enclosed in predator-exclosure cages) or exposed to predators (enclosed in partial cages). In Coryphopterus, survival and recruitment varied among shelter treatments on reefs exposed to predators, but not on reefs free of predators. This result indicates that shelter influenced the density of Coryphopterus by altering the impact of predators, thus supporting the prevailing hypothesis. In contrast, the effects of shelter on Lythrypnus were not caused solely by altering the impact of predation: survival and recruitment both varied among shelter treatments even when predators were absent. For survival of Lythrypnus, differences among shelter treatments were larger on reefs exposed to predators than on reefs free of predators, indicating that shelter did also modify the impact of predation. However, recruitment of Lythrypnus was affected similarly by shelter treatments regardless of whether predators were present or absent. Therefore, the effects of shelter were not caused by altering the impact of predators, and instead, it appeared that recruits responded directly to the abundance of shelter. These results indicate that for some reef fishes, positive relationships between abundance and shelter may not be caused by lower rates of predation in areas with abundant shelter. Instead, such relationships between abundance and shelter may be driven by prey preferences (exerted at or after the time of settlement) for areas with abundant shelter, or by use of shelter sites for purposes other than refuge from predators. Therefore, in the absence of any other evidence supporting a role of predation, positive relationships between the density of reef fishes and the abundance of shelter should not be construed as proof of the importance of predation in determining the abundance of reef fishes.

We investigated the factors presently associated with diversity of microhabitats (waterbodies) that may be maintaining the diversity of reproductive modes. In particular, desiccation, predation by fish, competition with other anurans and water quality were examined in 11 waterbodies as possible forces leading to the evolution of terrestrial oviposition. Predation experiments demonstrated that fish generally do not eat anuran eggs, and that predacious tadpoles and dytiscid beetle larvae are voracious predators of anuran eggs. The percentage of species with terrestrial oviposition was only weakly correlated with the occurrence of pond drying, pH and oxygen concentration, suggesting that anurans in this tropical community are able to use the range of water quality available for egg development. There was a tendency for terrestrial oviposition to be associated with the number of species of tadpoles using the waterbody, but we consider this to be spurious as there was no obvious competitive mechanism that could result in this relationship. The percentage of species with terrestrial oviposition was significantly positively related to our index of egg predation pressure, and negatively related to our index of fish biomass. Egg predation pressure was also negatively related to the index of fish biomass. These results allow us to discount as improbable the hypothesis that predation by fish on anuran eggs was an important selective pressure leading to terrestrial oviposition in this community. The strong positive relationship between terrestrial oviposition and our index of egg predation pressure indicates that these predators have exerted, and are exerting, a significant selective pressure for terrestrial oviposition. The strong negative relationship between the occurrence of fish and the egg predators suggests the surprising conclusion that the presence of fish actually protects aquatic anuran eggs from predation in this tropical system, and allows aquatic oviposition to dominate only in those waterbodies with moderate to high densities of fish. Our results suggest that terrestrial oviposition is a fixed predator avoidance trait.","INST NATL PESQUISAS AMAZONIA,BR-69083 MANAUS,AMAZONAS,BRAZIL; GRIFFITH UNIV,DIV AUSTRALIAN ENVIRONM STUDIES,NATHAN,QLD 4111,AUSTRALIA",,,"Magnusson, William E/J-9408-2014; Hero, Jean-Marc/A-4257-2010","Magnusson, William E/0000-0003-1988-3950; ",,,,70,121,135,0,31,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,86,3,,,,,310,318,,10.1007/BF00317595,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FK488,WOS:A1991FK48800002,28312915,,,,2021-09-27,

The large size is genetically determined, as ascertained by clutch exchange experiments between island and mainland nests. We conclude that the increased size of P. ater in places where it is geographically isolated from its larger congeners is the result of evolutionary adaptation, due ultimately to relaxed interspecific competition. On the islands, P. ater has evolved into a medium-sized generalist, with selection pressures likely governed by the following causal relationships. When competitors are lacking, P. ater takes over the foraging space of the absentees. The enlarged food base allows higher population densities, which intensifies intraspecific interference competition. This, in turn, selects for increased body size. When P. ater coexists with its larger congeners, it occupies peripheral foraging sites in trees, which requires excellent manoeuvrability and energy-expensive locomotion modes. Reduction of body size increases locomotor capacity for mechanical and aerodynamic reasons and lowers energy consumption, so small size is favoured in sympatry. But in geographic isolation, P. ater exploits the tree periphery less and the inner tree regions more, and it also adopts the easier locomotion modes of the absent species. Therefore, selection for manoeuvrability and a small body size is relaxed. The new selection regime shifts the balance between opposing selection forces towards a larger body size. We were able to test 11 alternative hypotheses and available evidence conclusively eliminates them all.

We compared micro- and macrohabitat selection of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) between areas with and without removal of the raccoon (Procyon lotor), a putative competitor, in a fragmented habitat in north-central Oklahoma. Live trapping conducted in 1998-2001 resulted in 482 total captures of opossums. Vegetation was sampled in summer (April-August) around trapsites associated with 235 of those captures. Ordination analyses indicated that opossums shifted microhabitat use toward eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) forest when density of raccoons was reduced. Geographic Information Systems analyses at the habitat-patch scale revealed no differences in habitat selection after raccoon reduction. Niche breadths were high for both species, but niche overlap varied by time and treatment. Overlap of habitat patches between raccoons captured preremoval and opossums captured postremoval was high, suggesting a shift in habitat selection. The niche shift by opossums and change in niche overlap between raccoons and opossums supported our competition hypothesis. We acknowledge our lack of replication, but note that our work represents the 1st report of experimental manipulation coupled with work at multiple scales to examine competitive relationships between these key mesopredators.","Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; Oklahoma State Univ, Oklahoma Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Hellgren, EC (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, 404 Life Sci W, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",,,"Hellgren, Eric/0000-0002-3870-472X",,,,75,12,13,2,26,ALLIANCE COMMUNICATIONS GROUP DIVISION ALLEN PRESS,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0022-2372,,,J MAMMAL,J.

The vulnerability of prey within populations may depend on habitat features that hinder predation, and increased density of conspecifics in both the immediate vicinity and the broader landscape. We evaluated the relative effects of physical habitat, local, and neighborhood prey density on predation by brown bears on sockeye salmon in a suite of 27 streams using hierarchical Bayesian functional response models. Stream depth and width were inversely related to the maximum proportion of salmon killed, but not the asymptotic limit on total number killed. Interannual variation in predation was density dependent; the number of salmon killed increased with fish density in each stream towards an asymptote. Seven streams in two geographical groups with ae<yen>23 years of data in common were then analyzed for neighborhood density effects. In most (12 of 18) cases predation in a stream was reduced by increasing salmon abundance in neighboring streams. The uncertainty in the estimates for these neighborhood effects may have resulted from interactions between salmon abundance and habitat that influenced foraging by bears, and from bear behavior (e.g., competitive exclusion) and abundance. Taken together, the results indicated that predator-prey interactions depend on density at multiple spatial scales, and on habitat features of the surrounding landscape. Explicit consideration of this context dependency should lead to improved understanding of the ecological impacts of predation across ecosystems and taxa.","[Quinn, Thomas P.; Cunningham, Curry J.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Cunningham, Curry J.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Wirsing, Aaron J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Quinn, TP (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",tquinn@uw.edu,,,seafood industry; National Science Foundation's BioComplexity and Coupled Natural and Human Systems programs; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Alaska Department of Fish and Game,"We gratefully acknowledge the late Donald Rogers, who initiated bear predation work in the Wood River system and played the key role in maintaining the long-term research program on sockeye salmon in Bristol Bay.

In inland Queensland, however, Noisy Miners dominate avian assemblages throughout extensive forest areas as well as fragmented landscapes, and our understanding of the factors influencing their behaviour and habitat selection in such relatively intact landscapes is limited. I investigated how road edges influenced Noisy Miners by comparing the species' aggressive and foraging behaviour, and location of nests, between road-edge and interior transects in a southern Queensland forest. I also investigated Noisy Miner foraging microhabitat preferences and targets of aggression. Noisy Miner nests were more likely to be located near to road edges, but foraging and aggressive interactions occurred with similar frequency near and far from road edges. Such interactions selectively targeted close competitors and a nest predator. Most foraging activity was in the canopy, and selectively within ironbarks (Eucalyptus spp.), suggesting that higher densities of Noisy Miners in more open areas of the forest are unlikely to be related to facilitation of ground-foraging activity. Despite some evidence of a preference for nesting near road openings, road edges do not appear to influence Noisy Miners as strongly as edges between forest and agricultural land do elsewhere in eastern Australia.","[Maron, Martine] Univ So Queensland, Australian Ctr Sustainable Catchments, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Maron, Martine] Univ So Queensland, Dept Biol & Phys Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia","Maron, M (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",m.maron@uq.edu.au,"Maron, Martine/D-9699-2011","Maron, Martine/0000-0002-5563-5789",University of Southern Queensland Early Career Researcher Grant,"I would like to thank Gloria Glass, Simon Kennedy and Andrea Kennedy for assistance in the field.

Modern theories of species coexistence recognize the importance of environmental heterogeneity. 2. Despite the existence of many observational studies, few experimental studies have evaluated the extent to which, and mechanisms by which, fixed spatial heterogeneity increases community diversity and alters community structure. 3 In experimental protist communities, we found that non-spatial mechanisms unrelated to heterogeneity were responsible for a large component of baseline diversity. Above this baseline, fixed spatial heterogeneity produced small but predictable increases in metacommunity diversity through species sorting, while heterogeneity and dispersal together altered local community structure (composition and relative abundance) through mass effects. 4. Our study illustrates that heterogeneity is not always the strongest driver of diversity, while experimentally demonstrating mechanisms by which heterogeneity alters community structure.","[Davies, Kendi F.; Holyoak, Marcel; Preston, Kim A.; Offeman, Valerie A.; Lum, Quenby] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Davies, KF (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, UCB 334, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",kendi.davies@colorado.edu,"Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009","Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627", [NSF-DEB 0414465],"Funding was provided by NSF-DEB 0414465 to MH.

Results were interpreted by using a competing risk analysis model, which uniquely enabled us to estimate the intrinsic patch-leaving decisions independently of external interruptions of foraging bouts by aggression. The experiment was conducted in two 1-ha field enclosures completely surrounded by rodent-proof fences and included allopatric (only Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) and sympatric (G. a. allenbyi and G. pyramidum) treatments. We predicted that increased food patch quality (i.e., habitat quality) should decrease intrinsic patch-leaving rates and increase rates of aggressive interactions involving the forager feeding in the patch (i.e., the occupant individual). We also anticipated that increasing population density should result in an increase in the rate of aggressive interactions involving the occupant individual. Our results supported the first two predictions, indicating a trade-off between foraging and aggression. However, the third prediction was realized only for G. a. allenbyi in allopatry. Furthermore, in allopatry, occupant G. a. allenbyi individuals with high competitive ranks were involved in aggressive interactions at lower rates than those with low competitive ranks. However, in sympatry, patch-use behavior of occupant G. a. allenbyi individuals was mainly influenced by aggressive behavior of G. pyramidum, which did not respond to their competitive rank. Thus, it should pay less for G. a. allenbyi to be aggressive in sympatric populations. The observed reduction in intraspecific aggression among individual G. a. allenbyi in the presence of G. pyramidum supports this assertion. We suggest that this reduction likely weakens the negative effect of intra- and interspecific density on the per capita growth rate of G. a. allenbyi. Because this would change the slope of the isocline of G. a. allenbyi, it could be an important mechanism promoting coexistence when habitat selection is constrained.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Ovadia, O (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",ofer.ovadia@yale.edu,"Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012","Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,34,26,26,2,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Previous studies have mainly focused on the risk for offspring. The effect of predation risk for the females has been considered in some taxa in which parents spend much time at an oviposition site for parental care or mating (e.g., birds, amphibians). In species in which females do not perform activities other than oviposition at sites, the effect of predation risk for females on oviposition site selection has been rarely investigated. We examined whether the predation risk for ovipositing females affects the decision on oviposition in the water strider Aquarius paludum insularis (Motschulsky) (Heteroptera: Gerridae). Adult A.paludum are preyed upon by a backswimmer, Notonecta triguttata (Motschulsky) (Heteroptera: Notonectidae), but N.triguttata does not prey upon eggs or early instars of A.paludum. We allowed female A.paludum to oviposit under one of three conditions: in presence of N.triguttata, in presence of its chemicals, and in absence of the predator or its cues (control). Female A.paludum less frequently oviposited in presence of N.triguttata than in its absence. Oviposition frequency did not differ between females in presence of chemicals of N.triguttata vs. those in the control. Female A.paludum recognized the predation risk upon themselves from the presence of N.triguttata and avoided ovipositing. This study is the first to directly show that the predation risk upon ovipositing females changes oviposition site selection in species in which the time spent at an oviposition site is short.","[Hirayama, Hiroyuki; Kasuya, Eiiti] Kyushu Univ, Dept Biol, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan","Hirayama, H (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Dept Biol, Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-1-10, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",hirohirayama@kyudai.jp,"Kasuya, Eiiti/B-6447-2013",,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [22370010, 25650149]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S9) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan","We wish to express our gratitude to all our colleagues at the Laboratory of Ecology, Kyushu University, for their help and encouragement.

The only large gastropods that occur in substantial quantities in the central Baltic proper are the freshwater snails Lymnaea peregra (O.F. Muller) and Theodoxus fluviatilis (L.); both are known to consume filamentous green and brown algae. The main objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that freshwater snails can exert substantial grazing pressure on juvenile and regenerating Fucus vesiculosus populations in the Baltic Sea. In laboratory experiments, both snail species were able to graze on F. vesiculosus germlings up to a size of approximately 0.8 to 1.0 mm. During the study period (autumn 1996 and spring and summer 1997), the largest F. vesiculosus germlings of the cohorts settled in September and May reached approximately 1.0 mm at the same time (July). Thus, to reach the 'safe' size and escape grazing requires about 8 mo for germlings setting in autumn but only 1 mo for germlings settling in spring. The survival and growth rate of new fronds from regenerating F. vesiculosus holdfasts in outdoor tank experiments were higher than for sexually recruited juveniles. After 1 yr, 95 % of the holdfasts had survived, and the mean length (+/- SE) of the largest frond on each holdfast was 12 +/- 2 mm. Grazing by L. peregra or T. fluviatilis did not affect regeneration or frond growth. During a long-term field study (1991 to 1994), an average of 8.5 +/- 0.7 T. fluviatilis ind. dm(-2) were found, with a maximum density of 40 ind. dm(-2) in September. During a 1 yr study (1996), the average density of L. peregra was comparatively low and varied from 0.5 ind. dm(-2) in April to 20 ind, dm(-2) in August. The higher density found in August (L. peregra) and in September (T. fluviatilis) suggests that both species may have a grazing impact during this time. We conclude that both. T, fluviatilis and L, peregra have the capacity to graze on zygotes and germlings of F. vesiculosus until they reach a safe size of approximately 0.8 to 1.0 mm. Both snail species can occasionally reach abundances high enough to affect the recruitment of F. vesiculosus. Freshwater snails do not affect the regeneration from holdfasts. However, because the time for germlings settled in autumn to reach a safe size is much longer than for germlings settled in spring, it is possible that even a low snail density has an impact on recruitment in the field. This will, however, require verification because levels of grazing activity during different times of the year are unknown.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10961 Stockholm, Sweden; Kalmar Univ, Dept Sci, S-39129 Kalmar, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10961 Stockholm, Sweden","Malm, T (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10961 Stockholm, Sweden.",torleif.malm@ng.hik.se,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012",,,,,33,35,36,0,16,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

This variability is hypothesised to result from variation in the trade-offs associated with avoiding predators. But critical information on fitness outcomes of these trade-offs associated with anti-predator behaviours is lacking. We tested this trade-off hypothesis in Aedes aegypti, by examining oviposition site selection decisions in response towards larval predation risk and comprehensively measuring the fitness implications of trade-offs of avoiding larval predators, using three fitness measures: larval survival, development time and size. In a field study, we find that adult females show a surprisingly variable response to predators, ranging from attraction to avoidance. This variation is explained by fitness outcomes of oviposition along a predation-risk gradient that we measured in the laboratory. We show that ovipositing females could gain fitness benefits from ovipositing in pools with a low density of predators, rather than in predator-free pools, as predators provide a release from negative density effects of conspecific larvae that might co-occur in a pool. Interacting selection pressures may thus explain diverse prey responses. We suggest other systems in which similarly unexpected prey behaviour is likely to occur.","[Sharma, Manvi; Guttal, Vishwesha; Isvaran, Kavita] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India; [Quader, Suhel] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore, Karnataka, India","Sharma, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India.",manvisharma@iisc.ac.in; suhelq@gmail.com; guttal@iisc.ac.in; kavita@iisc.ac.in,,,"Department of Biotechnology-Indian Institute of Science (DBT-IISc) partnership Grant; Department of Science and Technology-Fund for Improvement of S&T infrastructure (DST-FIST) Grant; Ministry of Human Resource Development-Indian Institute of Science for graduate scholarship; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology","We thank Mahalakshmi and Rajashree for maintenance of mosquito colony; Karthikeyan Chandrasegaran for discussions; Rishi Valley School and Indian Institute of Science for providing infrastructure.

Literature from a period of 18 years from 6 journals yielded a total of 25 predator and 41 herbivore abundance observations in experimental treatments with higher plant diversity compared to a control. These were divided into three size bins based on reported plot size. A clear pattern emerged for herbivore abundance whereby diversification experiments performed in small plots yielded a large negative effect on herbivores, intermediate sized plots showed an intermediate effect, and the largest plots exhibited a negligible effect. Predators were more abundant in medium sized diversified plots than in small ones, but, again, no effect could be discerned in the largest plots. These results suggest that past literature reviews and meta-analyses illustrating general trends of herbivore declines associated with increased vegetation diversity may be misleading. In particular, the effects of diversification appear to vary widely as a function of the spatial scale of vegetation plots. We speculate that effects of vegetation diversification may be enhanced when insects can move uninhibited among control and treatment plots in small scale experiments.

In coastal North Carolina, USA, this dominance by brown seaweeds is facilitated by omnivorous fishes, which feed both on red and green algae and on herbivorous amphipods that graze brown algae. When fish are removed in the field, brown seaweeds are replaced by red seaweeds, and herbivorous amphipods are more abundant. Using an array of large (similar to 4000 L) outdoor mesocosms, we tested three mechanistic hypotheses for this pattern: fish feeding facilitates brown algal dominance (1) by removing red and green algal competitors, (2) by removing amphipods and reducing their feeding on brown seaweeds, or (3) through an interaction of these mechanisms. Our experiments revealed strong impacts of both fish and amphipods, and a key role for the interaction, in structuring this community. When both fish and amphipods were removed (the latter with dilute insecticide), space was rapidly dominated and held for 17 weeks by fast-growing, primarily filamentous green algae. In contrast, when either fish, amphipods, or both were present, green algae were cropped to a sparse turf, and space was more rapidly dominated by larger macroalgae. The impacts of amphipods and fish on late-successional macroalgal assemblages were comparable in magnitude, but different in sign: red seaweeds prevailed in the amphipod-dominated treatment, whereas browns dominated in the presence of fish. Laboratory feeding assays and amphipod densities in the tanks suggested that the significant effects of amphipods were attributable largely, if not exclusively, to the single amphipod species Ampithoe longimana, which fed heavily on brown macroalgae. Our experimental removal of red and green algae failed to enhance cover of brown algae significantly; however, the latter reached substantially lower cover in the grazer-removal treatment, where green algae were very abundant, than in the fish-only treatment, where green algae were sparse. Thus, our results support the third hypothesis: fish-mediated dominance of brown algae involves both suppression of grazing amphipods and removal of algal competitors. Although collective impacts of fish and amphipods on this benthic community were generally comparable in magnitude, impacts normalized to each grazer's aggregate biomass were consistently higher for amphipods than for fish, sometimes by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Thus, the impacts of grazing amphipods (specifically A. longimana) on the benthic community were both strong and disproportionate to their biomass. These experimental results imply that grazing amphipods, which are ubiquitous in marine vegetation but poorly understood ecologically, may play important roles in the organization of benthic communities, particularly where predation pressure is low.","Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Duffy, JE (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",jeduffy@vims.edu,"Hay, Mark E/D-9752-2011; Duffy, J.

Field experimentation to identify density dependent effects is often cost and time prohibitive. Thus, assimilation of existing knowledge into a balance of probabilities can serve as a surrogate for experimental research. A case study of such a process is found in the mule deer Odocoileus hemionus herds of Colorado. Wildlife managers and hunters expressed concern over a recent decline in western Colorado mule deer herds, yet the underlying cause of this decline is yet to be determined. In response to this management concern, we conducted a review of scientific evidence on Colorado's mule deer population dynamics. This review was done in the context of a conceptual model that portrays population growth as a function of population size, per capita growth rate and population carrying capacity. Similar declines that occurred during the 1960s and early 1990s resulted in similar reviews that identified research and management topics that would benefit mule deer. These topics included: harvest, predation, intraspecific competition, disease, interspecific competition, and habitat loss and degradation. Between the late 1990s and present time, many of these topics were addressed by research. The conventional working hypothesis in Colorado is that mule deer herds are limited by winter range habitat. We identify new gaps in knowledge and suggest potential, future research topics, as well as potential management strategies. We suggest a focus on integrated studies of multiple herbivores with density reduction experiments to address intra- and inter- specific competition. In addition, we suggest focused experiments that address the roles of mountain lion predation, black bear predation, and disease in mule deer population dynamics.","[Bergman, Eric J.; Holland, A.

Its body size is a consequence of environmental characteristics and physiology. The aim of the study focused on the distribution of body size and densities of C. sphaericus in relation to environmental conditions represented by: (i) habitat types (elodeids, helophytes, and the open water); (ii) specific pond types (forest and field); (iii) pond size (surface area); (iv) the presence/lack of fish; and (v) physicochemical factors. Similar to large daphnids, in the case of the examined small water bodies, fish presence was responsible for a reduction of the body size of C. sphaericus in the zone of open water. More abundant crustacean communities and the presence of larger specimens were found among macrophytes, which indicated that aquatic vegetation offered optimal growth conditions as well as an effective refuge against fish predation. These facts reflect the necessity for maintaining a varied mosaic of habitats even in small water bodies such as the examined ponds. We found that not only the abundance of C. sphaericus but also its body size can be used as an bioindicator of environmental conditions as it preferred small and eutrophic ponds, particularly those with complex macrophyte cover (such as elodeids). Furthermore, the abundance pattern of zooplankton dominant species was affected by elodeids and fish presence as well as by the area of the ponds.","[Basinska, Anna M.; Swidnicki, Kasper; Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Water Protect, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Basinska, Anna M.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Meteorol, Poznan, Poland; [Basinska, Anna M.] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Lab Wetland Ecol & Monitoring, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Antczak, Marcin] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Behav Ecol, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Jassey, Vincent E.

A number of recent studies on birds have shown that individuals experiencing high levels of disturbance are frequently more aggressive than conspecifics living in less disturbed areas. Our study asked whether heterospecific aggression varied in Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana) breeding in artificial nest boxes over a gradient of human disturbance in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada. Unlike most previous studies, which have investigated effects of high disturbance (urbanization), our study focused on sites with lower rates of human disturbance, including ranch lands, vineyards, and recreational trails. Using decoys and playback, we measured the response of bluebird pairs to a simulated territory intrusion by one of two heterospecifics: a competing cavity nester, the House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), and a non-competing species, the American Goldfinch (Spinus tristus). We asked whether this response varied with the level of human disturbance experienced by the pair, and also whether aggression was correlated with female flight initiation distance (FID; a measure of boldness), local density of boxes in a territory, and presence of neighboring cavity-nesters. Overall, aggression was significantly higher towards the competitor stimulus (wren) than the non-competitor (goldfinch). Aggression towards the wren model did not change with disturbance level; however, aggression towards the goldfinch model increased significantly in more disturbed areas. Female FID did not vary across disturbance categories, but was correlated with aggression towards the wren, where individuals that responded more aggressively had marginally larger FIDs (i.e., behaved less boldly). Female FID was not correlated with aggression towards the goldfinch. Birds nesting in territories with more boxes tended to be more aggressive towards the wren, and birds nesting in territories with one or more box-nesting neighbors were significantly more aggressive towards the wren than birds without neighbors. Neither of these factors was correlated with aggression towards the goldfinch. Thus, the predicted association between disturbance and aggression was detected only in response to the non-competitor species (goldfinch), whereas aggression towards the competitor species (wren) varied with territory quality and number of competitors. Our study shows that variation in low levels of anthropogenic disturbance may be associated with behavioral effects in bird populations, and serves as a reminder that different factors may influence the expression of aggression in different contexts.","[Bhardwaj, Manisha; Dale, Catherine A.; Ratcliffe, Laurene M.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Bhardwaj, M (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Royal Bot Gardens Victoria, Australian Res Ctr Urban Ecol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",manisha.bhardwaj@live.ca,"Bhardwaj, Manisha/AAC-4268-2019","Bhardwaj, Manisha/0000-0001-7769-0845",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; North American Bluebird Society; Southern Interior Bluebird Trail Society; New York State Bluebird Society; Wilson Ornithological Society; Cooper Ornithological Society; Queen's University,"We thank T.

In salmonids, the mating systems are often characterised by fierce male-male competition, and the absence of paternal care is widely admitted in these species. However, the fact that brown trout eggs can be cannibalised by peripheral individuals just after spawning suggests that dominant males would benefit from protecting their offspring by keeping cannibals away from the nest. We used 77 field observations of brown trout spawning to document the defensive behaviour of dominant males towards peripheral individuals before and after spawning, and test whether this behaviour was related to the probability of the clutch being cannibalised. We showed that dominant males stayed on the nest and chased peripherals even after the eggs were laid and fertilised. The number of chases performed by dominant males during the 2 min following spawning was negatively correlated to the probability of egg cannibalism. This result indicates that brown trout males can provide direct benefits to females through protection against egg cannibalism by peripheral individuals.","[Tentelier, Cedric; Larrieu, Maider; Aymes, Jean-Christophe; Labonne, Jacques] UFR Sci & Tech Cote Basque, UMR Ecobiop, UPPA, F-64600 Anglet, France; [Tentelier, Cedric; Larrieu, Maider; Aymes, Jean-Christophe; Labonne, Jacques] INRA, UMR Ecobiop, Quartier Ibarron, St Pee Sur Nivelle, France","Tentelier, C (corresponding author), UFR Sci & Tech Cote Basque, UMR Ecobiop, UPPA, Allee Parc Montaury, F-64600 Anglet, France.",cedric.tentelier@univ-pau.fr,"Tentelier, Cedric/L-7195-2017; Tentelier, Cedric/AAH-6038-2019","Tentelier, Cedric/0000-0003-2178-4900; Labonne, Jacques/0000-0001-5953-3029; Aymes, Jean-Christophe/0000-0002-1181-3010",,,,34,7,7,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Various natural enemies may attack the cotton aphid in Bt cotton fields but no studies have identified potential specific top-down forces that could help manage this pest in the YRZ in China. In order to identify possibilities for managing the cotton aphid, we monitored cotton aphid population dynamics and identified the effect of natural enemies on cotton aphid population growth using various exclusion cages in transgenic Cry1Ac (Bt)+CpTI (Cowpea trypsin inhibitor) cotton field in 2011. The aphid population growth in the open field (control) was significantly lower than those protected or restricted from exposure to natural enemies in the various exclusion cage types tested. The ladybird predator Propylaea japonica Thunberg represented 65% of Coccinellidae predators, and other predators consisted mainly of syrphids (2.1%) and spiders (1.5%). The aphid parasitoids Aphidiines represented 76.7% of the total count of the natural enemy guild (mainly Lysiphlebia japonica Ashmead and Binodoxys indicus Subba Rao & Sharma). Our results showed that P. japonica can effectively delay the establishment and subsequent population growth of aphids during the cotton growing season. Aphidiines could also reduce aphid density although their impact may be shadowed by the presence of coccinellids in the open field (likely both owing to resource competition and intraguild predation). The implications of these results are discussed in a framework of the compatibility of transgenic crops and top-down forces exerted by natural enemy guild.","[Han, Peng; Niu, Chang-ying] Huazhong Agr Univ, Plant Sci & Technol Coll, Hubei Key Lab Insect Resources Applicat & Sustain, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Han, Peng; Desneux, Nicolas] INRA, French Natl Inst Agr Res, Sophia Antipolis, France","Niu, CY (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Plant Sci & Technol Coll, Hubei Key Lab Insect Resources Applicat & Sustain, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",niuchangying88@163.com; nicolas.desneux@sophia.inra.fr,"Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013; Han, Peng/Y-4457-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [IBN-31071690, 31371945]; International Atomic Energy AgencyInternational Atomic Energy Agency [16015, 17153]","Funding: This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant IBN-31071690, 31371945), and International Atomic Energy Agency (via Research Contract No. 16015, 17153 to CYN).

We conducted a field experiment on coral reef fishes in Moorea, French Polynesia, to quantify how differing levels of habitat availability (controlling for quality) increased and/or redirected colonizing larval fish. Focal reefs without neighboring reefs received two to four times more settlers than reefs with adjacent habitat, demonstrating that increased habitat redirected larval fish. At the scale of the entire reef array, total colonization increased 1.3-fold in response to a sixfold increase in reef area (and a 2.75-fold increase in adjusted habitat availability). Thus, propagules were both increased and redirected, a result midway between the Field-of-Dreams and Propagule Redirection Hypotheses. A recruitment model using our data and field estimates of density-dependent recruitment predicts that habitat addition increases recruitment primarily by ameliorating the negative effects of competition at existing sites rather than increasing colonization at the new sites per se. Understanding long-term implications of these effects depends upon the interplay among habitat dynamics, population connectivity, colonization dynamics, and density dependence.","[Stier, Adrian C.; Osenberg, Craig W.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Stier, AC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, POB 118525,223 Bartram Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",astier@ufl.edu,"Osenberg, Craig/M-9904-2013","Osenberg, Craig/0000-0003-1918-7904; Stier, Adrian/0000-0002-4704-4145",French American Culture Exchange; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312],"We thank S.

We sought to determine whether channel catfish negatively affect two other sport fishes (bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides) in Alabama's state public fishing lakes (ASPF lakes) through competition or predation. Using a variety of gears, we sampled channel catfish, largemouth bass, and bluegills in 12 ASPF lakes with variable channel catfish stocking and harvest rates. Four of these lakes were sampled more intensively to quantify the diets of these three species. Bioenergetics simulations were used to predict the annual consumption of channel catfish and largemouth bass populations of average density, size structure, and growth from these impoundments. Metrics of growth, condition, abundance, and population structure were not related between species. Latitude was negatively related to channel catfish growth. The diets of channel catfish and bluegills were moderately similar across all seasons in all lakes, while those of channel catfish and largemouth bass were highly dissimilar. Within species, diet similarity was high among lakes. Bioenergetics simulations suggest that the channel catfish populations in these lakes consume relatively little fish, particularly when compared with a typical largemouth bass population. We found little evidence of negative effects of channel catfish on the bluegill and largemouth bass populations in ASPF lakes, although largemouth bass growth and condition were poorest in the lake with the highest channel catfish stocking rate. However, current stocking and exploitation rates in most lakes appear to maintain channel catfish abundance below the level at which negative effects may occur.","[Leonard, D.

S. Atlantic Coast salt marshes, supports a food web that varies strongly across latitude. We tested whether latitudinal variation in plant quality (higher at high latitudes), consumption by omnivores (a crab, present only at low latitudes), consumption by mesopredators (ladybugs, present at all latitudes), or the life history stage of an herbivorous beetle could explain continental-scale field patterns of herbivore density. In a mesocosm experiment, crabs exerted strong top-down control on herbivorous beetles, ladybugs exerted strong top-down control on aphids, and both predators benefited plants through trophic cascades. Latitude of plant origin had no effect on consumers. Herbivorous beetle density was greater if mesocosms were stocked with beetle adults rather than larvae, and aphid densities were reduced in the adult beetle'' treatment. Treatment combinations representing high and low latitudes produced patterns of herbivore density similar to those in the field. We conclude that latitudinal variation in plant quality is less important than latitudinal variation in top consumers and competition in mediating food web structure. Climate may also play a strong role in structuring high-latitude salt marshes by limiting the number of herbivore generations per growing season and causing high overwintering mortality.","[Marczak, L.

We assume that the species are strongly interacting and that one or the other population is affected by the noise signal. Further assuming that a stable equilibrium with positive population densities exists, we are able to perform a complete frequency analysis of the system. If only one of the populations is subject to noise, the relative noise response by both populations is fully determined by the sign of a single element of the Jacobian matrix. The analysis is readily extended to cases when both species are affected by noise or when the food web has more than two species. The general conclusion about relative responses to noise is then less unambiguous, but the power spectra describing the frequency composition of the population variabilities are nevertheless completely determined. These results are entirely independent on the exact nature of the interaction (i.e., predation, competition, mutualism) between the populations. The results show that the interpretation of the color of ecological time series (i.e., the frequency composition of population variability over time) may be complicated by species interactions. The propagation of noise signals through food webs and the importance of web structure for the expected response of all parts of the web to such signals is a challenging field for future studies.","Univ Lund, Dept Theoret Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; Univ Helsinki, Div Populat Biol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Helsinki Univ Technol, Syst Anal Lab, FIN-02150 Espoo, Finland","Ripa, J (corresponding author), Univ Lund, Dept Theoret Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",jorgen.ripa@teorekol.lu.se,"Lundberg, Per/A-2479-2010","Lundberg, Per/0000-0002-9609-726X",,,,20,70,72,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5801 S ELLIS AVENUE, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

(Coleoptera, Cleridae) and its prey Ips typographus (L.) (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) were studied in the laboratory and the field. In the laboratory, 11 T. formicarius laid 71-132 eggs (mean = 162) during 66-123 days. During this time they ate 66-132 I. typographus adults per pair (male + female). The number of eggs laid per female was not correlated with life span or the number of Ips eaten. In the field, predation by T. formicarius larvae and other natural enemies on I. typographus brood was studied in the last year of an outbreak. Caged and uncaged spruce bolts attacked by I. typographus were used, and pairs of T. formicarius were released in the cages. The treatments were : uncaged bolts, caged bolts without T. formicarius, caged bolts with 4 T. formicarius pairs, and caged bolts with 8 T. formicarius pairs. The productivity of I. typographus was highest in the caged bolts without T. formicarius (mean = 4.5 offspring/female) and lowest in the uncaged bolts (mean = 0.9 offspring/female). The density of I. typographus galleries was similar in the different treatments. Hence, the variation in productivity between treatments could not have been due to differences in the levels of intraspecific competition. There was no difference in bark beetle productivity or density of T. formicarius larvae between bolts with 4 pairs of T. formicarius and bolts with 8 pairs (mean = 2.5 offspring/female). This indicates that some kind of interference occurred between T. formicarius individuals (e.g. cannibalism) and that a maximum level of predation was reached. Predation by larvae of Medetera spp. (Diptera, Dolichopodidae), Thanasimus spp. and other beetles, and parasitism by wasps (Hymenoptera, Pteromalidae) probably caused the low productivity in the uncaged bolts.","SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DIV FOREST ENTOMOL,POB 7044,S-75007 UPPSALA,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,27,39,43,0,12,LAVOISIER ABONNEMENTS,PARIS 08,"11 RUE LAVOISIER, F-75384 PARIS 08, FRANCE",0013-8959,,,ENTOMOPHAGA,Entomophaga,,1992,37,2,,,,,333,342,,10.1007/BF02372435,,,10,Entomology,Entomology,JG441,WOS:A1992JG44100021,,,,,2021-09-27,

The model assumes the classical foraging predation risk trade-offs: increased activity increases population growth rate, but it also increases mortality rate. The model considers three scenarios: prey only are adaptive, predators only are adaptive, and both species are adaptive. Under all these scenarios, the neutral stability of the classical Lotka-Volterra model is partially lost because the amplitude of maximum oscillation in species numbers is bounded, and the bound is independent of the initial population numbers. Moreover, if both prey and predators behave adaptively, the neutral stability can be completely lost, and a globally stable equilibrium would appear. This is because prey and/or predator switching leads to a piecewise constant prey ( predator) isocline with a vertical ( horizontal) part that limits the amplitude of oscillations in prey and predator numbers, exactly as suggested by Rosenzweig and MacArthur in their seminal work on graphical stability analysis of predator-prey systems. Prey and predator activities in a long-term run are calculated explicitly. This article shows that predictions based on short-term behavioral experiments may not correspond to long-term predictions when population dynamics are considered.","Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Ecol, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Krivan, V (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Ecol, Branisovska 31, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",krivan@entu.cas.cz,"Krivan, Vlastimil/F-1709-2010; Krivan, Vlastimil/J-7015-2019","Krivan, Vlastimil/0000-0003-0971-1231; ",,,,73,38,38,2,37,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Many animals invest a great amount of time and energy foraging. However, the sit-and-wait strategy is a common behaviour, which reduces the cost of moving by using perches. In the case of dung beetles, individuals of many species use leaves as perches. The factors for the selection of these perches are still unknown, but one hypothesis proposes that plant features may be key, creating an ecological animal-plant network. 2. We identified dung beetles and plant species in a tropical rain forest and measured the height and area of the leaves, and the body length for each species. We fitted linear regression models to test the relationship between the height and area of the leaf and a beetle's body size. We also analysed the number of perching interactions through a bipartite analysis to quantify the network modularity. 3. We collected 369 dung beetles of 21 species that were perching on 32 plant species. There were significant differences in the selection of perches related to dung beetle body size and functional group. Larger beetle species selected higher and larger leaves, whereas telecoprids perched on higher leaves than paracoprids. 4. Our findings show a distinct network of beetle-plant relationships with clear preferences by some dung beetles for particular plant species. The findings also suggest that the processes driving network structure lead to spatial segregation of dung beetle species. In conclusion, sit-and-wait behaviour is a common and apparently effective strategy for foraging, and reduces competition in dung beetles in tropical rain forests.","[Noriega, Jorge Ari] Univ Los Andes, Lab Zool & Aquat Ecol LAZOEA, Cra 1 18a-12, Bogota 110111, Colombia; [Noriega, Jorge Ari] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat MNCN CSIC, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Madrid, Spain; [March-Salas, Marti] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat MNCN CSIC, Dept Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Madrid, Spain; [March-Salas, Marti] King Juan Carlos Univ URJC, Escuela Int Doctorado, Madrid, Spain; [Pertierra, Luis R.] Univ King Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol, ESCET, Area Biodivers & Conservat, Madrid, Spain; [Vulinec, Kevina] Delaware State Univ, Dept Agr & Nat Resources, Delaware, DE USA","Noriega, JA (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Lab Zool & Aquat Ecol LAZOEA, Cra 1 18a-12, Bogota 110111, Colombia.",jnorieg@hotmail.com,"March-Salas, Marti/AAB-3273-2020; Pertierra, Luis R./AAA-2598-2020","Pertierra, Luis R./0000-0002-2232-428X; Noriega, Jorge Ari/0000-0003-1760-7020; MARCH-SALAS, MARTI/0000-0001-5347-4056","Colombian COLCIENCIAS PhD scholarship; FPI PhD Grant [BES-2013-062910, CGL2012-32459]",To the Japanese-Colombian cooperative agreement between the University of Los Andes and the University of Myiagi that existed during the field work.

A similar result occurred for O. rusticus, with only slightly higher densities on gravel-cobble substrates. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in the forward selection procedure reduced the number of environmental variables from 27 to five for the gravel-cobble data only. The second CCA revealed relationships between crayfish species abundance with percentage of urban land-use and stream-size related variables (e.g., temperature).

These detrimental nontarget effects motivate the use of alternative pest management strategies such as host plant resistance and intercropping. However, when alternative pest management strategies effectively suppress primary pests, they also have the potential to promote secondary pest populations via competitive release. The potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae) is a key pest of alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant cultivars are being widely adopted by growers in the Midwest and Northeast United States. We conducted a field experiment comparing leafhopper-susceptible alfalfa, leafhopper-resistant alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant alfalfa intercropped with orchardgrass. Leafhopper-resistant alfalfa reduced potato leafhopper abundance and protected the crop from protein loss, but there was no benefit of intercropping leafhopper-resistant alfalfa with orchardgrass. Importantly, the abundance of a secondary pest, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), was twice as high in the leafhopper-resistant plant treatments compared to the leafhopper-susceptible treatment. Field sampling and microcosm experiments confirmed that the increase in pea aphids was caused, at least in part, by release from competition with leafhoppers. These results suggest that, when host plant resistance against insects is employed, efforts to monitor and manage secondary pest populations are warranted.","[Straub, Cory S.] Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA; [Faselt, Jamie A.] AmeriCorps VISTA, Glacier Natl Pk,POB 125, East Glacier, MT 59343 USA; [Keyser, Erich S.] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Traugott, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Mt Agr Res, Technikerstr 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Straub, CS (corresponding author), Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA.",cstraub@ursinus.edu,,"Straub, Cory/0000-0002-2776-1817",AFRI-USDA-NIFA [2013-02482]; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank Matthew Wismer of Northern Star Farm for planting and managing the field experiment and Mark Sulc for advice on establishing the experimental plots.

Direct negative effects of invasive omnivores are well documented, but the indirect effects of resource competition or those caused by predator avoidance are unknown. Here we isolated and examined the independent and interactive effects of invasive omnivorous Black rats (Rattus rattus) and forest fragment size on the interactions between avian predators and their arthropod prey. Our study examines whether invasive omnivores and ecosystem fragment size impact: 1) the vertical distribution of arthropod species composition and abundance, and 2) the vertical profile of foraging behaviors of five native and two non-native bird species found in our study system. We predicted that the reduced edge effects and greater structural complexity and canopy height of larger fragments would limit the total and proportional habitat space frequented by rats and thus limit their impact on both arthropod biomass and birds' foraging behavior. We experimentally removed invasive omnivorous Black rats across a 100-fold (0.1 to 12 ha) size gradient of forest fragments on Hawaii Island, and paired foraging observations of forest passerines with arthropod sampling in the 16 rat-removed and 18 control fragments. Rat removal was associated with shifts in the vertical distribution of arthropod biomass, irrespective of fragment size. Bird foraging behavior mirrored this shift, and the impact of rat removal was greater for birds that primarily eat fruit and insects compared with those that consume nectar. Evidence from this model study system indicates that invasive rats indirectly alter the feeding behavior of native birds, and consequently impact multiple trophic levels. This study suggests that native species can modify their foraging behavior in response to invasive species removal and presumably arrival through behavioral plasticity.","[Rankin, Erin E.

Partial differential equation models provide a means of melding organism movement with population processes and have been used extensively to elucidate the effects of spatial variation on populations. While there has been an explosion of theoretical advances in partial differential equation models in the past two decades, this work has been generally neglected in mathematical ecology textbooks. Our goal in this paper is to make this literature accessible to experimental ecologists. Partial differential equations are used to model a variety of ecological phenomena; here we discuss dispersal, ecological invasions, critical patch size, dispersal-mediated coexistence, and diffusion-driven spatial patterning. These models emphasize that simple organism movement can produce striking large-scale patterns in homogeneous environments, and that in heterogeneous environments, movement of multiple species can change the outcome of competition or predation.","UNIV UTAH, DEPT MATH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT 84112 USA","HOLMES, EE (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT ZOOL, NJ-15, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.",,"Banks, John E./AAN-2300-2020; Banks, John/D-4194-2012; Lewis, Mark A/C-5015-2008; Lewis, Mark/A-2659-2014","Banks, John E./0000-0001-6793-7613; Lewis, Mark A/0000-0002-7155-7426; ",,,,117,494,505,4,134,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1994,75,1,,,,,17,29,,10.2307/1939378,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MP602,WOS:A1994MP60200003,,,,,2021-09-27,

We analyzed the reproductive biology, sexual dimorphism, feeding ecology, habitat use, and seasonal activity of Thamnodynastes hypoconia in its subtropical-temperate area of distribution. We discuss its main ecological traits in light of the competition and predation, and the deep-history hypotheses. Males and females attained sexual maturity at different body sizes, with females achieving the largest sizes. In this species, the males and females had no difference in the body size, and males had more ventral scales than did the females. The females' reproductive cycle was seasonal and not annual, with parturition occurring in summer, whereas the cycle of the males was continuous. Thamnodynastes hypoconia feeds mainly on amphibians (97%) and occasionally on lizards (3%). As in other Thamnodynastes snakes, hylid frogs were the most common type of prey consumed (34%). Thamnodynastes hypoconia is primarily a twilight-nocturnal species that inhabits wetlands (large rivers and their floodplains), where its prey is abundant. Its activity is seasonal, with a high number of individuals encountered during the warm months. The similarity between the natural history traits of T. hypoconia (anurophagy, seasonal reproductive cycle, aquatic and nocturnal habits) and other species of the genus suggests there is phylogenetic conservatism, mainly of its ecomorphological traits, which is a pattern commonly reported for Dipsadidae snakes.","[Bellini, Gisela P.; Arzamendia, Vanesa; Giraudo, Alejandro R.] Inst Nacl Limnol CONICET UNL, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Arzamendia, Vanesa; Giraudo, Alejandro R.] Univ Nacl Litoral, Fac Humanidades & Ciencias, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina","Bellini, GP (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Limnol CONICET UNL, Paraje El Pozo S-N,Ciudad Univ, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina.",giselabellini@yahoo.com.ar,,,"CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PEI 6129, PIP 6487, PIP 2011]; Universidad Nacional del Litoral [CAI+D 2005 PE249, CAI+D 2009 I-PJ383, CAI+D 2009 II-PI234]; ANPCYTANPCyT [PICT 2002 01-12831, PICT 2005 15-23191]","For financial support, we thank CONICET (PEI 6129, PIP 6487, PIP 2011), the Universidad Nacional del Litoral (CAI+D 2005 PE249, CAI+D 2009 I-PJ383, CAI+D 2009 II-PI234), and ANPCYT (PICT 2002 01-12831, PICT 2005 15-23191).

Here, we replicated an experiment across three climatically different habitat types to describe how these small-scale processes (microclimate and predation) are affected by macroclimatic variability at a larger spatial scale (among habitats). Each week for eight weeks during the summer of 1993, 18 Agaricus bisporus mushrooms were placed on dry, moist, or wet potting soil, within predator access or predator exclusion treatments cups, at six sites in the piedmont of South Carolina, USA. Two sites were moist hemlock ravines and four sites were dry ridgetops, Mushrooms and soil were collected after one week and fly metamorphs were counted and sorted by species, We described the effects of ant predation, soil moisture, site and week on the frequency of host use, metamorph abundance, and Simpson's diversity. All three measures were affected by macroclimatic differences among sites and across weeks, At wet sites and during rainy weeks, more mushrooms were used, more metamorphs emerged, and the communities were more diverse than at dry sites or during dry periods. The small-scale effect of soil moisture was strongly affected by large-scale macroclimatic conditions. In dry ridgetop sites and in dry weeks, abundance and diversity increased with increasing soil moisture. In moist sites: or juring rainy weeks, however, soil moisture was unimportant and had no effect on abundance or community structure. Predation was unaffected by large-scale differences in climate, hut was affected by small-scale differences in soil moisture; becoming more intense as soil moisture increased. This research demonstrates that the effect of climate on predation is a scale-dependent phenomenon, and that microclimatic effects are mediated by climatic conditions at larger spatial scales. We relate these findings re, hierarchical theory and hypotheses concerning the relative effects of tolerances, competition, and predation under different levels of environmental stress.",,"WORTHEN, WB (corresponding author), FURMAN UNIV,DEPT BIOL,POINSETT HWY,GREENVILLE,SC 29613, USA.",,,,,,,45,8,9,0,2,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,SEP,1995,18,3,,,,,248,258,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1995.tb00128.x,,,11,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TE525,WOS:A1995TE52500006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Recent changes in both climate and vertebrate community assemblages have created a unique opportunity to examine the impacts of two dynamic forces on population regulation. We examined the effects of warming winter conditions and the reestablishment of a previously extirpated predator, the fisher (Martes pennanti), on regulatory mechanisms in a northern-adapted mammal, the porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), along their southern range boundary. Using a long-term (17-year) capture-recapture data set, we (1) quantified the impacts of climate change and increased fisher predation on the survival of adult porcupines at their regional southern terminus, (2) assessed recruitment (via both adult fecundity and juvenile survival) of porcupines, and (3) modeled the relative importance of predation and winter conditions on the demography and population growth rate (lambda). Severe winters and abundant predators interacted synergistically to reduce adult survivorship by as much as 44%, while expanding predator populations led to near reproductive failure among porcupines. Increasing predatory pressure, disruptions in this community module, and more frequent extreme winter weather events led to predicted extirpation within 50 years, whereas in the absence of predators, the population was viable. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding behind distributional shifts resulting from climate change and may be broadly relevant for predicting future distributional shifts in other northern-adapted mammalian species.","[Pokallus, John W.; Pauli, Jonathan N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Pokallus, JW (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jnpauli@wisc.edu,,,Plum Creek Foundation; University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; University of Wisconsin-Madison Graduate School Fall Competition,"We sincerely thank Richard P.

Metapopulation microcosms were constructed to test the effect of four different types of habitat heterogeneity on the dynamics and dispersal in spatially extended systems; homogeneity, spatial heterogeneity, temporal heterogeneity and spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Resources were distributed across discrete habitat patches in bruchid beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus) metapopulations, and long-term time series were recorded. 2. Mathematical models were fitted to the long-term time series from the experimental systems using a maximum likelihood approach. Models were composed of separate birth, death, emigration and immigration terms all of which incorporated stochasticity drawn from different probability distributions. Models with density-dependent and density-independent birth, death and emigration terms were investigated and, in each case, the model that best described the empirical data was identified. 3. At the local scale, population sizes differed between patches depending on the type of heterogeneity. Larger populations were associated with higher resource availabilities. As a result of this, the variation between local population sizes was greatest when there was spatial heterogeneity in which mean resource abundance varied from patch to patch. Variation in population sizes within patches was largest when there was temporal heterogeneity. 4. Density-dependent processes leading to the regulation of local population dynamics in our experimental systems were strongest in homogeneity or temporal heterogeneity treatments. Associated with this, we found that these systems were best described using mathematical models with density dependence acting on mortality. In contrast, spatial and spatio-temporal time series were adequately described using density-independent population processes. 5. Experimental metapopulations showed varying degrees of density-dependent dispersal. Local net dispersal each week was primarily driven by the local population size and secondarily affected by neighbourhood population density. Mathematical population models illustrated the importance of explicit description of density-dependent dispersal in all systems except the homogeneous metapopulations.","[Strevens, Chloe M.

Although these indirect effects have been shown to mediate trophic cascades in ecological communities, our understanding of how habitat refuge influences the strength and direction of cascading effects is limited. We examined whether or not oyster toadfish (top predator) affect mud crab (intermediate predator) foraging on juvenile hard clams (infaunal prey) in oyster reefs, a physically complex habitat that can provide refuge for both intermediate predators and basal prey. In particular, we manipulated toadfish presence in mesocosms containing experimental oyster reefs and quantified both mud crab and juvenile clam mortality. Toadfish significantly reduced mud crab foraging on clams and increased clam survivorship even though mud crabs foraging on the surface of the reef sought refuge from toadfish deeper within the oyster-shell matrix where they were more proximal to clams. This counterintuitive result suggests, that toadfish suppression of mud crab foraging activity is far stronger than toadfish-avoidance behavior that potentially increases crab-clam encounter rates. Therefore, TMIIs can reinforce trophic cascades even in refuge habitats where intermediate predators and their prey are physically isolated from top predators. Determining the generality of cascading effects on lower trophic levels within refugia will require investigating how habitat refuge affects the relative importance of TMIIs.","Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Grabowski, JH (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA.",jgrabowski@gmri.org,,"Grabowski, Jonathan/0000-0003-4711-5481",,,,48,85,87,4,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2005,86,5,,,,,1312,1319,,10.1890/04-1216,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,924DW,WOS:000228960000026,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, under some circumstances the evolutionary response to a gradient may be opposite of the ecological response, a phenomenon known as countergradient variation. We had previously predicted that counter-gradient selection has occurred in pumpkinseed sunfish in response to a resource gradient created by competition with bluegill sunfish. Because competition only occurs when pumpkinseed are small, rapid growth has evolved to allow passage through the competing size classes as quickly as possible. We performed a common-garden experiment using juvenile pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill and from lakes without bluegill. Pumpkinseed were raised in cages without bluegill, or with a low density of bluegill, or with a high density of bluegill. Bluegill significantly decreased growth for all pumpkinseed, following the predicted ecological gradient. However, pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill grew faster than those from lakes without bluegill under all treatments, following the predicted evolutionary response.","SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Arendt, JD (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",,,,,,,32,60,65,0,24,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1999,80,8,,,,,2793,2798,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2793:CSFRGI]2.0.CO;2,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,264VR,WOS:000084204100028,,,,,2021-09-27,

Interactions between two freshwater protists, Colpidium striatum (the intraguild prey) and Blepharisma americanum (the intraguild predator), in laboratory microcosms support the predictions of intraguild predation theory. Colpidium competitively excluded Blepharisma when bacterial production was low, even though Blepharisma had a potential advantage conferred by its ability to consume Colpidium. In contrast to competitive exclusion at low productivity, Colpidium and Blepharisma coexisted for many generations at higher levels of bacterial production. Theory predicts a similar transition from competitive exclusion to coexistence as productivity increases, if intraguild predators use resources less efficiently than intraguild prey/competitors. Other experiments showed that Colpidium depresses bacterial densities more than Blepharisma, a result consistent with greater efficiency of resource utilization by Colpidium. These results indicate that simple mathematical models can provide important insights into the population dynamics of intraguild predators and prey under different levels of productivity.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Morin, P (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",pjmorin@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,45,110,114,0,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1999,80,3,,,,,752,760,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0752:PIPAPD]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,228UP,WOS:000082154300002,,,,,2021-09-27,

The influence of maternal condition on the size and quality of larvae at dispersal was examined for the tropical damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, through a series of field studies during 1994. In this species, males guard a demersal nest of eggs contributed to by nearby females. The largest and most dominant female stays near the nest and contributes most to the egg clutches, limiting egg contributions from subordinate females. Maternal effects dramatically influenced the size of larval progeny at hatching, four days after laying. Much of the variability in progeny size was explained by levels of the stress-associated steroid hormone, cortisol, in the female. A field experiment manipulating maternal levels of cortisol found that cortisol levels strongly influenced the morphology and yolk size of larval progeny at hatching. Variation in the density of egg predators and competitors together explained 38% of the observed variance in maternal cortisol levels. These competitors and predatory fish appear to elevate maternal cortisol levels and consequently influence larval morphology through a stress-related response. This study suggests that the behavioral interaction regime of a fish population can determine larval quality and potentially govern a female's contribution to the next generation.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",,,,74,170,174,2,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1998,79,6,,,,,1873,1883,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1873:BIMSIA]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,116YM,WOS:000075752700003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Here, we document a field experiment that examines whether the presence of top-predator cues (visual and chemical stimuli from a coral trout) can cascade to indirectly influence the behaviour and survival of juvenile fish prey of different species (Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. chrysurus) and size (small = 1.18 cm SL versus large = 1.32 cm SL). Results showed that habitat patches exposed to top-predator cues received fewer visits and foraging attacks from mesopredators, leading to higher space use (similar to 46%), feeding rate (similar to 95%) and survival (similar to 67%) from juvenile fish prey. Survival was always higher for individuals of P. amboinensis and of large-size, independent of the presence or absence of top-predator cues. Our data indicate that predation risk from the top-predator indirectly favoured the persistence and behaviour of juvenile fishes by promoting risk-averse behavioural responses in mesopredators. This study underscores the behavioural mechanisms by which risk effects can cascade through the food web and highlights the consequences that harvesting top-predators may have on the replenishment of bottom prey populations.","[Palacios, Maria del Mar; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Palacios, Maria del Mar] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Palacios, MD (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",maria.palaciosotero@my.jcu.edu.au,"; McCormick, Mark/J-8301-2014","Palacios, Maria/0000-0002-5450-674X; McCormick, Mark/0000-0001-9289-1645",Ian Potter Doctoral Fellowship at Lizard Island; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,This project was funded through an Ian Potter Doctoral Fellowship at Lizard Island awarded to MMP and an Australian Research Council grant to MIM.,,71,1,1,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2021,130,2,,,,,219,230,,10.1111/oik.07731,,NOV 2020,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QA8IC,WOS:000587976200001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Such a model allows us to explore different ecological scenarios (donor control vs. top-down control) by changing a single parameter. The response to habitat destruction is qualitatively the same for both predator and prey, although there are interesting differences linked to the trophic position. A similar decrease in the colonization rate affects the two species quite differently. Predators diminish faster than prey, and furthermore, the fraction of occupied sites decreases more sharply as colonization rates are lowered, i.e. there is a nonlinear relationship between regional abundance and colonization rate. There is a well-defined threshold in the colonization rate below which the predator becomes extinct. Thus, dispersal rate is critical for predicting the consequences of habitat destruction. Finally, these results are compared with the behavior of a spatially explicit simulation. The only difference between the analytical model and the simulation is that colonization is no longer a global phenomenon in the latter, but it is a local process, constrained to the nearest patches. The bulk of the results are similar to the mean field behavior, and we comment on some differences related with non-homogeneity and real space. Some general implications for conservation biology and biological control are outlined.

Compensatory density dependence is an essential condition for population regulation. Thus, understanding whether and how introduced predators alter the relationship between prey density and mortality can aid in predicting the ecological consequences of invasion. Here, we investigate the effects of invasive Indo-Pacific red lionfish Pterois volitans on density-dependent mortality patterns previously documented for a common native Atlantic prey species, the fairy basslet Gramma loreto. By repeating a pre-invasion density manipulation experiment, here in the context of predation by both native piscivores and lionfish, we provide a before-and-after comparison quantifying changes in prey mortality since the introduction of lionfish. Per capita loss of fairy basslet remained density-dependent in the presence of lionfish, but the overall magnitude of loss was higher compared to pre-invasion rates. In the presence of lionfish, 7 of 16 local basslet populations experienced greater than 50% loss over the 8 wk study duration, but there was no evidence of a difference in the slope of the density-mortality curve between pre- and post-introduction experiments. Thus, our experiment revealed a density-independent increase in per capita mortality rates since the start of the invasion. We conclude that local fairy basslet populations are facing an elevated risk of extirpation as a result of increased predation, and suggest that different predator foraging behavior and/or prey naivete may explain the altered prey mortality patterns observed after the lionfish invasion.","[Ingeman, Kurt E.; Webster, Michael S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Ingeman, KE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 3029 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",ingemank@science.oregonstate.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-08-51162, OCE-12-33027]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Division Of Ocean SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1233027] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants to M.

Previous studies have shown that the removal of large herbivorous mammals from large-scale, replicated experimental plots results in a dramatic increase in the density of small mammals, an increase that has been attributed to the relaxation of competition between rodents and large herbivores for food resources. To assess whether the removal of large herbivores also influenced a predator of small mammals, we measured the abundance of the locally common olive hissing snake, Psamniophis mossainbicus, over a 19-mo period in plots with and without large herbivores. Psammophis mossambicus was significantly more abundant in plots where large herbivores were removed and rodent numbers were high. Based on results from raptor surveys and measurements of vegetative cover, differences in snake density do not appear to be driven by differences in rates of predation on snakes. Instead, snakes appear to be responding numerically to greater abundances of small-mammal prey in areas from which large herbivores have been excluded. This is the first empirical demonstration of the indirect effects of large herbivores on snake abundance and presents an interesting example of how the influence of dominant and keystone species can move through a food web.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Bard Coll, Dept Biol, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya","McCauley, DJ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dougm@stanford.edu,,,,,,42,59,60,2,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2006,87,10,,,,,2657,2663,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2657:IEOLHO]2.0.CO;2,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,098XU,WOS:000241557900025,17089673,,,,2021-09-27,

However, when such legacy effects have been explicitly explored, they most often involve the long-term direct effects of species on systems, as opposed to the indirect effects. Here, we explore how a legacy of small mammal exclusion on the abundance of a shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), influences the abundance of a native land snail (Helminthoglypta arrosa) in coastal prairie and dune habitats in central California. The factors that limit populations of land snails are very poorly known despite the threats to the persistence of this group of species. In grasslands, prior vole (Microtus californicus) exclusion created long-lasting gains in bush lupine abundance, mediated through the seedbank, and was associated with increased snail numbers (10x) compared to control plots where mammals were never excluded. Similar plots in dune habitat showed no difference in snail numbers due to previous mammal exclusion. We tested whether increased competition for food, increased predation, and/or lower desiccation explained the decline in snail numbers in plots with reduced lupine cover. Tethering experiments supported the hypothesis that voles can have long-lasting impacts as ecosystem engineers, reducing woody lupine habitat required for successful aestivation by snails. These results add to a growing list of studies that have found that non-trophic interactions can be limiting to invertebrate consumers.","[Huntzinger, Mikaela] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Excellence Teaching & Learning, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Huntzinger, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Excellence Teaching & Learning, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",pmhuntzinger@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,28,4,5,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2011,167,4,,,,,1085,1091,,10.1007/s00442-011-2054-5,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,849OB,WOS:000297133800020,21691854,,,,2021-09-27,

Thus, similar-sized carnivores are likely to compete for food. We compared the summer diets of snow leopards Panthera uncia and wolves Canis lupus in Sarychat-Ertash Reserve in the Tien-Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan, based on analysis of genetically confirmed scats. Abundances of the principal prey species, argali Ovis ammon and Siberian ibex Capra sibirica, were estimated from field surveys. The diets consisted of few species, with high interspecific overlap (Pianka's index = 0.91). Argali was the predominant prey, with > 50% frequency of occurrence in both snow leopard and wolf scats. This was followed by Siberian ibex and marmots Marmota baibacina. Being largely unavailable, remains of livestock were not detected in any of the scats. In the snow leopard diet, proportions of argali and ibex were in line with the relative availabilities of these animals in the Reserve. This was in contrast to the diet of wolf, where argali occurred according to availability and ibex was significantly underrepresented. The high diet overlap indicates that the two predators might compete for food when the diversity of profitable, large prey is low. Competition may be more intense in winter, when marmots are not available. Hunting of argali and ibex outside the Reserve may be unsustainable and therefore reduce their abundances over time. This will affect both predators negatively and intensify competition for food. Reduction in ibex populations will directly affect the snow leopard, and the wolf is likely to be indirectly affected as a result of increased snow leopard predation of argali.","[Jumabay-Uulu, Kubanychbek] Snow Leopard Fdn Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Wegge, Per] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Mishra, Charudutt; Sharma, Koustubh] Snow Leopard Trust, Mysore, Karnataka, India; [Mishra, Charudutt; Sharma, Koustubh] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore, Karnataka, India","Wegge, P (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway.",per.wegge@umb.no,,,Panthera; Snow Leopard Trust,"The study was funded by Panthera and the Snow Leopard Trust.

Although direct killing of leopards by lions has been recorded, avoidance behaviour is an important part of leopard ecology that is difficult to measure through direct observation. Using tracking data from simultaneously collared lions and leopards, we investigated the effect of lion proximity on the behavioural ecology of leopards. We show that proximity to lions influenced leopard habitat use, transition probability and behaviour. Within enclosed habitats, lions were allowed to get closer to leopards before leopards engaged in a flight response. Visual observation data suggest that lions and leopards infrequently come into direct contact. However, tracking data indicate that avoidance was based on relative habitat cover and detectability, and as a result the two species were often located within close proximity. Finding new signals of interaction and avoidance within two well-studied predators with relatively small sample sizes suggests that this approach may have value to other systems, such as predator/prey interactions, or relationships between sympatric species, and at a scale hitherto not possible. This could be used to investigate the costs and benefits of animal foraging where competitive exclusion may occur, and is relevant for the large number of animals that are difficult to observe.

Contrary to our prediction, haying pikas did not switch preferences for forage species of different nutritional quality as predation risk increased. However, the total amount of forage removed was inversely related to risk, and the addition of cover at treatments of greatest potential risk ameliorated the negative effects of higher predation risk.

Chloride levels in many lakes, streams, and wetlands exceed the chronic and acute thresholds established by the United States and Canada for the protection of freshwater biota. Few studies have identified the impacts of deicing salts in stream and wetland communities and none have examined impacts in lake communities. We tested how relevant concentrations of road salt (15, 100, 250, 500, and 1000mgCl(-)/L) interacted with experimental communities containing two or three trophic levels (i.e., no fish vs. predatory fish). We hypothesized that road salt and fish would have a negative synergistic effect on zooplankton, which would then induce a trophic cascade. We tested this hypothesis in outdoor mesocosms containing filamentous algae, periphyton, phytoplankton, zooplankton, several macroinvertebrate species, and fish. We found that the presence of fish and high salt had a negative synergistic effect on the zooplankton community, which in turn caused an increase in phytoplankton. Contributing to the magnitude of this trophic cascade was a direct positive effect of high salinity on phytoplankton abundance. Cascading effects were limited with respect to impacts on the benthic food web. Periphyton and snail grazers were unaffected by the salt-induced trophic cascade, but the biomass of filamentous algae decreased as a result of competition with phytoplankton for light or nutrients. We also found direct negative effects of high salinity on the biomass of filamentous algae and amphipods (Hyalella azteca) and the mortality of banded mystery snails (Viviparus georgianus) and fingernail clams (Sphaerium simile). Clam mortality was dependent on the presence of fish, suggesting a non-consumptive interactive effect with salt. Our results indicate that globally increasing concentrations of road salt can alter community structure via both direct and indirect effects.","[Hintz, William D.; Mattes, Brian M.; Schuler, Matthew S.; Jones, Devin K.; Stoler, Aaron B.; Lind, Lovisa; Relyea, Rick A.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, Dept Biol Sci, 110 8th St, Rensselaer, NY 12180 USA","Hintz, WD (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, Dept Biol Sci, 110 8th St, Rensselaer, NY 12180 USA.",hintzwd@gmail.com,,,Jefferson Project at Lake George; International Business Machines (IBM)International Business Machines (IBM); Fund for Lake George; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"This study was funded by the Jefferson Project at Lake George, which is supported by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, International Business Machines (IBM), and The Fund for Lake George.

Experimental studies have shown that metamorph size is highly plastic, depending upon larval density and environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, food supply, water quality, chemical cues from conspecifics, predators and competitors). To test the hypothesis that this developmental plasticity is adaptive, or to determine if inducing plasticity can be used to control an invasive species, we need to know whether or not a metamorphosing anuran's body size influences its subsequent viability. For logistical reasons, there are few data on this topic under field conditions. We studied cane toads (Rhinella marina) within their invasive Australian range. Metamorph body size is highly plastic in this species, and our laboratory studies showed that larger metamorphs had better locomotor performance (both on land and in the water), and were more adept at catching and consuming prey. In mark-recapture trials in outdoor enclosures, larger body size enhanced metamorph survival and growth rate under some seasonal conditions. Larger metamorphs maintained their size advantage over smaller siblings for at least a month.

Based on an attempt to review the world-wide literature on these topics, it appears that both of these views have merit but could benefit from additional attention and clarification. The term estuarine dependency is used in a variety of ways depending on the author and context and even how one defines estuary. Further, and perhaps most importantly, we often lack the comparative data on habitat use by fishes in the ocean vs. the estuary to make judgments about dependency. To that end we have analyzed the distribution patterns of fish species along the estuarine-coastal ocean ecotone in southern New Jersey, U.S. to evaluate the fish response. As a result, it appears the degree of estuarine use is quite variable among species, as well as at geographic, annual and cohort-specific scales. Thus, further synthesis is necessary and it might focus on: first, more information on fish use in different types of estuaries across a broad geographical range; second, a better understanding of the functional significance of habitats across the habitat landscapes of the estuary-ocean ecotone; third, any further synthesis needs to incorporate of the role of biotic variables (e.g. predation, competition) in order to enhance our understanding of the degree of estuarine dependency; fourth, we need to determine how freshwater flow into estuaries might influence habitat use especially with regard to the potential role of the offshore estuary.

Pairs of C. maculata larvae suppressed aphids better than pairs of C. carnea larvae or heterospecific larval pairs and yielded the highest rate of plant survival. IGP by C. carnea larvae occurred mostly in the first instar, whereas C. maculata larvae were more aggressive in later instars. Although C. carnea was the superior intraguild predator, winning 62.7% of contests in microcosms, this value increased to 88.9% when the experiment was repeated in petri dishes without plant material, regardless of whether greenbugs or eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller were offered as focal prey. Provision in petri dishes of the sessile, higher quality prey (Ephestia) as opposed to greenbugs, improved the survival of solitary larvae and delayed cannibalism and IGP until later developmental stages in both species. Larvae of C. maculata that cannibalized took longer to develop and weighed less at pupation, independent of the arena or prey offered. Although larvae of C. carnea did not pay a cost for cannibalism or IGP in microcosms, there were some negative developmental effects of IGP in petri dishes, particularly on the Ephestia diet. These results illustrate how the plant, as a substrate, can mediate the strength of IGP interactions and how the relative suitability of the focal prey can influence both the timing and consequences of cannibalism and IGP.","[Michaud, J.

About 10-12 million birds per year use the area for foraging and consume about 25%-45% of the standing stock of macrozoobenthos. However, little is known about the influence of birds on the entire ecosystem. We conducted ecological network analysis (ENA) on an important bird breeding and resting site, the Norderaue tidal basin in the northern German Wadden Sea, to determine the influence of birds on the entire food web. The model was based on the yearly average biomass of system compartments empirically sampled every season at the study site. The analysis revealed a complex and well-connected food web (high flow diversity and effective link-density) dominated by short pathways but with a high throughput of energy. The system's energy had a high degree of freedom for its development. However, there is a strong dependency on external imports of phytoplankton due to the dominance of suspension feeders suggested by a low recycling and the detritivory to herbivory ratio. A large variety of bird species uses the area for foraging and induces a negative impact on their prey items revealed by the mixed trophic impact analysis. The food sources and also the competitors of the birds' prey items were positively influenced by the birds via indirect pathways in the network. Furthermore, there is a negative impact among the bird compartments probably due to competition between the bird species. A sensitivity analysis, conducted by changing the bird biomass in the model, revealed only small changes in the activity, complexity and connectivity of the system. The linkage to other system components could amplify these changes in the system functioning. It is therefore recommended to include birds in coastal food web studies which has rarely been done before. The use of holistic approaches such as ENA would facilitate decisions on management measures by providing a simplified representation of the entire ecosystem including all direct and indirect connections between the system components.","[Horn, Sabine; de la Vega, Camille; Asmus, Ragnhild; Asmus, Harald] Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt Hafenstr 43, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany; [Schwemmer, Philipp; Enners, Leonie; Garthe, Stefan] Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr, Hafentorn 1, D-25761 Busum, Germany; [Haslob, Holger] Thunen Inst Sea Fisheries, Herwigstr 31, D-24572 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Binder, Kirsten] State Agcy Agr, Environm & Rural Areas Schleswig Holstein, Hamburger Chaussee 25, D-24220 Flintbek, Germany; [de la Vega, Camille] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England","Horn, S (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt Hafenstr 43, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany.",sabine.horn@awi.de,"Horn, Sabine/L-2689-2017; Asmus, Ragnhild/O-2397-2017; Asmus, Harald/O-2417-2017","Horn, Sabine/0000-0003-1637-1191; Asmus, Ragnhild/0000-0003-3300-6065; Garthe, Stefan/0000-0003-0548-9346; Asmus, Harald/0000-0002-7772-1303; Schwemmer, Philipp/0000-0002-3930-2845",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [FKZ 03F0672D],"This study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the frame of the German joint research project STopP - From sediment to top predator (BMBF, FKZ 03F0672D).

These bottom-up effects may involve important ecological processes that affect pest control. For example, population densities of natural enemies may increase when alternative preys are favoured by a new resource. 2 Ants, particularly Solenopsis geminata Forel (Myrmicinae), are recognized as effective predators of herbivores eggs. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of a primary resource in a banana agroecosystem will increase pest control of the banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) by ants. 3 Using stable isotope analyses, we showed that S. geminata used the new resource pathway provided by the addition of a cover crop. This change was revealed by increased d13C values (13C/12C) in a cover crop treatment (C4 plant) compared with a banana (C3 plant) in bare soil treatment. 4 We also showed that the abundance of S. geminata, as measured with pitfall traps, was 4.85.4-fold higher in the cover crop treatment than in the bare soil treatment. Estimation of egg predation rates was in the range 7.870.3%, which occurred in plots with the lowest and highest S. geminata numbers, respectively. 5 The addition of a new primary resource in this system changed the origin of the carbon consumed by predators and increased their densities. The increased ant abundance resulted in increased predation of weevil eggs, which was consistent with our hypothesis. These results will be useful for the design of cropping systems that enhance the biological regulation of pests.","[Mollot, Gregory; Tixier, Philippe; Duyck, Pierre-Francois] PRAM CIRAD Petit Morne, CIRAD, UR Syst Culture Base Bananiers Plantains & Ananas, BP 214, F-97285 Le Lamentin 2, Martinique, France; [Lescourret, Francoise] INRA, Plantes & Syst Culture Hort UR1115, F-84914 Avignon 9, France; [Quilici, Serge] Univ La Reunion, CIRAD, UMR Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseurs Milieu T, St Pierre 97410, Reunion, France","Mollot, G (corresponding author), PRAM CIRAD Petit Morne, CIRAD, UR Syst Culture Base Bananiers Plantains & Ananas, BP 214, F-97285 Le Lamentin 2, Martinique, France.",gregory.mollot@cirad.fr,"Duyck, Pierre-Francois/C-2416-2008; Tixier, Philippe/C-2119-2008","Duyck, Pierre-Francois/0000-0001-5484-1970; Tixier, Philippe/0000-0001-5147-9777; Lescourret, Francoise/0000-0002-6576-8067",CIRAD; CIRAD,"This work is part of a PhD thesis funded by the CIRAD.

Differences in the developmental time of frog tadpoles provide an opportunity to examine mechanisms through which priority effects may influence fitness components of a late arriving taxon. Specifically, tadpoles of the southern leopard frog (Rana) can often require more than a year to complete metamorphosis so they overwinter in a pond and compete with newly deposited tadpoles in the spring. We conducted an experiment in artificial ponds to evaluate mechanisms through which overwintering Rana tadpoles influence fitness components of southern toad (Bufo) tadpoles deposited into ponds during the spring. We found that overwintered Rana reduced Bufo performance while newly hatched Rana that enter a pond simultaneously with Bufo did not. The production of this priority effect was primarily the result of Rana depleting algal resources in a pond during the winter prior to Bufo arrival. The performance of Bufo did not correspond with variation in the abundance of algae present in a pond during the spring and we found evidence to indicate that, in the absence of resource exploitation during the winter, overwintered Rana do not compete strongly with Bufo during the spring when both species co-occur. When Rana deplete algal resources during the winter, however, interactions between Rana and Bufo during the spring became much more important as both the development rate and survival of Bufo was reduced to a greater extent than what would have been predicted by resource exploitation alone. Our results demonstrate that priority effects can result from early colonists depleting resource availability prior to the arrival of other species which can intensify behavioral/physical interactions between species when they co-occur.","[Hernandez, Jason P.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; E Carolina Univ, N Carolina Ctr Biodivers, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Hernandez, JP (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",chalcraftd@ecu.edu,,"Chalcraft, David/0000-0002-2165-0948",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716558],"We thank H.

Further, the degree to which individuals select particular resources can be altered by numerous factors including competition, predation, and both natural- and human-induced environmental change. Understanding the influence of such factors on the way animals use resources can guide species conservation and management in changing environments. In this study, we investigated the effects of a prescribed fire on small-scale (microhabitat) resource selection, abundance, body condition, and movement pathways of a native Australian rodent, the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes). Using a before-after, control-impact design, we gathered data from 60 individuals fitted with spool and line tracking devices. In unburnt forest, selection of resources by bush rats was positively related to rushes, logs and complex habitat, and negatively related to ferns and litter. Fire caused selection for spreading grass, rushes, and complex habitat to increase relative to an unburnt control location. At the burnt location after the fire, rats selected patches of unburnt vegetation, and no rats were caught at a trapping site where most of the understory had been burnt. The fire also reduced bush rat abundance and body condition and caused movement pathways to become more convoluted. After the fire, some individuals moved through burnt areas but the majority of movements occurred within unburnt patches. The effects of fire on bush rat resource selection, movement, body condition, and abundance were likely driven by several linked factors including limited access to shelter and food due to the loss of understory vegetation and heightened levels of perceived predation risk. Our findings suggest the influence of prescribed fire on small mammals will depend on the resulting mosaic of burnt and unburnt patches and how well this corresponds to the resource requirements of particular species.","[Fordyce, Amber; Hradsky, Bronwyn A.; Di Stefano, Julian] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Creswick, Vic 3363, Australia; [Ritchie, Euan G.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia","Di Stefano, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Creswick, Vic 3363, Australia.",juliands@unimelb.edu.au,"Di Stefano, Julian/M-9672-2019; Hradsky, Bronwyn/I-6325-2019; Ritchie, Euan/N-1088-2014","Di Stefano, Julian/0000-0001-7846-6642; Hradsky, Bronwyn/0000-0002-0141-020X; Ritchie, Euan/0000-0003-4410-8868","Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP); Parks Victoria; Holsworth Research Endowment","Thanks to D. and D.

In many cases, insecticide applications targeting other herbivores trigger outbreaks of spider mites. Recently, elevated populations of spider mites on a diversity of plants in urban landscapes have been associated with applications of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide. Imidacloprid has also been linked to increased fecundity in two species of spider mites. In this study, we evaluated the indirect (plant-mediated) and direct impact of imidacloprid on fecundity and longevity of Eurytetranychus buxi Garman (Acari: Tetranychidae), feeding on boxwoods, Buxus sempervirens L. Moreover, we compared the abundance of E. buxi on imidacloprid-treated and untreated boxwoods in the landscape and a greenhouse to determine if changes in the fecundity of mites exposed to imidacloprid were linked to outbreaks of E. buxi. We found that females consuming imidacloprid-treated plants laid more eggs than females feeding on untreated boxwoods, while their longevity remained unchanged. Fecundity was not affected, however, when spider mites were directly sprayed with imidacloprid and consumed foliage of untreated boxwoods. Furthermore, populations of E. buxi were greater on boxwoods treated with imidacloprid in the landscape and greenhouse. On landscape boxwoods, elevated populations of E. buxi persisted into a second year. We also observed general lack of predators of spider mites on treated and untreated boxwoods in the field suggesting that imidacloprid's eruptive effect on E. buxi stems more from indirect changes in plant quality than from a loss of top-down regulation from E. buxi's natural enemies.","[Szczepaniec, Adrianna; Raupp, Michael J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Szczepaniec, Adrianna] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Szczepaniec, A (corresponding author), S Dakota State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, 220 Berg Agr Hall,Box 2207A, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",adrianna.szczepaniec@sdstate.edu,,"Szczepaniec, Adrianna/0000-0002-9603-4533",National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program of USDA [2005-35303-16269]; International Society of Arboriculture Tree Fund; Gahan Fellowship; Bamford Fellowship,"The authors wish to thank S.

In threatened species, such studies are essential for establishing effective conservation measures across the range. We analysed factors potentially influencing breeding in a declining peripheral population of a long-lived bird, the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra). We assessed reproductive success and the effects of infra- and interspecific competition, as well as predation by recording events at nests by remote cameras (camera traps and a webcam). Productivity of storks was low (1.1 fledglings per occupied nest) compared to the other parts of the range and resulted mainly from the lower proportion of successful nests (37% of occupied nests). The main reason for low breeding success was the occupancy ofmany nests (35%) by single non-reproductive birds. Breeders were often visited by non-local conspecifics, which harassed local birds but only seldomly caused direct damage. Impact of predators and interspecific nest-competitors on reproductive success was low. We suggest that many individuals have disappeared from the breeding population and shortage of mates is currently the most important factor lowering reproductive success of the Black Stork at its northern range margin. This mechanism could also limit the peripheral abundance and distribution in other long-lived birds.","[Konovalov, Annika; Vali, Ulo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Nellis, Rein; Nellis, Renno; Nurmla, Am; Sellis, Urmas; Vali, Ulo] Eagle Club, EE-63406 Valgjarve Vald, Polvamaa, Estonia; [Nellis, Rein] Estonian Environm Agcy, Mustamae Tee 33, EE-10616 Tallinn, Estonia","Vali, U (corresponding author), Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.; Vali, U (corresponding author), Eagle Club, EE-63406 Valgjarve Vald, Polvamaa, Estonia.",ulo.vali@emu.ee,"Vali, Ulo/G-8253-2017","Vali, Ulo/0000-0002-2247-0658","Estonian Environmental Board [IUT21-1]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia","Many people helped to set up and maintain cameras; even more people were following the web-camera online and participated in data gathering in a special web-based forum.

The abundance of perch 2 years and older was lower in lakes with pike than in lakes with only perch. In contrast, the abundance of small perch (young-of-the-year and I-year old) was lower in lakes with only perch suggesting that intense cannibalism reduced these size classes to low levels in lakes lacking pike. Functional response experiments with differently sized perch and zooplankton showed that the attack rate of small perch susceptible to cannibalism was much higher than that of large cannibalising perch. The optimal body size of perch with respect to attack rate was also lower for small zooplankton prey than for large zooplankton. The zooplankton communities in lakes with only perch were dominated by the relatively small species Ceriodaphnia quadrangula and Bosmina spp. and total zooplankton biomass was higher in these lakes than in lakes with both pike and perch. In contrast, the mean size of cladoceran zooplankton was largest in lakes with both pike and perch owing to a dominance of the large zooplankton species Holopedium gibberum in these lakes. We relate these patterns to (1) the low foraging efficiency of large perch on small zooplankton and (2) the low abundance of small zooplanktivorous perch (due to cannibalism) in lakes with only perch. The differences in zooplankton community structure also resulted in different seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton between lakes. Cannibalism introduces a vertical heterogeneity to food webs that causes consumer-resource dynamics that are not predictable from linear food chain models.","Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Wahlstrom, E (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051",,,,64,78,81,0,31,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2000,123,1,,,,,138,148,,10.1007/s004420050999,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,311KW,WOS:000086884300017,28308739,,,,2021-09-27,

Three cosmopolitan species Drosophila simulans Sturtevant, Drosophila melanogaster Meigen and Drosophila immigrans Sturtevant, and a native species, Drosophila auraria Peng, emerged abundantly from banana placed at the domestic station, while Drosophila immigrans and five native species, Drosophila lutescens Okada, Drosophila rufa Kikkawa and Peng, Drosophila bizonata Kikkawa and Peng, Drosophila sternopleuralis Okada and Kurokawa and Scaptodrosophila coracina (Kikkawa and Peng), were abundant at the forest station. The present analysis suggests that their coexistence was facilitated by the aggregation mechanism. In the cosmopolitan species, the density of individuals that emerged from patches increased with the increase of patch size, but the relationship between fly density and patch size was not clear in the native species. This difference in distribution patterns between the cosmopolitan and native species is likely to be due to the difference in the female visiting behavior. In the present analysis, however, it was not clear whether patch size diversity facilitated their coexistence or not. The effect of patch size diversity may have been masked, because the effect of aggregation was more prominent. The rate of parasitism by wasps was high in October at the domestic station, and in May and June at the forest station. The present result suggests that the rate of parasitism was density-dependent, at least at the domestic station, and therefore parasitism facilitates the coexistence of drosophilid species in domestic areas.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; Tokyo Metropolitan Yamasaki High Sch, Tokyo 1950074, Japan","Kimura, MT (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",mtk@ees.hokudai.ac.jp,,,,,,20,21,22,0,15,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Invasive species of crayfish are known to negatively impact native species in aquatic ecosystems. We recently found that an Ozark endemic crayfish, Orconectes neglectus, has been introduced into the Spring River drainage of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas and appears to have the potential to negatively impact the native communities. We used quantitative kick netting along the Spring River and selected tributaries to determine the distribution and abundance of O. neglectus and its potential to impact native crayfish species. The native crayfishes Orconectes eupunctus, a species of special concern, and Cambarus hubbsi appear to no longer occur throughout much of their former range in the Spring River drainage where O. neglectus is now abundant. Orconectes eupunctus, C. hubbsi, and O. neglectus mainly used fast-flowing riffle and run habitats with a mix of gravel, cobble, and boulder, whereas the other common species collected, Orconectes punctimanus and Orconectes ozarkae, were more generalists in habitat use and were found at all sampled sites. Orconectes eupunctus and C. hubbsi were positively associated with each other, but negatively associated with O. neglectus, despite their similar habitat use. These results provide evidence that O. neglectus is expanding its range, possibly to the detriment of O. eupunctus and C. hubbsi. An intensive field survey and manipulative experiments would be required to confirm the disappearance of the native species, and the mechanisms involved.","Univ Arkansas, USGS, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; Missouri Dept Conservat, Resource Sci Ctr, Columbia, MO 65201 USA","Magoulick, DD (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, USGS, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",danmag@uark.edu,"Magoulick, Daniel/AAG-1556-2020","Magoulick, Daniel/0000-0001-9665-5957",,,,25,26,27,0,15,HUMBOLDT FIELD RESEARCH INST,STEUBEN,"PO BOX 9, STEUBEN, ME 04680-0009 USA",1528-7092,1938-5412,,SOUTHEAST NAT,Southeast.

Predators, however, do not recognize such restrictions and may be attracted to areas of increased prey abundances where human extraction is being limited. Such targeting by predators may reduce or retard the potential recovery of depressed stocks. In the San Juan Islands, northern Puget Sound, USA, marine reserves were implemented to recover depressed fish populations. We examine the role of harbor seals Phoca vitulina in the San Juan Islands food web. We describe the temporal and spatial variability in their diet, emphasizing species for which reserves were established (rockfish Sebastes spp.) and other important de pressed stocks, including salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and Pacific herring Clupea pallasii. During winter and spring, seals primarily consumed Pacific herring, Pacific sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus, northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, and walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma. During summer/fall, adult salmonids composed >50% of the diet and were particularly important in odd-numbered calendar years, when pink salmon O. gorbuscha spawn. Rockfish were not a primary prey species at any time of the year, suggesting that the abundance of alternative prey species may reduce predation pressure and provide a critical buffer to rockfish predation. The importance of considering increased visitation by marine predators to areas where potential prey are enhanced through restrictions on human extractions should be considered when modeling the efficacy of quotas and reduced access areas, such as marine reserves.","[Lance, Monique M.; Jeffries, Steven J.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Wildlife Sci Program, Lakewood, WA 98498 USA; [Chang, Wan-Ying] Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Pearson, Scott F.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Wildlife Sci Program, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Acevedo-Gutierrez, Alejandro] Western Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA","Lance, MM (corresponding author), Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Wildlife Sci Program, Lakewood, WA 98498 USA.",monique.lance@dfw.wa.gov,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, Alejandro/0000-0002-9128-826X",SeaDoc Society; UC Davis Wildlife Health Center [K004431-25]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0550443]; Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife,"We thank J.

Predation experiments were conducted in the laboratory under salinity levels of 22 parts per thousand and 32 parts per thousand, as well as under field conditions. The results indicate that the invasive bivalves are more vulnerable to predation than the native bivalve in environments with high salinity, whereas environments with moderately low salinity (22 parts per thousand) may reduce predation. Because R. clavigera did not show clear prey preference, the low survival of the invasive species might be due to a lack of effective anti-predatory defenses under experimental conditions. These findings could explain the high abundance of the invasive bivalves in disturbed environments in Hong Kong where predation appears to be lower.","[Astudillo, Juan C.; Leung, Kenneth M.

Surveys covered some estuaries and intertidal areas, as well as shrimp fishery grounds. The 40 yr period showed distinct regional trend differences, but only in estuarine areas: the Western Dutch Wadden Sea (increase), the Eastern Dutch Wadden Sea (decrease) and the Oosterschelde (decrease). The decrease in the Oosterschelde coincided with the closure of this sea arm from fresh water inflow. Increases in the Western and Eastern Dutch Wadden Sea were driven primarily by increased abundance of small shrimp, suggesting that the causative mechanism likely affected younger shrimp. Trends in potential causes were examined in the 2 regions. Of all abiotic factors investigated, only water clarity decreased significantly in the west but not in the east. Mean abundance of potential predators (cod, whiting, shore crab and swimming crab) was used as an indicator of predation pressure. Shore crab showed similar increases in both areas. In the other 3 species, predator abundance in the east was generally initially higher than in the west, but declined towards similar densities in recent years. Shrimp fishing pressure in NW Europe has increased strongly since the 1990s. Preliminary, spatially resolved logbook data show that shrimp landings from the Western Wadden Sea followed this increase, but those from the Eastern Wadden Sea remained stable. Apart from mechanisms related to fishing pressure and water clarity, a candidate cause of differences in abundance may be differences in food condition or competition for food. Generally biomass of benthos, a primary food for shrimp, increased in the west and remained stable in the east. However, because brown shrimp are omnivorous, quantification of changing fractions of food available to them is difficult.","[Tulp, Ingrid; Bolle, Loes J.; Meesters, Erik; de Vries, Pepijn] Inst Marine Resources & Ecosyst Studies, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands","Tulp, I (corresponding author), Inst Marine Resources & Ecosyst Studies, POB 68, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands.",ingrid.tulp@wur.nl,,"Meesters, Erik/0000-0002-3877-1164; de Vries, Pepijn/0000-0002-7961-6646","Dutch Ministry of Economics, Agriculture and Innovation","J.

Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can he a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.","[Churchwell, Roy T.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Davis, Craig A.; Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Engle, David M.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Churchwell, RT (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",craig.a.davis@okstate.edu,"Fuhlendorf, Sam/A-2931-2011","Fuhlendorf, Sam/0000-0002-8726-9402",United States Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2003-35101-12928]; Nebraska Chapter of The Nature Conservancy; Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Oklahoma State University Zoology Department; Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station,"We thank the United States Department of Agriculture for providing funding for this project through their National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program, grant 2003-35101-12928.

Seeds and bulbils dispersed to the same average distance from the parent, but seeds occasionally traveled 10-30 cm further than bulbils. In addition, some bulbil infructescences were observed dispersing as a unit. Predation rates were significantly higher for seeds, but the density of propagules in an area had no effect on removal rates. Seeds and bulbils buried in the field were no longer viable after 1 yr. However, seeds stored in the laboratory for up to 3 yr had higher viability percentages than bulbils. Overall, the ecological differences found between seeds and bulbils are small relative to the differences found among dimorphic propagules of other species, and do not fit the predictions of models for the conditions necessary to maintain the production of heteromorphic propagules.","DUKE UNIV, DEPT BOT, DURHAM, NC 27706 USA",,,,,,,,44,28,28,0,9,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,1938-4238,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

Prey preference is size-dependent, and overall predation pressure is density dependent, and thus the size structure of the P. fluviatilis population should affect the structure of the macroinvertebrate community, and the population density of P. fluviatilis should reflect the overall density of benthic macroinvertebrates. We sampled the littoral benthic community in a boreal lake that had been divided into two parts that were subjected to two different fishing procedures during 2007-2012 period and analyzed the macroinvertebrate diet of fish. The benthic macroinvertebrate community reflected the predation pressure. Total macroinvertebrate biomass increased during the study period in the lake division with a non-size-selective fishing procedure (NSF), i.e., all invertivorous perch size-classes targeted, but decreased in the section with negatively size-selective fishing procedure (SSF), i.e., large invertivorous individuals >= 16 cm were not targeted. This difference was a result of the increase in large-sized species, such as Odonata, for the NSF procedure and decrease in the SSF procedure. In contrast to total biomass, total macroinvertebrate density did not show a response to predator size structure but rather total macroinvertebrate density decreased with increasing fish density. The study demonstrates the effect of predation pressure of P. fluviatilis on benthic communities, thus highlighting the keystone predator role of the species in boreal lakes and gives more insight on the multiple effects of fish predation on littoral benthic communities.","[Nurminen, Leena; Hellen, Noora; Olin, Mikko; Tiainen, Joni; Vinni, Mika; Gronroos, Mira; Estlander, Satu; Horppila, Jukka; Lehtonen, Hannu] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Rask, Martti] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Survontie 9 A, Jyvaskyla 40500, Finland","Nurminen, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",leena.nurminen@helsinki.fi,"Olin, Mikko/I-9258-2012","Gronroos, Mira/0000-0002-8210-8837",Bergsradet Bror Serlachius; University of Helsinki,We thank Evo Fisheries Research Station for providing excellent facilities and all the helping hands in the field during the years of this study.

Shifts are facilitated by factors such as adult movement and dispersal of pelagic larvae to normally cooler regions, where increasing ocean temperatures are now enhancing larval and juvenile survival. However, successful recruitment (i.e. larval settlement) at these new regions can be constrained by resource availability, specialisation (food, habitat) and ecological interactions (competition, predation). Evaluating the capacity or likelihood of a species to successfully shift or expand its range, provides information relevant to biodiversity conservation and fisheries management, and is particularly important for species with restricted ranges. Choerodon rubescens (Gunther, 1862) is an exploited labrid endemic to similar to 1400 km of the west Australian coastline, encompassing 13 degrees of latitude and a 6 degrees C temperature gradient. This region recently experienced a rapid warming event of similar to 3 degrees C, which lasted 3 months and mirrored ocean temperatures expected in the next 50 years. Following this event, high levels of recruitment of C. rubescens occurred towards its southern, cooler distribution limit. Juvenile abundances were surveyed in this study to evaluate: (1) the effect of elevated temperatures on recruitment success across shallow water habitats spanning the species' distribution, (2) temporal variation in recruitment success in the typically cooler, southern part of its range and (3) ecological characteristics important to recruit survival, including habitat preferences, diet and behaviour. Juvenile C. rubescens were significantly more abundant at the margin between reef and sand and towards the cooler southern range end. Reef margin habitat provides access to shelter from predators within the reef and to sand-associated invertebrate prey in adjacent soft sediments, where most feeding activity occurred. Juveniles were abundant (0.3 to 4 fish/40 m(2)) in reef margin habitats of the southern cooler region for three consecutive years, with individuals represented by multiple cohorts, indicating suitable environmental conditions for ongoing recruitment and survival. Juveniles at this habitat were able to compete effectively with other co-occurring labrids for invertebrate prey. As oceans warm, the number of recruits arriving and surviving beyond the existing cooler range limit will be dependent on factors such as successful spawning, larval delivery and survival, and availability of reef margin habitat with associated prey; these factors will determine the successful range shift or expansion of C. rubescens. We present an example of how range-wide spatiotemporal ecological studies of juvenile fish can identify range shift capacity and inform management adaptive to climate change.","[Cure, Katherine; Langlois, Tim J.; Thillainath, Emma C.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Cure, Katherine; Langlois, Tim J.; Thillainath, Emma C.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Cure, Katherine] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Indian Ocean Marine Res Facil, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.; Fairclough, David V.; Harvey, Euan S.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Fairclough, David V.] Dept Primary Ind & Reg Dev, Sci & Resource Assessment, 39 Northside Dr, Hillarys, WA 6025, Australia","Cure, K (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Indian Ocean Marine Res Facil, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",k.cure@aims.gov.au,"Cure, Katherine/I-3126-2019; Fairclough, David V/F-2596-2013; Harvey, Euan/B-2896-2011","Fairclough, David V/0000-0002-9620-5064; Harvey, Euan/0000-0002-9069-4581; Cure, Katherine/0000-0002-2922-6391","School of Plant Biology, University of Western Australia; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment","This work was supported by the School of Plant Biology, University of Western Australia, and a Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment to KC.",,93,2,2,0,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,1879-1697,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Researchers commonly estimate kill rates with GPS data using the following steps. Firstly, researchers mark individual animals and fit them with GPS collars. Next, they visit a subset of GPS clusters (aggregated location data) during field surveys and assign spatiotemporal covariates associated with predation and non-predation events. Lastly, they develop predictive models with data collected in the field to estimate the probability that each cluster they did not visit in the field was a predation event. Such predation models help reduce field efforts and save money; however, these models are prone to error when carnivores eat prey of different sizes or exhibit shorter-than-expected handling times. We simulated reduced field efforts to investigate the reliability of predictive modeling in determining diet composition and detecting predation events for 3 puma (Puma concolor) populations with different prey assemblages and potential effects on handling time of carcasses. We visited a total 1,896 clusters in Chilean Patagonia, Colorado, and California, of which 1,752 clusters (similar to 92%) were included to build and test predation models. Across all study areas, the total time a puma spent at a cluster was the only reliable predictor of a cluster being a predation event. When we reduced field efforts by selectively removing GPS clusters < 12 and < 24 h in length, model performance improved but produced inaccurate results. Predation models underestimated the number of predation events in California and Colorado and significantly over-or underestimated the number of predation events in Patagonia. Selectively reducing field efforts also reduced the diversity and evenness of prey we recorded in puma diets. Randomly reducing field efforts, in contrast, reduced the precision of model estimates. Our results highlight the importance of conducting intensive fieldwork over predation modeling to measure prey selection and kill rates of carnivores.","[Elbroch, L.

We investigated the indirect effects of collection by experimental removals of two target species, Cellana tramorerica (Sowerby) and Nerita atramentosa (Reeve) from a rocky shore in south eastern Australia. Removals of single species were compared with the removal of both species and frequent removals were compared against once-off removal events. The removal of Cellana resulted in an increase in micro-algal abundance. This increase was greater where Cellana were frequently removed than where once-off removal of the species occurred. The removal of Cellana also promoted the immigration of adult Cellana, but the overall population was dominated by juveniles. Immigration of juvenile Cellana was high in all cases and was not affected by removals of either target species. The removal of Nerita, whether once-off or frequent, resulted in a decrease in micro-algae, but did not affect the migration of other species. The combined removal of Cellana and Nerita did not affect microalgal abundance, a result that was successfully predicted from the summed effect of the single species removals. In addition, the combined removal had no effect on the abundance of other species. The single and combined removal of these two gastropod species did not influence the species richness at this study site.

Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems, where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and floristic diversity. 2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as 'shade grown' is actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico. 3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots with epiphytes. 4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant differences in species richness between treatments in any of the seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird community structure differed between the two treatments. 5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. 6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual survivorship. 7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote biodiversity conservation.","Inst Ecol, AC Dept Ecol Func, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Ctr, Washington, DC 20008 USA","Cruz-Angon, A (corresponding author), Inst Ecol, AC Dept Ecol Func, Km 2-5 Antigua Carretera Coatepec,315, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",angon@ecologia.edu.mx,,,,,,65,79,86,0,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

In this study, we focused on the food chain efficiency (FCE), the trophic transfer across three trophic levels, as an important process for ecosystem function, and examined the conditions under which such compensation could occur with aquarium experiments using an insecticide (methomyl) as the stressor. Our aquariums included one of two pairs of insecticide-tolerant and insecticide-sensitive cladoceran species, and a fish as the predator. The response of FCE to the insecticide stress, as indicated by the fish biomass production, depended on the zooplankton species combinations. FCE and total zooplankton biomass were maintained in the pair in which the compensatory changes of species abundances were clear, whereas they decreased in the pair in which the compensatory changes were not clear. This indicated the compensatory dynamics in the zooplankton community responsible for the observed resistance to the stress. We inferred the driving factors for the compensatory dynamics and the community resistance with respect to species traits of ecological importance, and concluded that a dissimilarity between species as regards the tolerance trait and a clear trade-off between the tolerance and the competitive ability was required to drive the compensatory dynamics, and a similarity or a superiority of the tolerant species as regards the functional effect trait (the predator avoidance and the reproductive potential) were required to maintain FCE.","[Mano, Hiroyuki; Tanaka, Yoshinari] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Risk Res, Onogawa 16-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Mano, Hiroyuki] Publ Works Res Inst, Water Environm Res Grp, Minamihara 1-6, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan","Mano, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Risk Res, Onogawa 16-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.; Mano, H (corresponding author), Publ Works Res Inst, Water Environm Res Grp, Minamihara 1-6, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan.",h-mano@pwri.go.jp,"Mano, Hiroyuki/M-2892-2018","Mano, Hiroyuki/0000-0003-2684-5792","Japan Society of Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17510027]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26340052] Funding Source: KAKEN",We thank M.

This 'individual specialisation' is a widespread phenomenon in natural populations, but until recently few studies quantified the magnitude of individual specialisation and how this magnitude varies among populations or contexts. Such quantitative approaches are necessary for us to understand how ecological interactions influence the amount of among-individual variation, and how the amount of variation might affect ecological dynamics. Herein, we review recent studies of individual specialisation, emphasising the novel insights arising from quantitative measures of diet variation. Experimental and comparative studies have confirmed long-standing theoretical expectations that the magnitude of among-individual diet variation depends on the level of intra and interspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. In contrast, there is little empirical information as to how individual specialisation affects community dynamics. We discuss some emerging methodological issues as guidelines for researchers studying individual specialisation, and make specific recommendations regarding avenues for future research.","[Araujo, Marcio S.; Layman, Craig A.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Araujo, MS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Ecol, BR-199 Rio Claro, Brazil.",msaraujo@rc.unesp.br,"Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015; Araujo, Marcio Silva/G-9485-2011","Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296; Araujo, Marcio Silva/0000-0003-3533-744X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); U.

Potting surveys conducted over 4 years revealed significantly higher catch per unit effort (cpue 109% greater), weight per unit effort (wpue 189% greater), and carapace length (10-15mm greater) in lobsters within the reserve compared with control sites. However, likely due to low levels of recruitment and increased fishing effort outside the reserve, lobster catches decreased in all areas during the final 2 years. Nevertheless, catch rates remained higher within the reserve across all years, suggesting the reserve buffered these wider declines. Additionally, lobster cpue and wpue declined with increasing distance from the boundaries of the marine reserve, a trend which tag-recapture data suggested were due to spillover. Catches of berried lobster were also twice as high within the reserve than outside, and the mean potential reproductive output per female was 22.1% greater. It was originally thought that higher densities of lobster within the reserve might lead to greater levels of aggression and physical damage. However, damage levels were solely related to body size, as large lobsters >110mm had sustained over 218% more damage than smaller individuals. Interestingly, catches of adult lobsters were inversely correlated with those of juvenile lobsters, brown crabs, and velvet crabs, which may be evidence of competitive displacement and/or predation. Our findings provide evidence that temperate marine reserves can deliver fisheries and conservation benefits, and highlight the importance of investigating multispecies interactions, as the recovery of some species can have knock-on effects on others.","[Howarth, Leigh M.; Waggitt, James J.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales; [Dubois, Pascal; Gratton, Paul; Judge, Matthew; Christie, Brian; Hawkins, Julie P.; Roberts, Callum M.; Stewart, Bryce D.] Univ York, Environm Dept, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Howarth, LM (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales.",l.m.howarth@bangor.ac.uk,"Beukers-Stewart, Bryce D/B-5262-2011","Howarth, Leigh/0000-0003-1689-6713",Fauna and Flora International; Kilfinan Trust; Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST),"This study was funded by Fauna and Flora International, the Kilfinan Trust, and the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST), to whom we are very grateful.

We studied earwigs (Dermaptera: Forficulidae) as generalist predators and aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) as key pests serving as earwig prey in a total of 58 commercial apple orchards differing in management (integrated production (IP) versus organic) in Germany and Spain. We focused on the effects of local agri-environmental structures, orchard management, and composition of the surrounding landscape on earwig populations and on tree infestation by the woolly apple aphid (WAA), Eriosoma lanigerum. Surprisingly, the common earwig, Forficula auricularia, did not benefit from organic management in either country, and we found even slightly higher earwig abundances in IP than in organic orchards in Germany. In Spain, we found a negative impact of IP compared to organic management on abundance of the earwig Forficula pubescens, whereas orchard management did not affect the abundance of F. auricularia. The presence of woody habitats adjacent to the orchard reduced the abundance of F. auricularia in IP but not in organic orchards in Germany. We did not study the effects of woody habitats in Spain, where these structures were very scarce. There was no effect of high plant species richness at the orchard boundary or compositional landscape heterogeneity on earwig abundance in either country. In Germany, WAA infestation was very low and driven by landscape characteristics rather than orchard management. In Spain, WAA infestation differed strongly between management types (higher in organic orchards). There were no strong, consistent correlations between earwig abundance and WAA infestation in either country. Our study shows that adjacent woody structures and orchard management may affect earwigs in perennial cropping systems. The consequences of orchard management, however, seem to strongly depend on earwig species. Our study suggests that woody elements may serve as sink habitats potentially attracting earwigs by providing alternative prey and shelter in IP (but not in organic) orchards.","[Happe, Anne-Kathrin; Mody, Karsten] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Networks, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Roquer-Beni, Laura; Bosch, Jordi] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Alins, Georgina] Inst Recerca & Tecnol Agroalimentaries, IRTA Fruit Prod, PCiTAL, Parc Gardeny,Edifici Fruitctr, Lleida 25003, Spain","Happe, AK; Mody, K (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Networks, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",ahappe@posteo.net; mody@bio.tu-darmstadt.de,"ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Alins, Georgina GA/L-9011-2014","Alins, Georgina GA/0000-0002-2353-051X","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (PT-DLR/BMBF) [BiodivERsA-FACCE2014-74, 01LC1403]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO) [PCIN-2014-145-C02]","We appreciate the constructive comments of three anonymous reviewers.

Arid Australia has the world's worst modern mammalian extinction record, largely attributable to competition from introduced herbivores, particularly European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). The biological control agent rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was introduced to Australia in 1995 and resulted in dramatic, widespread rabbit suppression. We compared the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence of 4 extant species of small mammals before and after RHDV outbreak, relative to rainfall, sampling effort, and rabbit and predator populations. Despite low rainfall during the first 14 years after RHDV, 2 native rodents listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the dusky hopping-mouse (Notomys fuscus) and plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), increased their extent of occurrence by 241-365%. A threatened marsupial micropredator, the crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda), underwent a 70-fold increase in extent of occurrence and a 20-fold increase in area of occupancy. Both bottom-up and top-down trophic effects were attributed to RHDV, namely decreased competition for food resources and declines in rabbit-dependent predators. Based on these sustained increases, these 3 previously threatened species now qualify for threat-category downgrading on the IUCN Red List. These recoveries are on a scale rarely documented in mammals and give impetus to programs aimed at targeted use of RHDV in Australia, rather than simply employing top-down threat-based management of arid ecosystems. Conservation programs that take big-picture approaches to addressing threatening processes over large spatial scales should be prioritized to maximize return from scarce conservation funding. Further, these should be coupled with long-term ecological monitoring, a critical tool in detecting and understanding complex ecosystem change. Biocontrol de Conejos y Recuperacion a Escala de Paisaje de Mamiferos Amenazados del Desierto El financiamiento para la conservacion de especies no es suficiente para enfrentar a la crisis actual de la biodiversidad y aun asi, muchos programas usan acciones inasequibles de recuperacion y de una sola especie y descuidan al manejo mas general que aborda los procesos amenazantes. La zona arida de Australia tiene el peor registro moderno de extincion de mamiferos del mundo, en su mayoria atribuible a la competencia con los herbivoros introducidos, particularmente el conejo europeo (Oryctolagus cuniculus), y a la depredacion por parte de los gatos ferales (Felis catus) y los zorros (Vulpes vulpes). El agente de control biologico VEHC (virus de la enfermedad hemorragica de conejos) se introdujo a Australia en 1995 y resulto en una represion dramatica y extendida de los conejos. Comparamos el area de ocupacion y la extension de la presencia de cuatro especies existentes de mamiferos pequenos antes y despues de la epidemia de VEHC en relacion a la lluvia, esfuerzo de muestreo y poblaciones de conejos y depredadores. A pesar de la poca lluvia durante los primeros 14 anos despues del VEHC, dos roedores nativos enlistados por la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza (UICN), la rata canguro (Notomys fuscus) y el raton de las praderas (Pseudomys australis), incrementaron su extension en un 241-365%. Un micro-depredador marsupial amenazado, la rata marsupial de cola crestada (Dasycercus cristicauda), experimento un incremento de 70 veces en la extension de su presencia y una de 20 veces en el area de ocupacion. Ambos efectos troficos de abajo-hacia-arriba y de arriba-hacia-abajo fueron atribuidos al VEHC, especificamente la competencia reducida por los recursos alimenticios y la declinacion de depredadores dependientes de los conejos. Con base en estos incrementos prolongados, estas tres especies previamente amenazadas ahora califican para una baja de categoria en la Lista Roja de la UICN. Estas recuperaciones son a una escala que rara vez se documenta en mamiferos y dan impetu a los programas centrados en el uso enfocado del VEHC en Australia, en lugar de emplear simplemente el manejo de arriba-abajo basado en amenazas en los ecosistemas aridos. Los programas de conservacion que adoptan estrategias generales para abordar los procesos de amenaza a grandes escalas espaciales deberian ser prioridad para maximizar el retorno del poco financiamiento para la conservacion. Ademas, estos programas deberian emparejarse con el monitoreo ecologico a largo plazo, una herramienta critica en la deteccion y el entendimiento del cambio complejo de los ecosistemas.

In lizards, competition and predation are major forces influencing distribution and abundance, but there is also increasing evidence pointing at the influence of habitat structure and prey abundance. Our work explored the latter further by quantifying the effects of vegetation and prey abundance on occupancy and abundance (i.e., estimated probability of detecting more than two individuals) of two synipatrically occurring species in the northern karst belt of Puerto Rico. We hypothesized that Anolis cristatellus would occur in trunk-ground substrates and Anolis krugi on grass-bush substrates according to their ecomorphological classification. We also hypothesized that prey abundance, a component of habitat quality, would have a positive and strong effect on occupancy and abundance. Anolis cristatellus exhibited high occupancy rates (> 0.80), influenced by mid-story tree size. A. cristatellus abundance fluctuated over time, with highest probability of detecting two or more individuals in January-March and July-September when prey abundance transitioned from low to high levels. Occupancy of A. krugi was positively influenced by sapling density and prey abundance. Prey abundance exerted a stronger influence on occupancy, but its influence on abundance was negative and strong. Biological interactions and the type of understory substrates may explain the negative relationship. Our study supported predicted relationships between ecomorphology and habitat, but also showed that higher prey abundance may not always translate to higher local abundance. We shed light on these interactions, knowledge needed to advance anole conservation in the advent of land use and climate change.","[Vega-Castillo, S., I] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, Arecibo, PR 00612 USA; [Collazo, Jaime A.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, North Carolina Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [Puente-Rolon, Alberto R.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, Mayaguez Campus, Mayaguez, PR USA; [Cuevas, Elvira] Univ Puerto Rico Rio Piedras, Ctr Appl Trop Ecol & Conservat, San Juan, PR 00931 USA","Vega-Castillo, SI (corresponding author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, Arecibo, PR 00612 USA.",sondra.vega@upr.com,,,"National Science Foundation of the Center for Applied Tropical Ecology and Conservation of the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus [HRD 0734826]","We thank J.

Two groups of cattle dung were used, one in the field and another in the laboratory, each group consisting of five fresh dung pats of medium size (about 30 cm in diameter), opaque appearance, presence of a thin external crust and firm consistency. The dung pats were covered with emergence cages in pyramidal format, presenting a hole in the superior part where a removable flask was coupled, and the substitution of the dung was done every 2 weeks. A total of 355 specimens of H. irritans was collected, 151 of which were obtained in the field and 204 specimens in the laboratory. These differences probably were due to smaller temperature variations in the laboratory than in the field, besides the action of arthropodal predators, competitors and parasites of horn fly pupae that probably interfered in H. irritans emergence in cattle dung under field conditions. A higher number of females were observed in both conditions. Besides H. irritans, there were collected other flies associated with bovine manure belonging to the following families: Aulacigastridae, Muscidae, Psychodidae, Sarcophagidae, Sepsidae, Tachinidae and Ulidiidae.

Herbivores can increase plant richness by reducing dominant plant species thus providing space for subdominant species. As small mammals are abundant in the Succulent Karoo and therefore might affect plant richness by means of herbivory, we tested if this mechanism might exist in the Succulent Karoo in southern Africa, a biodiversity hotspot due to its extraordinary plant richness. At ten ecologically different study sites we measured plant and small mammal richness and diversity and determined 11 abiotic factors including soil composition, altitude and rainfall. We found positive correlations between plant richness and the number of small mammal species. A general linear model revealed that the number of small mammal species was more important than abiotic factors in explaining variation in plant richness. To test whether small mammals might directly influence plant richness, we studied the influence of the bush-Karoo rat Otomys unisulcatus, a central place forager, on the plant community. The immediate surroundings of occupied O. unisulcatus nests showed significantly higher plant richness than control areas. We conclude that small mammals can have a positive effect on plant richness in the Succulent Karoo. While experimental data are needed to support these correlative results, the results of our study indicate that areas of high small mammal richness should be included in conservation programs of the Succulent Karoo.","[Keller, Christina] Univ Munster, Dept Behav Biol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Keller, Christina; Schradin, Carsten] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa","Keller, C (corresponding author), German Primate Ctr, Res Grp Cognit Ethol, Kellnerweg 4, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",keller@cog-ethol.de; carsten.schradin@zool.uzh.ch,"Schradin, Carsten/A-1534-2013","Schradin, Carsten/0000-0002-2706-2960",,,,36,13,13,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

The earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris, interacts with the common woodland salamander, Plethodon cinereus, via: (1) ecosystem engineering, by providing burrows that are used as a refuge, (2) direct effects as a prey item, and (3) indirectly, by competing with microinvertebrates, another prey item for P. cinereus. Using enclosures in the forest, I examined the relative strengths of these component pathways between seasons and salamander age classes. I found that the relative strength (partial g 2) of the positive direct (trophic) effect of L. terrestris on the change in mass of P. cineresus was greater than that of the negative indirect effect, but only in summer. Positive effects of ecosystem engineering were only evident over the winter as increased adult survival.

Environmental context and trophic structure can individually alter the strength of NCEs, yet the interactive influence of these contexts in natural settings is less understood. At six sites across 1000 km of the Southeastern Atlantic Bight (SAB), we constructed oyster reefs with one, two, or three trophic levels and evaluated the traits of focal juvenile oysters exposed to predation risk cues. We monitored environmental variables (water flow velocity, microalgal resources, and oyster larval recruitment) that may have altered how oysters respond to risk, and we also assessed the cost of trait changes to oyster mortality and growth when they were protected from direct predatory loss. Regardless of trophic structure, we found that oyster shell strength and natural oyster recruitment peaked at the center of the region. This high recruitment negated the potential for NCEs by smothering and killing the focal oysters. Also independent of trophic structure, focal oysters grew the most at the northernmost site. In contrast to, and perhaps because of, these strong environmental effects, the oyster traits of condition index and larval recruitment were only suppressed by the trophic treatment with a full complement of risk cues from intermediate and top predators at just the southernmost site. But at this same site, statistically significant NCEs on oyster growth and mortality were not detected. More strikingly, our study demonstrated environmental gradients that differentially influence oysters throughout the SAB. In particular, the results of our trophic manipulation experiment across these gradients suggest that in the absence of predation, environmental differences among sites may overwhelm the influence of NCEs on prey traits and population dynamics.","[Kimbro, David L.; Grabowski, Jonathan H.; Hughes, A.

While many studies have demonstrated the influence of predators in nest-site selection, few studies have explicitly quantified nutritional resources or considered the interacting effects of predation and food availability in determining nest survival. The painted honeyeater Grantiella picta is a mistletoe-specialist frugivore, with fruit from grey mistletoe Amyema quandang representing the main food source for breeding adults and nestlings. Previous work demonstrated that painted honeyeaters prefer to place their nests within mistletoe substrates. Here, we measured the outcome of 63 nests over two years, relating survival to various structural and resource-based variables to discern whether nests placed in mistletoes were more likely to succeed. Twenty-one nests survived the 33day nest period, with 35 of the 42 failed nests predated. While few significant differences were discerned between successful and unsuccessful nests in terms of nest tree or surrounding habitat, nest substrate emerged as the most important predictor of nest fate. Survival of nests in mistletoe was 16 center dot 6% across a 33day active nest period compared with a mean of 43 center dot 1% for nests in other substrates, a difference consistent across both years. Rather than having a positive effect on nest outcome (via access to nutritional resources), proximity to mistletoe had a marked negative effect, with nests in mistletoe suffering a predation rate 2 center dot 6 times higher than nests elsewhere. Rather than predators targeting mistletoe clumps, we suggest that this pattern arises from other species visiting fruiting mistletoe clumps, opportunistically predating the nest contents and disturbing attending parents. We interpret this finding as evidence that the painted honeyeater may be caught in an ecological trap; the cues used to select nesting locations are a poor predictor of success.","[Barea, Laurence P.; Watson, David M.] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia","Barea, LP (corresponding author), Hamilton Serv Ctr, Dept Conservat, Private Bag 3072, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",Lbarea@doc.govt.nz,,"David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632",Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; Charles Sturt University Competitive Research Grant,This research was supported by an Australian Postgraduate Award to LPB and a Charles Sturt University Competitive Research Grant to DMW.

We assessed how population densities of a secondary cavity nester, the Mountain Chickadee Poecile gambeli, varied with densities of avian cavity excavators, potential competitors and nest predators, during two large-scale insect outbreaks of Western Spruce Budworm Choristoneura occidentalis and Mountain Pine Beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae. At the regional level, Mountain Chickadee densities doubled with increases in budworm and beetle availability, then declined with decreases in beetle availability, despite high budworm supply. At the site level, densities of excavators were the best predictor of site-level variation in Chickadee densities in the following year. During and after the beetle outbreak, Mountain Chickadees used more cavities excavated by Red-breasted Nuthatches Sitta canadensis and Downy Woodpeckers Picoides pubescens, both of which are bark insectivores that increased in densities concomitantly with the beetle outbreak and whose foraging activities may have facilitated the Mountain Chickadees' access to bark beetles. Thus, Mountain Chickadees showed a numerical response to the food pulse at the regional level, but a functional response to the pulse of nesting cavities at the site level. Plasticity in resource selection and heterospecific attraction may allow Mountain Chickadees to respond to resource pulses in highly variable environments.","[Norris, Andrea R.; Drever, Mark C.; Martin, Kathy] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Drever, Mark C.; Martin, Kathy] Environm Canada, Pacific Wildlife Res Ctr, Delta, BC, Canada","Norris, AR (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",andrea.norris@alumni.ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Environment CanadaCGIAR; Space for Habitat project; Science Horizons Intern Program; Forest Renewal British Columbia; Tolko Limited; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); University of British Columbia (UBC); Forest Investment Account Forest Science Program; Southern Interior Bluebird Trail Society; Society of Canadian Ornithologists and Bird Studies Canada,"We thank the many field assistants and students who collected data on the Nestweb project over the years, particularly D.

To understand these constraints, we characterized distributions of 15 herbivore species from water, locations of peak density and degree of clustering around the peaks using zero-inflated count data models and mapping census data collected in the Mara reserve and the adjoining pastoral ranches in Kenya during a wet and dry year. Herbivores followed a humped pattern (n = 46), suggesting constrained foraging in which they balance the benefits of proximity to water with the costs of foraging where food is depleted near water and travelling to more abundant food distant from water; an exponentially decreasing pattern (n = 11), indicating strong attraction to water or vegetation near water; or a uniform (n = 3) pattern. The details rather than the types of these patterns varied between years. Herbivores concentrated farther from water and more tightly around locations of their peak densities in the ranches than the reserve. Herbivores were more abundant and widely distributed from water in the wet than the dry year, and segregated along the distance-to-water gradient, presumably to minimize interspecific competition for food. Pastoralism compressed herbivore distributions and partially excluded some species (warthog, hartebeest, topi, wildebeest, zebra, eland, buffalo and elephant) from, while attracting others (Grant's and Thomson's gazelles, impala, giraffe) to the ranches, relative to the reserve. Regulating cultivation, fencing, settlements and livestock stocking levels in the ranches would allow continued wildlife access to water, reduce competition with, displacement or harassment of wildlife by people, livestock and dogs near water.","[Ogutu, Joseph O.; Reid, Robin S.; Kruska, Russell L.; Worden, Jeffrey S.; Nyabenge, Meshack] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Ogutu, Joseph O.; Piepho, Hans-Peter] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Reid, Robin S.; Hobbs, Nicholas T.; Worden, Jeffrey S.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Rainy, Michael E.] Explore Mara Ltd, Nairobi 00200, Kenya","Ogutu, JO (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Fruwirthstr 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",jogutu2007@gmail.com; Robin.Reid@colostate.edu; piepho@uni-hohenheim.de; Tom.hobbs@colostate.edu; mikerainy@gmail.com; r.kruska@cgiar.org; jeffrey.worden@gmail.com; m.nyabenge@cgiar.org,"Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016","Piepho, Hans-Peter/0000-0001-7813-2992; Ogutu, Joseph O/0000-0002-7379-0387","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0342820]; Belgian Government [DGIC BEL011]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Research Fellowship at the Institute of Crop Science, Bioinformatics Unit, University of Hohenheim, GermanyAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","The data were collected by 22 vehicle- and 3 aircraft-counting teams, 20 organisations and 84 individuals in 1999 and 2002 (see http://www.masaimaracount.org for details).

Predators may influence mosquito prey populations through both lethal effect and non-lethal pathways. A series of experimental manipulations were used to distinguish between lethal (density-mediated interaction) and non-lethal (trait-mediated interaction) effects in a model system comprised of invasive prey mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and a predatory mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus. Treatments with predators present or manipulations mimicking daily mortality (density reduction) reduced developmental time and recruitment to the adult stage. Daily records of adult survival of A. aegypti showed that exposure to predators during the juvenile stage shortened the lifespan of adults. This was also observed in treatments, where A. aegypti were replaced at the rate of consumption by T. rutilus. In contrast, numerical reductions in A. aegypti that mimicked daily rate of predation led to adults with the longest lifespan. These observations suggest strong effects of density and trait-mediated interactions in the influence of predators on mosquito biology relevant to their ability to transmit pathogens. These results have potentially important implications for disease control strategies. The primary approach to reduce risk of mosquito-borne diseases is through population reduction of the vectors. We show an unanticipated benefit of biological control by predation for the control of juvenile stages of mosquitoes. Specifically, mosquitoes that are exposed to predators but survive to adulthood will have compromised life expectancy, a key parameter in determining risk of disease transmission.","[Bellamy, Shawna K.; Alto, Barry W.] Univ Florida, Florida Med Entomol Lab, Dept Entomol & Nematol, IFAS, 200 9th St SE, Vero Beach, FL 32962 USA","Alto, BW (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Florida Med Entomol Lab, Dept Entomol & Nematol, IFAS, 200 9th St SE, Vero Beach, FL 32962 USA.",bwalto@ufl.edu,,,,,,59,13,13,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2018,187,1,,,,,233,243,,10.1007/s00442-018-4107-5,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF1CA,WOS:000431668500020,29594613,,,,2021-09-27,

Inducible defences are a form of phenotypic plasticity by which organisms respond to and mitigate the threat posed by predators, parasites and competitors. While anti-predatory defences are often in trade-off with anti-competitor responses, chemicals that deter predators may have negative effects on competitors as well. Allelopathy is well known in plants and plant-like animals, but whether the toxins of mobile, behaviourally and morphologically complex animals are induced by and exert allelopathic effects on competitors is poorly known. 2. Common toads Bufo bufo synthesize bufadienolides which make them unpalatable or toxic to many predators. However, bufadienolide content of toad tadpoles correlates positively with the density of competitors in natural populations, suggesting that they may upregulate their toxin production to inhibit their competitors, such as heterospecific tadpoles that may be vulnerable to toad toxins. 3. We conducted a microcosm experiment with tadpoles of common toads and agile frogs Rana dalmatina, in which we manipulated the density of conspecific and heterospecific competitors. We measured the bufadienolide content of toad tadpoles to test for competitor-induced changes in toxin production, and we assessed the growth and development of agile frog tadpoles to test for allelopathy. 4. We found that toad tadpoles contained higher amounts of bufadienolides at higher densities; however, heterospecific competitors did not have a stronger effect than conspecifics. Furthermore, the presence or density of toad tadpoles had no effect on the body mass and development rate of agile frog tadpoles. 5. Our results demonstrate competitor-induced plasticity in toxin production, but we found no support for an allelopathic function of bufadienolides. Instead, we suggest that inducible changes in bufadienolide production may serve to mitigate risks posed by competitors, including aggression, cannibalism or disease. Therefore, bufadienolides are intriguing candidates for multi-purpose defences that may provide protection not only against predators but also against competitors.","[Bokony, Veronika; Uveges, Balint; Hettyey, Attila] Hungarian Acad Sci, Lendulet Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Plant Protect Inst, Ctr Agr Res, Budapest, Hungary; [Moricz, Agnes M.] Hungarian Acad Sci, Dept Pathophysiol, Plant Protect Inst, Ctr Agr Res, Budapest, Hungary","Bokony, V (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Lendulet Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Plant Protect Inst, Ctr Agr Res, Budapest, Hungary.",bokony.veronika@agrar.mta.hu,"Bokony, Veronika/AAH-7679-2020; Uveges, Balint/J-5607-2019","Bokony, Veronika/0000-0002-2136-5346; Uveges, Balint/0000-0001-9234-9258; Hettyey, Attila/0000-0003-0678-0936; Moricz, Agnes/0000-0002-4330-9396","Hungarian Academy of SciencesHungarian Academy of Sciences [LP2012-24/2012]; Marie Curie Career Integration Grant [PCIG13-GA-2013-631722]; National Research, Development and Innovation OfficeNational Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary [115402]","Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: LP2012-24/2012; Marie Curie Career Integration Grant, Grant/Award Number: PCIG13-GA-2013-631722; National Research, Development and Innovation Office, Grant/Award Number: 115402",,58,11,11,5,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Predators may increase lower trophic levels ( bacteria) by reducing density of bacteriovores, by altering behavior of bacteriovores, and by processing living bacteriovores into carcasses, feces, and dissolved nutrients that are substrates for bacteria. We tested these pathways in laboratory experiments with mosquitoes in water-filled containers. Larval Toxorhynchites rutilus prey on larval Aedes triseriatus, which feed on bacteria. Using containers stocked with oak leaf infusion as a bacterial substrate, we compared bacterial productivity at 7 and 14 days for: prey alone; prey with a predator; and prey with predation cues but no predator. Controls contained no larvae, either with predation cues or without cues. Predation cues in the control treatment increased bacterial abundance at 7 days, but this effect waned by 14 days. Aedes triseriatus larvae reduced bacterial abundance significantly at 14 days. Predator cues and real predation both eliminated the negative effect of A. triseriatus on bacterial abundance. Predation cues reduced survivorship of A. triseriatus larvae at 14 days, however this effect was smaller than the effect of real predation. We further tested effects of residues from predation as cues or as detritus in a second experiment in which A. triseriatus were killed at similar rates by: real predators; mechanical damage without the predator and carcasses left as detritus; or mechanical damage and carcasses removed. No prey larvae were killed in controls. Bacterial productivity was greater with real predation than in all other treatments and greater when prey larvae were killed or killed and removed, than in controls.

Two main types of traits, morphological and behavioural, are involved in the induced defences of many organisms. Here, we examined the influence of chemical cues of the predators Belostoma elongatum (Hemiptera, Belostomatidae) and Moenkhausia dichroura (Characiformes, Characidae) on the morphology, growth, development and activity of Scinax nasicus larvae. Our main goal was to determine whether the investment in morphological or behavioural defences varied according to the number of conspecifics and to the chemical cues of predators. To this end, we performed two experiments under microcosm conditions. In experiment 1, we determined morphological defences in tadpoles by analysing changes in morphology, growth rate and development rate, whereas in experiment 2, we determined behavioural defences by analysing changes in the activity of tadpoles. The experimental design consisted of two tadpole densities, with and without chemical cues of predators. We found that: (1) larval morphology, growth and development were significantly affected by density; (2) the chemical cues of the predators did not influence the morphology, growth or development of tadpoles; (3) tadpoles at high densities were more active than those at low densities; (4) tadpoles decreased the activity in the presence of chemical cues of M. dichroura; and (5) tadpoles increased the activity in the presence of chemical cues of B. elongatum. Our results suggest that density is a determinant factor of tadpole morphology of and that Scinax nasicus larvae respond to predators with behavioural defences, which vary according to the type of predator.",,,valeria_vig@yahoo.com.ar,,,,,,42,5,5,1,16,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,,2013,150,8,,,,,921,937,,10.1163/1568539X-00003085,,,17,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,181OI,WOS:000321678000005,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, intraguild interactions involving the world's most common carnivore, the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), have rarely been investigated. We experimentally examined the behavioural responses of a small canid, the Indian fox (Vulpes bengalensis), to the presence of dogs and dog odours. Resource competition between dogs and Indian foxes is low, so it is unclear whether foxes perceive dogs as interference competitors. To test this, we exposed foxes to neutral, live dog, and animal odour stimuli at food trays, and recorded the time spent at food trays, the amount of food eaten, and vigilance and non-vigilance behaviours. When dogs were visible, foxes continued to visit the food trays, but reduced the amount of time spent and food eaten at those trays. Foxes were more vigilant during dog trials than during neutral and odour trials and also exhibited lower levels of non-vigilance behaviour (resting and playing). In contrast, dog odours did not affect fox foraging and activity. These results show that vigilance/foraging trade-offs due to interference competition can occur between native and domestic carnivores despite low dietary overlap. These negative effects of dogs on a smaller member of the carnivore guild raise conservation concerns, especially for endangered carnivores. In many parts of the world, free-ranging dog densities are high due to human subsidies, and these subsidized predators have the potential to exacerbate the indirect effects of human presence.","[Vanak, Abi Tamim; Thaker, Maria] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Vanak, Abi Tamim; Gompper, Matthew E.] Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Thaker, Maria] Indiana State Univ, Dept Biol, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA","Vanak, AT (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, Westville Campus,Pvt Bag 54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",abivanak@gmail.com,"Vanak, Abi/F-8519-2010; Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014","Vanak, Abi/0000-0003-2435-4260; ",University of Missouri Research Board; Wildlife Conservation Society Research Fellowship Program,"This study was funded through grants from the University of Missouri Research Board ( M.

However, indirect interactions between prey can occur, leading to either increased or decreased predation on focal prey. The present paper demonstrates how alternative prey can disrupt predation by the hemipteran Orius insidiosus on the soybean aphid Aphis glycines via short-term indirect interactions. We used laboratory microcosms to measure the impact of the predator on the Population growth of the aphid in the presence of alternative prey, soybean thrips Neohydatothrips variabilis, and we characterized the foraging behaviour of the predator to assess prey preference. We showed that O. insidiosus predation on aphids was reduced in the presence of thrips and that this positive impact on aphids increased as thrips density increased. Results from the behavioural experiment support the hypothesis of a prey preference toward thrips. When prey-pest ratio is aphid-biased, short-term apparent commensalism between prey occurs in favour of the most abundant prey (aphids) with no switching behaviour appearing in O. insidiosus. These results demonstrate that potential indirect interactions should be taken into account when considering O. insidiosus as a biocontrol agent against the soybean aphid.","[Desneux, N.] INRA, Unite Rech Integrees & Hort, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Desneux, N.; O'Neil, R.

Using fences of different heights with and without holes and suspended game netting to alter principal predator (foxes and raptors) and large rodent herbivore (Octodon degus) access, four grids each have been assigned to the following treatments: 1) low fencing and holes allowing free access of predators and small mammals; 2) low fencing without holes to exclude degus only, 3) high fencing and netting with holes to exclude predators only; and 4) high fencing and netting without holes to exclude predators and degus. Small mammal population censuses are conducted monthly using mark-recapture techniques. Degu population trends during 1989 and 1990 showed strongly but nonsignificantly lower numbers in control plots during months when densities were characteristically low (September November) for this seasonally reproductive species; since March 1991, differences have become persistent and increasingly significant. Predators appear to have greater numerical effects when their prey populations are low. Survival times of degus, particularly established adults, were significantly longer in predator exclusion grids during the 2 1/2 years of observation; thus, predation also affects prey population structure.","UNIV LA SERENA,DEPT BIOL,LA SERENA,CHILE; CATHOLIC UNIV CHILE,DEPT ECOL,SANTIAGO,CHILE","MESERVE, PL (corresponding author), NO ILLINOIS UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,DE KALB,IL 60115, USA.",,"Jaksic, Fabian M/G-1705-2014","Jaksic, Fabian M/0000-0003-0098-0291",,,,73,55,56,1,27,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1993,94,2,,,,,153,158,,10.1007/BF00341311,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LE061,WOS:A1993LE06100001,28314026,,,,2021-09-27,

The hydroid was abundant during this study on prop roots of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) at Twin Cays, Belize, where it ranged vertically from 1.1 m below mean tide level (MTL) to 2-3 cm above MTL. The estimated percentage cover of the hydroid was maximal in the lower half of the intertidal zone (MTL and 0.1 m below MTL) and declined rapidly above and below that level. Colony height and number of branches per colony were also consistently highest in hydroids from the lower half of the intertidal zone. The percentage of colonies with gonophores was lowest at the lower and upper vertical limits of the species. Field observations and transplantation experiments suggest that the lower limits of D. crisioides are established by competition for space (with algae, sponges, and ascidians), smothering (by algae, sponges, ascidians, and other hydroids), and predation (by fishes). Desiccation was considered the prime factor determining the upper limits of the hydroid. Colonies transplanted to the supratidal zone were in good condition after 24 h, alive but in poor condition after 48 h, and dead after 72 and 96 h of exposure.","UNIV TORONTO,DEPT ZOOL,TORONTO M5S 1A1,ONTARIO,CANADA","CALDER, DR (corresponding author), ROYAL ONTARIO MUSEUM,DEPT INVERTEBRATE ZOOL,100 QUEENS PK,TORONTO M5S 2C6,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,,,,,,20,15,15,0,4,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

I tested for both hypotheses by conducting a press and release experiment in a mule deer, white-tailed deer, and cougar (Puma concolor (L., 1771)) community. If resource competition is causal, then predation should decrease, but other sources of mortality should increase following increased mortality of cougars and release of competing white-tailed deer. If apparent competition is causal, then predation should decrease and mule deer should increase following increased mortality of cougars and release of white-tailed deer. I accepted the apparent competition hypothesis because high mortality of female cougars and cougar population decline was associated with both white-tailed deer and mule deer population growth. Very high mortality of female cougars appeared to result in mule deer population recovery. However, high mortality of male cougars (with increased male immigration) preceding high female mortality appeared to result in sexually segregated prey-switching by females with cubs from abundant white-tailed deer to rare mule deer to avoid sexually selected infanticide. High mortality of resident male cougars may have precipitated the mule deer decline in the first place.","[Wielgus, Robert B.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Large Carnivore Conservat Lab, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Wielgus, RB (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Large Carnivore Conservat Lab, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",wielgus@wsu.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Energy Bonneville Power Administration (Wildlife Program)United States Department of Energy (DOE); B.C.

During such windows of relaxed top-down and/or bottom-up control, ungulate populations can grow rapidly, eventually leading to resource depletion and density-dependent expansion into less-preferred habitats. Although many studies have explored the demographic outcomes and ecological impacts of these processes, fewer have examined the individual-level mechanisms by which they occur. We investigated these mechanisms in Gorongosa National Park, where the Mozambican Civil War devastated large-mammal populations between 1977 and 1992. Gorongosa's recovery has been marked by proliferation of waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), an historically marginal 200-kg antelope species, which is now roughly 20-fold more abundant than before the war. We show that after years of unrestricted population growth, waterbuck have depleted food availability in their historically preferred floodplain habitat and have increasingly expanded into historically avoided savanna habitat. This expansion was demographically skewed: mixed-sex groups of prime-age individuals remained more common in the floodplain, while bachelors, loners, and subadults populated the savanna. By coupling DNA metabarcoding and forage analysis, we show that waterbuck in these two habitats ate radically different diets, which were more digestible and protein-rich in the floodplain than in savanna; thus, although individuals in both habitats achieved positive net energy balance, energetic performance was higher in the floodplain. Analysis of daily activity patterns from high-resolution GPS-telemetry, accelerometry, and animal-borne video revealed that savanna waterbuck spent less time eating, perhaps to accommodate their tougher, lower-quality diets. Waterbuck in savanna also had more ectoparasites than those in the floodplain. Thus, plasticity in foraging behavior and diet selection enabled savanna waterbuck to tolerate the costs of density-dependent spillover, at least in the short term; however, the already poorer energetic performance of these individuals implies that savanna occupancy may become prohibitively costly as heterospecific competitors and predators continue to recover in Gorongosa. Our results suggest that behavior can provide a leading indicator of the onset of density-dependent limitation and the likelihood of subsequent population decline, but that reliable inference hinges on understanding the mechanistic basis of observed behavioral shifts.","[Becker, Justine A.; Hutchinson, Matthew C.; Potter, Arjun B.; Guyton, Jennifer A.; Kuziel, Luca; Pansu, Johan; Stahl, Maria K.; Torrens, Kai R.; Pringle, Robert M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Becker, Justine A.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82072 USA; [Park, Shinkyu; Leonard, Naomi E.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Abernathy, Kyler] Natl Geog Soc, Explorat Technol Lab, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Americo, Victor F.; Da Concetc, Anagledis; Stalmans, Marc E.] Parque Nacl Gorongosa, Dept Sci Serv, Sofala, Mozambique; [Kartzinel, Tyler R.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Kartzinel, Tyler R.] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Lorenzi, Eli; Martins, Nuno C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Pansu, Johan] Sorbonne Univ, Stn Biol Roscoff, CNRS, UMR 7144, Roscoff, France; [Pansu, Johan] CSIRO Ocean & Atmosphere, Lucas Heights, NSW, Australia; [Scott, William L.] Bucknell Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA; [Long, Ryan A.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Becker, JA; Pringle, RM (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.; Becker, JA (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82072 USA.",justineabecker@gmail.com; rpringle@princeton.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1656527, IOS-1656642]; Greg Carr Foundation; Cameron Schrier Foundation; Princeton UniversityPrinceton University; National Geographic Young Explorers grantNational Geographic Society [WW-070ER-17]; Animal Behavior Society Student Research Grant","We thank Parque Nacional da Gorongosa and the government of Mozambique for permission to conduct this research.

On the island of Rarotonga, several blenny fish species appear to be in the process of colonizing land. Anecdotal observations have implied that aquatic predation is an important factor in prompting such amphibious fish behavior. We provide evidence supporting this hypothesis by demonstrating that amphibious blennies shift their abundance up and down the shoreline to remain above predatory fishes that periodically move into intertidal areas during high tide. A predation experiment using blenny mimics confirmed a high risk of aquatic predation for blennies, significantly higher than predation experienced on land. These data suggest that predation has played an active role in promoting terrestrial activity in amphibious blennies and provide a rare example of how ecological release from predation could drive the colonization of a novel environment.","[Ord, Terry J.; Summers, Thomas C.] Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ord, Terry J.; Summers, Thomas C.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Noble, Mae M.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Fulton, Christopher J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Ord, TJ (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.; Ord, TJ (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.; Fulton, CJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",t.ord@unsw.edu.au; christopher.fulton@anuedu.au,"Ord, Terry J/C-6870-2009; Fulton, Christopher/A-5971-2008","Ord, Terry J/0000-0002-2608-2150; Fulton, Christopher/0000-0002-1140-1999","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP120100356]; Research School of Biology, Australian National UniversityAustralian National University","This study was funded by a Discovery Project grant from the Australian Research Council to T.J.O.

With few exceptions, they are faunally typical of the Southern Mediterranean Tethys Margin (around palaeolatitude 25 degrees N) and range from the base to the top of the stage. The Moroccan assemblages include at least 7 genera and 10 species representing a broad spectrum of sizes and morphologies that illustrate several ecological trends. Noteworthy is the predominance of Mosasaurinae which are widespread in contemporaneous outcrops worldwide and constitute 80% and 70% of the total genus/species number respectively. In contrast, Halisauromorpha and Russellosaurina (plioplatecarpines) are scarce and tylosaurines are presently unknown. All of the Moroccan mosasaurids exhibit characteristic tooth morphologies and can be placed into resource partitioning morphoguilds indicative of adaptations for piercing, crushing or cutting. Medium to large predators are found to distribute along the 'Crush'-'Cut' axis of the morphoguild projection, and a new 'Crush-Cut' guild, previously unrecognised amongst Mesozoic marine amniotes, accommodates several Prognathodon species. Also of importance is the lack of mosasaurids along the 'Pierce'-'Crush' axis, potentially inferring that these ecological niches were occupied by other marine vertebrates such as selachians and plesiosaurians. In addition, the relative abundance of mosasaurids throughout the Maastrichtian series of the Gantour Basin evidences direct ecological competition or predation phenomena.

In marine invertebrates with a planktonic larval stage, such as echinoids, recruitment is assured by larval supply, settlement and juvenile survival. Larval supply and juvenile survival are affected by a wide range of factors, including temperature, presence of predators, quality and quantity of food. Echinoid larval settlement is mainly conditioned by the finding of a suitable substrate to metamorphose. The sea urchins Arbacia lixula and Paracentrotus lividus are considered key species of the Mediterranean infralittoral rocky shores. At high densities, the grazing activity of both species can produce and maintain barren grounds, a particular habitat condition characterized by extremely low cover values of erect algae with high presence of naked substrates and encrusting corallinales, poor in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. We tested the role of different settlement substrates on the metamorphosis competent larvae of the two species. Furthermore, from our larval rearing trails we were able to identify strong temperature effects on larval development of the two species. P. lividus and A. lixula larvae have been reared at 18 degrees C but for the second species it was necessary to use higher temperatures (22 degrees C) to perform settlement experiments, as in the 18 degrees C set all larvae died in the first week. Both species larvae have been fed Cricosphaera elongata. Metamorphosis of competent larvae has been induced using different substrates: naked stones. Lithophyllum incrustans, Stypocaulon scoparium, Corallina elongata, turf forming algae and Posidonia oceanica. For each species, two larval batches were used for settlement experiments; for each larval batch two replicates/substrates were set up. No differences in the rate of metamorphosis on any of the tested substrates were observed for P. lividus, while A. lixula showed to prefer naked stones and encrusting coralline algae Considering that A. lixula population growth may trigger barren extension on rocky shores, this may lead to a positive feedback between barren extension and A. lixula population density. Furthermore, our results suggest that the predicted rise in seawater temperature may favor A. lixula larval survival and inhibit P. lividus. Combining information on temperature tolerance with other sources of information for these species in the Mediterranean, it is possible to develop a conceptual model of the interaction between the two species and the alternative state of their habitats.

Population densities of S. viridis and its effect on foxtail millet yield were studied for 4 years in two locations, with three cultivars, under monoculture and no use of selective herbicide. Each year the density of S. viridis plants increased in all fields at a population growth rate lambda = 1.13. The stability of the lambda estimate in monoculture could serve as a reference value to predict the fate of a weed population in multi-year demographic models, using corrective factors to account for specific effects of given crop rotation and cropping practices. The low lambda value was due to a very low reproduction rate, around 6 10-4 adults per seed, which suggests high dormancy and seed predation. The yield of millet decreased linearly as the infestation increased, with the same slope whatever the cultivars. The yield loss was 0.58 tonne ha-1 for each additional plant m-2, indicating high sensitivity to competition from the wild relative. The close relationship between the weed and the crop, which could lead to similar biological responses to environmental conditions, could explain these results.","[Darmency, H.] INRA, Unite Mixte Rech Biol & Gest Adventices, F-21065 Dijon, France; [Wang, T.; Shi, Y.; Li, Y.; Song, Y.] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Crop Sci, Natl Key Facil Crop Gene Resources & Genet Improv, Beijing, Peoples R China","Darmency, H (corresponding author), INRA, UMR BGA 1210, BP 86510,17 Rue Sully, F-21065 Dijon, France.",darmency@dijon.inra.fr,,,"European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ERB-IC18-CT-98-0391]; Chinese Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2005DIA4J019, 2006BAD13B03]",We are indebted to Prof. Z.

Here we present a novel approach to the study of extinct carnivores, using a comparison between fossil records (n=3324) found in Late Pleistocene tar seeps at Rancho La Brea in North America and counts (n=4491) from playback experiments used to estimate carnivore abundance in Africa. Playbacks and tar seep deposits represent competitive, potentially dangerous encounters where multiple predators are lured by dying herbivores. Consequently, in both records predatory mammals and birds far outnumber herbivores. In playbacks, two large social species, lions, Panthera leo, and spotted hyenas, Crocuta crocuta, actively moved towards the sounds of distressed prey and made up 84 per cent of individuals attending. Small social species ( jackals) were next most common and solitary species of all sizes were rare. In the La Brea record, two species dominated, the presumably social dire wolf Canis dirus (51%), and the sabretooth cat Smilodon fatalis (33%). As in the playbacks, a smaller social canid, the coyote Canis latrans, was third most common (8%), and known solitary species were rare (< 4%). The predominance of Smilodon and other striking similarities between playbacks and the fossil record support the conclusion that Smilodon was social.","[Grether, Gregory F.; Van Valkenburgh, Blaire] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Carbone, Chris; Maddox, Tom] Zool Soc London, London NW1 4RY, England; [Funston, Paul J.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Nat Conservat Dept, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Mills, Michael G.

A camera trap method was used for a better understanding of the breeding behaviour of the griffon vulture, including the intra-and inter-species relations. A statistically significant difference was found between the independent feeding events during the pre-incubation and incubation periods of vultures. The duration of those events also differs, the ones in the second period being longer. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference was observed between the number of vultures per photo for the two sample periods, as a result of a different number of unmarked wild birds and different activity patterns of the nesting pairs. In spite of the fact that the terrestrial predators are also active during the night, their daytime presence leads to a high enough overlap between the two ecological groups, showing that the carnivores are a disturbance factor for the scavengers. The raven is the most abundant species at the feeding site and thus is a food competitor to the griffon vulture. The two species have adapted their behaviour to use the feeding station more successfully during the different biological periods. A significant decrease in the activity overlap between the individuals of the successfully nesting pairs was observed on the feeding station after the beginning of the incubation period. On the other hand, the activity overlap of the unsuccessfully nesting pairs increased in the second sample period. Camera traps can be used in further studies of the mating ecology for individual breeding pairs, when a direct observation on the nest is hard or impossible. This can be a cheap alternative of the time-consuming field observations.","[Nenov, Dimitar I.; Zlatanova, Diana P.; Grozdanov, Atanas P.] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Stoynov, Emilian H.; Peshev, Hristo V.] Fund Wild Flora & Fauna, Sofia, Bulgaria","Nenov, DI (corresponding author), Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Sofia, Bulgaria.",dinenov@uni-sofia.bg; pirin@fwff.org,"Zlatanova, Diana/A-2434-2013; Stoynov, Emilian/AAP-8999-2020; Grozdanov, Atanas/AAE-9119-2019; Peshev, Hristo/AAF-4320-2021","Zlatanova, Diana/0000-0002-4115-2786; Peshev, Hristo/0000-0001-8925-053X",Fund for Wild Flora and Fauna team,The authors express their sincere gratitude to the Fund for Wild Flora and Fauna team for their hard work on the griffon vulture reintroduction project in Kresna Gorge.

A field experiment was carried out to study seed removal of six gibbon-dispersed seed species in a tropical dry forest in central Thailand during the wet season of 2016 and early dry season of 2017. We collected seeds from the defecation of four groups of white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar), of which two groups lived in an evergreen forest habitat and two groups in a mosaic habitat composed of mixed-deciduous forest and dry-dipterocarp forest. We used camera traps to monitor seed removal activities of the rodents. Rodents had the most impact on the seeds dispersed by the gibbons. Maxomys surifer, the red-spiny rat was the most abundant ground-dwelling rodent species, and accounted for the greatest proportion of seed removal events, followed by Leopoldamys sabanus, the long-tailed giant rat, which was less abundant. The study also found that invertebrates, in particular ants, were important in post-dispersal seed removal. Seed removal by both rodents and invertebrates as well as by M. surifer alone did not differ significantly between the two habitat types. Further and longer-termed study is suggested to understand the competitive relationship between the rodents and invertebrates as well as the impacts habitat type and seasonality on seed fates.","[Dai, Ran; Ngoprasert, Dusit; Gale, George A.; Savini, Tommaso] King Mongkuts Univ Technol, Conservat Ecol Program, 49 Bangkhuntien Chaythalay Rd, Bangkok 10150, Thailand","Dai, R (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol, Conservat Ecol Program, 49 Bangkhuntien Chaythalay Rd, Bangkok 10150, Thailand.",randaiqq@gmail.com,,,,,,67,1,1,0,6,"NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, SCHOOL BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES",SINGAPORE,"DEPT ZOOLOGY, KENT RIDGE, SINGAPORE 0511, SINGAPORE",0217-2445,,,RAFFLES B ZOOL,Raffles Bull.

The crayfish Orconectes rusticus (Girard) is replacing Orconectes virilis (Hagen) and Orconectes propinquus (Girard) in northern Wisconsin lakes. To test whether O. rusticus differs from congeners in its response to the odors of food and predators, we conducted two laboratory experiments comparing five behavioral responses of these Orconectes spp. to odors of dead fish and to live largemouth bass. As expected, all three species responded to carrion odor, suggesting that olfaction is a part of foraging strategy for all three congeners. Orconectes rusticus, however, responded significantly for all five behavioral responses, whereas O. propinquus and O. virilis responded significantly for only two and three, respectively. Only O. rusticus responded to fish predator odor, but in a way contrary to our expectation. In the presence of fish predator odor, O. rusticus increased time spent out of the shelter. The larger number of significant responses by O. rusticus suggests that O. rusticus responded more strongly to the odors of fish carrion and live predaceous fish (as food) than O. virilis and O. propinquus.

We used a natural experiment to test the hypothesis that the loss of sharks on coral reefs can influence the diet and body condition of mesopredatory fishes by comparing two remote, atoll-like reef systems, the Rowley Shoals and the Scott Reefs, in northwestern Australia. The Rowley Shoals are a marine reserve where sharks are abundant, whereas at the Scott Reefs numbers of sharks have been reduced by centuries of targeted fishing. On reefs where sharks were rare, the gut contents of five species of mesopredatory teleosts largely contained fish while on reefs with abundant sharks, the same mesopredatory species consumed a larger proportion of benthic invertebrates. These measures of diet were correlated with changes in body condition, such that the condition of mesopredatory teleosts was significantly poorer on reefs with higher shark abundance. Condition was defined as body weight, height and width for a given length and also estimated via several indices of condition. Due to the nature of natural experiments, alternative explanations cannot be discounted. However, the results were consistent with the hypothesis that loss of sharks may influence the diet and condition of mesopredators and by association, their fecundity and trophic role. Regardless of the mechanism (risk effects, competitive release, or other), our findings suggest that overfishing of sharks has the potential to trigger trophic cascades on coral reefs and that further declines in shark populations globally should be prevented to protect ecosystem health.","[Barley, Shanta C.; Meeuwig, Jessica J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Perth, WA, Australia; [Barley, Shanta C.; Meeuwig, Jessica J.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, Australia; [Barley, Shanta C.; Meekan, Mark G.] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, Australia","Barley, SC (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Perth, WA, Australia.; Barley, SC (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, Australia.; Barley, SC (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, Australia.",shanta.barley@gmail.com,,"Meeuwig, Jessica/0000-0003-1169-8785; Meekan, Mark/0000-0002-3067-9427","University of Western Australia, an IPRS scholarship; Australian Institute of Marine Science; International Postgraduate Research ScholarshipAustralian Government; University of Western Australia, Perth; Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS); Woodside Energy Ltd","All funding came from the University of Western Australia, an IPRS scholarship and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.

This simplifying assumption is often justified by the perception that variation among individuals does not have significant effects on the dynamics of whole populations. However, this perception may be skewed by a historic focus on studying single populations. A true evaluation of the extent to which among-individual variation affects the dynamics of populations requires the study of multiple populations. In this study, we examined variation in the dynamics of populations of a live-bearing, marine fish (black surfperch; Embiotoca jacksoni). In collaboration with an organization of citizen scientists (Reef Check California), we were able to examine the dynamics of eight populations that were distributed throughout similar to 700km of coastline, a distance that encompasses much of this species' range. We hypothesized that genetic variation within a local population would be related to the intensity of competition and to the strength of population regulation. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether genetic diversity (measured by the diversity of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes) was related to the strength of population regulation. Low-diversity populations experienced strong density dependence in population growth rates and population sizes were regulated much more tightly than they were in high-diversity populations. Mechanisms that contributed to this pattern include links between genetic diversity, habitat use, and spatial crowding. On average, low-diversity populations used less of the available habitat and exhibited greater spatial clustering (and more intense competition) for a given level of density (measured at the scale of the reef). Although the populations we studied also varied with respect to exogenous characteristics (habitat complexity, densities of predators, and interspecific competitors), none of these characteristics was significantly related to the strength of population regulation. In contrast, an endogenous characteristic of the population (genetic diversity) explained 77% of the variation in the strength of population regulation (95% CI: 27-94%). Our results suggest that the genetic and phenotypic composition of populations can play a major role in their dynamics.","[Johnson, D.

Furthermore, sex ratios of species that regularly experience variable foundress numbers are closer to those predicted by LMC theory than species that encounter less variable foundress number scenarios. Due to their patterns of resource use, female Callosobruchus maculatus are likely to experience a broad range of foundress number scenarios. We carried out three experiments to test whether female C. maculatus adjust their sex ratios in response to foundress number and two other indicators of LMC: ovipositing on pre-parasitised patches and ovipositing with sisters.

One hypothesis is that some toxins are allelopathic, suppressing the growth of competitors, and it has been suggested that allelopathy may be one important mechanism causing algal blooms. In a metaanalysis of recent experimental work, we looked for evidence that allelopathy may explain the initiation of algal blooms. With few exceptions, allelopathic effects were only significant at very high cell densities typical of blooms. We conclude that there is no experimental support for allelopathy at prebloom densities, throwing doubts on allelopathy as a mechanism in bloom formation. Most studies tested allelopathy using cell-free manipulations. With simple models we show that cell-free manipulations may underestimate allelopathy at low cell densities if effects are transmitted during cell-cell interactions. However, we suggest that the evolution of allelopathy under field conditions may be unlikely even if based on cell-cell interactions. The spatial dispersion of cells in turbulent flow will make it difficult for an allelopathic cell to receive an exclusive benefit, and a dispersion model shows that dividing cells are rapidly separated constraining clone selection. Instead, we propose that reported allelopathic effects may be nonadaptive side effects of predator-prey or casual parasitic cell-cell interactions.","[Jonsson, Per R.; Pavia, Henrik; Toth, Gunilla] Gothenburg Univ, Dept Marine Ecol, Tjarno Marine Biol Lab, SE-45296 Stromstad, Sweden","Jonsson, PR (corresponding author), Gothenburg Univ, Dept Marine Ecol, Tjarno Marine Biol Lab, SE-45296 Stromstad, Sweden.",per.jonsson@marecol.gu.se,"Toth, Gunilla B/E-8737-2013; Pavia, Henrik/G-2764-2013; Jonsson, Per R/E-6707-2013","Jonsson, Per/0000-0002-1793-5473; Toth, Gunilla/0000-0002-1225-7773","MARICE; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [212-2006-2280, 217-2007-955]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [6212005-4845, 6212007-5779, 621-2007-5874]","We thank 3 anonymous reviewers who provided comments that improved this manuscript.

In gape-limited predators, body size asymmetries determine the outcome of predator-prey interactions. Due to ontogenetic changes in body size, the intensity of intra- and interspecific interactions may change rapidly between the match situation of a predator-prey system and the mismatch situation in which competition, including competition with the prey, dominates. 2. Based on a physiologically structured population model using the European perch (Perca fluviatilis), analysis was performed on how prey density (bream, Abramis brama), initial size differences in the young-of-the-year (YOY) age cohort of the predator, and phenology (time-gap in hatching of predator and prey) influence the size structure of the predator cohort. 3. In relation to the seasonality of reproduction, the match situation of the predator-prey system occurred when perch hatched earlier than bream and when no gape-size limitations existed, leading to decreased size divergence in the predator age cohort. Decreased size divergence was also found when bream hatched much earlier than perch, preventing perch predation on bream occurring, which, in turn, increased the competitive interaction of the perch with bream for the common prey, zooplankton; i.e. the mismatch situation in which also the mean size of the age cohort of the predator decreased. 4. In between the total match and the mismatch, however, only the largest individuals of the perch age cohort were able to prey on the bream, while smaller conspecifics got trapped in competition with each other and with bream for zooplankton, leading to enlarged differences in growth that increased size divergence. 5. The modelling results were combined with 7 years of field data in a lake, where large differences in the length-frequency distribution of YOY perch were observed after their first summer. These field data corroborate that phenology and prey density per predator are important mechanisms in determining size differences within the YOY age cohort of the predator. 6. The results demonstrate that the switch between competitive interactions and a predator-prey relationship depended on phenology. This resulted in pronounced size differences in the YOY age cohort, which had far-reaching consequences for the entire predator population.","[Borcherding, Jost; Beeck, Peter; Scharf, Werner R.] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Ecol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, Biol Resources Div, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, US Geol Survey, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Borcherding, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Ecol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",jost.borcherding@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG BO1507/5-1]; U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources DivisionUnited States Geological Survey","We gratefully acknowledge the help of Joscha Groddeck, Lisa Heermann, Martina Heynen, Stephanie Kiel, Ulrike Konig, Andreas Scharbert, Ralph Urbatzka and many volunteer helpers during the field sampling.

The degree to which communities are variable may be affected by the ecological conditions to which they are exposed and can affect their propensity to form alternative states. We examined the influence of two common ecological factors, predation and seasonal successional stage, on the variability in community composition of herbivorous pond plankton. In a highly replicated, two factor, mesocosm experiment we determined whether beta diversity was affected by seasonal successional stage of the community (two levels), by fish predation (presence/absence) or by their interaction. 2. Several significant changes were found in the composition of the rotifer, cladoceran and copepod assemblages. Most cladoceran abundances showed sharp declines in the presence of fish, while some rotifers, as well as their assemblage species richness, responded favourably to fish. The copepod assemblage was composed of omnivorous and carnivorous species, which added invertebrate predation to the experiment and which intensified as the season progressed. Copepods showed responses to fish predation that depended on seasonal successional stage of the initial community, because of changes in their stage structure and edibility as they grew from nauplii to adults. 3. Community variability was consistently high at the end of each month-long experimental period for both cladoceran and rotifer assemblages, except under two conditions. In the early season treatments, the rotifer assemblages were more consistent (lower beta diversity) in the presence of fish. This was attributed to high population growth rates for rotifers under these ecological conditions because of reduced copepod predation on them through a trophic cascade from fish. Low community variability was also observed in the late season for rotifers when fish were excluded and, as a result, they were exposed to high invertebrate predation from cyclopoid copepods. 4. Results from the early season support theoretical predictions that when community size increases, variability in composition should decline because of an increase in competitive processes over stochastic ones. Late season results suggest that a second mechanism, specialist predation, can also reduce prey community variability. Our study demonstrates that plankton communities may be more predictable under certain trophic web configurations and challenges ecologists to find ways to incorporate such inherent variability into experiments and community theory.","[Beisner, Beatrix E.; Peres-Neto, Pedro R.] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Beisner, BE (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Case Postale 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",beisner.beatrix@uqam.ca,"Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020","Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Peres Neto, Pedro/0000-0002-5629-8067",NSERC (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank R.

Here, we set microcosms to analyse how warming and predator affect the functional responses of three subtropical cladocerans (Ceriodaphnia silvestrii, Daphnia laevis, and Simocephalus serrulatus). Predator treatments included young-fish presence, young-fish absence, and fish chemical cues. Warming treatments included a control at 22 degrees C and others at + 2 degrees C and + 4 degrees C. We expected that warming would increase cladocerans' growth, reproduction, and feeding rates by metabolic demands, which also would increase the predation of fish on cladocerans and cladocerans on phytoplankton. The effects of warming and predator on cladocerans functional responses (secondary productivity and grazing rates) were tested through Linear Mixed Models, Generalized Linear Model, and Piecewise Structural Equation Modeling (piecewise SEM). Cladocerans' secondary productivity and grazing were primarily dictated by fish predation and chemical cues, but warming also reduced the grazing of cladocerans on phytoplankton. Warming and predation differently affected the secondary productivity of species depending on their body size, S. serrulatus (the largest-bodied) had reduced rates at high temperatures, D. laevis (the medium-bodied) in young-fish presence, and C. silvestrii (the smallest-bodied) at both treatments. The three species increased secondary productivity in response to fish chemical cues. Our results clarify the unique and combined effect of global warming and predator on the energy availability inside freshwater food-webs. Warming and predator have the potential to reduce cladocerans' secondary productivity and increase primary productivity in subtropical ecosystems.","[Bomfim, Francieli de Fatima; Lansac-Toha, Fabio Amodeo] Univ Estadual Maringa UEM, Nucleo Pesquisas Limnol Ictiol & Aquicultura Nupe, Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Av Colombo 5790,Campus Univ, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Gama Melao, Maria da Graca; Gebara, Renan Castelhano] Univ Fed Sao Carlos UFSCar, Dept Hidrobiol, Rod Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Bomfim, FD (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Maringa UEM, Nucleo Pesquisas Limnol Ictiol & Aquicultura Nupe, Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Av Colombo 5790,Campus Univ, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",franbonfim.bio@gmail.com,"Gebara, Renan Castelhano/K-5376-2014","Gebara, Renan Castelhano/0000-0002-2309-6186; Lansac-Toha, Fabio/0000-0001-6746-8052",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Brazilian National Council of Research and Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP),"We are grateful to the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for financial support.

Field studies were done to examine the relative importance of several of these factors in the establishment and early survival of Ceriops tagal, a species common in mid- to high-shore regions of mangrove forests in northern Australia. The fate of marked and tethered propagules was followed to estimate the range of dispersal and the intensity of predation. Propagules were artificially planted under different thicknesses of shade cloth (none, 30%, 80%) and in different habitats (clearing, forest, clearing-forest fringe) to examine the effects of light and soil conditions on survival and growth. Results suggested that dispersal was very limited: only 9% of marked propagules were ever found more than 3m from the parent tree. Losses to predators were great, with 83% of tethered propagules being damaged or consumed within 3 months. On average, 56% of planted propagules survived for at least 6 weeks and 76% of these initiated growth.

The effects of environmental and biological parameters on the distribution of these species were evaluated by generalized additive modelling (GAM). In 2017, the dominant ctenophore, Bolinopsis infundibulum, was mainly distributed in the north and west of St. Lawrence Island (SLI), and their vertical distribution varied with the region but not by the time of day. We found that B. infundibulum was distributed in the upper pycnocline north of SLI, but below the pycnocline west of SLI. Biological interactions with other gelatinous zooplankton may explain these regional differences in vertical distribution; GAM analysis revealed a negative interaction between B. infundibulum and the large scyphomedusa, Chrysaora melanaster, which occurred in the upper layer in the west of SLI. B. infundibulum may avoid that layer to reduce feeding competition. For the ctenophore, Beroe sp., vertical and horizontal distributions were similar to those of B. infundibulum, and GAM analysis also revealed a positive interaction for both species. As B. infundibulum is an important prey of Beroe sp., a prey-predator interaction may result from their similar horizontal and vertical distributions. Standing stocks of epipelagic ctenophores and scyphomedusae in 2018 were low compared to those in 2017, by a factor of 1/20 (C. melanaster) and1/90 (Beroe sp.). This might be due to annual differences in water mass in this region, in that the thermal conditions characterized by a high abundance of the dominant B. infundibulum in 2017 (<2 and >8 degrees C) were absent in 2018. As this drastic decrease in standing stock in 2018 was apparent for both ctenophores and scyphomedusae, food availability was hypothesized to be poor that year.","[Maekakuchi, Marie; Matsuno, Kohei; Yamaguchi, Atsushi] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Grad Sch Fisheries Sci, 3-1-1 Minato Cho, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan; [Matsuno, Kohei; Yamaguchi, Atsushi] Hokkaido Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Kita Ku, Kita 21 Nishi 11, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan; [Yamamoto, Jun] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, 3-1-1 Minato Cho, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan; [Abe, Yoshiyuki] Hokkaido Univ, Off Enhancing Inst Capac, Res Dev Sect, Kita Ku, Kita 21,Nishi 10, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan; [Maekakuchi, Marie] APA Hotel & Resorts Co Ltd, Minato Ku, Akasaka 3-2-3, Tokyo 1070052, Japan","Yamaguchi, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Fac Grad Sch Fisheries Sci, 3-1-1 Minato Cho, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan.",a-yama@fish.hokudai.ac.jp,"Matsuno, Kohei/AAJ-6510-2021","Matsuno, Kohei/0000-0001-9793-7622","Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) Project [JPMXD1300000000]; ArCS II; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20H03054, 19H03037, 18K14506, 17H01483]","We thank the crew members of the T/S Oshoro-Maru and our collaborators, especially Toru Hirawake, for assistance in collecting the video and CTD data.

In some cases cannibalism provides a means of acquiring nutrients and defensive compounds, reducing competition, and decreasing population density. For plants, inducing insect cannibalism is a defense mechanism to decrease damage by pests. Despite the growing awareness of cannibalism, its causes, and its ecological importance, few model systems exist, largely because observations of cannibalism are not reported. Here, we investigated the cannibalism of pupae by caterpillars of the ranchman's tiger moth, Arctia virginalis, [Lepidoptera: Erebidae] based oil an observation of a late instar caterpillar attacking the pupa of a conspecific in our laboratory. We conducted separate laboratory and field experiments to confirm this observation and determine the propensity for cannibalism under more natural conditions. We confirmed our observation of cannibalism in the laboratory experiment but failed to detect evidence of this behavior in the field. Consequently, the frequency of cannibalism, the conditions under which it occurs, and its impact on the population dynamics of A. virginalis are still unknown.","[Grof-Tisza, Patrick; Pepi, Adam] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol & Nematol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Grof-Tisza, Patrick] Univ Eastern Finland Kuopio, Dept Environm Sci, Kuopio, Finland; [Pepi, Adam] Univ Calif Davis, Ecol Grad Grp, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Grof-Tisza, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol & Nematol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Grof-Tisza, P (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland Kuopio, Dept Environm Sci, Kuopio, Finland.",p.groftisza@gmail.com,"Grof-Tisza, Patrick/AAY-7318-2020; Pepi, Adam/ABF-9389-2020","Grof-Tisza, Patrick/0000-0002-0217-4253; Pepi, Adam/0000-0002-8253-6938","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [LTREB-0639885, 157538]","We thank E.

Under field conditions, the female variegated pupfish, Cyprinodon variegatus, appeared to mate randomly among the available territorial males; i.e., male reproductive success was not correlated with male size or male color. Under laboratory conditions that prevented male-male competition, we found that although females do have a mating preference for larger males, they maintain their promiscuity by allowing a minority of their eggs to be fertilized by smaller males. We found no evidence that females increased the proportion of fertilized eggs by mating with multiple males and we suggest that the female's mating pattern resembled a bet-hedging strategy which may either increase the genetic diversity of her offspring or reduce the haphazard loss of her eggs, which could result from depositing all eggs within one heavily predated territory.","Long Isl Univ, Cw Post Ctr, Dept Biol, Brookville, NY 11548 USA; Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Draud, MJ (corresponding author), Long Isl Univ, Cw Post Ctr, Dept Biol, 720 No Blvd, Brookville, NY 11548 USA.",mdraud@liu.edu; mi00@lehigh.edu,,,,,,20,11,11,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

The structure of native coccinellid communities differed significantly for years prior to compared with years after establishment of C. septempunctata in fields of the three agricultural crops. Differences in community structure were accounted for mainly by reduced abundance of two species, C. transversoguttata richardsoni Brown and Adalia bipunctata (L.). Annual abundance of C. transversoguttata richardsoni averaged 20-32 times lower during post-invasion years than in years prior to invasion, depending on crop; while annual abundance of A. bipunctata averaged 20 times lower in corn after invasion. Addition of C. septempunctata to the community did not result in a significant increase in total abundance of coccinellids in the crops. Coccinellid abundance in agricultural crops may be limited by the total abundance of prey or by the availability of other requisites in the landscape as a whole. Therefore, introduction of a new species, while resulting in reductions in native species populations, may not increase total coccinellid abundance, and may therefore have no net effect on biological control of aphid pests.","USDA ARS,NPA,NO GRAIN INSECTS RES LAB,BROOKINGS,SD 57006; USDA,APHIS,OTIS METHODS DEV LAB,OTIS ANGB,CAPE COD,MA","Elliott, N (corresponding author), USDA,ARS,SPA,PLANT SCI RES LAB,1301 N WESTERN ST,STILLWATER,OK 74075, USA.",,,,,,,34,196,210,0,31,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,1996,105,4,,,,,537,544,,10.1007/BF00330017,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UB315,WOS:A1996UB31500015,28307147,,,,2021-09-27,

In particular, reproductive activity of aquatic-breeding anurans that inhabit tropical dry areas is affected by rainfall, which determines the availability and quality of reproductive sites. In this study, we analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of anurans with indirect development in a tropical dry forest in Western Mexico, during two rainy seasons (July 10-October 4, 2013, and June 26-September 26, 2014). We collected data on the occupancy and reproductive activity of 15 species in four temporary streams, and evaluated their relationship with precipitation, humidity and temperature. We determined richness, abundance and diversity of species in each stream; we also identified differences in the reproductive strategies and microhabitats used by the species. The most abundant species were: Tlalocohyla smithii and Exerodonta smaragdina, whereas the least abundant were Leptodactylus melanonotus and Incilius mazatlanensis. Species richness, abundance and reproductive activity peaked alongside the stream with the greatest number of breeding sites (e.g. pools). We found temporal segregation in the occupancy and reproductive activity of species in all streams which were mainly associated with precipitation. However, occupancy and reproductive activity of some species overlapped up to four weeks during part of the breeding season. Most species used specific substrates for particular reproductive activities (e.g. oviposition), but used a range of microhabitats (leaf-litter, water, rocks, branches, leaves, logs, etc.) for others (e.g. calling). We discuss these behavioral differences as factors that facilitate coexistence of species in this environment in the rainy season.","[Luna-Gomez, Martha I.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Apartado Postal 70-153, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Garcia, Andres] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Estn Biol Chamela, Apartado Postal 21, Melaque 48980, Jalisco, Mexico; [Santos-Barrera, Georgina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Museo Zool, Apartado Postal 70-399, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Estn Biol Chamela, Apartado Postal 21, Melaque 48980, Jalisco, Mexico.",moxybelis25@gmail.com; chanoc@ib.unam.mx; gsantos@ecologia.unam.mx,,,"PAPIIT, UNAMPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN204713]; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)","This work is part of a project funded by the program of support for research projects and technological innovation (PAPIIT, UNAM, IN204713) awarded to Andres Garcia.

Specialized araneophagic (spider eating) predators have evolved intriguing hunting strategies that allow them to invade spiders' webs by adopting a stealthy approach or using aggressive mimicry. Here, we present a newly discovered, specialized hunting strategy of the araneophagic spider Poecilochroa senilis (Araneae:Gnaphosidae), which forces its way into the silk retreat of the potential spider prey and immobilizes it by swathing gluey silk onto its forelegs and mouthparts. Poecilochroa senilis has been reported from the nests of a several, often large, spider species in the Negev desert (Israel), suggesting specialization on spiders as prey. Nevertheless, in laboratory experiments, we found that P. senilis has a wider trophic niche, and fed readily on several small insect species. The specialized nest-invading attack was used more frequently with large spiders, and even small juvenile P. senilis were able to attack and subdue larger spiders. Our observations show that specific hunting tactics, like nest usurpation, allow specialized predators to overcome defences of dangerous prey.","[Michalek, Ondrej; Pekar, Stano] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Lubin, Yee] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Michalek, O; Pekar, S (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.",michalek.ontirej@mail.muni.cz; pekar@sci.muni.cz,"Pekar, Stano/F-4148-2010; Michalek, Ondrej/AAC-2353-2020","Pekar, Stano/0000-0002-0197-5040; Michalek, Ondrej/0000-0002-7854-1363",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [GA15-14762S],"This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (grant number GA15-14762S).

Pursuing this hypothesis further, we used the minimum model to design and analyse a mesocosm experiment, studying the effect of high (+Z) and low (-Z) copepod density on resource allocation, along an organic-C addition gradient. In the Arctic, both effects are plausible due to changes in advection patterns (affecting copepods) and meltwater inputs (affecting carbon). The model predicts a trophic cascade from copepods via ciliates to flagellates, which was confirmed experimentally. Auto-and heterotrophic flagellates affect bacterial growth rate and abundance via competition for mineral nutrients and predation, respectively. In +Z, the model predicts low bacterial abundance and activity, and little response to glucose; as opposed to clear glucose consumption effects in -Z. We observed a more resilient bacterial response to high copepods and demonstrate this was due to changes in bacterial community equitability. Species able to use glucose to improve their competitive and/or defensive properties, became predominant. The observed shift from a SAR11-to a Psychromonodaceae - dominated community suggests the latter was pivotal in this modification of ecosystem function. We argue that this group used glucose to improve its defensive or its competitive abilities (or both). Adding such flexibility in bacterial traits to the model, we show how it creates the observed resilience to top-down manipulations observed in our experiment.","[Tsagaraki, Tatiana M.; Pree, Bernadette; Larsen, Aud; Bratbak, Gunnar; Ovreas, Lise; Egge, Jorun K.; Paulsen, Maria L.; Thingstad, T.

However, chemical alarm cues released from injured conspecifics could also dissuade cannibalism. The purpose of this study was to test mechanisms that may influence cannibalistic behaviour. We tested whether the tendency of tadpoles to consume conspecifics would increase with the presence of competition and/or cues of profitable diets. Tadpoles placed in 1L experimental containers were tested for feeding initiation times of multiple diets, including conspecific tissues and conspecific tissues combined with chemical cues from the alternative diets (brine shrimp and cornmeal). Tadpoles were tested in the presence and absence of a competitor, and at multiple times over the course of the study. Tadpoles exhibited an altered response to diets over time; however the presence of a competitor reduced response times to all diets including conspecific tissues. Similarly, the presence of specific diets also reduced the response time of tadpoles to conspecific tissues.

Samples were collected from Tarifa Island (Punta Marroqui, 36A degrees 00'00.7aEuro(3)N 5A degrees 36'37.5aEuro(3)W) bimonthly from December 2005 to December 2006 to explore seasonal and sex-related differences in diet. The gut contents of the two species included detritus, metazoan prey (crustaceans, polychaetes, hydroids, nematodes, and turbellarians), macroalgae, microalgae, and dinoflagellates. The dominant component was detritus, followed by crustaceans, mainly copepods, and macroalgal tissues. A three-way analysis of variance was conducted using the factors species (C. penantis vs. C. grandimana), sex (males vs. females), and month (seven dates, December 2005-December 2006). Males of both species had a significantly higher proportion of prey and a lower proportion of detritus in their guts than females. The larger body and gnathopod 2 of males appeared to be related to a more carnivorous diet. Both species fed more on crustaceans and macroalgae during the summer (April, June, and August), probably owing to fluctuations in prey availability and seasonal variations in algal abundance. Moreover, C. penantis was significantly more predatory than C. grandimana, but both species had a diet based mainly on detritus and crustaceans. Caprella penantis dwells at the lower intertidal and C. grandimana at the mid-tide level, which may reduce competition between the species.","[Martinez-Laiz, G.; Guerra-Garcia, J.

This provision may facilitate protection against herbivory. However, plants often cannot prevent other organisms from utilizing these foods as well. There. are many examples of herbivorous arthropods that can feed on plant-provided foods such as extrafloral nectar and pollen. The question therefore arises whether individual plants still gain protection when not only the predators, but also the herbivores, can feed on these foods. We investigated this question using a mathematical model and experiments that assessed the impact of supplementary pollen on the dynamics of predatory mites (Iphiseius degenerans (Berlese)) and herbivorous thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)), two arthropods capable of using pollen for reproduction. Replicated greenhouse experiments showed that addition of pollen every two weeks to one young mature leaf of a male-sterile cucumber-plant increased predator population growth and greatly reduced herbivore numbers. A stage-structured predator-prey-pollen model with experimentally established parameter gave reasonably accurate predictions of population trends observed in the greenhouse experiments with and without pollen. Model analysis yielded three important results. First, herbivore (prey) equilibria always settled to lower values in the presence of pollen. Second, mean herbivore numbers during the transient phase following predator release were not always lower under pollen supply, depending on the initial numbers of predators and prey. Third, limiting the plant area covered with pollen led to a decrease in mean herbivore numbers; provided that the predators aggregated in (and thereby monopolized) pollen patches. The latter result may explain why plants provide alternative foods at specific sites.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands","Van Rijn, PCJ (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Kruislaan 320, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands.",rijn@science.uva.nl,,,,,,72,167,174,0,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2002,83,10,,,,,2664,2679,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2664:HPBFPF]2.0.CO;2,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,617ER,WOS:000179348800002,,,,,2021-09-27,

It has been proposed that the biotic resistance offered by native predators, competitors and disease organisms plays a role. In Yaquina Bay, Oregon, we observed very little overlap in the distribution of the invasive European green crab, Carcinus maenas, and the larger red rock crab, Cancer productus. C. productus dominates the more saline, cooler lower estuary and C. maenas, the less saline, warmer upper estuary. Because caged C. maenas survive well in the lower estuary, we decided to test the hypothesis that C. productus prey on C. maenas and thus contribute to their exclusion from the more physically benign lower estuary. A laboratory species interaction experiment was designed to determine whether C. productus preys on smaller C. maenas at a higher rate than on smaller crabs of their own species. Crabs of both species were collected and sorted by weight into three size classes: small, medium and large. Small and medium crabs of both species were paired with C. maenas and C. productus of various sizes. When conspecifics were paired, mortality was less than 14%, even in the presence of larger crabs. Smaller C. productus survived well in the presence of larger C. maenas, but the reverse was not true. When small C. maenas (60-67 mm carapace width) were matched with medium and large C. productus, their mortality increased to 52% and 76%, respectively. A less dramatic pattern was observed for medium C. maenas (73-80 mm) in the presence of medium and large C. productus. Thus on the West Coast of North America, the more aggressive red rock crab, C. productus, has the potential to reduce the abundance of C. maenas in the more saline and cooler lower estuaries.","[Hunt, Christopher E.] Oregon State Univ, Environm Sci Program, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Yamada, Sylvia Behrens] Oregon State Univ, Zool Dept, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hunt, Christopher E.] Sci Applicat Int Corp, Bothell, WA 98011 USA","Yamada, SB (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Zool Dept, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",yamadas@science.oregonstate.edu,,,,,,53,48,52,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Because many of the underlying mechanisms of foraging are temperature dependent in ectotherms, the distribution of ectothermic foragers between food patches may similarly depend on temperature because the difference in fitness rewards between these patches may change with temperature. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of Common Gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) between food patches can be explained by an IFD, but that conformance to an IFD weakens as temperature departs from the optimal temperature because fitness rewards, interference competition and the number of individuals foraging are highest at the optimal temperature. First, we determined the optimal temperature for foraging. Second, we examined group foraging at three temperatures and three density treatments. Search time was optimized at 27 degrees C, handling time at 29 degrees C and digestion time at 32 degrees C. Gartersnakes did not match an IFD at any temperature, but their distribution did change with temperature: snakes at 20 degrees C and at 30 degrees C selected both food patches equally, while snakes at 25 degrees C selected the low food patch more at low density and the high food patch more at high density. Food consumption and competition increased with temperature, and handling time decreased with temperature. Temperature therefore had a strong impact on foraging, but did not affect the IFD. Future work should examine temperature-dependent foraging in ectotherms that are known to match an IFD.","[Halliday, William D.; Blouin-Demers, Gabriel] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Halliday, WD (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada.",whall075@uottawa.ca,,"Halliday, William/0000-0001-7135-076X",University of Ottawa; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We are grateful to P.

The sediment composition was stable at each site: sediments densely covered with seagrass (Suaeda glauca) in the lower estuarine site (Station S) were finer, with higher content of organic matter, phaeopigments and water than sediments at the upper estuarine site (Station S-P) which was unvegetated other than for patches of S. glauca and common reed (Phragmites australis). Chlorophyll a exhibited a similar distribution in the two habitats. A total of 14 meiofaunal groups, and 249 species of ciliates belonging to 37 genera, 28 families and 16 orders, were isolated from the two sites. Univariate and multivariate measures of the communities were significantly different between the two habitats. There were higher abundances of ciliates and meiofauna, and a greater diversity of ciliates, at Station S than Station S-P (223 vs. 61 species). Herbivorous ciliates were numerically predominant in ciliate communities at both sites. The representative ciliates at Station S-P belonged to the Cyrtophorida and appeared to be a reduced subset of the assemblage at Station S. which was characterized by members of the Prostomatida, Cyrtophorida, Hypotrichida and Scuticociliatida. More than 96% of the total meiofauna were nematodes, accounting for 93% of the differences in the abundance compositions of the meiofaunal communities between habitats. The average individual weights of nematodes were nearly 3 times greater at Station S than Station S-P, indicating a distinctive species composition at each site. Temperature, salinity and food availability were key factors that regulated the ciliate and meiofaunal community structure. Nematodes were the dominant group in terms of the combined abundance, biomass and benthic metabolism of ciliates and meiofauna. With respect to the dominance of herbivorous ciliates and epistrate-feeder nematodes in seagrass sediment, predator-prey relationships and competition for food resources between nematodes and ciliates are likely to be important factors in controlling the abundances of these groups.

Thus, it is difficult to determine the real ecological role of this group in ecosystems and how their communities are structured. In the present study, we analyzed the diet of six co-occurring Neotropical land planarians and their success in capturing prey, based on experiments in the laboratory, in order to determine how they share resources in the same environment. We also calculated indices of food niche breadth and food niche overlap for land planarians for the first time. The diet of Luteostriata abundans comprises only woodlice and the diets of Obamaficki and Obama ladislavii are composed only of gastropods, while Paraba multicolor and Obama anthropophila feed on both gastropods and other land planarians. An invasive species recently found in Western Europe, Obama nungara, showed the highest food niche breadth, feeding on gastropods, earthworms and planarians. We found the highest niche overlap between O. anthropophila and P. multicolor. The results suggest that land planarians are frequent predators of woodlice and land gastropods in the Neotropical ecozone and thus are important for the maintenance of native ecosystems and for the control of invasive species. The coexistence of several species in the same habitat is possible due to the use of different species as main prey, which reduces interspecific competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Dietary overlap is one of the numerous niche dimensions used to characterize resource partitioning and potential competition within a community. We characterize the diet, potential dietary niche overlap and prey preference of a large African carnivore guild on small fenced protected areas. To quantify the potential inter- and intraspecific foraging competition, we analysed 5,128 kills, representing 35 prey species made by African wild dogs Lycaon pictus (n = 553), cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus (1,427), lions Panthera leo (2,648) and leopards P. pardus (500). Our results show that large African carnivores in small protected areas are exposed to considerable overlap in dietary resource utilization. At the interspecific level, African wild dogs and cheetahs displayed the greatest vulnerability to potential dietary competition. Lions exhibited marked differences in prey preference, mass and species utilization compared to the other carnivores. African wild dogs and cheetah females with dependent offspring occupied the greatest potential for dietary competition within the large carnivore guild. Using a case study based on the preferred biomass of prey available, we estimate the sustainable density of large carnivores at a small fenced prospective African wild dog reintroduction site. African wild dogs displayed the lowest mean predicted density compared to all sympatric predators with an expected population size of 7 individuals. Our research highlights the need to assess the influence of competitive forces in structuring and restoring large predators to portions of their historical range by identifying species most vulnerable to a potential reintroduction attempt. In the absence of controlled experiments, elucidating the influences of exploitation competition is challenging, and only through manipulating sympatric species presence and densities can these complex interactions be fully understood.","[Vogel, John T.; Venter, Jan A.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management, George Campus,Madiba Dr, ZA-6530 George, Western Cape, South Africa; [Vogel, John T.] Eastern Cape Pk & Tourism Agcy, East London, South Africa; [Somers, Michael J.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Invas Biol, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol,Eugene Marais Chair Wildlife, Pretoria, South Africa","Venter, JA (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management, George Campus,Madiba Dr, ZA-6530 George, Western Cape, South Africa.",jan.venter@mandela.ac.za,/A-1523-2008,/0000-0002-5836-8823,,,,61,3,3,5,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Its colonies defend their whole foraging areas (territories) against other territorial ants, including F. sanguinea Latr., a common facultative slave-maker. The most frequent 'victim' of F. sanguinea is F. fusca L., a ubiquitous submissive ant species. On the basis of some earlier observations, the presumption was made that F. polyetena, when defending its own territories, would indirectly protect F. fusca, colonies, which nest within these territories, from F. sanguinea raids. It was expected that F. fusca should be more abundant in F. polyetena territories, than in F. sanguinea territories, while other subordinate ants, which are not potential slaves of F. sanguinea, should not show such difference. This hypothesis was supported by the results of the baiting experiments carried out in the Bialowieza Forest, NE Poland. The findings are discussed in the context of interspecific competition hierarchy in ants.","Polish Acad Sci, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insect, Museum & Inst Zool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; Univ Babes Bolyai, Dept Taxonomy & Ecol, Cluj Napoca 3400, Romania","Czechowski, W (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insect, Museum & Inst Zool, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",wcz@miiz.waw.pl; mbalint@biolog.ubbcluj.ro,"Marko, Balint/C-3081-2011","Czechowski, Wojciech/0000-0001-9422-2453; Marko, Balint/0000-0001-6039-8231",,,,46,20,20,0,7,MUSEUM & INST ZOOLOGY PAS-POLISH ACAD SCIENCES,WARSAW,"WILCZA STREET 64, 00-679 WARSAW, POLAND",0003-4541,1734-1833,,ANN ZOOL,Ann.

Two species of fish (common tarp Cyprinus carpio and perch Perca fluviatilis) increased the survival of small tadpoles severalfold by selectively consuming predatory invertebrates, bur a third species of fish (rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus) devoured tadpoles and invertebrates indiscriminately. Survival of larger tadpoles later in larval development was less affected by the reduction of invertebrate predation pressure from carp and perch, probably because abiotic factors (pond desiccation and anoxia) were stronger agents of tadpole mortality. In ponds of low pH (ca 4.5) there was greatly increased spawn mortality and reduced tadpole growth rates but no significant change in tadpole predation compared with circumneutral controls. Neutralisation of acid ponds to pH 7 by addition of Ca(OH)(2) restored spawn viability and tadpole growth rates to control levels without affecting predation level. Addition of organic nutrients stimulated tadpole growth rates significantly in oligotrophic ponds but not sufficiently to improve survival of small larvae in the Face of predation. Extensive growths of macrophytes increased predator numbers up to more than twofold but effects on tadpole mortality rates differed between experiments. Replacement of natural substrates by concrete basins substantially increased tadpole survival throughout development, probably because both predation by invertebrates and abiotic mortality factors were ameliorated. Predation was a strong force early in natterjack tadpole development irrespective of chemical and biological conditions within ponds, but became much less important compared with abiotic factors as an agent of mortality at later times.",,"Denton, JS (corresponding author), UNIV SUSSEX,SCH BIOL SCI,BRIGHTON BN1 9QG,E SUSSEX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,27,18,20,0,23,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,APR,1997,20,2,,,,,166,174,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00359.x,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WT788,WOS:A1997WT78800009,,,,,2021-09-27,

These fish use coastal marine ecosystems as nursery areas, but also to forage and to avoid predation or competition. We studied spatial, seasonal, lunar and diel variations in a coastal fish community from a marine protected area of the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau. Fish were sampled with 46 beach seine net sessions in 2015 and 2016. A total of 35 fish species of 25 families were captured. Fish abundance varied between years and seasons, with a higher abundance in the dry season, but not by lunar tide. Nonetheless, the community composition was broadly similar over the seasons, among islands and between lunar tides. Clupeidae, Haemulidae and Gerreidae were the most abundant fish families. Sardinella maderensis highly dominated the captures throughout the year, with catches much higher than any other species. The differences in abundance between seasons and years may be related with movements to or from the shore due to feeding activity or to avoid predation, or else to differences in recruitment between years. There were no significant diel differences in species richness and diversity, although higher numbers of fish were captured during daytime. For most species the majority of individuals captured were immature, highlighting the importance of the archipelago as nursery area for several species. These small pelagics, and particularly Sardinella maderensis, represent the main prey for several marine predators. Thus, the conservation of such fish species may be key for the management of the Bijagos Archipelago. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We tested experimentally whether dispersal options influence dispersal propensity in the cooperatively breeding Lake Tanganyika cichlids Neolamprologus pulcher and N. savoryi. Cooperative groups of these fishes breed in densely packed colonies, surrounded by unoccupied, but apparently suitable breeding habitat. Breeding inside colonies and living in groups seems to benefit individuals, for example by early detection and deterrence of predators. We show that despite a slight preference of both species for habitat with a higher stone cover, 40% of the preferred habitat remained unoccupied. On average, the colonies contained a higher number of (1) predators of adults, juveniles and eggs, (2) shelter competitors, and (3) other species including potential food competitors, compared to the outside colony habitat. Apparently, habitat differences cannot explain why these cichlids breed in colonies. Accordingly, dispersal may not be limited by a lack of suitable breeding shelters, but by the relatively higher risk of establishing an outside-compared to a within-colony breeding territory. To test whether cichlids prefer within- to outside-colony breeding territories, we provided breeding shelters inside the colony and at the colony edge and studied helper dispersal. As expected, significantly more shelters were occupied within the colony compared to the edge. New breeding pairs with several helpers occupied these shelters. We conclude that although breeding habitat is plentiful outside the colonies, helpers delay dispersal to obtain a higher quality breeding position within the group or colony eventually, or they disperse in groups. Our results suggest that (1) group augmentation and Allee effects are generally important for dispersal decisions in cooperatively breeding cichlids, consistent with the 'benefits of philopatry hypothesis', and (2) habitat saturation cannot fully explain delayed dispersal in these species.","[Heg, D.; Heg-Bachar, Z.; Taborsky, M.] Univ Bern, Dept Behav Ecol, Inst Zool, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland; [Brouwer, L.] Univ Groningen, Anim Ecol Grp, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Heg, D (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Dept Behav Ecol, Inst Zool, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland.",dik.heg@esh.unibe.ch,"Taborsky, Michael/F-8420-2013","Taborsky, Michael/0000-0002-1357-4316","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [3100-064396, 3100A0-108473]","We thank C.

Several countries are now engaged in identifying these areas based on animal tracking, but this is often limited to a few individuals from one breeding population, which may result in biased portrayals of the key marine habitats. To help identify such foraging areas, we compiled tracking data of a marine top predator from the main breeding colonies in the Central Macaronesia. Location North-east Atlantic Ocean. Methods Over seven years, we tracked the foraging movements of Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris borealis) from several populations during the chick-rearing period using global positioning system and platform terminal transmitter devices. Results We obtained foraging trips from 174 shearwaters breeding on six important colonies representative of the range occupied in the Macaronesian Archipelagos of Madeira, Salvages and Canaries. Our results show that birds orient and move rapidly towards the closest neritic waters over the African continental shelf. Birds from different colonies show substantial spatial segregation in their foraging grounds but consistently overlap in some specific foraging areas along the Canary Current characterized by high productivity. By weighting the use of foraging grounds according to the size of each study population, we inferred the overall exploitation of such areas. Main conclusions Our meta-population approach provides a more comprehensive picture of space use from both perspectives: the studied species and the Canary Current system. Foraging grounds consistently used by several populations may not be adequately identified by tracking a single population, and therefore, multiple population tracking studies are needed to properly delineate key conservation areas and inform conservation planning in the marine ecosystem. Finally, we highlight the long-term stability and sustainability of identified foraging areas and propose that countries with geographical jurisdictions over the Canary Current area should work towards multilateral agreements to set management plans for this key marine ecosystem.","[Ramos, Rauel; Catry, Paulo] ISPA Inst Univ, Eco Ethol Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal; [Ramos, Rauel; Reyes-Gonzalez, Jose M.; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob] Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Ramos, Rauel; Reyes-Gonzalez, Jose M.; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Granadeiro, Jose P.] Univ Lisbon, CESAM, Museu Nacl Hist Nat & Ciencia, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rodriguez, Beneharo; Becares, Juan; Ruiz, Asuncion; Arcos, Pep] Soc Espanola Ornitol SEO Birdlife, Barcelona 08026, Spain; [Navarro, Joan] Inst Ciencies Mar ICM CSIC, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Paiva, Vitor H.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Inst Marine Res IMAR CMA, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal; [Fagundes, Isabel] Soc Portuguesa Estudo Aves, P-9060314 Funchal, Portugal","Ramos, R (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut CNRS UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France.",ramos@ub.edu,"REYES-GONZALEZ, JOSE MANUEL/N-9182-2017; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/E-8060-2011; Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/C-3942-2008; Paiva, Vitor H./J-1092-2019; Ramos, Raul/S-3112-2016; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Catry, Paulo/I-5408-2013","REYES-GONZALEZ, JOSE MANUEL/0000-0001-8311-3235; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/0000-0002-7207-3474; Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/0000-0002-8691-9397; Paiva, Vitor H./0000-0001-6368-9579; Ramos, Raul/0000-0002-0551-8605; Rodriguez, Beneharo/0000-0002-9946-3421; Catry, Paulo/0000-0003-3000-0522","Beatriu de Pinos [2010-BP_A-00173]; Juan de la CiervaInstituto de Salud Carlos III [JCI-2009-05426]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BPD/63825/2009]; Formacion de Profesorado Universitario (FPU)Spanish Government [AP2009-2163]; European Union (EU)CGIAREuropean Commission; Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (MEyC)Spanish Government; Portuguese FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [LIFE04NAT/ES/000049(EU), LIFE04NAT/PT/000213(EU), LIFE07NAT/E/000732(EU), LIFE09NAT/PT/000041(EU), REN2002-01164(MEyC), CGL2006-01315/BOS(MEyC), CGL2009-11278/BOS(MEyC), PTDC/MAR/71927/2006(FCT), PEst-OE/MAR/UI0331/2011(FCT)]","We are thankful to A.

Crappie with limited reproduction would be an attractive management option for minimizing overpopulation. An experiment was conducted to measure survival, abundance of age-0 offspring, and growth of Black Crappie and hybrid crappie (female Black Crappie P. nigromaculatus x male White Crappie P. annularis) in small impoundments. Sixteen unfertilized 0.1-ha ponds were stocked with Black Crappie or hybrid crappie. Half of the ponds with Black Crappie and hybrid crappie were also stocked with Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, and all ponds were stocked with Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas as supplemental forage. In September 2013, ponds were harvested and drained; weight and lengths were recorded from all adult Black Crappie and hybrid crappie, and all age-0 Black Crappie and hybrid crappie were counted and recorded. Adult survival rates did not differ among groups (F = 0.72, df = 2, P = 0.5059), ranging from 25% to 58%. Predation and increased competition with other centrarchids may be a function of adult Black Crappie and hybrid crappie survival. The number of age-0 fish recovered from each pond was highly variable and ranged from 0 to 52,162 individuals, with no significant differences observed among the groups with and without predators (F = 3.73, df = 2, P = 0.0524). Hybrid crappie were significantly heavier (F = 14.36, df = 2, P = 0.0011) and longer (F = 8.45, df = 2, P = 0.0071) than Black Crappie. Growth rates for hybrid crappie were higher than any previously documented research of individual crappie species. High densities of Fathead Minnow for forage may explain the high growth rates. Hybrid crappie may be a viable alternative for stocking in small impoundments, but further investigation of the long-term success of stocked hybrid crappie is warranted.","[Baumhoer, Brandon M.; Kelly, Anita M.] Univ Arkansas Pine Bluff, Dept Aquaculture Fisheries, 1200 North Univ Dr,Mail Slot 4912, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA; [Baumhoer, Brandon M.] Missouri Dept Nat Resources, Water Resource Ctr, POB 176, Jefferson City, MO 65102 USA","Kelly, AM (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas Pine Bluff, Dept Aquaculture Fisheries, 1200 North Univ Dr,Mail Slot 4912, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA.",kellya@uapb.edu,"Kelly, Anita/AAN-7444-2020",,U.

In fire-prone mediterranean-climate vegetation, such as California chaparral, rodents are commonly assumed to be the most effective post-dispersal seed predators, which would render them the main driver for soil seed bank dynamics. This is a critical issue because the most dominant species of the chaparral rely on dormant, persistent soil seed banks to recruit after wildfires. Here, we used a series of exclusion experiments in combination with close video observation to show that granivorous birds are more effective than rodents in removing seeds of Ceanothus papillosus, a fire-dependent obligate seeder shrub of the California chaparral. We furthermore used seed traps and germination experiments to show that C. papillosus can have extremely high seed production and expresses strong intra and inter-annual seed bank dynamics. We conclude in contrast to other studies, that granivorous birds, in addition to rodents, are major determinants of C. papillosus seed bank densities. We also found that seed bank density increased between years, despite high seed predation rates. We conclude that high seed production in combination with small and dark seed design may help some seeds to stay undetected, thus allowing C. papillosus to build a sufficiently dense enough seed bank to regenerate after wildfire. Our results indicate that the ratio of granivorous birds to rodents has the potential to play a major role in shaping chaparral community structure by differentially impacting soil seed bank densities.","[Warzecha, Bernhard; Parker, V.

Historically the apex predator in this aquatic ecosystem, LCT in Pyramid Lake are now entirely dependent on hatchery programs and are potentially threatened by the introduction of a nonnative piscivore. The purpose of this study was to identify strong food web interactions and potential trophic limitations to the LCT population. Our specific objectives were to estimate seasonal foraging patterns, trophic position (TP), trophic niche space, diet composition, and seasonal depth distributions of LCT relative to prey fish. Additionally, we evaluated the potential for competition between LCT and nonnative, piscivorous Sacramento Perch Archoplites interruptus by examining diet overlap and trophic niche space. Our results indicate that LCT are apex predators, with TP (large [>400mm TL] LCT: TP [mean +/- 1.96<bold>SE</bold>]= 4.30 +/- 0.04) and diet composition indicating high rates of piscivory (average annual rate of piscivory=77.1% for large LCT) throughout the year. Small (200-400mm TL) LCT exhibited weak dietary overlap (Schoener's index=0.55) and large LCT exhibited strong overlap (Schoener's index=0.72) with Sacramento Perch. These trends were present despite seasonal changes in distribution and catch of Tui Chub Siphateles bicolor, the primary prey of LCT. Analysis of isotopic niche space also indicated strong overlap between the trophic niche of large LCT (89%) and that of Sacramento Perch; however, overall catch rates of Sacramento Perch were low. Despite the presence of a potential nonnative competitor, LCT demonstrate high rates of piscivory and are not negatively influenced by Sacramento Perch. Overall, these results demonstrate how trophic niche ecology can be used to evaluate key food web interactions in anthropogenically altered ecosystems.","[Heredia, Nicholas A.; Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Heredia, Nicholas A.; Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Heredia, NA (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA.; Heredia, NA (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",nhere81@gmail.com,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lahontan National Fish Hatchery Complex; U.S. Geological Survey, Utah Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research UnitUnited States Geological Survey; Ecology Center at Utah State University","Funding for this project was provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lahontan National Fish Hatchery Complex; the U.S. Geological Survey, Utah Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (in kind); and the Ecology Center at Utah State University.

The presence of predators can strongly influence ecological systems both directly by consuming prey and indirectly by altering prey behavior or habitat use. As such, the threat of attack by higher level predators may strongly influence agonistic interactions among conspecifics via nonconsumptive (e.g., behaviorally mediated) predator effects. We sought to investigate these interactions experimentally using larval salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) as prey and dragonfly nymphs (Anax junius) as predators. Specifically, we quantified salamander behavioral responses to perceived predation risk (PPR) from dragonfly nymphs and determined the degree to which PPR influenced intraspecific aggression (i.e., intraspecific biting and cannibalism) among prey. This included examining the effects of predator exposure on the magnitude of intraspecific biting (i.e., extent of tail damage) and the resulting change in performance (i.e., burst swim speed). Salamander larvae responded to PPR by reducing activity and feeding, but did not increase refuge use. Predator exposure did not significantly influence overall survival; however, the pattern of survival differed among treatments. Larvae exposed to PPR experienced less tail damage from conspecifics, and maximum burst swim speed declined as tail damage became more extensive. Thus, escape ability was more strongly compromised by intraspecific aggression occurring in the absence of predation risk. We conclude that multitrophic indirect effects may importantly modulate intraspecific aggression and should be considered when evaluating the effects of intraspecific competition.","[Hossie, Thomas J.; MacFarlane, Shawn; Clement, Amy; Murray, Dennis L.] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON, Canada","Hossie, TJ (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON, Canada.",thossie@trentu.ca,"Hossie, Thomas/I-5729-2012","Hossie, Thomas/0000-0001-7777-4379",NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); CRC Research Funds,NSERC Discovery Grant; CRC Research Funds,,49,3,3,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Furthermore, we have shown that concentrations of corticosteroid metabolites in desert rodents' faeces change in response to changing levels of food availability, competitor density, and moonlight. This suggests that stress hormones play an important role in mediating the trade-off of food and safety and in managing foraging. Hypotheses: Higher concentrations of the exogenous stress hormone cortisol will increase gerbils' marginal valuation of energy (MVE) and their vigilance. In general, cortisol will mediate responses to slowly changing factors associated with food and safety, but not to rapidly changing ones. Methods: In order to test these hypotheses, we manipulated cortisol concentrations in a set of gerbils by injecting each subcutaneously with 21-day slow-release 0.01 mg cortisol pellets and compared their foraging behaviour with that of a control group. The experiment was conducted in a large outdoor vivarium where we could simulate features of the gerbils' desert environment, manipulate the presence of a predatory owl (i.e. a rapidly changing factor), and quantify patch use over the course of a lunar cycle from new moon to full moon (i.e. a slowly changing factor). Foraging behaviour was quantified by giving-up densities (GUDs; the amount of food left in a resource patch after foraging), time allocated to foraging, and harvest rate curves in artificial foraging patches (seed trays). Results: Giving-up densities were affected by the interaction of cortisol treatment and moon phase, but not the interaction of cortisol treatment and owl presence. Gerbils implanted with cortisol foraged longer, but harvested food more slowly (suggesting greater vigilance and apprehension), than placebo-treated gerbils. This reaffirms that glucocorticoids affect energy acquisition, and provides a physiological context to explain how foragers manage risk and the trade-off between food and safety.","[Sargunaraj, Franklin; Kotler, Burt P.; St Juliana, Justin R.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [St Juliana, Justin R.] Indiana State Univ, Dept Biol, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Wielebnowski, Nadja] Oregon Zoo, Dept Conservat & Res, Portland, OR USA; [Wielebnowski, Nadja] Chicago Zool Soc, Brookfield Zoo, Conservat Sci Dept, Brookfield, IL USA","Kotler, BP (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",kotler@bgu.ac.il,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [804/09]; Israel Nature and National Parks Authority [5-2-2011],"Funding was provided by the Israel Science Foundation, Research Grant Application #804/09 to B.P.K.

We quantified the magnitude of interference competition between individuals using a combination of experiments and computer simulations, which allowed us to remove the effect of exploitative competition. We used this approach to test the hypothesis that interference competition reduces feeding rates of young red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and that the magnitude of interference competition is related to phenotypic traits, such as the sizes of competitors and behavioral interactions between them. In laboratory experiments, we measured prey consumption and behavioral interactions between 2 fish of different sizes (7- to 25-mm standard length). We used computer simulations to remove the effects of exploitative competition and found that prey consumed by focal individuals decreased in the presence of competitors due to interference competition and that the decrease was stronger when focal individuals were smaller than competitors and when the competing individuals were generally larger. We also found greater impairment of prey consumption by focal individuals when they were more vigilant (more reactive) to the presence of competitors. A better understanding of the magnitude of asymmetry in interference competition has important implications for understanding population dynamics, spatial distribution, and reproductive strategies of many organisms. This is the first study to quantify the asymmetry in interference competition when prey density changes over time.","[Nakayama, Shinnosuke; Fuiman, Lee A.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Dept Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA","Nakayama, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Dept Marine Sci, 750 Channel View Dr, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.",shin.nakayama@mail.utexas.edu,"Fuiman, Lee A/L-9514-2017; Nakayama, Shinnosuke/G-1991-2010","Fuiman, Lee A/0000-0003-2667-2684; ",Marine Science Institute of the University of Texas at Austin,This study was supported by the E.

Both competition and parasitism are known to be major structuring forces in ecological communities; however, surprisingly little is known about how the competitive nature of infected hosts could affect the survival and dynamics of remaining uninfected host populations. Using a laboratory system comprising the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, and a solitary koinobiont parasitoid, Venturia canescens, we address this question by conducting replicated competition experiments between the unparasitized and parasitized classes of host larvae. For varying proportions of parasitized host larvae and competitor densities, we consider the effects of competition within (intraclass) and between (interclass) unparasitized and parasitized larvae on the survival, development time, and size of adult moths and parasitoid wasps. The greatest effects were on survival: increased competitor densities reduced survival of both parasitized and unparasitized larvae. However, unparasitized larvae survival, but not parasitized larvae survival, was reduced by increasing interclass competition. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of the competitive superiority of parasitized over unparasitized hosts for limiting resources. We discuss possible mechanisms for this phenomenon, why it may have evolved, and its possible influence on the stability of host-parasite dynamics.","Univ Leeds, Inst Integrat & Comparat Biol, Genet Ecol & Evolut Res Grp, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Cameron, TC (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Inst Integrat & Comparat Biol, Genet Ecol & Evolut Res Grp, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",t.c.cameron@leeds.ac.uk,"Beckerman, Andrew P/D-3020-2011; Cameron, Tom/H-9555-2012","Cameron, Tom/0000-0002-5875-1494; Beckerman, Andrew P./0000-0002-4797-9143",,,,41,5,5,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2007,88,5,,,,,1225,1231,,10.1890/06-0661,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,166HN,WOS:000246369900017,17536408,,,,2021-09-27,

The presence of predatory fish was found to alter the foraging activities of the baetid, but not of the glossosomatid. We investigated the local distribution of Baetis thermicus and Glossosoma sp. to examine the potential for competition between the two grazers in a northern Japanese stream. Further, we carried our a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that the freshwater sculpin Cottus nozawae, when not allowed to attack prey, mediates the resource-limited competitive influences of Baetis on the growth of Glossosoma, but not the reverse. We found a negative correlation between the densities of Baetis and Glossosoma in the stream, suggesting the strong potential for resource-limiting competitive interactions to occur between the grazers. Using a laboratory channel experiment employing a target-neighbor design, neither the presence of sculpin nor the density of the two grazers altered any life-history traits measured for the grazers. However, the proportion of Baetis individuals positioned on the upper surface of a ceramic plate substrate (with greater periphyton biomass) largely decreased in the presence of sculpin, with only a minor behavioral shift being detected in Glossosoma. This difference in behavioral shift resulted in greater growth suppression in Baetis than in Glossosoma. In the absence of sculpin, growth of both target grazers was lowered by experimentally increasing the density of neighboring competitors. In par tial contradiction to the above hypothesis, the growth of not only Glossosoma but also Baetis was never influenced by the density of neighbor competitors when sculpin were present. The biomass of periphyton in the presence of sculpin was greater than when sculpin were absent, and was lower with higher densities of either grazer. Predator-avoidance behavioral modifications in both grazers may be the mechanism responsible for mediation of their exploitative competition.","Chitose Board Educ, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan; Hokkaido Univ Forests, Tomakomai Res Stn, Tomakomai, Hokkaido 0530035, Japan; Inst Low Temp Sci, Biodivers Grp, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600019, Japan","Kuhara, N (corresponding author), Chitose Board Educ, 958-1 Kamiosatsu, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan.",naotoshi.kuhara@nifty.ne.jp,,,,,,42,27,27,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1999,87,1,,,,,27,35,,10.2307/3546993,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,248AG,WOS:000083252700003,,,,,2021-09-27,

The sessile filter-feeders usually compensate their lack of physical defense and behavioral escape by a high level of bioactivity. In the stinging black sponge (Haliclona cnidata sp. nov.), these chemical defense mechanisms are complemented by cellular weapons-functional nematocysts likely acquired from cnidarians (kleptocnidism). Whereas, kleptocnidism might be facilitated by a close contact with cnidarian donors, preliminary investigations suggest that the stinging black sponge sustains nematocysts even if kept apart from cnidarians. As the underlying mechanisms causing this phenomenon remain unknown, the development of its nematocysts was studied in both presence and absence of potential cnidarian donors. First, we compared inherent nematocysts of adult sponge individuals with foreign nematocysts of co-cultivated cnidarians to identify potential donors. Second, we experimentally assessed the donor-independent and donor-dependent development of inherent and foreign nematocysts within cultures of sponge cell aggregates (SCAs). The inherent nematocysts comprised two specific types that both differed from those of the eight co-cultivated cnidarians. Specifically, we showed that the number of sponge-inherent nematocysts increased in SCAs over time in the absence of potential donors. Numbers of supplied foreign nematocysts, however, did not increase in the SCAs. We conclude that the observed increase of inherent nematocysts is due to the maturation of nematocyst precursor cells. Given these findings, we here propose the precursor hypothesis of sponge kleptocnidism. Accordingly, nematocyst precursors or immature nematocyte-nematocyst complexes might be initially acquired by sponges through filtration, maintained in sponge tissues, and nurtured to fully functioning nematocyte-nematocyst complexes. The underlying evolutionary processes are likely facilitated by bacteria-derived secondary metabolites and photosynthetically active dinoflagellates. Due to a simple body plan and the in vitro proliferation capacity of sponge cells, H. cnidata sp. nov. may serve as a novel evolutionary model system to further assess fundamental research questions regarding kleptocnidism. This study not only sheds new light on kleptocnidism in sponges, it also calls for a holobiontic view at defense mechanisms that involves the actual sponge, cnidarian nematocysts, dinoflagellate endosymbionts, and a complex microbial community.","[Schellenberg, Johannes; Reichert, Jessica; Schubert, Patrick; Wilke, Thomas] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Anim Ecol & Systemat, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Giessen, Germany; [Schellenberg, Johannes; Kaempfer, Peter; Glaeser, Stefanie P.] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Appl Microbiol, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Giessen, Germany; [Hardt, Martin] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Biomed Res Ctr, Seltersberg Imaging Unit, Giessen, Germany; [Schmidtberg, Henrike] Fraunhofer Inst Mol Biol & Appl Ecol, Dept Bioresources, Giessen, Germany","Schellenberg, J (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Anim Ecol & Systemat, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Giessen, Germany.; Schellenberg, J (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Appl Microbiol, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Giessen, Germany.",johannes.schellenberg@allzool.bio.uni-giessen.de,"Wilke, Thomas/G-1517-2012; Reichert, Jessica/AAM-1284-2021; Glaeser, Stefanie/ABI-5518-2020; Kampfer, Peter/P-7643-2019","Wilke, Thomas/0000-0001-8263-7758; Reichert, Jessica/0000-0003-2245-4188; Kampfer, Peter/0000-0002-7165-3418","CEMarin (Center of Excellence in Marine Sciences, Colombia)","JS and JR received financial support through scholarships of the CEMarin (Center of Excellence in Marine Sciences, Colombia).",,54,1,1,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Theoretical studies predict that limited amounts of dispersal of individuals in host-parasitoid systems can both enhance the stability of the subpopulations and promote the co-existence of competing parasitoid species. We investigated the effects of dispersal on the population dynamics and parasitoid community structure of a natural host-multi-parasitoid system consisting of the midge Rhopalomyia californica that forms galls on the shrub Baccharis pilularis and the parasitoids that attack the midge. 2. An experiment involving the release of midges into a field with a low background density of galls demonstrated that the midges, on average, travelled approximately 1.7m in their lifetime. This suggests that the appropriate spatial scale at which to look at the effects of dispersal is relatively small. 3. Dispersal of midges and parasitoids between individual bushes was experimentally eliminated in a caging experiment. The midge populations in all of the uncaged replicates displayed dynamics that were similar to each other, while the dynamics of the midge populations in the caged replicates diverged. The midge dynamics on the uncaged bushes were not significantly more stable than those on the caged bushes. 4. Dispersal among bushes was found to play a major role in co-existence of the competing parasitoid species. There was a dramatic drop in the parasitoid species diversity on the caged bushes, with only a single parasitoid species, Platygaster californica, persisting at high numbers in the caged populations.

Comparisons of functional responses can improve our understanding of underlying processes involved in altering species interaction strengths and may predict the effect of species invading new communities. Therefore, we investigated the functional responses of the mourning gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris (Dumeril & Bibron, 1836) to explore how temperature, body-size and prey density alter gecko predatory impacts in ecosystems. We quantified the functional responses of juvenile and adult geckos in single-predator experiments at 20, 23 and 26 degrees C. Both displayed saturating Type-II functional responses, but juvenile functional responses and the novel Functional Response Ratio were positively affected by temperature as juvenile attack rates (a) increased as a function of increased temperature. Handling times (h) tended to shorten at higher temperature for both predator stages. We demonstrate that the effects of temperature on functional responses of geckos differ across ontogeny, perhaps reflecting life-history stages prioritising growth and maturation or body maintenance. This indicates that temperature-dependent gecko predatory impacts will be mediated by population demographics. We advocate further comparisons of functional responses to understand the invasiveness and future predatory impacts of geckos, and other invasive species globally, as temperatures change.","[Haubrock, Phillip J.; Baker, Nathan Jay] Senckenberg Res Inst, Gelnhausen, Germany; [Haubrock, Phillip J.; Vesely, Lukas; Kouba, Antonin] Nat Hist Museum Frankfurt, Dept River Ecol & Conservat, Gelnhausen, Germany; [Cuthbert, Ross N.; Dick, Jaimie T.

In the present study we examined the ecological impact of its arrival in the Mediterranean region. The spider mite and phytoseiid mite assemblages in various crop and non-crop plants in three areas of Valencia (Spain) were studied a few months before and 10 years after the invasion of T. evansi. According to rarefaction analyses, the invasion of T. evansi did not affect neither the total number of species in the mite community examined (spider mite and phytoseiid species) nor the number of species when the two communities were examined separately. However, after the invasion, the absolute and relative abundance of the native Tetranychus species was significantly reduced. Before the invasion, T. urticae and T. turkestani were the most abundant spider mites, accounting for 62.9 and 22.8 % of the specimens. After the invasion, T. evansi became the most abundant species, representing 60 % of the total spider mites recorded, whereas the abundance of T. urticae was significantly reduced (23 %). This reduction took place principally on non-crop plants, where native species were replaced by the invader. Null model analyses provided evidence for competition structuring the spider mite community on non-crop plants after the invasion of T. evansi. Resistance to acaricides, the absence of efficient native natural enemies, manipulation of the plant defenses and the web type produced by T. evansi are discussed as possible causes for the competitive displacement.","[Ferragut, Francisco; Pekas, Apostolos] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Valencia 46022, Spain","Ferragut, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",fjferrag@eaf.upv.es,"; Pekas, Apostolos/J-8823-2017","Ferragut, Francisco/0000-0003-1545-6011; Pekas, Apostolos/0000-0002-8209-3882","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [AGL2003-0541, AGL2006-13232]",This work was supported by the projects AGL2003-0541 and AGL2006-13232 of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science.,,73,30,32,0,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Shallow rock pools can dry out and be refilled repeatedly during a summer causing high mortality of immatures. In deeper pools, young nymphs face intense competition by older stages including cannibalism. The adult corixids move frequently between rock pools and are thus able to use currently available habitat for reproduction. In this dispersal behaviour, the ability to assess the local population density and hence select the more suitable low density patches would be advantageous. We studied the effect of local population density on the frequency of dispersive flights of Arctocorisa carinata (Sahlberg) and Callicorixa producta (Reuter) experimentally, using rock pools from which nymphs of both species were removed. The dispersal rates of marked C. producta adults were significantly lower from experimental rock pools than from normal density controls, leading to a concentration of C. producta adults in the experimental rock pools. Indications of immigration rate differences between the experimental and control pools were also observed.

We manipulated components of the predator community, including three hemipteran predators and larvae of the predatory green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea, in held enclosure/exclosure experiments to address four questions: (1) Do generalist hemipteran predators feed on C. carnea? (2) Does intraguild predation (IGP) represent a substantial source of mortality for C. carnea? (3) Do predator species act in an independent, additive manner, or do significant interactions occur? (4) Can the experimental addition of some predators result in increased densities of aphids through a trophic cascade effect? Direct observations of predation in the held demonstrated that several generalist predators consume C. carnea and other carnivorous arthropods. Severely reduced survivorship of lacewing larvae in the presence of other predators showed that IGP was a major source of mortality. Decreased survival of lacewing larvae was primarily a result of predation rather than competition. IGP created significant interactions between the influences of lacewings and either Zelus renardii or Nabis predators on aphid population suppression. Despite the fact that the trophic web was too complex to delineate distinct trophic levels within the predatory arthropod community, some trophic links were sufficiently strong to produce cascades from higher-order carnivores to the level of herbivore population dynamics: experimental addition of either Z. renardii or Nabis predators generated sufficient lacewing larval mortality in one experiment to release aphid populations from regulation by lacewing predators.

Quantifying through which vital rates population fitness is affected, instead of focusing on population trends only, can give a more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics. The aim of this study was to estimate the underlying demographic rates of aphid (Myzus persicae) populations. We analysed unpublished stage-structure population dynamics data of a field experiment with caged and uncaged populations in which rapid evolutionary dynamics were observed, as well as unpublished results from an individual life table experiment performed in a glasshouse. Using data on changes in population abundance and stage distributions over time, we estimated transition matrices with inverse modelling techniques, in a Bayesian framework. The model used to fit across all experimental treatments included density as well as clone-specific caging effects. We additionally used individual life table data to inform the model on survival, growth and reproduction. Results suggest that clones varied considerably in vital rates, and imply trade-offs between reproduction and survival. Responses to densities also varied between clones. Negative density dependence was found in growth and reproduction, and the presence of predators and competitors further decreased these two vital rates, while survival estimates increased. Under uncaged conditions, population growth rates of the evolving populations were increased compared to the expectation based on the pure clones. Our inverse modelling approach revealed how much vital rates contributed to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. The decomposition analysis showed that variation in population growth rates in the evolving populations was to a large extent shaped by plant size. Yet, it also revealed an impact of evolutionary changes in clonal composition. Finally, we discuss that inverse modelling is a complex problem, as multiple combinations of individual rates can result in the same dynamics. We discuss assumptions and limitations, as well as opportunities, of this approach.","[Bruijning, Marjolein; Jongejans, Eelke] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Anim Ecol & Physiol, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Turcotte, Martin M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Bruijning, M (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Anim Ecol & Physiol, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",mbruijning@princeton.edu,"Jongejans, Eelke/B-4832-2008","Jongejans, Eelke/0000-0003-1148-7419; Turcotte, Martin/0000-0003-3949-6958",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); FQRNTFQRNT; Sigma Xi,NSERC; FQRNT; Sigma Xi,,47,1,1,4,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Fear of predators ('fear effects') is an important determinant of foraging decisions by consumers across a range of ecosystems. Group size is one of the main behavioural mechanisms for mitigating fear effects while also providing foraging benefits to group members. Within coral reef ecosystems, fear effects have been shown to influence the feeding rates of herbivorous fishes, a key functional group that prevents macroalgal overgrowth. Yet, how fear effects and group size interact to shape macroalgal removal on coral reefs remains unclear. 2. Here, we conducted field-based experiments using models of a common piscivorous fish, the leopard coral grouper Plectropomus leopardus and a series of macroalgal Sargassum ilicifolium assays positioned at increasing distances from the models (1, 2, 3 and 4 m) on two coral reefs in Singapore to investigate how acute fear effects shape the intensity of herbivory, and whether these effects were influenced by variation in the group size of herbivorous fishes feeding on the assays. 3. We found acute fear effects strongly influenced the foraging behaviour of herbivorous fishes over small spatial scales. Rates of Sargassum biomass removal, feeding rates and the total number of individual feeding events were all lower near the predator model. These effects dissipated rapidly with increasing distance from the predator model and were undetectable at a distance of 4 m. We also found generally larger group sizes of herbivorous fishes further from the predator model, presumably reflecting decreased risk. Furthermore, the number of individual bites/event increased significantly with increasing group size for two common browsing fishes, Siganus virgatus and Siganus javus. 4. Our findings highlight that acute fear effects influence the distribution and intensity of herbivory over small spatial scales. Fear effects also interacted with herbivore group size resulting in changes in the number of individual feeding events and bite rates that collectively shape the realized ecosystem function of macroalgal removal on coral reefs. Group size is an important context-dependent factor that should be considered when examining fear effects on coral reefs.

The invasion ecology and, in particular, the population dynamics of the species in this country are, however, poorly understood. In this study the relative abundance and population dynamics of G. affinis were quantified in 5 interconnected irrigation impoundments within the Sundays River Valley, Eastern Cape. Four fish surveys were conducted from early summer (February 2012) to early winter (June 2012). Repeated-measures ANOVA analyses on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of G. affinis between sampling events and dams revealed significant differences in population dynamics among dams, although an overall trend of rapid increase followed by plateau in summer, with a rapid decline in winter was seen in most dams. A general linear model assessing the role of biotic and abiotic factors on G. affinis CPUE found that water temperature and the presence of the native fish Glossogobius callidus had significant effects on the CPUE of G. affinis. While winter drops in temperature are likely to have caused mortality in G. affinis populations, and may act as the primary regulator of G. affinis establishment success in South African impoundments, the negative effect of G. callidus densities on G. affinis suggests competitive or predator-prey interactions with the native species.","[Howell, Dylan H.; Froneman, William] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Woodford, Darragh J.; Weyl, Olaf L.

It has been suggested that high concentrations of nyala, capable of browsing a greater breadth of food items, negatively influence bushbuck. Using camera trap data, we explored factors influencing spatio-temporal activity patterns and co-occurrence of both species within three Protected Areas (PAs) of the Maputaland Conservation Unit, South Africa. Bushbuck have gone locally extinct within one of our survey areas, likely because of competitive pressures and cascading effects. Our results indicated a segregation of activities; bushbuck was more nocturnal, particularly in areas with higher nyala occupancy. Nyala occupancy overall was higher than bushbuck. When comparing occupancies at the management level, bushbuck occupancy was higher than nyala within two survey areas: where nyala were modelled as present but populations were managed through culling, and where leopard (Panthera pardus) populations were highest. Co-occurrence was most likely in these two survey areas, indicating a threshold of nyala occupancy up to which bushbuck were tolerant. Where nyala were present in conjunction with high leopard density, bushbuck occupancy was higher. Conversely, where leopard density was low, the cascading effect was of high nyala occupancy, with subsequent competitive exclusion of bushbuck. Our results have critical management implications for PAs, including the management of carrying capacities, the preservation of native species assemblages and habitat management. We provide evidence that a larger-bodied sympatric species can outcompete subordinate sympatric browsers when not effectively managed, particularly where the predation effects that influence population dynamics are limited.","[Smith, Yvette C.

Over a series of four cruises from 1994 to 1998, blocks were exposed to colonists for consecutive and continuous intervals in short-term (5 + 8 = 13 mo) and longer-term (8 + 29 = 37 mo) experiments. Colonists grouped into a mobile functional group were less abundant in the continuous interval (13 mo) than in the synchronous pooled-consecutive intervals (5 + 8 mo) of the short-term experiment, indicating that early colonists inhibited subsequent recruitment. Colonists grouped into a sessile functional group exhibited the opposite pattern, indicating facilitation. Similar trends, though not statistically significant, were observed in the longer-term experiment. The character of species interactions varied along a gradient in hydrothermal fluid flux (and inferred productivity), with inhibitory interactions more prominent in zones with high temperatures, productivity, and faunal densities, and facilitative interactions appearing where temperatures, productivity, and densities were low; Analyses of primary succession on introduced basalt blocks suggest that biological interactions during early vent. community development strongly modify initial patterns of settlement, even in the absence of sustained temporal change in the vent fluid flux.","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","Mullineaux, LS (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",,,"Micheli, Fiorenza/0000-0002-6865-1438; Mullineaux, Lauren/0000-0002-8932-2625",,,,47,106,109,1,33,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9615,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Differential foraging behavior of bluegills and gizzard shad as juveniles, for example, may structure zooplankton and benthos communities and influence the growth of juvenile largemouth bass. We conducted a mesocosm experiment (1.6-m-diameter circular tanks) in which we allowed high and low densities of juvenile bluegills (70-100 mm total length [TL]) and gizzard shad (135-155 mm TL) to forage on established zooplankton and benthos communities for 6 weeks. After this period, we added juvenile largemouth bass (50-80 mm TL) to each tank for 4 weeks to examine growth and diets. Although foraging by bluegill and gizzard shad had limited effects on the total population densities of invertebrates, important taxon-specific effects were observed. At the time that largemouth bass were added to tanks, blttegill treatments exhibited a higher macrozooplankton density, higher turbidity, and lower density of larval hydrophilid cole-opterans than did gizzard shad or control treatments. The growth of juvenile largemouth bass was strongly influenced by treatment; largemouth bass grew at similar rates in the gizzard shad and control treatments but lost weight in the bluegill treatments. We suggest that bluegills compete with juvenile largemouth bass for preferred prey items, thereby limiting largemouth bass growth. Further, our results demonstrate that the presence of larger gizzard shad may not have the negative implications observed in previous Studies with smaller individuals. Knowledge of the relative, size-specific abundances of bluegills and gizzard shad should provide resource managers with valuable information for developing initiatives aimed at maximizing the growth of juvenile largemouth bass.","Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol & Conservat, Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA","Aday, DD (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Box 7617, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",derek_aday@ncsu.edu,"Shoup, Daniel E/A-9869-2013; Shoup, Daniel/E-8897-2015","Shoup, Daniel E/0000-0002-9867-4497; Shoup, Daniel/0000-0002-9867-4497",,,,64,13,15,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Recently, it has been reported that the presence of a higher proportion of orchards in the landscape and their management negatively affect the abundance and diversity of natural enemies. Two hypotheses are tested in this study: (1) the increased orchard surface has led to a reduction in natural enemies in neighbouring maize crops, and (2) the higher alfalfa proportion of agricultural land enhances the predatory fauna on maize. Maize fields were selected across a landscape gradient created by orchards and field crops (alfalfa and maize) in a buffer of 500 m. The abundance of 17 insect taxa in each maize field was estimated by means of 3 yellow sticky traps per season over three years. The insect abundance was related to the landscape structure (proportions of landscape elements and landscape diversity) and local variables (maize phenology, perimeter/area, weed diversity of the maize edges and abundance of the potential predators or potential prey). Our results show that the proportion of orchards in the landscape had negative effects on the main predators, and alfalfa had positive effects on herbivores and their predators. Semi-natural habitats (non-crop habitats and forest) and landscape diversity had low effects on insect abundance. However, variables at the local level included more significant effects than landscape structure; maize growth stages and abundance of potential prey or predators on the crop were the most influential variables at a local level. Here we show the interplay between different land uses types and local management and their impact on natural enemies and herbivores in maize crops in the Mediterranean area.","[Clemente-Orta, Gemma; Madeira, Filipe; Sossai, Samuel; Juarez-Escario, Alejandro; Albajes, Ramon] Univ Lleida, AGROTECNIO Ctr, Dept Crop & Forest Sci, Rovira Roure 191, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Batuecas, Ivan] IRTA Ctr Cabrils, Dept Protecc Vegetal, E-08348 Cabrils, Spain","Clemente-Orta, G (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, AGROTECNIO Ctr, Dept Crop & Forest Sci, Rovira Roure 191, Lleida 25198, Spain.",gemma.clemente@pvcf.udl.cat,"Orta, Gemma Maria Clemente/ABE-7278-2020; Albajes, Ramon/AAZ-3784-2021; Madeira, Filipe/E-3592-2015","Orta, Gemma Maria Clemente/0000-0002-1948-8371; Juarez-Escario, Alejandro/0000-0003-1540-1221; Madeira, Filipe/0000-0001-6585-2173","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [AGL2014-53970-C2-1-R, AGL2017-84127-R]; Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [BES-2015-072378]","This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness project AGL2014-53970-C2-1-R. and AGL2017-84127-R.

The bullhead, Cottus gobio, is a species of great conservation interest threatened by the massive introduction of hatchery-reared brown trout, Salmo trutta, for angling purposes. The aims of this research were: i) to present a case-study of interspecific and intraspecific competition in dwelling fish from two Mediterranean streams ( central Italy); ii) to evaluate the bullhead population status before and after the alien brown trout removal, and iii) to investigate the influence of the environmental parameters on the abundance of both species. For the bullhead populations the abundances and the young-of- the-year percentage significantly increased after the removal activities. The growth analysis showed that, after the trout removal, bullhead were distinguished by greater performance and larger sizes in all age classes in comparison to the pre-removal period, while the condition factor (Kn) showed no differences, suggesting that the effects of trout population control acted mainly through predator-prey dynamics. An inverse correlation between the abundance of bullhead and its body condition suggested that the beneficial effects due to the reduction of predation could be compensated by the intraspecific competition due to the increase of the bullhead population density.","[Lorenzoni, Massimo; Carosi, Antonella; La Porta, Gianandrea] Univ Perugia, Dept Chem Biol & Biotechnol, Via Elce Sotto, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Giovannotti, Massimo; Splendiani, Andrea; Barucchi, Vincenzo Caputo] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy","Carosi, A (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Chem Biol & Biotechnol, Via Elce Sotto, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.",acarosi@libero.it,"Carosi, Antonella/M-4474-2016; lorenzoni, massimo/G-7610-2014; La Porta, Gianandrea/F-3545-2014; Carosi, Antonella/AAE-4635-2020; Giovannotti, Massimo/AAZ-3563-2020","Carosi, Antonella/0000-0003-0513-7287; La Porta, Gianandrea/0000-0002-6465-5423; Giovannotti, Massimo/0000-0001-7622-3583",Lifethorn TROTA Project [LIFE12 NAT/IT/0000940],"This work was funded by Lifethorn TROTA Project (LIFE12 NAT/IT/0000940) for the recovery and conservation of Mediterranean trout (Salmo trutta complex) in the central Apennines (Italy), within the framework of the European Commission Life Projects.

Female-limited colour polymorphism is very common in odonates. One of the forms has male-like colouring (androchromotypics), while the other(s) is cryptic (gynochromotypics). Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the maintenance of this polymorphism: (1) higher reproductive isolation of androchromotypics, balanced by higher predation on this form; (2) androchromotypics avoid unnecessary long matings, but suffer greater predation; and (3) androchromotypics avoid male harassment at high density, but have lower mating success at low density. 2. To test these hypotheses I measured survivorship and mating success of andro- and gynochromotypic females of Ischnura graellsii in two natural populations with different densities in Galicia (NW Spain). 3. Contrary to the predictions of hypotheses 1 and 2, mean longevity and daily survival rate was the same for andro- and gynochromotypics. 4. Mating success was the same for andro- and gynochromotypics at high density but the proportion of unmated females was greater in andro- than gynochromotypics at low density. Furthermore, androchromotypics mated with longer inter-copula intervals at high density, and mating duration was also density-dependent. These results suggest that hypothesis 3 is the most appropriate to explain the maintenance of the polymorphism. 5. Androchromotypics were larger than gynochromotypics in the high density population. As body size is related to larval nourishment, this suggests an effect of larval competition on the maintenance of polymorphism. 6. It is proposed that both the mating behaviour of this species (long copulations) and the existence of changes in population density during the season are the main factors that maintain the polymorphism in I. graellsii.",,"CORDERO, A (corresponding author), UNIV SANTIAGO COMPOSTELA,FAC BIOL,AREA ECOL,E-15071 SANTIAGO,SPAIN.",,"Cordero-Rivera, Adolfo/K-4182-2014","Cordero-Rivera, Adolfo/0000-0002-5087-3550",,,,46,86,89,0,14,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

But, is phage-mediated selection the sole mechanism responsible for the evolution and maintenance of these ubiquitous and multiply evolved systems? In an effort to answer this question, we have performed experiments with laboratory populations of E. coli and phage and computer simulations. We consider two ecological situations whereby phage-mediated selection could favor R-M immunity; i) when bacteria with a novel R-M system invade communities of phage-sensitive bacteria in which there are one or more species of phage, and ii) when bacteria colonize bacterial-free habitats in which phage are present. The results of our experiments indicate that in established communities of bacteria and phage, the advantage R-M provides an invading population of bacteria is ephemeral. Within short order, mutants resistant (refractory) to the phage evolve in the dominant population and subsequently in the invading population. The outcome of competition then depends on the relative fitness of the resistant states of these bacterial clones, rather than R-M. As a consequence of sequential selection for independent mutants, this rapid evolution of resistance occurs even when two and three species of phage are present. While in our experiments resistance also evolved when bacteria colonized new habitats in which phage were present, a novel R-M system greatly augmented the likelihood of their becoming established. We interpret the results of this study as support for the hypothesis that the latter, colonization selection, may play an important role in the evolution and maintenance of restriction-modification. However, we also see these results and other observations we discuss as questioning whether protection against phage is the unique biological role of restriction-modification.","UNIV MASSACHUSETTS,DEPT ZOOL,AMHERST,MA 01003",,,"Korona, Ryszard/J-7154-2015","Korona, Ryszard/0000-0002-4329-5908",,,,22,53,54,2,12,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,APR,1993,47,2,,,,,556,575,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb02113.x,,,20,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,KZ712,WOS:A1993KZ71200016,28568719,,,,2021-09-27,

Each stream consisted of three habitats, a riffle, a run and a pool, the latter two being further divided into shallow margins and deeper mid-regions. The experimental design differentiated between intraspecific and interspecific effects by having two densities of allopatry for each salmonid and one density of sympatry, for a total of five treatments. These five treatments were then run in the presence and absence of the piscivorous northern pike (Esox lucius) at high and low discharge. Decreasing discharge reduced the area of the run and pool margins covered by water, thereby reducing use of these areas by trout and grayling. In the absence of a predator, brown trout caused grayling to markedly reduce its use of pool mid-regions and increase its use of the shallow margins, but only at high flow. Grayling had a more modest effect on brown trout, causing brown trout to increase its use of pool mid-regions, but only at high flow. There were no effects of intraspecific effects on habitat use by either species. In the presence of pike, which occupied the Fool, grayling had no effect on habitat use by brown trout, whereas brown trout caused grayling to increase its use of shallow water habitats. There were no effects of intraspecific effects on habitat use by either species when pike was present. The number of grayling or trout consumed by pike did not vary among the different treatments. The results showed that variation in flow and predation altered habitat use patterns of brown trout and grayling.","Univ Lund, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Greenberg, LA (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Biol, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",,,,,,,27,18,18,0,10,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGS,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

Experiments and observations were performed in the field and with captive birds in an aviary. Intact fruits are round whereas those that are attacked by an insect usually acquire a deformed shape; thus, birds have a cue to discriminate among the blueberries. Infested berries are not necessarily larger or smaller than intact berries, so fruit size cannot be used as a cue to discriminate between them. Results from the aviary experiments showed that the two avian species examined, varied thrushes and American robins. consumed significantly less insect-infested fruits than uninfested ones. In the field, birds also showed a preference for round fruits over deformed ones. Here, the probability of removal of an insect-infested berry depends on the type of habitat where the plant is located. Avian fruit removal was higher in an open site than inside the forest while the incidence of insects was greater in the latter. The presence of deformed fruits did not decrease the removal of uninfested fruits in either site. Not all seeds in an infested fruit are killed by the larvae, so animals may still be dispersers of the viable seeds if the infested fruit is consumed. The larger the fruit the higher the number of seeds within it. The two species of birds preferred large over small fruits in the aviary. Therefore, a seed in a large berry - infested or not by insects might have a greater probability of being dispersed than one in a smaller fruit (although to assess this we need to know which other factors affect fruit selection). There is no apparent competition between birds and insects that results in a nonoverlapping use of the resources (fruits). The two insect species risk mortality by vertebrate frugivores, as larvae develop within ripe fruits. The evolutionary implications of the bird-insect interaction for plant fitness are apparently negligible, mainly because insects do not seem to kill many seeds and also because the bird-insect encounters are rather few.","FORESTRY SCI LAB, JUNEAU, AK 99801 USA; UNIV CALIF DAVIS, BOT SECT, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA","TRAVESET, A (corresponding author), INST ESTUDIS AVANCATS ILLES BALEARS, CRTRA VALLDEMOSSA KM 7-5, E-07071 PALMA DE MALLORCA, SPAIN.",,"Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011",,,,,31,32,33,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1995,73,3,,,,,381,386,,10.2307/3545962,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TA648,WOS:A1995TA64800010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Kite habitat decisions, territory occupancy and breeding success were tightly enmeshed with human activities: kites preferred areas with high human density, poor waste management and a road configuration that facilitated better access to resources provided by humans, in particular to Muslim colonies that provided ritual subsidies. Furthermore, kites bred at 'clean' sites with less human refuse only when close to Muslim colonies, suggesting that the proximity to ritual-feeding sites modulated the suitability of other habitats. Rather than a nuisance to avoid, as previously portrayed, humans were a keenly-targeted foraging resource, which tied a predator's distribution to human activities, politics, history, socio-economics and urban planning at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Many synurbic species may exploit humans in more subtle and direct ways than was previously assumed, but uncovering them will require greater integration of human socio-cultural estimates in urban ecological research.","[Kumar, Nishant; Gosler, Andrew G.] Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Dept Zool, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Kumar, Nishant; Gupta, Urvi; Jhala, Yadvendradev V.; Qureshi, Qamar] Wildlife Inst India, POB 18, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Gupta, Urvi] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Gosler, Andrew G.] Inst Human Sci, Sch Anthropol & Museum Ethnog, 58a Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6QS, England; [Sergio, Fabrizio] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain","Kumar, N (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Dept Zool, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.; Kumar, N (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, POB 18, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India.",nishant.kumar@zoo.ox.ac.uk; urvi.gupta@ouce.ox.ac.uk; jhalay@wii.gov.in; qnq@wii.gov.in; andrew.gosler@zoo.ox.ac.uk; fsergio@ebd.csic.es,"Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015; Jhala, Yadvendradev/AAL-9711-2020","Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773; Kumar, Nishant/0000-0002-3505-6800","Raptor Research and Conservation Foundation (Mumbai); Govt. of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change; Felix Scholarship Trust; Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [RNM-7307]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2015- 69445-P]","We thank Prof. Nilon and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

Evaluating the costs and benefits of these pressures is crucial to make correct behavioural decisions in terms of fitness. The insular Sao Vicente's wall gecko Tarentola substituta provides a relatively simple model system to study these questions as it inhabits arid rocky habitats where refuges are limited, density of conspecifics is high, and terrestrial predators are almost absent. In the field, adults tend to find diurnal shelter under mid-sized rocks, frequently in male-female couples, while juveniles occupy small rocks which are thermally suboptimal. A lab experiment was conducted to determine the roles of ecological (shelter size and temperature) and social (conspecifics) factors in refuge selection. Single and pair combinations of geckos of different age and sex classes were allowed to select among four refuges: cold small, hot small, cold large, or hot large rock. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that larger and thermally buffered rocks would be the preferred refuges, and that adult male-female pairs under the same rock would be more frequent than other combinations.Geckos primarily selected larger shelters, trading off the presence of conspecifics against thermal quality. In social terms, sex, adult condition and size-related disparity shaped the patterns of aggregation, resulting in lower aggregation frequencies between adults and juveniles and even between juveniles of different sizes. These results reasonably match field observations suggesting selection of rocks as diurnal retreats according to their thermal properties, and social aggregations mainly involving adult males and females but not juveniles. Overall, this combined evidence provides insights on the spatial ecology of geckos, and likely other ectotherms, under conditions of low predation, limited resources and high intraspecific competition, such as those prevailing on island systems.","[Pereira, Jose Joao; Lopes, Evandro P.; Carretero, Miguel A.; Vasconcelos, Raquel] Univ Porto, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, Campus Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Pereira, Jose Joao] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Rua Campo Alegre 1021-1055, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal; [Lopes, Evandro P.; Carretero, Miguel A.; Vasconcelos, Raquel] Uni CV Univ Cabo Verde, FECM, CP 163, Mindelo, Sao Vicente, Cape Verde","Vasconcelos, R (corresponding author), Univ Porto, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, Campus Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.",raquel.vasconcelos@cibio.up.pt,"Vasconcelos, Raquel/H-5524-2012; Carretero, Miguel A/A-1472-2013","Vasconcelos, Raquel/0000-0002-4717-9429; Carretero, Miguel A/0000-0002-2335-7198; Lopes, Evandro/0000-0003-3938-1560","Cabeolica S.A. from Cabo Verde; 'Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia from Portugal, I.P.' under the 'Programa Operational Potencial Humano - Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional' funds from the European Social Fund [SFRH/BPD/79913/2012]; Portuguese 'Ministerio da Educacao e Ciencia';  [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000007]","To 'Departamento de Engenharias e Ciencias do Mar' of University of Cabo Verde, Uni-CV, for logistic support and to J. de Deus, F.

It is often unclear how sufficient contacts are made between viruses and their specific hosts to generate spikes in viral abundance. Here, we show that copepods, acting as predators, can bring aquatic viruses and their algal hosts into contact. Specifically, predation of the protist Paramecium bursaria by copepods resulted in a >100-fold increase in the number of chloroviruses in 1 d. Copepod predation can be seen as an ecological catalyst by increasing contacts between chloroviruses and their hosts, zoochlorellae (endosymbiotic algae that live within paramecia), thereby facilitating viral population growth. When feeding, copepods passed P. bursaria through their digestive tract only partially digested, releasing endosymbiotic algae that still supported viral reproduction and resulting in a virus population spike. A simple predator-prey model parameterized for copepods consuming protists generates cycle periods for viruses consistent with those observed in natural ponds. Food webs are replete with similar symbiotic organisms, and we suspect the predator catalyst mechanism is capable of generating blooms for other endosymbiont-targeting viruses.","[DeLong, John P.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Al-Ameeli, Zeina] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Duncan, Garry] Nebraska Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Lincoln, NE 68504 USA; [Van Etten, James L.; Dunigan, David D.] Univ Nebraska, Nebraska Ctr Virol, Dept Plant Pathol, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA","DeLong, JP (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.; Van Etten, JL; Dunigan, DD (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Nebraska Ctr Virol, Dept Plant Pathol, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",jpdelong@unl.edu; jvanetten1@unl.edu; ddunigan@unlnotes.unl.edu,"Dunigan, David/AAF-1386-2019","Dunigan, David D/0000-0001-9496-5396; DeLong, John/0000-0003-0558-8213","Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research, Republic of Iraq; Iraqi Cultural Office in Washington, DC; National Institute for General Medical Science Grant [8P20GM103427]; National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive ResearchNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EPS-1004094]; Stanley Medical Research Institute; Center of Biomedical Research Excellence Program of the National Center for Research Resources Grant [P20-RR15535]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [K23RR015535] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P20GM103427, P30GM103509] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Jean-Philippe Gibert, Rachel Allen, and Ron Hruska for laboratory assistance.

We assessed the potential of insectivorous birds as pest regulators in woody crops located in central Spain. A total of 417 nest boxes installed in five field study sites (one vineyard, two fruit orchards, and two olive groves) were monitored for use and breeding of insectivorous birds and other species for four consecutive years (2013 +/- 2016). At all field sites except the two olive groves, where birds never occupied the nest boxes, predation experiments were conducted with Greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) sentinel caterpillars, and food consumption by birds was estimated. Nesting of insectivorous birds, chiefly Great tit (Parus major), and sparrows (Passer domesticus and P. montanus) increased over time, averaging 60% per field site in the vineyard and fruit orchards by the fourth year. Use of nest boxes by sparrows and by Garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) was high at the fruit orchards (70%) and the vineyard (30%), respectively. Micro-habitat characteristics (nest box level) and meso-habitat characteristics (patch level) strongly affected use of nest boxes and bird breeding (i.e. number of laid eggs and produced chicks) in different years. Distance to natural or semi-natural vegetation did not consistently affect bird breeding, nor did we see consistent evidence of competition between adjacent breeding birds. Predation rates of sentinel caterpillars were approximately one-third higher near boxes with nesting birds (31.51 +/- 43.13%) than at paired distant areas without nest boxes (22.45% +/- 38.58%). Food consumption by insectivorous birds per ha and breeding season were conservatively estimated to range from 0.02 kg in one fruit orchard to 0.15 kg in the vineyard. We conclude that installation of nest boxes in Mediterranean woody crops enhances populations of insectivorous birds that regulate pests, but that the effects are moderate and highly context-dependent.","[Rey Benayas, Jose M.; de las Heras-Bravo, Daniel] Alcala Univ, Life Sci Dept, Ecol Unit, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Rey Benayas, Jose M.; Meltzer, Jorge; Cayuela, Luis] Int Fdn Ecosyst Restorat, Madrid, Spain; [Cayuela, Luis] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Biol Geol Phys & Inorgan Chem, Mostoles, Spain; [de las Heras-Bravo, Daniel] IMIDRA, Madrid Inst Res & Rural Agrarian & Food Dev, Oliviculture Serv, Alcala De Henares, Spain","Benayas, JMR (corresponding author), Alcala Univ, Life Sci Dept, Ecol Unit, Alcala De Henares, Spain.; Benayas, JMR (corresponding author), Int Fdn Ecosyst Restorat, Madrid, Spain.",josem.rey@uah.es,"Cayuela, Luis/K-7255-2015; Rey Benayas, Jose/C-3218-2011","Cayuela, Luis/0000-0003-3562-2662; Rey Benayas, Jose/0000-0002-2099-8512","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity [CGL2010-18312, CGL2014-53308-P]; Spanish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and the Environment [ARM/934/2011, AAA/2286/2012, AAA/1284/2014, AAA/1770/2015]; government of Madrid [S2009AMB-1783 REMEDINAL-2, S2013/MAE-2719 REMEDINAL-3]; Fundacion BiodiversidadEuropean Commission; ERANET-LAC programme [PCIN-2016-150]; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports; Abadia Retuerta; HaciendasBio","This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity (grant numbers CGL2010-18312 and CGL2014-53308-P to JMRB), the Spanish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and the Environment (calls to foundations numbers ARM/934/2011, AAA/2286/2012, AAA/1284/2014, and AAA/1770/2015 to JMRB), the government of Madrid (grant numbers S2009AMB-1783 REMEDINAL-2 and S2013/MAE-2719 REMEDINAL-3 to JMRB), Fundacion Biodiversidad (competitive call of 2012 granted to JMRB), and the ERANET-LAC programme (grant number PCIN-2016-150 to LC).

Nonetheless, up to now, there is little empirical support for this hypothesized mechanism of diversity preservation. We experimentally assessed the effects of induction of plastic morphological responses triggered by a predator kairomone, on patterns of co-occurrence of two herbivore populations of rotifers (Brachionus calyciflorus and B. havanaensis) sharing resources (Chlorella vulgaris) and predators (Asplanchna brightwelli). To our knowledge, this is the first experimental work conducted at the population level where non-induced and induced states of same prey species are obtained through manipulating the level of predator signal. Our objective was to assess the consequences of induced defenses on the mean population density, population variability, evenness and likelihood of persistence of competitor populations. Our results show that induced defenses promote species coexistence through increasing the likelihood of persistence and evenness of competing populations, over a gradient of resource availability.","[Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo] Fdn Univ Chile, Ctr Nacl Medio Ambiente, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Bustamante, Ramiro O.] IEB, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo; Bustamante, Ramiro O.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ecol & Recursos Nat, Santiago, Chile","Aranguiz-Acuna, A (corresponding author), Fdn Univ Chile, Ctr Nacl Medio Ambiente, Larrain 9975 La Reina, Santiago, Chile.",a.aranguiz@cenma.cl,"BUSTAMANTE, RAMIRO/I-7353-2019; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo/F-3160-2013","Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana/0000-0002-9409-1147","CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [ICM-P05-002]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1090132]; Vicerrectoria de Asuntos Academicos, Universidad de Chile","A.A.-A. acknowledges the support of a CONICYT doctoral scholarship, grant ICM-P05-002 to Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity, technical support in laboratory from Universidad Andres Bello and a grant for foreign research stay from the Vicerrectoria de Asuntos Academicos, Universidad de Chile.

It is, however, unclear to what extent this is driven by ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we used experimental evolution to study the eco-evolutionary feedbacks among Ralstonia solanacearum bacterial pathogen, Ralstonia-specific phage parasite, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens competitor bacterium in the laboratory and plant rhizosphere. We found that while the phage had a small effect on pathogen densities on its own, it considerably increased the R. solanacearum sensitivity to antibiotics produced by B. amyloliquefaciens. Instead of density effects, this synergy was due to phage-driven increase in phage resistance that led to trade-off with the resistance to B. amyloliquefaciens antibiotics. While no evidence was found for pathogen resistance evolution to B. amyloliquefaciens antibiotics, the fitness cost of adaptation (reduced growth) was highest when the pathogen had evolved in the presence of both parasite and competitor. Qualitatively similar patterns were found between laboratory and greenhouse experiments even though the evolution of phage resistance was considerably attenuated in the tomato rhizosphere. These results suggest that evolutionary trade-offs can impose strong constraints on disease dynamics and that combining phages and antibiotic-producing bacteria could be an efficient way to control agricultural pathogens.","[Wang, Xiaofang; Wei, Zhong; Li, Mei; Wang, Xueqi; Shan, Anqi; Mei, Xinlan; Jousset, Alexandre; Shen, Qirong; Xu, Yangchun] Nanjing Agr Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Organ Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Organ Solid Waste Utilizat, Weigang 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jousset, Alexandre] Univ Utrecht, Inst Environm Biol Ecol & Biodivers, Padualaan 8, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Friman, Ville-Petri] Univ York, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Wei, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Organ Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Organ Solid Waste Utilizat, Weigang 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",weizhong@njau.edu.cn,"Jousset, Alexandre/C-7607-2011; Shen, Qirong/AAB-6531-2020","Friman, Ville-Petri/0000-0002-1592-157X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41671248, 41301262, 41471213]; National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB150503]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20130677]; Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; 111 projectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B12009]; Qing Lan ProjectJiangsu Polytech Institute; British Ecological Society large research; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [105624]; University of YorkEuropean Commission [C2D2]; NWO project [ALW.870.15.050]; KNAW [530-5CDP18]","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41671248 and 41301262, ZW, and 41471213, YX), National Key Basic Research Program of China (2015CB150503, QS), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20130677, ZW), Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (QS), 111 project (B12009, QS), andQing Lan Project (YX and ZW).

Ultimately, it is what ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral science are supposed to explain. It is difficult to use natural history alone to test hypotheses in these fields because of the complex paths between process and pattern. Few patterns are predicted by one and only one hypothesis, so experiments are almost always necessary. However, the robustness of experimental results depends on how well experimental conditions reflect the integration of natural history. Natural history also plays a vital role in how well we can apply Krogh's principle to our work. Krogh's principle is that scientists begin with an important hypothesis and find a system (organism, habitat, species interaction) with which to test it. However, natural history is essential for knowing whether the question applies to the system or whether we are forcing the question on the system. There is value in beginning one's research not by identifying an interesting question and searching for the right system but by identifying an interesting system in which to ask the right question. This approach carries the danger of parochialism, which can be avoided only by having a command of theory as well as natural history. A command of both areas allows nature to tell us which question to ask instead of demanding that nature answer the question we find most interesting.","[Travis, Joseph] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Travis, J (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",travis@bio.fsu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 15-56884],"I thank Dan Bolnick for inviting this essay.

Big game hunting is a growing activity that annually subsidizes ecosystems with tonnes of carrion world-wide. By feeding on carrion, scavengers support key ecosystem functions and services, becoming key vectors to transfer the impacts of human-mediated food subsidies across ecosystems. We characterize and compare the structure of vertebrate communities feeding on these subsidies, namely big game hunting remains, at a global scale. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe collected data from a countrywide field study in Spain and broadened it up to nine regions in four continents by reviewing scientific literature. We analysed the structure of the scavenger communities considering species composition, richness and scavenging frequency. ResultsSeventy-nine vertebrate species, 19% globally threatened, scavenged food subsidies from big game hunting world-wide. Scavenger richness (2.0-11.0% of vertebrates/region) positively correlated with total vertebrate richness. Although scavenger communities at hunting remains varied among regions, we describe a general structural pattern. Birds and mammals dominate consumption, with birds scavenging twice more frequently than mammals - but more mammal species scavenge compared to birds. Generalists dominate scavenging globally, especially where the presence of obligate scavengers (vultures) and apex predators (e.g. wolves, hyenas, eagles) is low. Main conclusionsAnthropogenic food from hunting subsidizes many vertebrate species from different trophic levels and conservation status and thus is expected to affect from populations to ecosystems. Obligate scavengers and apex predators seem to play a key role structuring the scavenger community through top-down mechanisms. The general structure of scavenger communities we describe here provides a benchmark for comparisons of subsidized and non-subsidized communities. More data on the spatio-temporal availability of anthropogenic food subsidies and their consumption by scavengers world-wide are needed to efficiently preserve biodiversity, and the associated ecological functions and services, in increasingly subsidized ecosystems.","[Mateo-Tomas, Patricia; Olea, Pedro P.; Vicente, Joaquin; Vinuela, Javier] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cinegeticos IREC, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Olea, Pedro P.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Moleon, Marcos; Botella, Francisco; Antonio Sanchez-Zapata, Jose] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Biol Aplicada, Alicante 03202, Spain; [Selva, Nuria] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland","Mateo-Tomas, P (corresponding author), Plaza Ios Pueblos 9, Leon 24900, Spain.",rktespejos@gmail.com,"Olea, Pedro P/M-1502-2014; Sanchez-Zapata, Jose Antonio/H-1413-2015; Botella, Francisco/P-7790-2019; Selva, Nuria/J-6970-2013; Botella, Francisco/F-7626-2011; Mateo-Tomas, Patricia/L-8471-2014","Olea, Pedro P/0000-0001-5387-9598; Sanchez-Zapata, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-8230-4953; Botella, Francisco/0000-0002-1877-5360; Selva, Nuria/0000-0003-3389-201X; Botella, Francisco/0000-0002-1877-5360; Mateo-Tomas, Patricia/0000-0001-6762-9514; Vinuela, Javier/0000-0002-8916-0398","Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La ManchaJunta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha; Fondo Social EuropeoEuropean Social Fund (ESF)European Commission; Spanish Ministry of EducationSpanish Government; National Research CentreNational Research Centre (NRC) [2013/08/M/NZ9/00469]; National Centre for Research and Development in Poland, Norway [POL-NOR/198352/85/2013]; Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [RNM-1925]; Ministerio Economia y Competitividadd, Spain [CGL2006-10689/BOS, CGL2009-12753-C02-02, CGL2012-40013-C02-01-02]; EU FEDER fundsEuropean Commission; Access to Unique Technological and Scientific Infrastructure Programme 'Donana Scientific Reserve' project ICTS-RBD [23/2007]","We thank D.L.

The distribution of the introduced calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE) shifted from brackish to fresh water in 1993 following the introductions of 2 brackish-water copepods, the small but numerically dominant Limnoithona tetraspina (Cyclo poida) and the predatory Acartiella sinensis (Calanoida). The nearly simultaneous timing of these introductions complicated interpretation of the temporal change in distribution of P. forbesi. Although P. forbesi is now uncommon at salinity >similar to 2, which might be interpreted as the result of salinity stress, short-term experiments showed high survival of adults up to salinity similar to 8 and of nauplii to salinity of at least 14, and reproduction was highest at salinity 5. Feeding experiments showed some overlap in diets of P. forbesi and L. tetraspina, but P. forbesi consumed a broader range of prey than L. tetraspina. Furthermore, feeding rates of the L. tetraspina population appeared insufficient to reduce prey availability to P. forbesi. Previous reports of high consumption of nauplii by A. sinensis and the clam Potamocorbula amurensis suggest that these interspecific interactions are important in constraining the distribution of P. forbesi in the upper SFE. Thus, we interpret the temporal shift in distribution of P. forbesi as due mainly to the introduction of the predatory copepod, whose high abundance may have been facilitated by the availability of a common alternative prey, L. tetraspina.","[Kayfetz, Karen] Delta Stewardship Council, Delta Sci Program, 980 9th St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Kimmerer, Wim] San Francisco State Univ, Romberg Tiburon Ctr Environm Studies, 3152 Paradise Dr, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA","Kayfetz, K (corresponding author), Delta Stewardship Council, Delta Sci Program, 980 9th St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA.",karen.kayfetz@deltacouncil.ca.gov,,"Kayfetz, Karen/0000-0003-3236-4469",U.S. Dept. of Interior agreement [R10AC20074],"We thank A.

Intraguild predation (IGP) has been studied extensively in predatory fish, amphibians and mammals, but less so in top avian predators. We studied the impact of IGP by large eagle owls Bubo bubo Linnaeus (body mass similar to1.5-4 kg) on diurnal black kites Milvus migrans Boddaert (similar to0.5-1 kg) in eight populations located in the Italian Alps. Eagle owls preyed on both adult and nestling kites, especially when kites nested within 2 km of an owl nest. Food overlap was low as kites preyed mainly on fish and owls on mammals. Eagle owls were absent from two study areas, bred very close to another area and were present at medium-high densities in the other five. Within-population effects varied and were most severe in areas with high owl densities. Overall, kites responded to predation risk through predator spatial avoidance, being concentrated in interstitial predation-refugia bordering the core home range of owl pairs. 2. Kite productivity declined steeply with increasing predation risk; no nestling fledged within 1 km of an owl nest. Brood predation was higher in an area with medium owl density than in an area lacking eagle owls. 3. The abandonment of kite territories increased near owl nests, but close coexistence was maintained by new kite territories being established occasionally in areas of high predation risk and high food abundance, which probably functioned as ecological traps. Compared to a random nest dispersion, colonial nesting was avoided within 1 km of an owl pair and peaked in conditions of medium predation risk. 4. At the population level, kite density and productivity were related to a complex interaction of IGP risk and food abundance, and were probably shaped by a mixture of top-down and bottom-up effects. These results may apply to many other vertebrate mesopredators, whose individual decisions and population responses are probably the result of a trade-off between predator avoidance and food acquisition. 5. At the community level, the density of different diurnal avian predators responded differently to IGP risk, some of them even increasing with this risk. The diversity of the assemblage peaked at medium-high eagle owl density. Future studies of top vertebrate predators need to take more account of IGP effects. Their conservation management needs to be highly case-specific and framed within a broader ecosystem perspective.","Museo Tridentino Sci Nat, Raptor Conservat Res Unit, I-38100 Trento, Italy; Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Dept Zool, Oxford, England","Sergio, F (corresponding author), Museo Tridentino Sci Nat, Raptor Conservat Res Unit, Via Calepina 14, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",fabrizio.sergio8@tin.it,"Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015","Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773",,,,72,117,125,3,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

In this study, we determined how these top-down and bottom-up processes interact to affect algal communities by using exclusion cages to manipulate the access of fish and herbivores to algae around both colony and control islands, and measuring algal recruitment and herbivory in these cages. The results showed that algal communities do indeed differ significantly between control and colony sites: Fucus vesiculosus, an important foundation species, had lower recruitment around colony sites. We found evidence of increased herbivory on Fucus around colony sites in one year, which may contribute to lower survival and reproduction, but the effect was not consistent. Instead, we suggest that lower recruitment is likely mainly due to nutrient enrichment which leads to increased competition from ephemeral algae, and thus decreased recruitment and abundance of Fucus around colonies. This was also indicated by higher recruitment of several ephemeral algal species around colonies in herbivore exclusion cages, indicating they do indeed benefit from nutrient runoff from colonies. Increased grazing around colonies was able to counteract this to some extent, but not completely. Overall, cormorants can indeed affect lower trophic levels, especially through local bottom-up processes, leading to shifts in community structure and potentially decreased biodiversity due to impairing conditions for the foundation species F. vesiculosus.

Predation by rats at high density severely damages native fauna populations. In 2006 the Department of Conservation undertook a management experiment in the Eglinton Valley to see if they could protect endangered species during a rat irruption. Poison (0.15% 1080, followed by 0.0375% coumatetralyl, or Racumin (R)) was laid in bait stations, and the consequences for rat abundance and survival were estimated. All 10 radio-tagged rats died, suggesting that 1080 had a high impact on the rat population. The two rats that made the smallest daily movements survived longer than the others. Live trapping documented a reduced abundance of rats within the poison area (450 ha) after 1 month of poisoning. However, after 4 months of poisoning, the abundance of rats had begun to recover. Further investigation is needed on acceptance of Racumin (R) to rats, optimum spacing of bait stations for rats, and bait competition between rats and mice when densities of both species are high.","[Smith, Des H.

Little is known, however, about the potential for, and occurrence of, interactions between assembly history and the environment. Of particular, interest may be the interaction between temperature and community assembly dynamics, especially in the light of predicted global climatic change and the fundamental processes that are governed, through metabolic rate, by an individual's environmental temperature. We present, to our knowledge, the first experimental exploration of how the influence of assembly history, temperature, and the interaction between the two alters the structure of communities of competitors, using small-scale protist microcosm communities where temperature and assembly order were manipulated factorially. In our experiment, the most important driver of long-term abundance was temperature but long-lasting assembly order effects influenced the relationship between temperature and abundance. Any advantage of early colonization proved to be short-lived, and there was rarely any long-term advantage to colonizing a habitat before other species. The results presented here suggest that environmental conditions shape community composition, but that occasionally temperature could interact with the stochastic nature of community assembly to significantly alter future community composition, especially where temperature change has been large. This could have important implications for the dynamics of both rare and invasive species.","[Clements, Christopher F.; Warren, Philip H.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Collen, Ben] UCL, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Blackburn, Tim] ZSL, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England; [Blackburn, Tim] King Saud Univ, Distinguished Scientist Fellowship Program, Riyadh 1145, Saudi Arabia; [Worsfold, Nicholas] Univ Bedfordshire, Dept Life Sci, Luton LU1 3JU, Beds, England; [Petchey, Owen] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Clements, CF (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",c.clements@shef.ac.uk,"Blackburn, Tim/AAC-3144-2019; Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011; Collen, Ben/F-2543-2016; Blackburn, Tim M/A-7685-2011","Blackburn, Tim/0000-0003-0152-2663; Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633; Collen, Ben/0000-0003-2564-4243; Clements, Christopher/0000-0001-5677-5401",Natural Environment Research Council CASE studentship grant [NE/H018700/1]; Zoological Society of London,This research was funded by a Natural Environment Research Council CASE studentship grant (NE/H018700/1) in partnership with the Zoological Society of London.,,42,13,13,2,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Augmentative releases of EPN have been used to enhance biological control of pests in agroecosystems. Pest managers strive to achieve a trophic cascade whereby natural-enemy effects permeate down throguh the food web to suppress host herbivores and increase crop production. Although trophic cascades have been studied in diverse aboveground arthropod-based systems, they are infrequently investigated in soil systems. Moreover, no overall quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of EPN in suppressing hosts with cascading benefits to plants has been made. Toward synthesizing the available but limited information on EPN and their ability to suppress prey and affect plant, yield, we surveyed the litrerature and performed a meta-analysis of 35 published studies. Our analysis found that effect sizes for arthropod hosts as a result of EPN addition were consistently negative and indirect effects on plants were consistently positive. Results held across several different host metrics (abundance, fecundity and survival) and across measures of plant performance (biomass, growth, yield and survival). Moreover, the relationship between plant and host effect sizes was strikingly and significantly negative. That is, the positive impact on plant responses generally increased as the negative effect of EPN on hosts intensified, providing strong support for the mechanism of trophic cascades. We also review the ways in which EPN might interact antagonistically with each other and other predators and pathogens to adversely affect host suppression and dampen trophic cascades. We conclude that the food web implications of multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN are little studied, but, as management techniques that promote the long-term persistence of EPN are improved, antagonistic interactions are more likely to arise. We hope that the likely occurrence of antagonistic interactions in soil food webs should stimulate researchers to conduct field experiments explicitly designed to examine multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN and their cascading effects to hosts and plants.","[Denno, Robert F.; Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kaplan, Ian] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Denno, RF (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dsgruner@umd.edu,"Gruner, Daniel S./A-5166-2010","Gruner, Daniel S./0000-0002-3153-4297",,,,128,44,46,0,40,SOC NEMATOLOGISTS,MARCELINE,"PO BOX 311, MARCELINE, MO 64658 USA",0022-300X,,,J NEMATOL,J.

Ornithologists have exploited the fact that a number of hole-nesting birds readily breed in nest boxes. Boxes are artificial environments which often reduce the negative effects of nest predation and ectoparasitism, and nest boxes are frequently provided at unnaturally high densities. These aspects of nest-box studies may have important implications for the interpretation of current knowledge of the life history, population dynamics, and ecology of birds because much of the information is derived from nest-box studies. I review the consequences of nest-box studies for the inferences which can be made on bird biology in general and raptor biology in particular.

As distress calls may trigger antipredator behaviour even in individuals that are not under attack, we tested whether this defensive behaviour induced behavioural changes in neighbouring conspecifics. We compared the behavioural responses of two species of Neotropical hylid frogs (genus Boana) to conspecific distress calls and white noise. Individuals of both species interrupted their vocal activity and decreased call rate after hearing the distress call. Natural variation on signal intensity calibrated among the nearest neighbours did not influence the response and we did not observe negative phonotaxis after any acoustic stimulus. Despite the fact that many predators are acoustically oriented, we could not determine if such response (reduced call rate) was induced by risk assessment or by the masking effect on advertisement calls. Boana faber responded similarly to white noise and distress calls, while B. bischoffi responded more intensely to distress calls. Duration of silence after playbacks in B. faber was longer than B. bischoffi. We suggest that, if the signals are interpreted as a risk cue by neighbouring conspecifics, each species may be preyed upon by different predators, as they may have led to distinct defensive strategies and different responses to distress calls. If risk assessment information is included in distress calls, it triggers behavioural responses only in the nearest neighbours, as we did not observe responses on the vocal activity of the interspecific chorus. Our results add relevant data about acoustic communication and interpretations by anurans, highlighting the importance of considering cues within common and widespread signals.","[Forti, Lucas Rodriguez; Toledo, Luis Felipe] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Forti, Lucas Rodriguez; Toledo, Luis Felipe] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Multiusuario Bioacust LMBio, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Bella Sanches Forti, Anna Barbara] Fac Direito Sorocaba, Rua Doutora Ursulina Lopes Torres, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Marquez, Rafael] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat CSIC, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Fonoteca Zool, Madrid, Spain","Forti, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Forti, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Multiusuario Bioacust LMBio, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lucas_forti@yahoo.com.br,"Toledo, Luis Felipe/I-4017-2012; Forti, Lucas/E-8207-2013","Toledo, Luis Felipe/0000-0002-4929-9598; Forti, Lucas/0000-0003-3057-2141; Marquez, Rafael/0000-0002-2070-860X","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/21519-4, 2014/23388-7]; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas [CGL2011-16159-E]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [302589/2013-9, 300896/2016-6, 438675/2016-9, 150041/2017-9, 405285/2013-2]; Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [ACOURA CGL2008-04814]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Grant/Award Number: #2013/21519-4 and #2014/23388-7; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Grant/Award Number: CGL2011-16159-E; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Grant/Award Number: #302589/2013-9, #300896/2016-6, #438675/2016-9, #150041/2017-9 and #405285/2013-2; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: ACOURA CGL2008-04814; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad",,32,5,5,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,DEC,2017,123,12,,,,,942,948,,10.1111/eth.12693,,,7,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FM2YC,WOS:000414867800007,,,,,2021-09-27,

Fouling assemblages grown on artificial settlement substrata were disturbed by mechanical removal of biomass at different time intervals. Using one single disturbance frequency (10 disturbance events over 5 months) we applied 7 different temporal disturbance treatments: a constant disturbance regime (identical intervals between disturbance events), and 6 variable treatments where both variableness and sequences of intervals between disturbance events were manipulated. Two levels of temporal variableness (low and high, i.e. disturbance events were either dispersed or highly clumped in time) in the disturbance regime were applied by modifying the time intervals between subsequent disturbance events. To investigate the temporal coupling between disturbance events and other ecological processes (e.g. larval supply and recruitment intensity), three different sequences of disturbance intervals were nested in each of the two levels of temporal variableness. Species richness, evenness, total abundance, and structure of communities that experienced the various disturbance regimes were compared at the end of the experiment (15 days after the last disturbance event). Disturbance strongly influenced the community structure and led to a decrease in evenness and total abundance but not species richness. In undisturbed reference communities, the dominant competitor Pyura chilensis (Tunicata) occupied most available space while this species was suppressed in all disturbed treatments. Surprisingly, neither temporal variableness in the disturbance regime nor the sequence of intervals between disturbance events had an effect on community structure. Temporal variability in high disturbance regimes may be of minor importance for fouling communities, because they are dominated by opportunistic species that are adapted to rapidly exploit available space.

Despite the large number of studies on biological invasions addressing this hypothesis, tests evaluating changes in herbivory on native and introduced populations and their effects on plant reproductive potential at a biogeographical level are relatively rare. Here, we tested the ER hypothesis on the South African species Senecio pterophorus (Asteraceae), which is native to the Eastern Cape, has expanded into the Western Cape, and was introduced into Australia (> 70-100 years ago) and Europe (> 30 years ago). Insect seed predation was evaluated to determine whether plants in the introduced areas were released from herbivores compared to plants from the native range. In South Africa, 25 % of the seedheads of sampled plants were damaged. Plants from the introduced populations suffered lower seed predation compared to those from the native populations, as expected under the ER hypothesis, and this release was more pronounced in the region with the most recent introduction (Europe 0.2 % vs. Australia 15 %). The insect communities feeding on S. pterophorus in Australia and Europe differed from those found in South Africa, suggesting that the plants were released from their associated fauna after invasion and later established new associations with local herbivore communities in the novel habitats. Our study is the first to provide strong evidence of enemy release in a biogeographical survey across the entire known distribution of a species.","[Castells, Eva; Morante, Maria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Vet, Unitat Toxicol, Dept Farmacol Terapeut & Toxicol, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Blanco-Moreno, Jose M.; Xavier Sans, F.] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, E-08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Vilatersana, Roser] Bot Inst Barcelona IBB CSIC ICUB, Barcelona 08038, Catalonia, Spain; [Blasco-Moreno, Anabel] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Serv Estadist Aplicada, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain","Castells, E (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Vet, Unitat Toxicol, Dept Farmacol Terapeut & Toxicol, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain.",eva.castells@uab.cat,"castells, eva/M-1111-2014; Vilatersana, Roser/L-9472-2014; Blanco-Moreno, Jose M./A-5565-2013; Serra, F.

For bulk sampled bivalves of the genus Chione from the late Neogene of Florida, temporal patterns of prey size selectivity differ depending on whether drill holes from naticid and muricid gastropods are lumped together or separated. When drill hole producers are identified to family level using revised experimental criteria developed specifically for this study system, we find that naticid and muricid prey size selectivity responds in different directions and at different times, but both groups exhibit change in prey size selectivity beginning around 2.5 Ma. We reject previous conclusions that changes in drilling gastropod prey handling behaviors were driven by changes in prey morphology associated with a species turnover event at 1.8 Ma. Prey density, threats from enemies, and habitat structure were also changing throughout the study interval, but none of these factors alone provides a complete explanation for observed changes in predator behaviors for either family. We conclude that multiple factors drive predator behavioral change, and that different predator types have different sensitivities to these factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Plankton composition was mainly studied in size-fractionated samples, but also the isotopic signatures of three copepod species, as representative of primary consumers, were considered. Several fish species were included as planktivorous consumers, with special attention to sardine (Sardina pilchardus). Finally, top pelagic consumers were represented by the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis). The relationship between trophic position and body size implies large variability in the ratio of predator to prey sizes, likely because widespread omnivory and plankton consumption by relatively large predators. Planktivorous species share a common trophic position, suggesting potential competition for food, and low nitrogen isotope enrichment between prey and consumers suggest nutrient limitation and recycling at the base of the food web. Both experimental and field evidences indicate that the muscle of sardine integrates fish diet over seasonal periods and reflects the composition of plankton from large shelf areas. The low mobility of sardines during periods of low population size is consistent with differential isotopic signatures found in shelf zones characterised by upwelling nutrient inputs.

The potential value of agroecosystems for aiding species survival is often ignored. Essential ecosystem services may suffer when functional groups such as pollinators and predators are affected by land use. We used agroforestry systems differing in land-use intensity to examine flower-visiting bees on coffee plants and the community structure of trap-nesting bees and wasps and their natural enemies. The number and abundance of all species of coffee-visiting bees did not show a significant correlation with land-use intensity. The abundance (but not the number of species) of solitary bees increased with land-use intensity, whereas the abundance and number of species of social bees significantly decreased. In a further experiment, abundance and number of trap-nesting species increased with land-use intensity. These results contrast with the common expectation that intensively used agroforestry systems are characterized only by loss of species. Furthermore, they support the idea that many nonpest and beneficial insect species may even profit from agricultural land use. Parasitism and predation of trap-nest inhabitants did not change with land-use intensity, but species diversity (number of enemy species) and ecological function (mortality) were correlated.","Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Dept Pest & Plant Dis, Bogor 16144, Indonesia","Klein, AM (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Waldweg 26, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",a.klein@uaoe.gwdg.de,"Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014; Klein, Alexandra-Maria/J-5871-2016; Buchori, Damayanti/L-5878-2017","Klein, Alexandra-Maria/0000-0003-2139-8575; Buchori, Damayanti/0000-0002-2843-0737; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf/0000-0003-1359-3944",,,,65,180,190,3,95,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

This hypothesis suggests that diversity is maintained by slowing down competitive exclusion. In this study we: (1) quantified the relative importance of seed limitation and establishment limitation on recruitment for 4-7 species, testing the impact of seed predators and competition; (2) evaluated the effect of recruitment limitation on the diversity of seedling communities: if recruitment limitation is a diversity-promoting mechanism, then removing the limitation should have a negative effect on diversity. To evaluate the magnitude and effects of recruitment limitation we used data from 400 seed traps, we executed seed addition experiments with and without vertebrate exclusion, and we conducted seedling transplant experiments during 2yr in an Amazonian rain forest in Colombia. On the basis of seed traps, we found that seed limitation was strong; however, seed addition experiments showed that establishment limitation is more important than seed limitation for recruitment in all species considered. The addition/transplant experiments did not affect diversity of the surrounding seedlings, lending no support to the theory that recruitment limitation affects diversity. Establishment limitation was stronger at the seed-seedling transition than in older seedling transitions, as shown by high survival in the seedling transplants experiment. We found that seed dispersal increases regenerating plant diversity, and that predation is an important factor affecting seed establishment. We highlight the role of animals in these processes and therefore in the maintenance of diversity in tropical rain forests.","[Vargas, Ivonne N.; Stevenson, Pablo R.] Univ Los Andes, LEBTYP, Dept Ciencias Biol, Bogota, Colombia","Stevenson, PR (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, LEBTYP, Dept Ciencias Biol, Cr 1A 18A-10, Bogota, Colombia.",pstevens@uniandes.edu.co,,,"Facultad de Ciencias at Los Andes University, Bogota","We thank Edgar Yucuna, Mara Florian, Paul Zalamea, and Pilar Jimenez for their help and company in the field.

In a tropical coastal terrestrial forest in Costa Rica, we investigated the relative importance of predation by land crabs, Gecarcinus quadratus, and hermit crabs, Coenobita compressus, on measured forest composition through a series of seed removal and seedling establishment experiments. We also used natural light-gaps and adjacent non-gap sites to test how canopy cover affects crab predation ( seed removal) and seedling establishment. We found fewer tree species (S = 18) and lower densities ( seedlings, saplings, and adults) in the coastal zone within 100 m of coastline, than in the inland zone (S = 59). Land crab densities were higher in the coastal zone (3.03 +/- 1.44 crabs m(-2)) than in the inland zone (0.76 +/- 0.78 crabs m(-2)), and hermit crabs were not present in the inland zone. Seed removal and seedling mortality also were higher in the coastal zone than in the inland zone, and in the open controls than in the crab exclosures. Mortality of seeds and seedlings was two to six times higher in the controls than exclosures for four of the five experiments. Crabs preferred seeds and younger seedlings over older seedlings but showed no species preferences in the seed (Anacardium excelsum, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Terminalia oblonga) and seedling (Pachira quinata and E. cyclocarpum) stages. We conclude that the observed differences in tree densities were caused by differential crab predation pressure along the coastal gradient, while the differences in species composition were due to predator escape ( satiation) by seed quantity. Canopy cover did not affect seed removal rates, but did affect seedling survival with higher mortality in the non-gap versus gap environments. In summary, crab predation of seeds and seedlings, and secondarily canopy cover, are important factors affecting tree establishment in terrestrial coastal forests.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Lindquist, ES (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Org Trop Studies, Box 90630, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",erin@ots.ac.cr,,,,,,50,46,53,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2004,141,4,,,,,661,671,,10.1007/s00442-004-1673-5,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,869QT,WOS:000224999800012,15349766,,,,2021-09-27,

In this study, we described the foraging strategy of three sympatric South American species of Pogonomyrmex ants to confirm that they are solitary foragers as is suggested anecdotally in the literature. Then we tested whether those foraging strategies are fixed or flexible in response to seed density and distribution. Based on individual and group movements of foraging ants, we determined that P. rastratus MAYR, 1868 is exclusively a solitary foraging species, P. inermis FOREL, 1914 use a group-foraging strategy with limited recruitment, and P. mendozanus CUEZZO & CLAVER, 2009 displays an intermediate foraging system in which workers are typically solitary foragers but also recruit nestmates to high-density seed patches. The addition of seeds near the nest modified the foraging behavior of the three species by different amounts. Individual foragers of each species reduced their search time and search area, and colonies increased their foraging activity rate, probably as a result of a higher returning rate of successful foragers after seed addition. Such behavioral responses were much more conspicuous in P. mendozanus than in the other two species. Flexibility in foraging and diet breadth reported for some of these harvester ants may constitute important adaptive features in the central Monte desert where seed abundance is highly heterogeneous, irregular, and severely affected by anthropic disturbances.","[Pol, Rodrigo G.] IADIZA CONICET, Desert Community Ecol Res Team Ecodes, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Pol, Rodrigo G.] Univ Nacl Cuyo, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Lopez de Casenave, Javier; Milesi, Fernando A.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Desert Community Ecol Res Team Ecodes, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Lopez de Casenave, Javier; Milesi, Fernando A.] IEGEBA UBA CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Milesi, Fernando A.] CEAN, INIBIOMA UNCo CONICET, Ecodes, Junin De Los Andes, Neuquen, Argentina","Pol, RG (corresponding author), IADIZA CONICET, Desert Community Ecol Res Team Ecodes, Casilla Correo 507, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina.",rgpolo@yahoo.com.ar,"Pol, Rodrigo/AAM-2379-2020",,"ANPCyTANPCyT [PICT 2196, PICT 2010-0898]; Universidad de Buenos Aires from ArgentinaUniversity of Buenos Aires [UBACyT 20020100100928]","We thank Gabriela Pirk for her helpful comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

The nemertean Prosorhochmus nelsoni is a common predator in the mid-intertidal zone on rocky shores along the Chilean coast, where it can reach very high abundances (up to 260 ind m(-2)) in algal turfs, algal crusts, barnacle crusts, and mixed substrata. Tidal and diurnal scans revealed that the activity of P. nelsoni is primarily restricted to night and early-morning low tides and is relatively low when air temperatures are high. On average, larger worms crawled faster than smaller worms, with their maximum velocity being influenced by substratum type. Their estimated rate of predation is 0.092 prey items nemertean(-1) day(-1), just below the laboratory rate of similar to 0.2 amphipods nemertean(-1) day(-1) previously estimated for this species. P. nelsoni consumes a diverse spectrum of prey items (i.e., amphipods, isopods, decapods, barnacles, and dipterans) and is possibly exerting a significant influence on its prey populations. We suggest that the opportunistic predatory behavior of this intertidal predator is caused by the trade-off between immediate persistence (e.g., avoidance of desiccation) and long-term survival through successful foraging.","[Caplins, Serena; Turbeville, J.

Through a pioneer study in North-West Africa based on a camera-trapping survey, we studied ecology features of a carnivores' community in the Middle Atlas Mountains, Morocco. We focused on how species shared (or not) the territory and their activity patterns. Camera trapping detected five carnivorous species: African golden wolf (Canis lupaster), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), genet (Genetta genetta) and African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica). Generalized Linear Models confirmed different habitat selection patterns between these species. The presence of a small protected area or prey availability apparently were not determinant factors in the abundance of these species. Spatial segregation patterns were observed between the red fox with the domestic dog and between the red fox with the genet. Kernel density estimates showed strong temporal segregation of red fox and African golden wolf with regard to domestic dog, and suggested avoidance mechanisms for the triad red fox, genet and African golden wolf. Despite the influence of interspecific competition in the assembly of the community, human pressure was apparently the most relevant factor related with the spatiotemporal segregation in this territory.","[Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria; Mana-Varela, Brais] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain; [Herrera-Sanchez, F.

We hypothesized that perch spawning population biomass and summer water temperature would increase perch recruitment, with potential density dependence, while the effect of the population size of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) would be negative. Different forms of general stock-recruitment functions, with and without density dependence, and with and without water temperature and pikeperch population size as environmental factors were fitted to long-term (1981-2014) stock assessment data of perch and pikeperch in the Archipelago Sea, southwestern coast of Finland. Perch spawning stock biomass (ages 5-14), water temperature in June-July and pikeperch stock size (ages >= 1) at spawning year best explained variation in perch recruitment. The results supported the predictions: perch recruitment increased with spawning stock in density-dependent manner, pikeperch effect on perch recruitment was negative and summer temperature effect was positive suggesting environmentally affected competitive interaction between these two percids.","[Kokkonen, Eevi] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, POB 1627, Kuopio 70211, Finland; [Heikinheimo, Outi] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9,POB 2, Helsinki 00791, Finland; [Pekcan-Hekim, Zeynep] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Oregrund, Sweden; [Vainikka, Anssi] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland","Kokkonen, E (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, POB 1627, Kuopio 70211, Finland.",eevi.kokkonen@uef.fi; outi.heikinheimo@luke.fi; zeynep.pekcan.hekim@slu.se; anssi.vainikka@uef.fi,,"Heikinheimo, Outi/0000-0002-1454-3087; Vainikka, Anssi/0000-0002-0172-5615; Kokkonen, Eevi/0000-0003-3779-1179","University of Eastern Finland (UEF); Kuopio University Hospital; Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation [201700360]; Doctoral Programme in Environmental Physics, Health and Biology of the University of Eastern Finland","Open access funding provided by University of Eastern Finland (UEF) including Kuopio University Hospital.

A basic assumption of group size effect is that all individuals are equally important for a focal individual, who may adjust its vigilance levels according to social information acquired from them. However, some studies have indicated that neighbors pose greater influences on an individual's vigilance decisions than other group members, especially in large aggregations. Vigilance has also been found to be directed to both predators (anti-predation vigilance) and conspecifics (social vigilance). Central individuals might rely more on social vigilance than peripheral individuals. To test these hypotheses, we examined the effects of flock size, number of neighbors and position within a flock on vigilance and competition of greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons that form large foraging flocks in winter, controlling the effects of other variables (group identity, winter period and site). We found that individual vigilance levels were significantly affected by number of neighbors and position within a flock, whereas flock size showed no effect. Individuals devoted a large component of vigilance to nearby flock mates. Central individuals directed a relatively larger proportion of vigilance to monitor neighbors than peripheral ones, indicating that central individuals more relied on social information acquired from neighbors, possibly caused by the more blocked visual field of central individuals. Moreover, some social vigilance may function as conducting or preventing agonistic interactions since competition intensity was positively correlated with number of neighbors. Our study therefore demonstrate that the number of neighbors is more important than group size in determining individual vigilance in large animal groups. Further studies are still needed to unravel which neighbors pose greater influence on individual vigilance, and the factors that influence individuals to acquire information from their neighbors to adjust vigilance behaviors.","[Zhao, Jin-Ming; Zhou, Li-Zhi] Anhui Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jin-Ming] Huaibei Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Huaibei, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Nan] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers & Ecol Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yue-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhou, LZ (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",lizhi_zhou@126.com,"Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021","Zhou, Lizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31800325, 31472020, 31772458]; Anhui Provincial Natural Science foundationNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1808085QC59]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672298]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant no. 31800325, 31472020, 31772458; and the Anhui Provincial Natural Science foundation, grant no. 1808085QC59.

Both of these impacts increase marine microbial diversity by increasing interspecific competition. By contrast, very little is known about the role of phage predation in terrestrial ecosystems. A recent field study in Barrow, AK found phage predation to be a key factor controlling terrestrial bacterial population dynamics in Arctic soils. When phage abundance was artificially reduced using a tea extract, antiphage treatment, bacterial abundance, and respiration increased accordingly, suggesting top-down control by phages. The goal of this study was to examine the impact of phage predation in temperate soil ecosystems. Laboratory-scale experiments confirmed the potent antiphage properties of tea extracts. However, field experiments conducted at two discrete sites (upland and wetland) yielded little evidence that top-down control by phage predation was significant in temperate soils.","[Helsley, Kaitlin R.; Brown, Theresa M.; Furlong, Kevin; Williamson, Kurt E.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, Integrated Sci Ctr 2127, Williamsburg, VA 22185 USA","Williamson, KE (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, Integrated Sci Ctr 2127, Williamsburg, VA 22185 USA.",kewilliamson@wm.edu,,,William & Mary Honors Fund; Jeffress Memorial Trust [J-988],"This work was supported by William & Mary Honors Funding to KRH provided by individual donors Dr. John Sherwood, Ms. Margery Daughtry, Mr. Ted Dintersmith, and Ms. Janet Bouland and by a grant to KEW from the Jeffress Memorial Trust ( J-988).

We examined interspecific differences in caching and pilfering behaviors of 3 coexisting heteromyid rodents, Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami), the pale kangaroo mouse (Microdipodops pallidus), and the little pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris), to determine if caching microhabitat affects likelihood of pilferage. In outdoor enclosures we tracked cache placement and measured pilferage of artificial caches using radiolabeled Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) seeds. M. pallidus and P. longimembris placed seed caches mostly under shrubs, whereas D. merriami placed caches predominately in open microhabitat. However, D. merriami showed a significant preference for pilfering caches under shrubs, whereas P. longimembris did not show a significant preference for pilfering caches in either open or undershrub microhabitats. The 2 species pilfered similar numbers of caches. Coexisting heteroymid rodent species may contribute to spatial heterogeneity of available resources by caching in different microhabitats, thereby reducing but not eliminating cache pilferage by other species.

Here we report oil a series of experiments that quantify that window for age-structured Populations of salamander larvae and paedomorphic adults. We determined body size limits on cannibalism in microcosms and then the consumptive and nonconsumptive (injuries, foraging and activity, diet, growth) effects on victims in mesocosms with seminatural levels of habitat complexity and alternative prey. We found that cannibalism by the largest size classes (paedomorphs and >= age 3+ yr larvae) Occurs mainly on young-of-the-year (YOY) victims. Surviving YOY and other small larvae had increased injuries, reduced activity levels, and reduced growth rates in the presence of cannibals. Data on YOY survival in an experiment in which we manipulated the density of paedomorphs combined with historical data oil the number of cannibals ill natural populations indicate that dominant cohorts of paedomorphs can cause observed recruitment failures. Dietary data indicate that ontogenetic shifts ill diet should preclude strong intraspecific competition between YOY and cannibals in this species. Thus Our results are consistent with previous empirical and theoretical work that suggests that recruitment regulation by cannibalism is most likely when YOY are vulnerable to cannibalism but have low dietary overlap with cannibals. Understanding the role of cannibalism in regulating recruitment in salamander populations is timely, given the widespread occurrences of amphibian decline. Previous Studies have focused on extrinsic (including anthropogenic) factors that affect amphibian population dynamics, whereas the data presented here combined with long-term field observations suggest the potential for intrinsically driven population cycles.","[Wissinger, Scott A.; Mumford, Miranda L.] Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; [Wissinger, Scott A.; Whiteman, Howard H.; Denoel, Mathieu; Mumford, Miranda L.; Aubee, Catherine B.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Whiteman, Howard H.; Aubee, Catherine B.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Denoel, Mathieu] Univ Liege, Dept Environm Sci, Behav Biol Unit, B-4020 Liege, Belgium","Wissinger, SA (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",swissing@allegheny.edu,,"Denoel, Mathieu/0000-0002-3586-8323","Fulbright Foundation; FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [1.5.01 1.03, 1.5.120.04, F.4718.07, 1.5.199.07, 1.5.013.08]; Murray State University; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0109436, DEB-0108931]","We greatly appreciate field assistance from Amy Benson, Jessica Boynton, Erin Olson.

Recently the role of kinship in CBP has been in focus, and some studies have demonstrated high host-parasite relatedness in avian CBP systems. However, high natal and breeding site fidelity of hosts and parasites complicates the interpretation of previous observational findings, and the mechanisms leading to high host-parasite relatedness remain unknown. Some recent findings suggest that broadening the scope of the study of interactions may cast light on these mechanisms. We studied relatedness between parasites laying in the same nest (co-parasites) and factors possibly driving relatedness patterns between co-parasites in the common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula. Based on a field experiment, controlling for site fidelity and host role, we report here that both relatedness and safety of the nest site, and their interaction, affected the likelihood of two females engaging in co-parasitism. At the population level, parasites indeed seemed to lay eggs preferentially with kin. Analyses at a finer spatial scale revealed that high relatedness between co-parasites was not due to the philopatry effect only. Parasites engaging in co-parasitism also laid in safer neighbourhoods than parasites that did not engage in co-parasitism; the number of nondepredated nesting attempts the previous year was higher for the parasites engaging in co-parasitism. However, the interaction between relatedness and safety of the nest site suggests that co-parasitism at dangerous lakes was more likely to involve relatives. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that nest predation risk and interaction between related parasites are associated with kin-biased co-parasitism in a CBP system.

Increases in forage quantity and quality in burned areas attract large ungulates, and may result in changes to animal distributions. In mountainous northern British Columbia where prescribed fire is used to enhance ungulate range, there is concern that expanding elk (Cervus elaphus) populations will move in response to burning into the traditional ranges of another grazing species, Stone's sheep (Ovis dalli stonei), and have adverse effects on them. We compared patterns of resource selection and use by both species on a landscape with 138 prescribed burns varying from 0 to 31 years of age. Seasonal range sizes of global positioning system (GPS)-collared individuals were smallest in winter and late winter and largest in summer for both female Stone's sheep and elk. Both species selected for south aspects and against conifer stands in all seasons. Stone's sheep selected for burned areas in fall, winter, and late winter and selected to be close to a burn in every season except summer. Elk selected for burned areas in every season, with the highest selection for burn-shrub areas. Stone's sheep typically used younger burns, whereas elk were less specific and often used older burns. The highest potential for seasonal overlap in the use of burned areas occurs during winter and late winter, but Stone's sheep and elk at current population levels overlap minimally because they partition their use of the landscape through elevation and topography. Stone's sheep always selected and used steeper rugged terrain than elk, and were at higher elevations, often in rocky areas. Elk avoided alpine and rocky areas, and were at lower elevations than Stone's sheep, on flatter less rugged terrain. We recommend continued monitoring of post-fire effects on resource selection and use by these sympatric grazers, particularly relative to the distribution of expanding elk populations, which could enable competitive interactions and change predator-prey dynamics.

However, small vertebrate herbivore species co-occurring with large herbivores may be affected by large herbivore grazing through changes in plant species composition, nutrient content and vegetation structure. These changes can be either positive or negative for the smaller herbivores, but this may depend on the species of small herbivores. We experimentally tested the impact of cattle grazing on habitat choice of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cunicidus) and common voles (Microtus arvalis). We excluded cattle for 7 years and measured changes in vegetation parameters, and the response of rabbits and voles. Rabbits were Facilitated by cattle, whereas voles strongly preferred vegetation without cattle. The facilitation effect was stronger at low rabbit densities. Vegetation biomass and nitrogen concentration were not affected by cattle grazing, but vegetation height increased significantly where cattle were excluded. Plant species composition also changed following cattle exclusion; however, the main food plants of rabbits and voles remained abundant in each grazing treatment. We conclude that the response of both rabbits and voles predominantly reflect the differences in vegetation height in the presence and absence of cattle, but in a contrasting fashion. The difference in response between rabbits and voles may result from reduced perceived predation risk, which is lowest in high vegetation for voles, but in short vegetation for rabbits, which depend on their burrows for safety. The use of large herbivores in grassland conservation management can thus have a contrasting effect on different species of small herbivores. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

These birds produce many recruits when fish availability is high, leading to rapidly increasing populations, but few recruits, and may even exhibit die-offs, when the opposite is true. Unlike cormorants in the Peru and Benguela currents, however, Brandt's Cormorant population changes have yet to be correlated with those of its prey. Herein, using multi-decadal time series of cormorant colony size, diet, prey availability and mortality, in the context of changes in breeding site and fishery management, we provide insight into why central California colonies near San Francisco - a major portion of this species' global population expanded from principally one offshore island in the 1960-70s to include a large mainland component by the 1990s. Involved were increases and decreases, respectively, of northern anchovy, a coastal forage species, and young-of-the year rockfish, more prevalent offshore. With protection of breeding sites and a shift towards ecosystem-based fisheries management by the 1990s, variations of the central California Brandt's Cormorant population are now driven naturally by forage fish availability, and perhaps inter- and intraspecific competition for prey and space when population sizes are high. This species, owing to its boom-or-bust natural history and the relative ease of assessing breeding population size and diet, may be ideal for monitoring the state of the central California Current food web.","[Ainley, David G.; Nelson, Peter] HT Harvey & Associates, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA; [Santora, Jarrod A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Capitolo, Phillip J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Field, John C.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Beck, Jessie N.; Carle, Ryan D.; Donnelly-Greenan, Erica; Hester, Michelle] Oikonos Ecosyst Knowledge, Santa Cruz, CA 95062 USA; [Donnelly-Greenan, Erica] Moss Landing Marine Labs, Pob 450, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [McChesney, Gerard J.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, San Francisco Bay Natl Wildlife Refuge Complex, Fremont, CA 94555 USA; [Elliott, Meredith; Bradley, Russell W.; Warzybok, Peter; Jahncke, Jaime] Point Blue Conservat Sci, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA; [Lindquist, Kirsten] Greater Farallones Assoc, San Francisco, CA 94129 USA; [Roletto, Jan] Greater Farallones Natl Marine Sanctuary, San Francisco, CA 94129 USA","Ainley, DG (corresponding author), 983 Univ Ave,Bldg D, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA.",dainley@penguinscience.com,,,"NOAA through H.T.

The present study analyses the interactions in trophic ecology between the endangered Iberian toothcarp Aphanius iberus and the highly invasive eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki at a sympatric site where they have been verified to coexist for more than 10 yr. The existence of a habitat gradient in the system, mainly determined by salinity and accompanied by different proportions of the 2 fish species, made it possible to analyse dietary variation along that gradient. Overall results from gut content analysis showed a high degree of similarity in the spring diets of both species. However, the mosquitofish appeared to be a better competitor for food resources, as individuals of this exotic species presented a lower proportion of empty guts and their guts contained more food. Possibly associated with a certain degree of spatial segregation, a shift in the diet composition of the toothcarp and the mosquitofish was observed among sites with different salinities and relative abundances of both species. In general, in sectors of the channel with lower salinity levels and mosquitofish as the dominant species, toothcarp seemed to display more benthic feeding and, consequently, the diets of both species were less overlapped. Under such conditions, the toothcarp diminished feeding intensity and diet diversity. Thus, this native species could be subjected to a decrease in its population viability as a direct consequence of trophic relationship with the invasive fish.","[Ruiz-Navarro, Ana; Torralva, Mar; Oliva-Paterna, Francisco J.] Univ Murcia, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Ruiz-Navarro, A (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",anaruiz@um.es,"Ruiz-Navarro, Ana/AAU-7982-2021; TORRALVA, MAR/R-5545-2019","Ruiz-Navarro, Ana/0000-0002-3872-6080; Oliva-Paterna, Francisco J./0000-0001-8288-5321",Spanish Ministry of EducationSpanish Government [FPU AP2006-01528],"We thank Institut d'Ecologia Aquatica of the University of Girona for the study of the invertebrate community and for help in prey identification, J.

The study was carried out in St. Andrews, New Brunswick (Canada) from July to October 1989. Flat panels without and with crevices of various depths (1, 10, 100 mm) alternating with adjoining flat areas were moored according to a random design in the surface 2 m in the sublittoral zone. Species diversity and total percent cover increased from August to October. However, the ANOVA showed no significant effect of substratum heterogeneity nor complexity (the hierarchical combination of various scales of heterogeneity) on overall diversity (H') in August and October nor on percent cover on the whole panels in August. However, one type of complex panel out of eight types tested did show a significantly lower percent cover than the others in October. Small scale patterns of distributions varied significantly among the different types of surfaces within each panel, however. In general, percent cover of organisms were greater in 1 mm crevices in August and in 10 mm crevices 2 months later, than on other types of surfaces. Local hydrodynamics and active larval choice may be involved. Our study shows that both substratum heterogeneity and complexity did not influence much the overall northern sessile community characteristics (diversity and abundance), but structured strongly the small scale distribution of its species during the early phases of development.","UNIV LAVAL,DEPT MATH & STAT,ST FOY G1K 7P4,PQ,CANADA","BOURGET, E (corresponding author), UNIV LAVAL,DEPT BIOL,GIROQ,ST FOY G1K 7P4,PQ,CANADA.",,,,,,,57,128,129,1,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Common Carp Cyprinus carpio is a widespread invasive species that can exert negative density-dependent effects on aquatic food webs. However, little is known concerning processes that regulate their recruitment. We used summer-through-fall electrofishing catch rates of age-0 Common Carp to investigate the importance of biotic (stock size, prey availability, egg and juvenile predation, intraspecific competition) and abiotic (water level fluctuation, temperature, wind events) factors on recruitment and growth in 13 lakes across eastern South Dakota from 2008 to 2010. Mean relative abundance of age-0 Common Carp was highly variable spatially and temporally, ranging from 0 to 152.2 fish per hour of electrofishing. Ricker stockrecruitment models indicated that peak production of age-0 Common Carp occurred when adult Common Carp relative abundance was low. Recruitment also increased with springsummer temperatures, decreased with wind events, and was affected by annual water level fluctuations. Age-0 Common Carp growth, estimated by mean size in August, was highly variable (mean TL = 42165mm) and influenced by the abundance of conspecifics and wind events, indicating that density-dependent interactions may have occurred during early life stages. Combined, our results suggest that the early life history of Common Carp is regulated by density-dependent processes and abiotic environmental conditions, which provide new insights into mechanisms regulating recruitment of this widespread invasive species.

The site was located within an area that had been closed to fishing since 1987 to protect juvenile haddock. An experimental line was trawled 12-14 times on three separate occasions over a 20 month period. The benthic macrofauna, and megafauna were sampled before and after trawling on both impact and control lines with both a grab and a photographic system. The 100 grab samples collected contained 341 taxa, primarily polychaetes, amphipods and molluscs, the majority (60%) of which were epifaunal. Biomass was dominated by the horse-mussel Modiolus modiolus, a long-lived bivalve, while the tube-building amphipod Ericthonius fasciatus was the most abundant species. Through the study period the benthos on the control lines showed little qualitative or quantitative change in individual taxa or community metrics. However, the abundance of 24 individual taxa (polychaetes, amphipods, echinoderms and molluscs) changed significantly, with the majority of these increasing. This resulted in a significantly different relative abundance of taxa between years as detected through ANOSIM. A significant change in relative biomass amongst the taxa was also observed. Trawling had few detectable immediate effects on the abundance or biomass of individual taxa and none on community composition. A few taxa, primarily a mixture of polychaetes and amphipods, decreased significantly after trawling and data from fish stomachs collected during the experiment (Kenchington, E.L., Gordon Jr., D.C., Bourbonnais-Boyce, C., Maclsaac, K.G., Gilkinson, K.D., McKeown, D.L., Vass, W.P., 2005. Effects of experimental otter trawling on the feeding of demersal fish on Western Bank, Nova Scotia. Amer. Fish. Soc. Symp. 41, 391-409) showed that some of these were scavenged by demersal fish. Fifteen taxa showed significant decreases after trawling when the cumulative effects of trawling were considered. As in the analyses of individual years the species affected were primarily high turn-over species such as polychaetes and amphipods. Dominance curves prepared for both control and impact samples before trawling in 1997 and after trawling in 1999 showed a marked decrease in the biomass values of the highest ranking taxa, particularly of the first species, M modiolus, only on the impact line at the conclusion of the experiment. The proportion of epifaunal biomass also declined significantly from 90% to 77% on the impact line by the conclusion of the experiment. These changes are in part due to trawl-induced damage and subsequent predation by demersal fish of the top ranking species. Analysis of the photographic images showed that the three top-ranking species in terms of biomass, M modiolus, the tube-building polychaete Thelepus cincinnatus, and the brachiopod Terebraturlina septentrionalis, were visibly damaged more than other species by the trawl gear. Two of these species, M modiolus and T cincinnatus, were preyed upon by scavenging demersal fish. The use of multiple sampling devices at the experimental site (grab, photographic system reported here and trawl and fish stomachs reported by Kenchington, E.L., Gordon Jr., D.C., Bourbonnais-Boyce, C., Maclsaac, K.G., Gilkinson, K.D., McKeown, D.L., Vass, WP., 2005. Effects of experimental otter trawling on the feeding of demersal fish on Western Bank, Nova Scotia. Amer. Fish. Soc.

Competitive interactions are an important determinant of foraging rates; however, the relationship between the exploitation and interference components of competition has received little empirical or theoretical consideration. Moreover, little is known about the relationship between aggressive behavioural interactions and interference competition. Using a natural gradient of consumer and resource densities, we empirically examine how aggressiveness relates to consumer-consumer encounter rates and foraging for four species of Chaetodon reef fish spanning a range of dietary niche breadths. The probability of aggression was most strongly associated with both total consumer and resource densities. In contrast, total encounter rates were best predicted by conspecific consumer density, and were highest for the most specialised consumer (Chaetodon trifascialis), not the most aggressive (Chaetodon baronessa). The most specialised consumer, not the most aggressive, also exhibited the largest reduction in foraging rates with increasing consumer density. Our results support the idea of a positive link between the exploitation and interference components of competition for the most specialised consumer. Moreover, our results caution against inferring the presence of ecological interactions (competition) from observations of behaviour (aggression and agonism) alone.","[Blowes, Shane A.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Blowes, Shane A.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Blowes, Shane A.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Blowes, SA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Blowes, SA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Blowes, SA (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",sablowes@gmail.com,"Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020","Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Blowes, Shane/0000-0001-6310-3670",James Cook University; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Queensland Smart State Ph.D. fellowship; JCU Ecological Modelling Research Group,"We thank James Cook University and the Australian Research Council for financial support; SAB was also supported by a Queensland Smart State Ph.D. fellowship.

Controlled hand-pollination treatments were applied to plants in the field. Although C. keyensis flowers are self-compatible, they are not capable of automatic selfing. Inbreeding depression was observed in both seed set and percentage seed germination. Bees of seven genera were observed visiting C. keyensis flowers during the peak flowering season (June to July). Only Xylocopa micans and Melissodes spp. may be effective pollinators for C. keyensis, as they were the only bees that buzz pollinate this species, which has poricidal anther dehiscence. Chamaecrista keyensis received substantially more visits by X. micans, but fewer visits from Melissodes spp. in urban-edge vs. forest sites. Aerial mosquito spraying may exacerbate the existing pollinator limitation suffered by C keyensis by reducing the number of visits by the buzz-pollinating bees. Individuals of C. keyensis at urban edges produced fewer seeds per fruit than did individuals in a pristine forest mainly because of greater insect seed predation.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Liu, H (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol, Univ Pk, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",,"Koptur, Suzanne/B-7809-2009",,,,,47,47,51,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9122,1537-2197,,AM J BOT,Am.

Studies on the effect of large mammals on tree regeneration are few, and the results are conflicting. Large herbivores have been found to be important seedling predators in some areas, but facilitate tree regeneration by outcompeting small mammals and reducing grass cover in other areas. Through the use of the experimental fencing of termite mounds and adjacent savanna areas in this study, we investigated how termites and large herbivores influence tree regeneration. Termite mounds had a higher number of seedlings, more species richness, more alpha diversity (OD) and lower evenness (E) than savanna plots. Large herbivores did not significantly affect overall seedling density, species richness, OD or E. Beta diversity was higher in savanna areas than on termitaria, and beta diversity decreased in savanna areas when herbivores were excluded. Herbivore exclusion increased the density of the 12 (40 %) most common seedling species, representing 79 % of all seedlings, and fenced plots had relatively taller seedlings than open plots. Thus, termites were the main determinants of tree regeneration in our study area, but large mammals regulated the most common species. Although our study confirms previous work suggesting that large herbivores affect tree regeneration, we found that termites were an even more important determinant. Termite impacts on tree regeneration deserve increased attention by savanna ecologists.","[Stoen, Ole-Gunnar; Okullo, Paul; Eid, Tron; Moe, Stein R.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway","Stoen, OG (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",ole.stoen@umb.no,"Stoen, Ole-Gunnar/AAY-6457-2020; Moe, Stein R./G-1507-2011","Moe, Stein R./0000-0003-1005-3192; Okullo, Paul/0000-0001-5462-0844",,,,65,20,21,2,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2013,172,4,,,,,1085,1093,,10.1007/s00442-012-2561-z,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,188GF,WOS:000322180000016,23269321,,,,2021-09-27,

In the model, both prey and predator may choose between either a simple or a complex habitat. A second predator is restricted to hunting only in the simple habitat. The model is applied to a system of rodents and their predators: snakes (the generalist predator) and owls. The simplest version of the model predicts that snakes and rodents distribute themselves among the two microhabitats according to the relative magnitude of risk for rodents. Under various conditions (moonlight, competition among rodents and dilution of the risk) the model predicts that snakes distribute themselves among habitats in a way that dampens rodent reactions to variation in owl predation risk and to effects of competition. When rodents are abundant the model predicts that snakes will show a weaker reaction to moonlight. The predictions of the model are qualitatively comparable to field data of microhabitat use of kangaroo rats and sidewinders from the Mojave Desert. The model can also describe a habitat selection game at a larger scale (e.g., movements of snakes into a rich desert oasis). Although a game between predators and prey may not be the cause for all their movements among habitats in the field, a game perspective may contribute explanations for what would otherwise be unintuitive habitat shifts.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Bouskila, A (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",,"Bouskila, Amos/B-4847-2010","Bouskila, Amos/0000-0002-6995-5070",,,,64,41,43,1,22,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,UNIV HELSINKI,"P O BOX 26, FI-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND",0003-455X,1797-2450,,ANN ZOOL FENN,Ann.

Here we address how mesoscale oceanographic and environmental variability in the region around PC, CA may influence the distribution, abundance and size of the mussel Mytilus californianus, a competitively dominant species in rocky intertidal assemblages along the northeast Pacific. Strong upwelling and high wave exposure dominate the California coast north of PC, and weak, seasonal upwelling and warmer water temperatures are characteristic of the region south/ east of PC. We hypothesized that the gradient in temperature, upwelling, and wave exposure around PC would greatly influence patterns of recruitment and abundance of mussels, potentially underlying large-scale differences in community structure. We evaluated these predictions by surveying intertidal community structure, mussel distribution, size, abundance and recruitment at a range of intertidal sites around PC. We found that intertidal communities north of PC were dominated mainly by macrophytes, while mussels and barnacles were relatively scarce. Intertidal communities south of PC were dominated by mussels and barnacles, with a low abundance of macrophytes. Mussels were larger and mussel beds were more expansive and extended lower in elevation at sites ranging from north to south around PC. At northern sites, high abundances of sea star predators and elevated wave exposure effectively displaced the entire mussel zone upwards. We found no differences in the numbers of mussel recruits to sites around PC, suggesting that spatial patterns of mussel abundance were not driven by differential recruitment. These results suggest that unlike other well-studied systems, supply of benthic larvae does not underly the large-scale gradient in community structure around PC. We suggest that environmental conditions favorable to macroalgal growth north of PC, and conditions favorable to filter-feeder growth south of PC may underly mesoscale patterns of intertidal community structure in this region.

First, we provide evidence for ecological opportunity by demonstrating reduced species richness and abundance of potential competitors and predators at White Sands relative to nearby dark soils habitats. Second, we characterize ecological release at White Sands by demonstrating density compensation in the three White Sands lizard species and expanded resource use in White Sands S. undulatus. Contrary to predictions from ecological release models, we observed directional trait change but not increased trait variation in S. undulatus.

We quantified the effect of the predation pressure of the gastropod Trophon geversianus on the mytilid Mytilus chilensis in a rocky intertidal community of the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego. We quantified the density of T. geversianus along with the density of T. geversianus preying on M. chilensis and examined the potential relationship between sizes of both T. geversianus and M. chilensis. Additionally, we carried out laboratory experiments to quantify the drilling and ingestion rates of T. geversianus on M. chilensis at different aerial exposure times. At mid intertidal levels, unlike at low intertidal levels, T. geversianus consumed more frequently the available size range of mussels. On average, sizes of predator and prey consumed were positively correlated. The drilling rate decreased with increasing time of aerial exposure. Additionally, permanently submerged predators invested less time consuming the same amount of food than individuals exposed for 4 out of 12 h (4/12 h). Predators exposed for 9/12 h invested less time and consumed less food than those exposed 4/12 h. Our results suggest that T. geversianus is an efficient predator of M. chilensis, due to both its high density and feeding rate. Our results suggest that the strong predation pressure of T. geversianus on M. chilensis prevents this key competitor from monopolizing space at the low level through controlling their abundance, and further limits their vertical distribution.","[Curelovich, Jessica; Calcagno, Javier A.] Univ Maimonides, Dept Ciencias Nat & Antropol, Hidalgo, Argentina; [Curelovich, Jessica; Lovrich, Gustavo A.; Calcagno, Javier A.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Lovrich, Gustavo A.; Calcagno, Javier A.] Ctr Austral Invest Cient, Ushuaia, Argentina","Calcagno, JA (corresponding author), Univ Maimonides, Dept Ciencias Nat & Antropol, Hidalgo 775,C1405BWE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",jkalcagno@gmail.com,,,Argentinean Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT 1385]; Administracion de Parques Nacionales; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"This work was supported by the Argentinean Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica under Grant PICT 1385, the Administracion de Parques Nacionales and the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET).

However, these plastic responses may also have an interaction cost, which is assessed by the strength of interspecific interactions such as increased vulnerability to other predators or a reduction in competitive ability. This study assesses experimentally the effects of induced morphological defenses triggered by the carnivorous rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli, on the competitive ability of two herbivorous populations, and the reciprocal dominance between the rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and Brachionus havanaensis. Our results support the existence of a trade-off between the expression of induced morphological defenses and competitive ability in aquatic animals. Specifically, we show that: (i) a consumer which reduces its vulnerability to predation via induced defenses increases its resource requirement to maintain zero population growth; and (ii) the expression of induced defenses promotes a qualitative shift in the relative competitive performance of the two herbivores over a single resource gradient. These results reinforce the general idea of functional community consequences of phenotypic plasticity, in particular the expression of inducible defenses of prey.","[Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo] Fdn Univ Chile, Ctr Nacl Medio Ambiente, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Bustamante, Ramiro O.] Inst Ecol & Biodivers IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo; Bustamante, Ramiro O.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ecol & Recursos Nat, Santiago, Chile","Aranguiz-Acuna, A (corresponding author), Fdn Univ Chile, Ctr Nacl Medio Ambiente, Av Larrain 9975, Santiago, Chile.",a.aranguiz@cenma.cl,"BUSTAMANTE, RAMIRO/I-7353-2019; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo/F-3160-2013","Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana/0000-0002-9409-1147",CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [ICM-P05-002]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1090132],A.A.-A. acknowledges the support of a CONICYT doctoral scholarship and grant ICM-P05-002 to Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity.

This paper investigates their coincidence across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales to examine whether copepod distribution is related to that of krill. During 2 summers of high krill abundance near South Georgia (1996 and 1993) copepod abundance was <40% of that during an abnormally low krill year (1994). No such depletion was found north of the Polar Front, where krill were rare. Analysis of 2 mesoscale data sets showed that krill, rather than food or environmental factors, were most strongly implicated in copepod distribution. An area of persistently high krill abundance just north of South Georgia was characterised by exceptionally few copepods. Fine-scale relationships between patches of krill and copepods were studied with a Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder. Within krill swarms copepod abundance was low, but more dispersed krill associated with high concentrations of copepods. Copepods also appeared to live deeper and to make more extensive vertical migrations when krill were present. The inverse relationship between krill and copepod abundances thus occurred repeatedly and across a wide range of scales. The facts that krill swarms are mobile and were unrelated to hydrography further suggest that the inverse relationship was caused by krill. This could arise from competitive exclusion, direct predation or both. Evidence for competition is that South Georgia copepods rely on high phytoplankton biomass for recruitment and krill can remove this. Predation is suggested by the fact that crustaceans were found in krill guts in this region during both summer and winter. During the 1996 summer, experiment tally derived predation rates on copepods, combined with krill biomass values, suggested a significant impact on small copepods. Therefore we suggest that copepod numbers can be controlled by a combination of competition and predation by krill.","British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Atkinson, A (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",a.atkinson@bas.ac.uk,"Brierley, Andrew S/G-8019-2011","Brierley, Andrew S/0000-0002-6438-6892",,,,90,55,59,2,12,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Given that most managed systems have higher primary productivity than adjacent natural systems, theory suggests that bottom-up subsidized consumers are likely to spill over from managed to natural habitats. Furthermore, the magnitude of spillover is likely to differ between generalist and specialist consumers, because of differences in their ability to use the full spectrum of resources. However, it is unknown whether there is indeed asymmetrical spillover of consumers between managed and natural habitats, and whether this is related to resource abundance or the trophic specialization of the consumer. We used flight intercept traps to measure spillover of generalist predators (Vespula wasps, Vespidae) and more specialist predators (106 species of parasitoids, Ichneumonidae and Braconidae) across habitat edges between native New Zealand forest and exotic plantation forest over a summer season. We found net spillover of both generalist and specialist predators from plantation to native forest, and that this was greater for generalists. To test whether natural enemy spillover from managed habitats was related to prey.(caterpillar) abundance (i.e., whether it was bottom-up productivity driven, due to increased primary productivity), we conducted a large-scale herbivore reduction experiment at half of our plantation sites, by helicopter spraying caterpillar-specific insecticide over 2.5 ha per site. We monitored bidirectional natural enemy spillover and found that herbivore reduction reduced generalist but not specialist predator spillover. Trophic generalists may benefit disproportionately from high resource productivity in a habitat, and their cross-habitat spillover effects on natural food webs may be an important source of consumer pressure in mosaic landscapes.","[Frost, Carol M.; Peralta, Guadalupe; Tylianakis, Jason M.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Didham, Raphael K.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Didham, Raphael K.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Ctr Environm & Life Sci, Floreat, WA 6014, Australia; [Rand, Tatyana A.] USDA ARS, Northern Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA; [Tylianakis, Jason M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Frost, CM (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",carol7frost@gmail.com,"Didham, Raphael K/B-5953-2011; Peralta, Guadalupe/AAF-2319-2019",,Marsden FundRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ) [UOC-0802]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Education New Zealand; University of Canterbury; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT100100040]; Rutherford Discovery Fellowship,"We thank Nelson Forests Ltd., Merrill & Ring, Hancock Timber Resource Group, M.

In this multiple trophic level investigation, seed preference experiments were conducted to determine whether five species of passerines (dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis; American tree sparrows, Spizella arborea; song sparrows, Melospiza melodia; chipping sparrows, Spizella pusilla; and house sparrows, Passer domesticus) recognize and preferentially consume noninfected (NI) over infected (I) seeds of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea). We predicted that the birds would refrain from eating I seeds because those seeds contain high concentrations of fungal alkaloids. When given a choice of NI fescue seeds and control seeds (millet), all bird species showed a significant preference for millet. However, individuals of all species consumed some NI seeds. When given a choice of NI and I fescue seeds, all species except the chipping sparrow ate significantly more NI than I fescue seed and the chipping sparrow showed the same trend. Thus, birds were able to distinguish between the two seed types and preferred NI seeds in choice tests. Additional experiments investigated weight changes in dark-eyed juncos fed diets containing different proportions of millet, NI, and I fescue seed. Significant differences in weight loss were observed for the various diets. Juncos showed greater weight loss when the proportion of fescue seed, especially the proportion of I seed, in their diet was greater. The potential significance of the finding that abundant grass seeds are made unavailable to predators by fungal infection is discussed in relation to foraging and competition in avian communities.",,"MADEJ, CW (corresponding author), INDIANA UNIV, DEPT BIOL, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47405 USA.",,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",,,,,68,50,52,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,88,2,,,,,296,302,,10.1007/BF00320825,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GM331,WOS:A1991GM33100022,28312146,,,,2021-09-27,

Many introduced species fail to interact strongly with the recipient biota, whereas others profoundly disrupt the ecosystems they invade through predation, competition, and other mechanisms. In the context of ecological impacts, research on biological invasions seldom considers phenotypic or microevolutionary changes that occur following introduction. Here, we show how plasticity in key life history traits ( colony size and longevity), together with omnivory, magnifies the predatory impacts of an invasive social wasp ( Vespula pensylvanica) on a largely endemic arthropod fauna in Hawaii. Using a combination of molecular, experimental, and behavioral approaches, we demonstrate (i) that yellowjackets consume an astonishing diversity of arthropod resources and depress prey populations in invaded Hawaiian ecosystems and (ii) that their impact as predators in this region increases when they shift from small annual colonies to large perennial colonies. Such trait plasticity may influence invasion success and the degree of disruption that invaded ecosystems experience. Moreover, postintroduction phenotypic changes may help invaders to compensate for reductions in adaptive potential resulting from founder events and small population sizes. The dynamic nature of biological invasions necessitates a more quantitative understanding of how postintroduction changes in invader traits affect invasion processes.","[Wilson, Erin E.; Holway, David A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Mullen, Lynne M.] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, MCZ Labs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Wilson, EE (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, Mail Code 0116,9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",eewilson@ucsd.edu,"Rankin, Erin E.

The present study examines how an indigenous parasitic nematode, Howardula aoronymphium, may affect the structure of mycophagous Drosophila communities in eastern North America. A field-cage experiment demonstrated that the competitive superiority of Drosophila putrida over Drosophila falleni was diminished by the parasites. This probably results from D. putrida being more severely affected than D. falleni by the parasites. Across the eastern United States, the relative abundance of D. putrida is much greater in areas where H. aoronymphium is absent. The geographical distribution of H. aoronymphium appears to be governed largely by temperature, occurring only north of the 27-degrees-C isotherm of mean July temperature. In the laboratory, growth and reproduction of nematodes is arrested at 29-degrees-C, and transmission rates drop to zero at 27-degrees-C and above. Because potential hosts are abundant in the southern United States, the absence of H. aoronymphium from this region is most likely due to its intolerance of high temperature. These results suggest that the physiological ecology of a parasitic nematode contributes to geographical variation in the relative abundance of its host species.",,"JAENIKE, J (corresponding author), UNIV ROCHESTER, DEPT BIOL, ROCHESTER, NY 14627 USA.",,,,,,,45,19,21,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1995,72,2,,,,,235,244,,10.2307/3546226,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QN425,WOS:A1995QN42500009,,,,,2021-09-27,

According to the specialist predator hypothesis, reciprocal interactions between voles and small predators that specialize on voles, such as weasels, can cause multiannual cycles. A fundamental feature of classical weasel-vole models is a long time-lag in the numerical response of the predator to variations in prey abundance: weasel abundance increases with that of voles and peaks approximately 1 yr later. We investigated the numerical response of the common weasel (Mustela nivalis) to fluctuating abundances of common voles (Microtus arvalis) in recently colonized agrosteppes of Castilla-y-Leon, northwestern Spain, at the southern limit of the species' range. Populations of both weasels and voles exhibited multiannual cycles with a 3-yr period. Weasels responded quickly and numerically to changes in common-vole abundance, with a time lag between prey and weasel abundance that did not exceed 4 months and occurred during the breeding season, reflecting the quick conversion of prey into predator offspring and/or immigration to sites with high vole populations. We found no evidence of a sustained, high weasel abundance following vole abundance peaks. Weasel population growth rates showed spatial synchrony across study sites approximately 60 km apart. Weasel dynamics were more synchronized with that of common voles than with other prey species (mice or shrews). However, asynchrony within, as well as among sites, in the abundance of voles and alternative prey suggests that weasel mobility could allow them to avoid starvation during low-vole phases, precluding the emergence of prolonged time lag in the numerical response to voles. Our observations are inconsistent with the specialist predator hypothesis as currently formulated, and suggest that weasels might follow rather than cause the vole cycles in northwestern Spain. The reliance of a specialized predator on a functional group of prey such as small rodents does not necessarily lead to a long delay in the numerical response by the predator, depending on the spatial and interspecific synchrony in prey dynamics.","[Mougeot, Francois] Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Rondo Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; [Lambin, Xavier] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Tillydrone Ave, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth; Romairone, Juan; Luque-Larena, Juan-Jose] Univ Valladolid, Dept Ciencias Agroforestales, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agr, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, E-34004 Palencia, Spain; [Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth; Romairone, Juan; Luque-Larena, Juan-Jose] Inst Univ Invest Gest Forestal Sostenible, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, E-34004 Palencia, Spain","Mougeot, F (corresponding author), Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Rondo Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain.",francois.mougeot@uclm.es,"Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011; Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth/E-7922-2016; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/D-6454-2014; Mougeot, Francois/B-1894-2009","Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653; Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth/0000-0001-8435-6386; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/0000-0001-6425-637X; Mougeot, Francois/0000-0002-5819-6275","project ECOCYCLES (Era-net European project) [EUI2008-03641, EUI2008-03658]; project ECOVOLE [CGL2012-35348]; project ECOTULA [CGL2015-66962-C2-1-R]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G002045/1]","This work was funded through the projects ECOCYCLES (BIODIVERSA 2008, Era-net European project, EUI2008-03641 and EUI2008-03658), ECOVOLE (CGL2012-35348), and ECOTULA (CGL2015-66962-C2-1-R; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain), and by NERC NE/G002045/1 to XL.

However, its consequences for species diversity and community organization depend on several intrinsic properties of predators and prey. To evaluate how predators of different sizes affect the organization of sessile communities during their development, we deployed an experiment in which PVC plates were assigned to one of four predation exclusion treatments: partial exclusion cage (2.4 cm mesh), total exclusion cage (0.5 cm mesh), and two respective controls. We evaluated community richness and structure after 30, 90, and 150 days. Regardless of size, predation did not affect total species richness. After 30 days, communities on plates protected against all predators had less free space than any other treatments, but their structure was similar to those protected to large predators only. Therefore, the addition of predators smaller than 2.4 cm to the pool of consumers may intensify predation effects rather than change species dominance and composition. After 90 days, intensified consumption by smaller predators had no longer measurable effects. Our data suggest that the removal of dominant species by predation does not increase species richness but modulates the interaction among species. The removal of ascidians seems to facilitate the dominance of predator-resistant bryozoans.","[Oricchio, Felipe T.; Dias, Gustavo M.] Univ Fed ABC, Ctr Ciencias Nat & Humanas, Rua Arcturus 03 Jd Antares, BR-09606070 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil; [Oricchio, Felipe T.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo UNIFESP, Rua Prof Artur Riedel,275 Jd Eldorado, BR-09972270 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Flores, Augusto A.

Variation in predation risk and resource availability may influence the occurrence and fitness effects of aggregating in nature. Yet tests of such possibilities are lacking. Cavity-nesting birds provide an interesting test case. They compete aggressively for resources and experience low nest predation rates, which might predict dispersion, but across 19 years of study we found that they commonly aggregate by sharing nest trees. Tree sharing was more common when aspen were more abundant and was somewhat more common in years with higher nest predation risk. Nest success was higher in shared trees when nest predation risk was higher than average. Ultimately, the costs and benefits of aggregating (nest tree sharing) varied across years, and we outline hypotheses for future studies.","[Mouton, James C.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Martin, Thomas E.] Univ Montana, US Geol Survey, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Mouton, JC (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",james@moutons.org,"Mouton, James/AAZ-1466-2021; Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1701672, DEB-0841764, DEB-1241041, IOS-1349178]","We appreciate helpful comments from two anonymous reviewers and our laboratory on the manuscript.

The study was based on 199 samples (50 cm x 50 cm quadrats) distributed along transects placed perpendicular to the shore at 6 locations. Some 315 species of macrobenthos (> 1 mm) were identified. Community structure varied markedly with the depth gradient but less so with the estuarine gradient (20-28 parts per thousand). Generally, the density of organisms decreased moving up the Estuary ((x) over bar approximate to 300 individuals 0.25 m(-2) near the mouth, 175 ind. 0.25 m(-2) on intermediate transects, and 65 ind. 0.25 m(-2) at the most brackish sites). Invertebrate biomass did not show a corresponding decrease along the estuarine gradient. No consistent effect of the estuarine gradient on invertebrate diversity was observed. Macroalgal diversity and biomass varied in an irregular pattern along the estuarine gradient. There was an important effect of depth on invertebrate densities (decreasing with increasing depth), no significant changes in biomass, and lower diversity at shallowest depths. Macroalgal biomass and diversity decreased with depth. Relationships among feeding guilds (predators, filter feeders, grazers) and their effect on overall diversity in the system suggested that (1) predators limit the maximum biomass of filter feeders and grazers and this effect is proportionately greater as the biomass of predators increases, (2) high filter feeder and grazer biomass slightly reduce the biomass of one another, (3) increasing pressure from consumers has little effect on invertebrate diversity (H') except that at high consumer biomass variability in diversity is less, and (4) high grazer biomass limits macroalgal biomass and diversity.","[Bourget, Edwin; Lapointe, Louise; Himmelman, John H.; Cardinal, Andre] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, GIROQ, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Bourget, E (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, GIROQ, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,,,"ministere de l'Agriculture, des Pecheries et de l'Alimentation du Quebec; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); FCAR","We would like to thank S.

Within a species' preferred habitat, the structural complexity and resource availability of adjacent habitats may influence the effect of edges on ecological processes. In nearshore waters of New England, American lobsters (Homarus americanus) inhabit fragmented cobble reefs that often are bordered by unvegetated sediment and occasionally by seagrass. We determined whether proximity to cobble patch edges, microhabitat characteristics within cobble habitat, and the type of habitat adjacent to cobble patches (seagrass or unvegetated sediment) influence the density and survival of juvenile and adult American lobsters in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. We surveyed naturally occurring cobble patches and artificial cobble reefs to determine how the odds of finding lobsters varied with distance from the edge and habitat type. Additionally, we tethered lobsters at different distances from the edge inside and outside of cobble patches to determine how lobster relative survival varied with edge proximity and habitat type. In cobble habitat, the odds of finding large lobsters (adolescents and adults > 40 mm carapace length (CL)) were highest near patch edges regardless of adjacent habitat type, whereas smaller lobsters (e.g. emergent juveniles 15-25 mm CL) were more abundant in patch interiors when seagrass bordered cobble patches. The odds of finding lobsters also increased with the relative amount of cobble cover within patches. In predation experiments, lobster relative survival after 6 h was lowest outside of cobble and increased toward cobble patch interiors, but after 24 h this trend disappeared or reversed. Seagrass appeared to offer greater refuge for lobsters than did unvegetated sediment. Our results suggest that proximity to patch edges influences lobster distribution and survival, and that edge effects on lobsters vary with life history phase and with the type of habitat adjacent to cobble patches.

We conducted a 10-month manipulative experiment in primary and secondary rainforests. In each forest type, a 625 m2 treatment plot was isolated from the surrounding forest and 135 bait stations treated with fipronil, S-methoprene, and hydramethylnon were placed in trees to suppress ants. Ant activity was monitored in the forest canopy and understorey with an additional 65 stations in treatment and control plots. 3. We achieved a dramatic decline in ant abundance in treatment plots compared with controls in both forest types, with an average decrease in ant numbers per station of 82.4% in primary and 91.2% in secondary forest. In particular, native dominant species Oecophylla smaragdina, Anonychomyrma cf. scrutator in primary forest, and invasive Anoplolepis gracilipes in secondary forest were greatly affected. In contrast, Tapinoma melanocephalum flourished in treatment plots, perhaps benefiting from reduced competition from other ant species. 4. Our study demonstrates that it is possible to selectively eradicate most of the foraging ants in a structurally complex tropical forest. We propose whole-forest manipulation as a novel tool for studying the role of ants in shaping plant-insect food webs.","[Klimes, Petr; Janda, Milan; Novotny, Vojtech] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Ctr Biol, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Klimes, Petr; Janda, Milan; Novotny, Vojtech] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Janda, Milan] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ibalim, Sentiko; Kua, Joseph; Novotny, Vojtech] New Guinea Binatang Res Ctr, Madang, Papua N Guinea","Klimes, P (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Ctr Biol, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, Branisovska 31, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",klimes@entu.cas.cz,"Janda, Milan/H-7216-2014; Novotny, Vojtech/G-9434-2014; Klimes, Petr/G-6823-2014","Janda, Milan/0000-0003-3038-0107; Novotny, Vojtech/0000-0001-7918-8023; Klimes, Petr/0000-0002-6561-4455","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0841885, DEB-0816749]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [IAA600960712, KJB612230701]; Czech Ministry of EducationMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LC06073, ME09082, MSM6007665801]; Czech Grant AgencyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [206/08/H044, 206/09/0115, P505/10/0673]; Grant Agency of University of South Bohemia [052/2010/P, 136/2010/P]; J.

A commercial dredging track was identified and an analysis of the species composition inside the track and at an adjacent control area showed that dredging changed the community structure by reducing the density of polychaetes. In order to investigate the extent and the duration of the dredging impact experimental dredging was conducted. The experimental dredging removed 50% of the mussels in two dredged areas. Immediately after dredging, a significantly lower number of species was measured inside the mussel beds in dredged areas compared to control and boundary areas. This effect lasted for at least 40 days. The analysis of the species composition showed that the dredged area had a significantly lower density, particularly of polychaetes compared to the boundary area. An increased number of species was recorded outside the mussel beds just after dredging, but this effect lasted for less than 7 days. After dredging, brown shrimps, C. crangon invaded the dredged areas. This species is an important predator of smaller invertebrates, and it is suspected that it was feeding on small vulnerable polychaetes exposed at the sediment surface after dredging. The dredging process was observed to form 2-5-cm deep furrows in the seabed, but the sediment texture and the organic content of the sediment was not affected. The biomass accumulation of individual blue mussels was significantly lower in the dredged area compared to the boundary area. This indicates that the disturbance of the mussel bed structure reduced growth and that the lowering of intraspecific food competition caused by a reduced density of mussels did not increase the accumulation of biomass in the mussels which remained in the dredged area.","Danish Inst Fisheries Res, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark","Dolmer, P (corresponding author), Danish Inst Fisheries Res, Charlottenlund Castle, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark.",pdo@dfu.min.dk,,,,,,48,17,21,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,DEC,2001,465,1-3,,,,,115,127,,10.1023/A:1014549026157,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,530JF,WOS:000174354000012,,,,,2021-09-27,

On Prosecco, densities of Amblyseius andersoni, and to a lesser extent of Typhlodromus pyri increased when downy mildew symptoms occurred on a high number of leaves. On Pinot, A. andersoni was the dominant species and its densities markedly increased when downy mildew spread. A. andersoni populations were significantly larger on leaves with downy mildew symptoms than on leaves without symptoms and their densities were positively correlated to the extent of leaf surface showing symptoms. The effect of downy mildew on T pyri populations was less marked. There were no relationships between downy mildew spread and spider mite abundance (Panonychus ulmi). Untreated plots or plots treated with folpet to control downy mildew were monitored in an experimental vineyard colonized by A. andersoni. A. andersoni populations increased when downy mildew symptoms spread and their densities were significantly higher in the control than on folpet plots. In another experimental vineyard, T pyri densities were significantly higher in the control (severely infected by downy mildew) than on copper hydroxide plots. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF) was employed to detect downy mildew in mites and glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) was selected from among different enzymes. A stain corresponding to downy mildew in addition to the phytoseiid intrinsic stains was detected in a high proportion of A. andersoni and T pyri collected from infected leaves. Downy mildew stains were not detected in P. ulmi females collected from infected leaves. Most A. andersoni and T pyri females confined on symptomatic leaves became positive to IEF a few hours later.

Field observations showed that non-conspecific fishes that intruded were either attacked, ignored, or actively avoided. Food competitors and small piscivores were attacked by male razorfish. Razorfish PA behaviors varied among three habitats with different substratum compositions, suggesting that these fish possess phenotypic plasticity for PA behavior. In a rocky-rubble habitat, razorfish dove into the coarse sand for PA, but most sand dives observed there were to soften a small site for future PA. In a sandbed habitat, they hid among coral branches and dove into the sand when attacked; few maintenance dives were observed as soft sand was widespread. In a seagrass habitat, they hid among blades of grass for PA, and dove into the sand less frequently than at the other sites. Some female razorfish that were transferred among habitats adopted PA behaviors similar to those of females in the new site, while others did not, suggesting that behavioral plasticity is not universal in this species. Razorfish spawned lower in the water column in the presence of natural predators and a predator model, than when these were absent. When the predator model was introduced into a male's territory during spawning periods, there was a reduction in his courtship rate, but not in the number of spawns he achieved. Predation pressure may reduce males' long-term fitness by causing decreased courtship rates which can facilitate sex change in harem females.","SUNY STONY BROOK,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT,STONY BROOK,NY 11794",,,,,,,,56,12,12,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

We worked with a model insect community consisting of two species of aphid feeding on different host plants (Acyrthosiphon pisum on Vicia and Sitobion avenae on Triticum), a parasitoid (Aphidius ervi) that attacks both species, and a dominant intraguild predator (Coccinella septempunctata) that also feeds on both aphids (whether parasitized or not). As reported previously, we found A. ervi avoided chemical traces of C. septempunctata. In population cages in the laboratory, application of C. septempunctata extracts to Vicia plants reduced parasitism on A. pisum. This did not increase parasitism on the other aphid species, our predicted short-term trait-mediated effect. However, a longer term multigenerational consequence of intraguild predator avoidance was observed. In cages where extracts were applied in the first generation of the study, parasitoid recruitment was reduced leading to higher population densities of both aphid species. S. avenae thus benefits from the presence of a dominant intraguild predator foraging on another species of aphid (A. pisum) on a different food plant, a long-term, trait-mediated example of apparent mutualism. The mechanism underlying this effect is hypothesized to be the reduced searching efficiency of a shared parasitoid in the presence of cues associated with the dominant predator.","[Frago, Enric; Godfray, H.

In order to determine the effect of the 2 groups on dung removal rate, as well as the associated mechanisms, we conducted a two-factor, two-level factorial-designed experiment in an alpine meadow of eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Four treatments were included: (A) flies excluded, beetles included; (B) beetles excluded, flies included; (C) both flies and beetles excluded; and (D) both flies and beetles included, each having 45 replicates of artificial dung pats (17 cm in diameter; ca. 248 g in dry weight). We examined dung quality, removal rates, and abundance and biomass of macro-soil faunas within the dung 9 times (5 replicates sampled each time) during the experimental period of 32 d. Both beetles and flies (maggots), as well as the interaction between the 2 groups, markedly affected the dung removal rates. The total dry weight loss of the dung during the experiment was 167.6 g and 127.5 g on average for the beetle and fly groups, respectively. The removal rate in terms of both dung weight and organic matter loss was significantly greater for the beetles than the flies, which was principally because the consumption rate was lower and the resident time was shorter for fly maggots than for the beetles. The coexistence of the 2 species increased dung removal synergistically on the first sampling day and additively between the 2(nd) and the 5(th) day. However, after the 8(th) day of the experiment, the coexistence effect was negative, such that the dung loss of treatment D was comparable to treatment A but significantly greater than treatment B. The synergistic control might be due to the mediating effect of predator beetles on the relative abundance of coprophagous beetles and maggots, and the negative effect of the functional group diversity was because of the overwhelming competitive advantage of the beetles over fly maggots. In conclusion, although both fly and beetle species may significantly contribute to dung removal, the effect of the interaction between flies and beetles appears to depend on dung age (the sampling timing) in the alpine meadow.","[Wu, Xinwei; Sun, Shucun] Chinese Acad Sci, ECORES Lab, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Sun, Shucun] Nanjing Univ, Dept Biol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China","Sun, SC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, ECORES Lab, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",shcs@nju.edu.cn,,,Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-XB2-02]; Chinese Ministry of Sciences and Technology [2008CB418201]; ECORES lab of Sichuan Province,"We thank C.

Females of the butterfly lay their eggs on the newly opened flower heads of Cardamine and the larvae feed on the developing seed pods. They are extremely selective in their choice of plant for egg laying, choosing mainly large Bower heads growing in open sunny locations. Larval survival is greatly reduced if the flower head is more than 8 days old at the time of egg laying, because the seed pods become too tough for feeding. Earlier studies showed that only one larva can survive on a flower head, because larvae are cannibalistic, but females tend to avoid plants carrying more than one egg, in response to an oviposition-deterring pheromone laid down at the time of egg laying. The numbers of flower heads of Cardamine fluctuate enormously between years, and the numbers of eggs follow these closely. There is a strong correlation between number of eggs laid and the availability of suitable Bower heads, and this correlation was shown to be real and causal by the experimental provision of extra flower heads, which resulted in more eggs, laid over an extended period of oviposition. The main causes of mortality of the butterfly's young stages were egg infertility, cannibalism, predation, starvation, the grazing of flower heads by deer, and possibly the failure of the newly hatched larvae to feed adequately. Adult numbers were only weakly correlated with the numbers of young stages in the wood, and there appears to be a considerable amount of movement by the butterfly through the wood and surrounding farmland.",,"Dempster, JP (corresponding author), THE LIMES,GREEN,HUNTINGDON PE18 9NA,CAMBS,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,18,42,43,0,30,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1997,111,4,,,,,549,556,,10.1007/s004420050270,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XR381,WOS:A1997XR38100014,28308117,,,,2021-09-27,

Using bioenergetics simulations, we demonstrated the overall importance of galaxiids and decapods to the energy budgets of nonnative salmonids and Creole Perch. Introduced salmonids, especially Rainbow Trout, exerted considerably heavier predatory demands on shared resources than did the native Creole Perch on both a per capita basis and in terms of relative population impacts. Rainbow Trout consumed higher quantities and a wider size range of Small Puyen (also known as Inanga) Galaxias maculatus than the other predators, including early pelagic life stages of that prey; as such, this represents an additional source of mortality for the vulnerable early life stages of Small Puyen before and during their transition from pelagic to benthic habitats. All predators were generally feeding at high feeding rates (above 40% of their maximum physiological rates), suggesting that competition for prey does not currently limit either Creole Perch or the salmonids in this lake. This study highlights the importance of keystone prey for the coexistence of native species with nonnative top predators. It provides new quantitative and qualitative evidence of the high predation pressure exerted on Small Puyen, the keystone prey species, during the larval to juvenile transition from pelagic to littoral-benthic habitat in Patagonian lakes. This study also emphasizes the importance of monitoring salmonid and Creole Perch population dynamics in order to detect signs of potential impacts through competition and shows the need to carefully consider the rationale behind any additional trout stocking.

We explored whether predator attacks on artificial prey of eight different colors vary among climates and whether this variation affects the detection of latitudinal patterns in predation. Bird attack rates negatively correlated with model luminance in cold and temperate environments, but not in tropical environments. Bird predation on black and on white (extremes in luminance) models demonstrated different latitudinal patterns, presumably due to differences in prey conspicuousness between habitats with different light regimes. When attacks on models of all colors were combined, arthropod predation decreased, whereas bird predation increased with increasing latitude. We conclude that selection for prey coloration may vary geographically and according to predator identity, and that the importance of different predators may show contrasting patterns, thus weakening the overall latitudinal trend in top-down control of herbivorous insects.","[Zvereva, Elena L.; Klemola, Tero; Zverev, Vitali; Kozlov, Mikhail V.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Castagneyrol, Bastien] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, BIOGECO, Cestas, France; [Cornelissen, Tatiana] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Genet Ecol & Evolucao, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Forsman, Anders] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Kalmar, Sweden; [Hernandez-Agueero, Juan Antonio; Polo, Vicente] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Phys & Inorgan Chem, Mostoles, Spain; [Paolucci, Lucas] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Setor Ecol & Conservacao, Lavras, Brazil; [Paolucci, Lucas] Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Paolucci, Lucas] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Geral, Campus Univ, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Salinas, Norma] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Inst Ciencias Naturaleza Terr & Energia Renovable, Lima, Peru; [Theron, Kasselman Jurie] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Matieland, South Africa; [Xu, Guorui] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun, Peoples R China","Zvereva, EL (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",elezve@utu.fi,"Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014; Hernandez-Aguero, Juan Antonio/AAF-7041-2021; Paolucci, Lucas/G-5247-2010; Salinas, Norma/K-8960-2015; Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013; Cornelissen, Tatiana G/J-9483-2015; Forsman, Anders/G-8778-2012","Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X; Hernandez-Aguero, Juan Antonio/0000-0001-6584-5774; Paolucci, Lucas/0000-0001-6403-5200; Salinas, Norma/0000-0001-9941-2109; Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244; Cornelissen, Tatiana G/0000-0002-2721-7010; Theron, Kasselman Jurie/0000-0003-0739-8720; Forsman, Anders/0000-0001-9598-7618","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [311929, 316182]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [PCIN-2016-150]; Community of MadridComunidad de Madrid [PEJD-2017-PRE/AMB-3669]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [2017XTBG-T01]; West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences; Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [3072102016-2]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel SuperiorCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); PELD/CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [441703/2016-0]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion del Peru [107-2016-FONDECYT-ERANet-LAC]; Linnaeus University","Academy of Finland, Grant/Award Number: 311929 and 316182; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: PCIN-2016-150; Community of Madrid, Grant/Award Number: PEJD-2017-PRE/AMB-3669; Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 2017XTBG-T01; West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa CNPq, Grant/Award Number: 3072102016-2; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior; PELD/CNPq, Grant/Award Number: 441703/2016-0; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion del Peru, Grant/Award Number: 107-2016-FONDECYT-ERANet-LAC; Linnaeus University",,58,11,11,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Environment changed dramatically through the first 200 yr of succession. Soil organic matter increased 10-fold in the upper mineral soil with corresponding increases in soil moisture, total nitrogen (N), and capacity to support plant growth and declines in bulk density, pH, and total phosphorus (P). Plant growth in pioneer soils tended to be simultaneously limited by both N and P, as well as by unknown factors (perhaps lack of mycorrhizae), whereas only P limited growth in older soils. Light availability to seedlings declined through succession. Early-successional species (Epilobium latifolium, Dryas drummondii) had smaller seeds, younger age at first reproduction, shorter life-span, and shorter height at maturity than did mid-successional (alder, Alnus sinuata) and late-successional species (sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis). Seed rain of alder and spruce was negligible in the pioneer stage, increased prior to the stage in which a species was dominant, and was greatest in the stage in which a species dominated. Vegetation in each successional stage inhibited germination and initial establishment of sown alder and spruce seeds (except a tendency of the ''black-crust'' algal/microbial community in the pioneer stage to enhance survivorship). Removal of the surface litter layer generally enhanced germination and survivorship, particularly of alder. Comparisons of germination in the greenhouse and the field indicated that climatic or indirect vegetation effects (e.g., differential seed predation) and allelopathy also reduced germination and establishment in vegetated communities. Naturally occurring spruce seedlings grew most rapidly in the Dryas and alder stages and most slowly in the spruce stage. Similarly, growth of spruce seedlings transplanted into each successional stage was facilitated by the Dryas (nonsignificantly) and alder stages but inhibited by the spruce stage, relative to earlier successional stages. Facilitation of growth of natural and transplanted spruce seedlings by Dryas and alder stages was associated with higher N and P uptake and tissue nutrient concentrations, whereas nutrient uptake and concentration in spruce seedlings declined in the spruce stage. By contrast, transplanted alder seedlings grew rapidly and accumulated most nutrients in the pioneer stage and were strongly inhibited by subsequent stages. The facilitative effect of Dryas and alder comes primarily from inputs of organic matter and associated N. Addition of alder litter stimulated nutrient uptake and growth of transplanted spruce seedlings in the pioneer and Dryas stages, whereas shading had no effect on growth of spruce seedlings. Root trenching and planting of spruce near isolated alders indicated that, although the net effect of alder is facilitative, alder also inhibits growth of spruce seedlings through competition for soil resources. Strong root competition also occurs in the spruce stage. Alder competitively inhibits Dryas, primarily by shading but also through the physical and allelopathic effects of its litter. In general, both at Glacier Bay and elsewhere, life history traits determine the pattern of succession. Changes in competitive balance accompanying successional changes in environment provide the mechanism for changes in species dominance. Initial site conditions (and facilitation, where present) influence the rate of change and final state of community composition and productivity. We conclude that no single factor or mechanism fully accounts for primary succession at Glacier Bay.","UNIV NEVADA, DEPT BIOL SCI, LAS VEGAS, NV 89154 USA; UNIV ALASKA, INST ARCTIC BIOL, FAIRBANKS, AK 99775 USA; UNIV ALASKA, INST MARINE SCI, FAIRBANKS, AK 99775 USA","CHAPIN, FS (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.",,"Chapin, F Stuart/AAZ-3931-2020","Chapin, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910",,,,115,690,716,10,430,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

The strategies permitting this property are delineated and called viable strategies. All solutions starting outside the viability kernel lead to too low densities or extinction. The viability approach highlights the timing of strategy changes necessary for a system to perpetuate itself or alternatively to lead one species to extinction. The study of the dependence of the viability kernel on the admissible sets of strategies reveals the minimal flexibilities necessary for the existence of the system. The shape of the viability kernel determines whether the exogenous addition or substraction of prey or predator will endanger the system or not, thus gathering different experiments with opposite results. The comparison of the coexistence kernel with viability kernels for one, two or three species points out the importance of repeated strategies, not necessarily in a periodic manner, thus emphasizing the concept of repetitions in ecosystems instead of cycles as a key feature of coexistence.

The species appears to be anholocyclic, persisting viviparously throughout the year on its deciduous host tree, the lowland ribbonwood (Plagianthus regius). Local aphid abundance increased rapidly in spring as new leaves appeared, but collapsed abruptly in November, probably due to dispersal and a decline in resource quality. Numbers then remained low until leaf senescence in late autumn, when they increased again to a smaller peak. Aphids persisted on plump terminal buds for the short time in winter when host trees were completely leafless. Though several colonisation events were observed in late spring, these were generally unsuccessful in establishing new populations, and local colony extinction was common.

Common Eiders increased tremendously between 1982 and 1988. The vigorous enforcement program carried out by Parks Canada in Betchouane Bird Sanctuary and by the Canadian Wildlife Service in the Iles Sainte-Marie Bird Sanctuary may explain this spectacular comeback. The high rate of yearly increase of this species supports an immigration hypothesis. Although the gull population also grew, their rate of increase was lower those that of other species. Alcids, which represent 58% of the nesting birds, continued to increase, as they have done since 1977. Two factors may account for the improvement: a better conservation program, of which enforcement and education are the two main components, and the exploitation of large predatory fish competitors by fisheries, which made more small prey fish (Capelin and sand lace) available for seabirds. However, the abundant Capelin stocks have now become attractive to the fisheries, and their imminent exploitation may augur a leaner future for the alcids.",,"CHAPDELAINE, G (corresponding author), SERV CANADIEN FAUNE,CP 10100,ST FOY G1V 4H5,QUEBEC,CANADA.",,,,,,,0,7,9,0,1,OTTAWA FIELD-NATURALISTS CLUB,OTTAWA,"BOX 3264 POSTAL STATION C, OTTAWA ON K1Y 4J5, CANADA",0008-3550,,,CAN FIELD NAT,Can.

How do nitrogen-fixing pioneer species (Lupinus lepidus and Alnus viridis) affect conifer emergence and establishment? Location: Mount St. Helens, Washington State, USA. Methods: We planted seeds of Pseudotsuga menziesii in four habitat types - barrens, young and old Lupinus patches and Alnus thickets - in a partial factorial cross with shade and soil disturbance treatments in 2002, 2003 and 2004, and monitored survival through 2006. We compared experimental results with surveys of natural establishment in 2007 and 2010. Results: Pseudotsuga menziesii emergence and survival were highest in barren and young Lupinus sites and low in old Lupinus and Alnus patches, but varied greatly among cohorts. In barrens, nearly 50% of germinated seedlings of the 2002 cohort survived year 1 and 25% through year 4, compared to 10% (year 1) and similar to 0% (to year 4) survival in other habitats. Survival rates were lower in subsequent cohorts. Emergence and establishment were enhanced by shade and initial soil disturbance in barren sites and young Lupinus patches. Soil moisture was higher in barren and young Lupinus habitats. Post-experiment surveys indicated older trees were six times more abundant on sites with old Lupinus patches and Alnus thickets, consistent with earlier colonization at those sites driven by seed availability, but total tree density increased more rapidly in sites with barren and young Lupinus habitats, surpassing older sites by 2010, as predicted from experimental results. Conclusion: Increased seedling survival in barren and young Lupinus sites and under shade was attributable to decreased competition for soil moisture in those sites, possibly combined with apparent competition in old Lupinus and Alnus sites via seed and seedling predators. Overall, high emergence and survival rates in low-density habitats suggest that P. menziesii colonization is strongly propagule limited, and that survival of seeds that successfully arrive and germinate is more strongly affected by competition in early succession than by soil N. This conclusion is supported by evidence for decreased recruitment over time in old Lupinus patches and Alnus thickets and accelerating recruitment in areas with less developed vegetation.","[Titus, Jonathan H.] SUNY Coll Fredonia, Dept Biol, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA; [Bishop, John G.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA","Titus, JH (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Fredonia, Dept Biol, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA.",titus@fredonia.edu; bishopj@vancouver.wsu.edu,,,"US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0089843, DEB-0614263]; Holmberg Fellowships; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1257360] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","P.

We hypothesised that vegetation cover would provide habitat for ground fauna. We also hypothesised that rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) would reduce the abundance of these fauna by reducing vegetation, and by providing prey for mammalian predators (cats Felis catus and ferrets Mustela putorius) that Consume ground fauna as secondary prey. We measured these variables at 30 sites across three pastoral properties in the South Island in 1996 and 2002. There were mostly positive relationships between vegetation ground cover and fauna captures in pitfall traps. Relatively few beetles and caterpillars were caught where cover was less than 80%, no millipedes were caught where cover was less than 70%, and few spiders and mostly no skinks, crickets, flies or slugs were caught where vegetation cover was less than 50%. Most grasshoppers were caught where cover ranged from 30 to 80%. Faunal species richness was also positively related to cover. This supports our hypothesis that ground vegetation provides habitat for skinks and invertebrates in this ecosystem. The introduction of rabbit haemorrhagic disease in 1997 provided a natural experiment to test the hypothesised indirect effects of rabbits oil ground fauna. Declines in rabbits varied between properties, and vegetation cover and predator abundance changed according to the magnitude of these declines. However, skink and invertebrate abundance did not track these changes as expected, but instead varied more or less consistently between properties. Some fauna increased (skink captures quadrupled and cricket captures nearly doubled), others declined (flies, caterpillars and spiders), and some did not change (beetles, Millipedes, slugs and grasshoppers, and faunal species richness and diversity). Therefore, rabbits, predators and vegetation did not affect changes in skinks and invertebrates in consistent ways. The dynamics of ground fauna are likely to be more influenced by factors other than those we measured.","[Norbury, Grant; Heyward, Richard] Landcare Res, Alexandra 9340, New Zealand; [Parkes, John] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand","Norbury, G (corresponding author), Landcare Res, POB 282, Alexandra 9340, New Zealand.",norburyg@landcareresearch.co.nz,,,"Foundation for Research, Science and TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology","We thank Roger Gibson, Dale Norbury, and Beth Apsel for assistance with fieldwork; Warren Chinn for assistance with identifying invertebrates; the Perriam, Campbell and Urquhart families for hosting the research on Bendigo, Earnscleugh and Grays Hills stations, respectively; the Department of Conservation for permission to collect protected wildlife (permits Wil 00/01:6 and CO 02/01); Roger Pech,Andrea Byrom, Tony Sinclair, James Reardon, Chris Jones, Rob Wardle, Bill Lee, Graham Nugent, Richard Toft and James Smith for commenting on the manuscript; Guy Forrester for statistical advice; and the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology for funding the work.",,30,14,14,0,37,NEW ZEALAND ECOL SOC,CHRISTCHURCH,"PO BOX 25178, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND",0110-6465,1177-7788,,NEW ZEAL J ECOL,N.

At the start of the research program, a number of general recruitment hypotheses were formulated, i.e. focusing on (1) predation, (2) food availability, (3) physical parameters, (4) the impact of current systems, and finally (5) the importance of top-clown vs bottom-up effects. The present study synthesizes the results of field sampling (2002 and 2003), laboratory experiments, and modeling studies to re-evaluate these hypotheses for the Baltic sprat stock. Recruitment success was quite different in the 2 years investigated. Despite a lower spawning stock biomass in 2003, the total number of recruits was almost 2-fold higher that year compared to 2002. The higher recruitment success in 2003 could be attributed to enhanced survival success during the post-larval/juvenile stage, a life phase that appears to be critical for recruitment dynamics. In the state of the Baltic ecosystem during the period of investigation, we consider bottom-up control (e.g. temperature, prey abundance) to be more important than top-down control (predation mortality). This ranking in importance does not vary seasonally. Prevailing water circulation patterns and the transport dynamics of larval cohorts have a strong influence on sprat recruitment success. Pronounced transport to coastal areas is detrimental for year-class strength particularly at high sprat stock sizes. A suggested mechanism is density-dependant regulation of survival via intra- and inter-specific competition for prey in coastal areas. A documented change in larval vertical migration behavior between the early 1990s and early 2000s increased the transport potential to the coast, strengthening the coupling between inter-annual differences in the magnitude and direction of wind-driven surface currents and year-to-year changes in reproductive success. However, due to the strong linkages and feed-back loops in the Baltic Sea food web, the most robust projections of the future strength of the Baltic sprat stock will need to take into account climate-driven changes in both abiotic (e.g., drift trajectories) and biotic (trophodynamic) factors. Although our understanding of processes affecting pre-recruit (larval) growth and survival has been advanced by the integrated research conducted within the GLOBEC Germany program, key mechanisms potentially affecting life stages outside of the spawning basins remain to be explored including the dynamics of coastal habitats of juveniles and the feeding and overwintering grounds of adults.

Its life cycle and ecological impacts were studied on two islands 11 yr after it was first discovered. This invasive wasp adapted quickly and was found in most environments. Colony counts and adult wasp monitoring showed a strong preference for drier habitats. Nest activities were seasonally synchronized, nest building followed the rains in the hot season (typically January-May), when insect prey increases, and peaked as temperature and rains started to decline. Next, the number of adult wasps peaked during the cool season when there is barely any rain in the drier zones. In Galapagos, almost half of the prey loads of P. versicolor were lepidopteran larvae, but wasps also carried spiders, beetles, and flies back to the colonies. An estimated average of 329 mg of fresh insect prey was consumed per day for an average colony of 120-150 wasp larvae. The wasps preyed upon native and introduced insects, but likely also affect insectivorous vertebrates as competitors for food. Wasps may also compete with native pollinators as they regularly visited flowers to collect nectar, and have been recorded visiting at least 93 plant species in Galapagos, including 66 endemic and native plants. Colonies were attacked by a predatory moth, Taygete sphecophila (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Autostichidae), but colony development was not arrested. High wasp numbers also affect the activities of residents and tourists. A management program for this invasive species in the archipelago is essential.","[Parent, Christine E.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, 875 Perimeter MS 3051, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Parent, Christine E.] Univ Idaho, Inst Bioinformat & Evolutionary Studies, 875 Perimeter MS 3051, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Peck, Stewart B.] Canadian Museum Nat, Res & Collect Div, Dept Entomol, POB 3443, Ottawa, ON K1P 6P4, Canada; [Causton, Charlotte E.; Roque-Albelo, Lazaro] Charles Darwin Fdn, Charles Darwin Res Stn, Santa Cruz Isl, Galapagos Islan, Ecuador; [Lester, Philip J.; Bulgarella, Mariana] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","Bulgarella, M (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",mariana.bulgarella@vuw.ac.nz,"Lester, Phil/A-1296-2008; Bulgarella, Mariana/C-2760-2008","Lester, Phil/0000-0002-1801-5687; Parent, Christine/0000-0002-4378-6715; Bulgarella, Mariana/0000-0002-7582-8529",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Canadian International Development Agency; Galapagos Conservancy; Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic Fund; British Embassy,"Our special thanks go to the Galapagos National Park Directorate for issuing investigation permits and for field and logistical support.

We used high-resolution GPS/IMU inertial measurement unit) collars to record position, activity and the first high-speed movement data on four male leopards in the Okavango Delta, an area with high habitat diversity and habitat fragmentation. Leopards in this study were generally active and conducted more runs during the night, with peaks in activity and number of runs in the morning and evening twilight. Runs were generally short (less than 100 m) and relatively slow (maximum speed 5.3 ms(-1), mean of individual medians) compared to other large predators. Average daily travel distance was 11 km and maximum daily travel distance was 2 km. No direct correlation was found between average daily temperature and travel distance or between season and travel distance. Total daily energy requirements based on locomotor cost and basal metabolic rate varied little between individuals and over time. This study provides novel insights into movement patterns and athletic performance of leopards through quantitative high-resolution measurement of the locomotor, energetic, spatial and temporal movement characteristics.

We evaluated the interaction between avian frugivores and the masting shrub Pistacia lentiscus in both connected and isolated forest fragments along the Guadalquivir valley (south Iberian Peninsula) in two contrasting fruiting seasons (mast and non-mast). We compared the abundance and composition of avian dispersers and seed predators, recorded fruit removal rates by dispersers and predators, and investigated potential changes in the arrival of seeds to forest fragments. Our results showed that there was a greater abundance of dispersers in connected than in isolated fragments in the mast season (i.e. high fruit availability) but the opposite pattern in the non-mast season (i.e. low fruit availability). The effects of habitat fragmentation were more noticeable on medium-sized than small bird dispersers. Medium-sized birds were more abundant in isolated forest fragments but their abundance was highly dependent on the season, while small bird dispersers were apparently unaffected by fragmentation. Seed removal rates were higher in isolated than in connected fragments in the mast season but not in the non-mast season; predation rates were negligible in both seasons. Seed arrival was consistent between seasons and microhabitat where the dispersed seeds were deposited, most seeds being dispersed under the canopy of female Pistacia plants. We highlight the influence of the interplay between seasonality and landscape configuration on patterns of frugivore-mediated seed dispersal. Thus, despite its direct link to plant-frugivore interaction, the effects of habitat fragmentation on frugivores and plants were decoupled in our study system. These decoupled responses seemed to be chiefly due to the high feeding dependence of dispersers on P. lentiscus fruits.","[Parejo-Farnes, Clara; Aparicio, Abelardo; Albaladejo, Rafael G.] Univ Seville, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ecol, C Prof Garcia Gonzalez 2, Seville 41012, Spain; [Parejo-Farnes, Clara; Aguilar, Ramiro] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, CC 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Herrera, Jose M.] CSIC, EBD, Avda Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Herrera, Jose M.] Univ Evora, Mediterranean Inst Agr Environm & Dev MED, P-7000651 Evora, Portugal","Parejo-Farnes, C (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ecol, C Prof Garcia Gonzalez 2, Seville 41012, Spain.",cparejo@us.es,"Albaladejo, Rafael G/K-2204-2014; Herrera, Jose M./L-7432-2013","Albaladejo, Rafael G/0000-0003-2101-5204; Herrera, Jose M./0000-0001-7968-3438; Parejo - Farnes, Clara/0000-0003-2974-8584","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2011-23721]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2012-055103]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [FPDI-2013-16335]; Portuguese national funding agency for science, research and technology (FCT) [IF/00001/2015];  [EEBB-I-15-09392]","We would like to thank the local landowners for permission to work at the study sites, Lorena Ashworth, Ana Calvino and Pedro Jordano for valuable comments, Encarnacion Rubio-Perez for field and laboratory assistance, and Michael Lockwood for the linguistic correction.

Data were collected from January 2013 to January 2015 by positioning camera traps in 200 sample stations. During 3479 trap days, we collected 1048 independent videos of target carnivore species, which revealed a general spatial coexistence among carnivores with some differences in seasonal occurrence of species. The red fox and the European badger showed temporal segregation, as their activity patterns suggested a differential use of night-time in all seasons. Activity patterns of the red fox and the wolf revealed moderate-high overlap and similar density distributions in all seasons except during winter. Coexistence between these species may be allowed by temporal segregation during winter and spatial segregation during spring. Finally, results regarding the European badger and the wolf suggest a moderate temporal segregation with a marked avoidance effect for the European badger induced by the presence of tracks left by wolves. Programmes aimed at carnivore conservation, and management should treat the entire guild, as it has been demonstrated that populations of different carnivores interact with each other in complex ways and that fine-scale mechanisms regulating carnivore assemblage influence different aspects of natural communities.","[Torretta, E.] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Ferrata 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Torretta, E.; Serafini, M.; Puopolo, F.; Schenone, L.] Antola Reg Pk, Via Provvidenza 3, I-16029 Genoa, Italy; [Puopolo, F.; Schenone, L.] Aveto Reg Pk, Via Marre 75, I-16041 Genoa, Italy","Torretta, E (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Ferrata 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.; Torretta, E (corresponding author), Antola Reg Pk, Via Provvidenza 3, I-16029 Genoa, Italy.",torretta.elisa@gmail.com; teos.teos@libero.it; fpuopolo@libero.it; fpuopolo@libero.it,,,Regional Administration of Liguria (ROP/ERDF funds); Regional Administration of Liguria; Aveto Regional Park (RDP funds),"We are very grateful to A.

Since there are few studies that evaluate how species establish and adapt to new environments, it is useful to assess to what extent the introduction of a critically endangered species into an area similar to where it originally occurred can help reduce its decline in number of individuals and avoid its possible extinction. This study presents the First results of an ongoing monitoring survey set up after the experimental introduction. We analyze how the introduced population uses space and food and we compare these characteristics to that of the original population at Barra de Marica, Rio de Janeiro state. We also compare morphological measurementss of specimens from both populations. Both make similar use of the microhabitat, but there are differences in their diets. We recommend that the introduced population, potential competitors, predators, parasites, and the habitat characteristics continue to be monitored, so as to insure that this species will not become a threat to Praia das Neves beach community.","[Soares, Ana Herminia B.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Ecol, Inst Biol, BR-70000000 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Araujo, Alexandre F.

An initial study showed direct suppression of an exceptionally large-seeded (seed > 15 mg) species (Silphium integrifolium, Asteraceae) by seed-size predation by rodents during the winter, resulting in indirect release of small-seeded (seed less than or equal to 1.5 mg) species. Twelve months after planting, plant diversities (Simpson's D) were 33% higher in plots exposed to winter seed selection by rodents. Thirty-six months after planting, Silphium integrifolium had almost equalized densities in rodent access (20.8 +/- 4.1 m(-2)) and exclusion (29.0 +/- 5.2 m(-2)) plots, but still suppressed both large-seeded (greater than or equal to 3.5 mg) and small-seeded (less than or equal to 1.5 mg) species (F-1,F-16=11.84 and F-1,F-16=10.42, P less than or equal to 0.005, respectively). A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) distinguished effects of Silphium integrifolium (Wilk's lambda P=0.029) from echoes of earlier winter granivory (Wilk's lambda P=0.014). Thirty months after rodent exclusion, diversity (D) remained 27% higher in plots once opened to winter granivory (adjusted mean 4.70 +/- 0.37 SE) as compared with closed plots (3.70 +/- 0.26; F-1,F-16=5.12, P < 0.05).

Like many other plants and animals of oceanic islands, they have evolved no defenses against introduced predators and competitors. The range of Achatinella mustelina, a tree-snail species found only in a short mountain range on the island of O'ahu, typifies this problem. Mark-recapture studies at two field locations reveal that the snails exhibit slow growth and late maturity (3-5 years). Fecundity is estimated at about 7 offspring per adult per year. The young are born live at about 4.6 mm. Population growth typically depends on considerable longevity (> 10 years). Demographic effects of the depredations by alien predators, rats and a North American predatory snail, Euglandina rosea, were documented in two long-term study sites. The predatory snail eats all sizes of A. mustelina and can rapidly drive populations to extinction (less than one year). Rats tend to select larger snails as prey and may leave an area before destroying all of the prey snails present; while reproductive output is temporarily destroyed, populations may survive. Actions necessary to conserve Hawai'ian tree snails, or indeed any group of relatively sedentary invertebrates with small species ranges, must include predator abatement, but also preservation and restoration of sufficiently large and complex forest habitats that the invertebrates may find refuge from alien predators.",,"HADFIELD, MG (corresponding author), UNIV HAWAII,KEWALO MARINE LAB,41 AHUI ST,HONOLULU,HI 96813, USA.",,,"Hadfield, Michael/0000-0002-8808-5197",,,,18,131,139,0,23,AMER SOC ZOOLOGISTS,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMPSHIRE ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0003-1569,,,AM ZOOL,Am.

Individual variation in prey preference is likely to be important but we have little information on this aspect of predator behaviour. Operant conditioning techniques and an underwater feeding apparatus were used to test the prey species and size preferences of five captive grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, in a series of paired choice trials. The experimental procedure was designed to present simple foraging choices to remove as many potentially confounding variables as possible. Results suggest that individual grey seals exhibit prey preferences. When presented with different numbers of items of the same species, seals generally selected the larger number of prey items. When presented with choices between two species, seals apparently showed consistent preferences for particular species. However, the apparent species preferences may be simply explained in terms of size selection.

Here, we assessed the effects of the predatory starfish Heliaster helianthus on substrate colonization by the dominant mussel Semimytilus algosus in a rocky intertidal area of the central Peruvian coast. We conducted 3 experiments: exclusions of starfish (1) from the edge of mussel beds, (2) from areas on bare substrate and (3) from areas surrounding recruitment mediators (i.e. branched macroalgae). The exclusion of H. helianthus resulted in increased cover of S. algosus in the 3 experiments. However, the colonization of the available space by S. algosus in the absence of starfish was more evident when facilitated by recruitment mediators or by migration from the edge of mussel beds than when colonization occurred during succession starting from bare substrate. By the end of the study period, however, increased S. algosus abundance, which coincided with the end of the cold phase (La Nina) of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, overwhelmed the effects of starfish. We suggest that periodic oceanographic fluctuations are also important in controlling community dynamics in Peruvian rocky intertidal zones, highlighting the variation in the relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up control when different temporal scales are considered.","[Hidalgo, Fernando J.; Firstater, Fausto N.; Lomovasky, Betina J.; Iribarne, Oscar O.] Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Lab Ecol, Dept Biol FCEyN, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Lomovasky, Betina J.; Iribarne, Oscar O.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Hidalgo, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Lab Ecol, Dept Biol FCEyN, CC 573 Correo Cent,B7600WAG, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",fhidalgo@mdp.edu.ar,"Hidalgo, Fernando/L-8046-2013","Lomovasky, Betina/0000-0002-0879-8403",EUEuropean Commission [511071],"We express our gratitude to J.

To study this, I performed an experiment designed to mimic natural conditions in many drying ponds. The number of tadpoles per tank was constant during the experiment but the water level was lowered in experimental tanks so that crowding increased. Experimental tadpoles grew and developed more slowly than control tadpoles that were in constant water volume. Also, metamorphosis was delayed (i.e. a smaller proportion had metamorphosed when the experiment was concluded on I August) and the metamorphs were smaller. I conclude that, due to crowding, the tadpoles in this experiment were not able to speed up development rate adaptively. Performance of the tadpoles in the experiment was compared to that of R. temporaria tadpoles in the field. These lived in a pond where desiccation resulted in division of the water body into a small pool and a large pool. The small pool dried out completely before the rest of the pond. Tadpoles in this pool were smaller and had relatively smaller hind legs, suggesting slower development. This pattern confirms the result of the experiment, supporting my suggestion that the experimental set-up mimicked many natural situations. Of particular interest is the fact that other studies-carried out both in the same geographical area and elsewhere-have shown R. temporaria to have the ability to respond adaptively to pond drying. The fact that it did not do so in this particular experiment, as well as in the field pond studied here, shows that care must be exercised when extrapolating from one study to the properties of a species. Different conditions, both in the field and in experiments, may well give different responses.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Loman, J (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",,,,,,,36,10,11,3,19,BRITISH HERPETOL SOC,LONDON,"C/O ZOOL SOC LONDON REGENTS PARK, LONDON NW1 4RY, ENGLAND",0268-0130,,,HERPETOL J,Herpetolog.

The Indo-Pacific red lionfish Pterois volitans is an invasive predatory reef fish that has reached high population densities and can cause large reductions in small native fishes. To determine whether lionfish behavior or movement varies with local lionfish and/or prey densities, I conducted observations of lionfish on 16 coral patch reefs in The Bahamas. Lionfish foraging activity and movement varied significantly with lionfish density. At higher densities, lionfish exhibited greater activity levels, time away from shelter, and more short-term foraging movements between coral patch reefs and surrounding seagrass habitats. However, these changes were not uniform throughout the day, with differences in activity occurring only at dusk and differences in movement occurring at both dawn and dusk, but not midday. Although some lionfish foraging behaviors varied with prey density, overall lionfish density was more strongly related to differences in lionfish activity patterns. These temporal and spatial changes in lionfish foraging behaviors are consistent with the predicted effects of intraspecific competition and may have important consequences for lionfish removal efforts and native prey populations. Specifically, in areas with higher lionfish densities, prey fishes that are more active at dusk and/or inhabit seagrass beds near coral patch reefs may be more vulnerable to lionfish predation. By culling lionfish, managers may reduce the local foraging movements of lionfish and thus help maintain native fish communities in multiple habitats.","[Benkwitt, Cassandra E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Benkwitt, CE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",benkwitc@science.oregonstate.edu,,"Benkwitt, Cassandra/0000-0001-6756-7958",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-12-33027]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists Raney Fund; Oregon State University travel grants; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1233027] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"Funding was provided by National Science Foundation (NSF) grant OCE-12-33027 awarded to M.

In one experiment, we examined the relative fitness on clover race (CR) and alfalfa race (AR) pea aphids on broad bean, red clover and alfalfa alone. But because clover is typically grown in a more complex agricultural mosaic with alfalfa and broad bean, a second experiment was conducted to assess the fitness consequences under predation in a more complex agricultural field setting that also included potential apparent competition with AR pea aphids. In a third experiment we tested for the effect of differential host race density on the fitness of the other host race mediated by a predator effect. CR pea aphids always had fitness losses when on broad bean (had lower fitness on broad bean relative to red clover) and fitness benefits when on red clover (higher fitness on red clover relative to broad bean), whether or not in apparent competition with alfalfa race aphids on bean and alfalfa. AR suffered fitness loss on both alfalfa and bean in apparent competition with CR on clover. Therefore we can conclude that the predation rate between host races was highly asymmetrical. The complexity of the agricultural mosaic thus can influence prey selection by predators on different host plants. These may have evolutionary consequences through context dependent fitness benefits on particular host plants.","[Balog, Adalbert; Schmitz, Oswald J.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Balog, Adalbert] Sapientia Univ, Dept Hort, Fac Tech Sci, Targu Mures, Romania","Balog, A (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",adalbert.balog@fulbrightmail.org,"Adalbert, Balog/AAR-4097-2021; Balog, Adalbert/O-9649-2019",,"Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research; CNCS - Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior; Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii [PN-II-RU-TE-2011-3-0096]","This work was supported by the grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2011-3-0096.

The abundance of RWAs in managed forest clear-cut areas was investigated in 2007 in Western Poland. The ants were counted in 1 x 1 m squares along transects that led from the edge to the centre of clear-cut areas. Squares that contained RWAs were located significantly closer to the edge as compared with squares without ants. The RWA density decreased significantly from the edge to the centre of clear-cut area. The pattern of the decrease of RWAs towards the clear-cut area centre may have serious consequences for ant-sensitive invertebrates. It can be expected that species richness and species diversity of invertebrates will be affected by forest clear-cut areas, which generate ant-free conditions.","[Zmihorski, Michal] Polish Acad Sci, Museum Zool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Zmihorski, Michal] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Zool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland","Zmihorski, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum Zool, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",zmihorski@miiz.waw.pl,"Zmihorski, Michal/G-7366-2011","Zmihorski, Michal/0000-0001-5137-1635; , Michal/0000-0002-2951-3462","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [N304 040 32/1895]",I am grateful to Tomasz Wlodarczyk for his help in the field and valuable discussion and to two anonymous referees for their valuable comments on the previous version of the manuscript.

The disappearance of O. esculentus has been attributed to predation, competition, and introgression by introduced species and to overfishing. An overlooked factor is a shift in algal community dominance in Lake Victoria, from large filamentous diatoms (a preferred food item of O. esculentus) to smaller colonial cyanobacteria and green algae. We performed a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that feeding performance of the two species differs sufficiently that algal shifts could have contributed to the species replacement. Adults of the two tilapiine species were fed individually on a monospecific culture of the small green alga Scenedesmus acuminatus, which grows in a range of colony sizes. Clearing rates were compared at 4 algal food densities and at the 4 colony sizes. The results indicate that O. niloticus has the ability to feed on either smaller or less bulky particles than O. esculentus such as prevail in the postdisturbance Lake Victoria, O. niloticus is also a more efficient filter feeder overall, with a differential that is inversely proportional to particle size. Additional data would be required to show that feeding performance and limnological shifts were primary to the replacement of O. esculentus by O. niloticus. Researchers should however, be cautious about invoking competition as the proximal cause of exotic impacts when simpler, extrinsic mechanisms are equally plausible.","SE MASSACHUSETTS UNIV,DEPT BIOL,N DARTMOUTH,MA 02747","Batjakas, IE (corresponding author), BOSTON UNIV,DEPT BIOL,MARINE PROGRAM,5 CUMMINGTON ST,BOSTON,MA 02215, USA.",,"Batjakas, Ioannis E/G-3608-2016",,,,,35,18,18,0,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR 28,1997,347,,,,,,75,82,,10.1023/A:1003063117116,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,XV450,WOS:A1997XV45000008,,,,,2021-09-27,

Because this predator metamorphoses and exits early from temporary pools, we also examined the resilience of the community for a short interval after Salamandra metamorphosed. Salamandra had extensive impacts on the food web. It reduced invertebrate species richness by 53%. Salamandra significantly reduced populations of three of the four numerically dominant invertebrates. It eliminated the large cladoceran, Simocephalus expinosus, while densities of the smaller cladoceran, Ceriodaphmia cf. quadrangula, were not affected. Presumably, this differential effect on the two cladoceran species was due at least in part to size-selective predation. Densities of the calanoid copepod, Arctodiaptomus similis, and Chironomidae were largely reduced by the salamander larvae. Hyla savignyi and Bufo viridis hatchlings were heavily preyed upon by Salamandra but surviving anuran tadpoles tended to be larger in the salamander pools than those in the control pools. Salamandra caused a trophic cascade; they indirectly caused an increase in periphyton and bacteria, presumably by reducing populations of those species which graze on periphyton and bacteria and making more nutrients available through their excretion. Upon removing the salamanders, the invertebrate community in the former salamander pools then became indistinguishable from those of the control pools with respect to species richness after two weeks. Standing crop of filamentous algae became considerably higher in the control pools after the salamanders had been removed. Similarly, bacterial densities, higher in salamander pools during the salamander period, reversed to be higher in the controls during the post-salamander period although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). Our results indicate that larval Salamandra directly and indirectly has large effects on temporary pool community structure. Thus, the absence of this species, which is presently on the endangered species list in Israel, can have large consequences for the entire temporary pool community.","UNIV HAIFA,OVERSEAS PROGRAM,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,COMMUN ECOL LAB,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL.",,,"Fahima, Tzion/0000-0001-5555-0040",,,,55,62,65,0,26,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,1996,76,2,,,,,392,402,,10.2307/3546211,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VC125,WOS:A1996VC12500021,,,,,2021-09-27,

While plastic responses to a range of biotic factors (e.g. predation) are increasingly documented, the details of responses to competition (mediated by the densities of conspecifics or heterospecifics vying for the same resources) remain unclear, despite a rich literature for terrestrial plants on which to draw. We examined phenotypic responses to conspecific density in a colonial invertebrate (the arborescent bryozoan, Bugula neritina) under field conditions. We found that colonies at higher densities were generally less fecund, lower in biomass and more elongate than those growing virtually alone. We also found such responses to vary only subtly with the life history stage of neighbours, with colonies exposed to higher densities of contemporary recruits achieving elongation via increased budding between bifurcation points and the elongation of individual zooids, while colonies exposed to established adults achieved elongation via increased budding only. These responses are broadly consistent with those of terrestrial plants competing for light and are probably due to the combined effects of resource limitation and altered flow in high density stands. Future studies are needed to disentangle these effects and the extent to which such responses to density in branching colonial invertebrates are a passive result of food limitation, or reflect active (and potentially adaptive) plasticity to other aspects of the local density environment.","[Gooley, Toby A.; Marshall, Dustin J.; Monro, Keyne] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Marshall, Dustin J.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Monro, K (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",k.monro@uq.edu.au,"Monro, Keyne/J-7418-2019; Marshall, Dustin/A-4185-2008; Marshall, Dustin/C-3450-2016","Marshall, Dustin/0000-0001-6651-6219",,,,58,5,5,0,12,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Our study examined some interactions between P. leniusculus and benthic fish in a British lowland river, the River Great Ouse. In a river survey an inverse correlation was found between the abundance of crayfish and the two dominant benthic fishes, bullhead (Cottus gobio L.) and stone loach (Noemacheilus barbatulus [L.]) in six riffles. The benthic fishes were least abundant in the riffle nearest the original site of crayfish introduction and gradually increased in abundance both up and down river as crayfish abundance decreased. The hypotheses that crayfish compete with bullheads and stone loach for shelter and prey on fish were tested by laboratory experiments in an outdoor artificial shelters on the bottom. In competition experiments 12 fish of one species were alternatively kept alone and with 12 crayfish for 3-day cycles lasting a total of 12 days. The results showed that crayfish out-completed both fish species for shelter. Predation was measured by keeping 24 fish of each species alone and with 36 crayfish for 10 dyas respectively in the artificial stream. The mortalities of both fish species were significantly higher when crayfish were present. The loss of fish could be partly due to the predation because cray-fish guts contained the remains of some lost fish and they were observed preying on both fishes in a tank. In the river crayfish lived at high densities reaching greater than or equal to to 20 m(-2) in riffles, and they continued to disperse. This may lead to a great reduction in benthic fish abundance if not local extinctions.","UNIV BUCKINGHAM, CLORE LAB LIFE SCI, BUCKINGHAM MK18 1EG, ENGLAND","Guan, RZ (corresponding author), JIMEI UNIV, COLL FISHERIES, DEPT AQUACULTURE, FUJIAN 361021, PEOPLES R CHINA.",,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,33,113,117,1,56,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Linked demographic-bioclimatic models are emerging tools for forecasting climate change impacts on well-studied species, but these methods have been used in few management applications, and species interactions have not been incorporated. We combined population and bioclimatic envelope models to estimate future risks to the viability of a cockatoo population posed by climate change, increased fire frequency, beak-and-feather disease and reduced management. 2. The South Australian glossy black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus is restricted to Kangaroo Island, Australia, where it numbers 350 birds and is managed intensively. The cockatoo may be at particular risk from climate change because of its insular geographic constraints and specialised diet on a single plant species, Allocasuarina verticillata. The cockatoo population model was parameterised with mark-resight-derived estimates of survival and fecundity from 13 years of demographic data. Species interactions were incorporated by using a climate-change-driven bioclimatic model of Allocasuarina verticillata as a dynamic driver of habitat suitability. A novel application of Latin Hypercube sampling was used to assess the models sensitivity to input parameters. 3. Results suggest that unmitigated climate change is likely to be a substantial threat for the cockatoo: all high-CO2-concentration scenarios had expected minimum abundances of <160 birds. Extinction was virtually certain if management of nest-predating brush-tail possums Trichosurus vulpecula was stopped, or adult survival reduced by as little as 5%. In contrast, the population is predicted to increase under low-emissions scenarios. 4. Disease outbreak, increased fire frequency and reductions in revegetation and management of competitive little corellas Cacatua sanguinea, were all predicted to exacerbate decline, but these effects were buffered by the cockatoo populations high fecundity. 5. Spatial correlates of extinction risk, such as range area and total habitat suitability, were nonlinearly related to projected population size in the high-CO2-concentration scenario. 6. Synthesis and applications. Mechanistic demographic-bioclimatic simulations that incorporate species interactions can provide more detailed viability analyses than traditional bioclimatic models and be used to rank the cost-effectiveness of management interventions. Our results highlight the importance of managing possum predation and maintaining high adult cockatoo survival. In contrast, corella and revegetation management could be experimentally reduced to save resources.","[Harris, J.

Here, we brought desert organisms together (rodents and vipers) from two deserts (Mojave and Negev). Both predators and prey in the Mojave have adaptations that give them competitive advantage compared to their middle-eastern counterparts. Heteromyid rodents of the Mojave, kangaroo rats and pocket mice, have fur-lined cheek pouches that allow them to carry larger loads of seeds under predation risk compared to gerbilline rodents of the Negev Deserts. Sidewinder rattlesnakes have heat-sensing pits, allowing them to hunt better on moonless nights when their Negev sidewinding counterpart, the Saharan horned vipers, are visually impaired. In behavioral-assays, we used giving-up density (GUD) to gauge how each species of rodent perceived risk posed by known and novel snakes. We repeated this for the same set of rodents at first encounter and again two months later following intensive natural exposure to both snake species. Pre-exposure, all rodents identified their evolutionarily familiar snake as a greater risk than the novel one. However, post-exposure all identified the heat-sensing sidewinder rattlesnake as a greater risk. The heteromyids were more likely to avoid encounters with, and discern the behavioral difference among, snakes than their gerbilline counterparts.","[Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo] Univ Arizona, Tumamoc People & Habitat, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo; Kotler, Burt P.; Shalev, Omri; Dixon, Austin; Embar, Keren] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer, Israel; [Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo; Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Brown, Joel S.] Moffitt Canc Res Ctr, Dept Integrated Math Oncol, Tampa, FL USA","Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Tumamoc People & Habitat, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer, Israel.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",bleicher@email.arizona.edu,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo/AAE-6272-2020","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Dixon, Austin/0000-0003-2459-7422; Bleicher, Sonny S/0000-0001-8727-5901",US-Israel Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [BSF-2008163]; US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF)US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [BSF-2008163]; Ben Gurion University of the Negev Ethics in Animal Research Committee [IL-73-11-2009],"This work was supported by US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF-2008163) to BPK and JSB.; We would like to acknowledge the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) for funding this project (BSF-2008163).

To test this hypothesis, we examined the diet and feeding ecology of bald-faced saki monkeys Pithecia irrorata in a largely intact forest mosaic of southeastern Peru based on systematic monitoring of five habituated groups over a three-year period and compared the relative availability of ripe and unripe fruits in their diet. Plant phenology data from individual tree crowns showed that, compared to ripe fruits, immature fruits were available in more tree species, in greater quantities, and for longer periods. Despite pronounced community-wide seasonal changes in fruit production at our study area, feeding patterns of bald-faced saki remained largely invariant: fruits comprised approximately 95% of the species monthly diet, with seeds alone accounting for 75%, with no major monthly dietary shifts. The flexible exploitation by this species of a consistently available food supply for which it faces little competition likely reduces foraging effort and consumption of less desirable foods, even during prolonged periods of overall fruit scarcity. The relative rarity of immature fruit specialists in tropical forests may reflect the fact that processing the hard pericarps and neutralizing the toxicities of immature seeds present substantial evolutionary hurdles that few arboreal vertebrate species have overcome.","[Palminteri, Suzanne; Peres, Carlos A.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Palminteri, Suzanne; Powell, George V.] World Wildlife Fund, Conservat Sci Program, Washington, DC 20037 USA","Palminteri, S (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",sue.palminteri@gmail.com,"Peres, Carlos/N-8275-2019; Peres, Carlos A./B-1276-2013; Peres, Carlos A./ABE-8361-2020","Peres, Carlos/0000-0002-1588-8765; Peres, Carlos A./0000-0002-1588-8765; ",Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; World Wildlife Fund,"We thank the Peruvian Natural Resource Agency (INRENA, Intendente Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre) for permission to conduct this investigation and the Asociacion para la Conservacion de la Cuenca Amazonica (ACCA) for permission to work at Los Amigos.

Each predator directly exerts a negative effect upon its prey, but predators may also provide indirect benefits to their prey. In ecosystems, such benefits are effected via indirect trophic pathways thlat can provide a more than compensating positive influence. The ecosystem of the Big Cypress National Preserve (southwest Florida) appears to contain an unusually high number of such predators-most notably, the American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis. The trophic exchanges of carbon among the 68 principal taxa comprising the cypress wetland ecosystem have been quantified during both wet and dry seasons. The network analysis program IMPACTS identified predators that potentially have a positive influence on some of their prey. A total of 64 of these instances were recorded for the wet season and 44 for the dry. Taxa that, on balance, have positive effects upon their prey include fishes, turtles, snakes, birds, and, most significantly, alligators. The feeding habits of alligators benefit a conspicuous number (11) of their prey (invertebrates, frogs, mice, and rats). Further trophic analysis reveals that the predation by alligators on snakes and turtles accounts for most of the trophic benefits bestowed. The actions of alligators in modifying their physical environment has been cited elsewhere as contributing to the maintenance of biotic diversity. It appears that the trophic influence of this species adds further evidence to the important role it plays in the functional ecology of the cypress wetland.","Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Solomons, MD 20688 USA","Bondavalli, C (corresponding author), Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, Viale Sci, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",bonda@cbl.umces.edu,"Ulanowicz, Robert E/G-1021-2013",,,,,49,67,70,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,JAN-FEB,1999,2,1,,,,,49,63,,10.1007/s100219900057,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,171HT,WOS:000078858100005,,,,,2021-09-27,

The removal of the massive sponge Geodia cydonium from the vault significantly increased the abundance of other invertebrates and patterns were consistent across positions; in contrast, the removal of the smaller sponge Petrosia ficiformis from the sides of the Snow Hall had little effect. Patterns of growth of Geodia cydonium did not differ among positions, nor among replicated areas within positions, while significant differences among replicated areas within each of the two sides of the Snow Hall occurred for Petrosia ficiformis. Patterns of mortality of the cnidarian Astroides calycularis differed largely among areas within sites, and a trend toward a greater mortality in the inner part of the Snow Hall was evident. Early patterns of colonisation were very patchy, and neither position nor the distance from the boundary affected the abundance of recruits in cleared plots.

We exclude such behaviour using explicit mass balances and study the consequences of symbiosis for the long-term dynamic behaviour of a three species system, two prey and one predator species in the chemostat. We compose a theoretical food web where a predator feeds on two prey species that have a symbiotic relationships. In addition to a species-specific resource, the two prey populations consume the products of the partner population as well. In turn, a common predator forages on these prey populations. The temporal change in the biomass and the nutrient densities in the reactor is described by ordinary differential equations (ODE). Since products are recycled, the dynamics of these abiotic materials must be taken into account as well, and they are described by odes in a similar way as the abiotic nutrients. We use numerical bifurcation analysis to assess the long-term dynamic behaviour for varying degrees of symbiosis. Attractors can be equilibria, limit cycles and chaotic attractors depending on the control parameters of the chemostat reactor. These control parameters that can be experimentally manipulated are the nutrient density of the inflow medium and the dilution rate. Bifurcation diagrams for the three species web with a facultative symbiotic association between the two prey populations, are similar to that of a bi-trophic food chain; nutrient enrichment leads to oscillatory behaviour. Predation combined with obligatory symbiotic prey-interactions has a stabilizing effect, that is, there is stable coexistence in a larger part of the parameter space than for a bi-trophic food chain. However, combined with a large growth rate of the predator, the food web can persist only in a relatively small region of the parameter space. Then, two zero-pair bifurcation points are the organizing centers. In each of these points, in addition to a tangent, transcritical and Hopf bifurcation a global heteroclinic bifurcation is emanating. This heteroclinic cycle connects two saddle equilibria where the predator is absent. Under parameter variation the period of the stable limit cycle goes to infinity and the cycle tends to the heteroclinic cycle. At this global bifurcation point this cycle breaks and the boundary of the basin of attraction disappears abruptly because the separatrix disappears together with the cycle. As a result, it becomes possible that a stable two-nutrient-two-prey population system becomes unstable by invasion of a predator and eventually the predator goes extinct together with the two prey populations, that is, the complete food web is destroyed. This is a form of over-exploitation by the predator population of the two symbiotic prey populations. When obligatory symbiotic prey-interactions are modelled with Liebig's minimum law, where growth is limited by the most limiting resource, more complicated types of bifurcations are found. This results from the fact that the Jacobian matrix changes discontinuously with respect to a varying parameter when another resource becomes most limiting.","Free Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Inst Ecol Sci, Dept Theoret Biol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Kooi, BW (corresponding author), Free Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Inst Ecol Sci, Dept Theoret Biol, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Kooi, Bob W/B-6343-2012","Kooi, B.W./0000-0003-3477-9924",,,,52,28,28,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0303-6812,1432-1416,,J MATH BIOL,J.

Global climate change is predicted to affect coastal habitats and may, therefore, have important consequences for the terrestrial breeding habitat of seabirds and hence seabird populations. The present study assessed use of breeding habitat in the four most abundant species of seabird breeding in south-eastern Australia using a generalised additive mixed-modelling approach. Habitat characteristics were measured on 13 islands in winter and summer, 2008-11. Burrows of the four species were associated with one or more habitat parameters, potentially explained by predator avoidance, physical requirements and possibly by interspecific competition. Whereas the habitat characteristics used by each species showed broad interspecific overlap, there was strong divergence, and the four species typically occupied different nesting sites within breeding areas. Information on the proportion of available habitat used and the influence of breeding habitat on reproductive success would enhance current understanding of what constitutes optimal breeding habitat as well as the role of interspecific competition in this assemblage of seabirds.","[Schumann, Nicole; Arnould, John P.

We tested this prediction with a granivorous avian guild consisting of only two Carpodacus members that bred in a Tibetan alpine zone at 4,200-4,600 m a.s.l. These two species, Streaked rosefinch C. rubicilloides weighing 40 g and Pink-rumped rosefinch C. eos 20 g, represent the extreme of body size of their genus. Both rosefinch species as the dominant members of local passerine breeders had similar breeding densities. They did not segregate in clutch initiation date, nesting altitude, habitat patches or nesting plant species, but in nesting plant height, with C. rubicilloides using those taller than the average of local bushes and C. eos using those lower than the average. No overlap in diet fed to nestlings between the two rosefinch species. C. rubicilloides with large and strong beaks primarily exploited the leguminous seeds, whereas C. eos mainly collected small seeds at ground level from a variety of plant species in accord with their smaller beaks. Interspecific aggression and territoriality were lack. The mechanisms underlying stable coexistence of the two rosefinch congeners should contribute to their success in the harsh abiotic environments.","[Lu, Xin; Gong, Guohong; Ma, Xiaoyan] Wuhan Univ, Dept Zool, Coll Life Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China","Lu, X (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Dept Zool, Coll Life Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",luxinwh@gmail.com,,,National Sciences Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30425036],"We thank the Buddhists in Xiongse nunnery for logistical assistance, and L.Y.

Mixed trophic impact analysis of a network model developed for Apalachee Bay, near St. Marks, FL, USA predicted such a trophic cascade, in that increased abundance of juvenile gulf flounder Paralichthys albigutta ((x) over bar= 149 turn SL, effective trophic level 3.9) should have a negative impact on juvenile spot Leiostomus xanthurus ((x) over bar =30 runt SL, effective trophic level 2.9) and a positive impact on benthic polychaetes (effective trophic levels 2.3 for deposit feeders and 3.0 for predatory polychaetes) in Halodule wrightii seagrass beds. We tested the predictions of the mixed trophic impact analysis by manipulating the abundance of the high trophic-level species (juvenile gulf flounder) in a cage-exclusion study in the North River, near Harkers Island, NC, USA. We compared the polychaete communities in St. Marks, FL and Harkers Island, NC, and showed that they are 5 1 % similar (Jaccard's Index) at the family level, with the same eight dominant families (Nereidae, Capitellidae, Syllidae, Spionidae, Cirratulidae, Terebellidae, Sabellidae, and Maldanidae) present in both locations. We used 24 open-bottom cages to enclose the benthos and its seagrass-associated animal communities. We manipulated each cage by assigning it to one of the following treatments: (1) inclusion of fishes in upper and intermediate trophic levels (I juvenile gulf flounder and 10 juvenile spot, the flounder+ spot treatment); (2) inclusion of the intermediate predator (10 juvenile spot with no gulf flounder, the spot-only treatment); and (3) no fish added (unmanipulated controls). Core samples taken within the cages provided pre- and post-experimental measures of polychaete density and biomass, and the difference in density and biomass were used as response variables. At the end of the experiment, we collected, weighed, and analyzed the gut contents of all juvenile spot present in the cages. Juvenile pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides, (x) over bar= 30 turn SL) were present at the end of the study, having arrived as larvae or being trapped during cage set-up, and these fish were also examined, because they also eat polychaetes and their natural densities exceeded our introduced spot densities. Significant differences among treatments were detected for the polychaete family Terebellidae for both the change in density and biomass (pre-experiment - post-experiment). Densities of the Terebellidae changed in the direction predicted by the network model's impact analysis, declining in the cages with spot added compared with the control cages. Analyses of the other response variables (post-experiment spot and pinfish densities and biomass, difference between pre- and post-experiment polychaete densities and biomass for other families, and post-experiment spot and pinfish stomach content biomass) showed no significant differences among treatments. Several variables (Nereidae densities, pinfish densities and biomass, and pinfish stomach content biomass) varied between cages with low and high seagrass cover (significant blocking effect, P<0.001). Nereidae densities declined significantly in cages with high (73%) rather than with low coverage (31% cover) of seagrass. Pinfish density and biomass were significantly greater in the high seagrass cages at the end of the experiments (P<0.001), suggesting that dense seagrass attracted them. We conclude thatthe high density of pinfish in dense seagrass was responsible for the decline in density of the Nereidae. The direct effect of intermediate predators (pinfish feeding on polychaete prey) can be influenced by preferential recruitment of fishes to structurally complex habitats. The direction of change of indirect effects, but not the magnitude, in multi-trophic-level food webs can be predicted by the mixed trophic impact analysis of network models. However, these indirect effects are likely to be small in magnitude relative to direct effects and may be difficult to detect experimentally, especially in low-power experimental caging studies with natural fluctuations in recruitment rates of competitor species.

However, percentage-positive results from molecular assays are strongly influenced by factors other than predation rate, and thus can only be reliably used to quantify predation rates under very restrictive conditions. Here, we develop two statistical approaches, one using a parametric bootstrap and the other in terms of Bayesian inference, to build upon previous techniques that use DNA decay rates to rank predators by their rate of prey consumption, by allowing a statistical assessment of confidence in the inferred ranking. To demonstrate the utility of this technique in evaluating ecological data, we test web-building spiders for predation on a primary prey item, springtails. Using these approaches we found that an orb-weaving spider consumes springtail prey at a higher rate than a syntopic sheet-weaving spider, despite occupying microhabitats where springtails are less frequently encountered. We suggest that spider-web architecture (orb web vs. sheet web) is a primary determinant of prey-consumption rates within this assemblage of predators, which demonstrates the potential influence of predator foraging behaviour on trophic web structure. We also discuss how additional assumptions can be incorporated into the same analysis to allow broader application of the technique beyond the specific example presented. We believe that such modelling techniques can greatly advance the field of molecular gut-content analysis.","[Welch, Kelton D.; Chapman, Eric G.; Harwood, James D.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Schofield, Matthew R.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Stat, Lexington, KY 40546 USA","Welch, KD (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, NCARL, Brookings, SD 57006 USA.",keltondouglaswelch@gmail.com,"Chapman, Eric G/A-6741-2009; Welch, Kelton/U-3872-2019","Schofield, Matthew/0000-0003-1481-2766; Harwood, James/0000-0002-0018-7288",Kentucky Science and Engineering Foundation [KSEF-148-502-10-261]; Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation; University of Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station State project [KY008043]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0934516],"This work was supported by the Kentucky Science and Engineering Foundation via Grant Agreement #KSEF-148-502-10-261 with the Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation, and the University of Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station State project KY008043.

Detritus can alter bottom-up control of green webs by affecting autotroph biomass and quality through its ability to alter ecosystem properties, including soil moisture and nutrient cycling. Additionally, the role of detritus as the food resource base of brown webs may subsidize omnivorous predators that can provide top-down control of green webs. Brown-green connections may be especially important following plant invasions, which often lead to increased detritus and altered food webs. I combine field experiments, observational data, and path analysis to understand how nonnative grasses impact native arthropod communities in a semiarid shrub system. Theory and correlative evidence predict that decreased shrub growth and nutritional quality, and increased feeding of detrital predators on the grazing web, would decrease the abundance of shrub arthropods. In contrast, I found nonnative litter increased shrub growth via increased soil moisture and produced a strong bottom-up increase of the grazing arthropod web; effects of detrital predators and plant quality were comparatively unimportant. I link these findings to the apparent lack of overlapping predators between the brown and green webs, and to the important abiotic role of litter in this xeric system, which increased native plants and the abundance and richness of arthropods on them.","[Wolkovich, Elizabeth M.] Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Wolkovich, Elizabeth M.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Wolkovich, EM (corresponding author), NCEAS, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",wolkovich@nceas.ucsb.edu,,"Wolkovich, Elizabeth M/0000-0001-7653-893X",UC IPM; Center for Invasive Plant Management; EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; Dartmouth's Cramer Fund; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0316798],"I thank R.

The study was conducted during two years in six commercial tomato fields in Northeast Spain that were managed using an integrated pest management program based on predatory mirid conservation. Our results indicated that Necremnus tutae Ribes & Bernardo (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) was by far the main natural enemy responsible for larval parasitism of T. absoluta.

The predatory mite, Bdellodes lapidaria (Acari: Bdellidae), co-occurs with S. viridis and is reported to be a biological control agent of this pest. Using laboratory bioassays and field experiments, we assessed the susceptibility of B. lapidaria to several pesticides and investigated its impact in controlling S. viridis. In the laboratory, B. lapidaria was found to be susceptible to the synthetic pyrethroids, alpha-cypermethrin and bifenthrin, but relatively tolerant to the avermectin, abamectin, and organophosphorous chemicals, omethoate and chlorpyrifos. In field experiments, B. lapidaria was not adversely affected by applications of either bifenthrin or omethoate. Despite strong intraspecific interactions, we found no detectable impact of B. lapidaria on S. viridis numbers in the field. These results indicate that B. lapidaria has a relatively high tolerance to several pesticides, perhaps partly through behavioural avoidance, but little impact as a biological control agent on S. viridis in southeastern Australia.

Culex pipiens and Culex restuans were the first mosquito species to colonize ground-container habitats and were the dominant larval species throughout the study period, whereas Ae. albopictus was late to colonize ground habitats and accounted for less than 15% of weekly larval collections once established. Ae. albopictus had a much stronger community presence within treehole ovitraps; however, Ae. albopictus never reached the average larval densities of the expected primary colonizer, Ae. triseriatus. Throughout the study period, the weekly abundances of Ae. triseriatus and Ae. albopictus were positively correlated and there were no significant differences between the abundances of each species. The larval dominance of Ae. triseriatus appears to be enhanced by the presence of Toxorhynchites rutilus septentrionalis, a large predatory mosquito species. When Tx. rut. septentrionalis was present, mature larvae (3rd4th instar) of Ae. albopictus were also present in only 16.7% of collections, whereas mature larvae of Ae. triseriatus were collected concurrently with Tx. rut. septentrionalis in 53.8% of collections.

Development of ecologically based models is complicated by the multiple functions and sources of variability inherent in bark beetle semiochemistry. This discussion addresses four ecological issues of chemical signaling in bark beetles: the effects of aggregation on individual fitness, the possibility of cheating, how plants can defend themselves against herbivores that employ aggregation pheromones, and the implications of variability in chemical communication systems to predator avoidance. An analysis of published data from thirteen scolytid conifer systems indicates that the net benefit and optimal colonization density vary with host condition and beetle species. When beetles attack live trees, the benefit of cooperative host procurement exceeds losses due to competition for the limited substrate, at least up to moderate densities. When beetles colonize dead tissue, however, the effect of subsequently arriving beetles on initial colonizers is almost entirely negative. This suggests that aggregation originated as exploitation of senders, but evolved into manipulation of receivers. It is also proposed that the optimal colonization density which typifies each species or population may offer a more objective and less value-laden index of behavior than current labels such as aggressiveness. Beetles can maximize the relative benefits of group attack by incorporating instantaneous measures of host resistance into their colonization behavior, and by adjusting oviposition with colonization density. This system may provide opportunities for cheating. However a number of factors may select against a fixed strategy of cheating, including the linkage between tree allelochemistry and beetle semiochemistry, the reduced quality of substrate available to late arrivers, the short adult lifespans of most bark beetles, differential exposure to some predators, the difficulty of locating signalers during extensive endemic periods, and the low costs incurred during host assessment. However, the possibility that beetles employ flexible, density - dependent strategies deserves heightened attention. The ability of bark beetles to collectively exhaust host defenses poses a particular problem for plant defense. It is argued here that the ideal defense should include both direct resistance mechanisms against invading beetles, and indirect mechanisms that inhibit chemical communication. Evidence for the latter mechanism is explored. The ability of predators to efficiently exploit aggregation pheromones as kairomones in prey finding poses significant risk to bark beetles. It is proposed that minor alterations in pheromone components may provide colonizers with partial escape from such natural enemies while maintaining intraspecific functionality. Traditional interpretations emphasized the fidelity and consistency of pheromones, but under natural conditions chemical signals are modified by unpredictable features of the biotic and abiotic environment. Although we typically view variation in pheromonal signals as experimental noise or simple deviations from a population norm, such variation may reflect evolutionary dynamics. Complex ecological interactions may impose trade-offs between the clarity versus diversity of their signals.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Raffa, KF (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",raffa@entomology.wisc.edu,,,,,,186,138,146,0,53,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0937-7409,1423-0445,,CHEMOECOLOGY,Chemoecology,,2001,11,2,,,,,49,65,,10.1007/PL00001833,,,17,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,432CR,WOS:000168671700001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Fieldwork on the Northern Range of Yellowstone indicates that wolves facilitate carrion acquisition by scavengers, but it is unclear whether this represents a transient or permanent effect of wolf reintroduction. Here we present a wolf-elk model with human elk harvest and use it to investigate the long-term consequences of predator-prey dynamics and hunting on resource flow to scavengers. Our model shows that while wolves reduce the total amount of carrion, they stabilize carrion abundance by reducing temporal variation in the quantity of carrion and extending the period over which carrion is available. Specifically, the availability of carrion is shifted from reliance on winter severity and elk density to dependence on the strength of wolf predation. Though wolves reduce the overall abundance of carrion by lowering the elk population, this reduction is partially offset by increases in the productivity of an elk population invigorated by removal of the weakest individuals. The result of this is higher carrion production per elk in the presence of wolves. In addition, this yields an ecological explanation for the phenomena that predators increase the robustness of their prey: namely that by reducing the effect of density-dependent resource competition among elk, those that remain, even some of the older animals, are better fed and healthier as a result. Our model also suggests that human hunting has no effect on the distribution of carrion across the year but is crucial in determining the long-term abundance of carrion because of the effect of hunting on elk population levels. By reducing the proportion of cows in the annual hunt, which have historically been high in order to control the number of elk migrating north of the park, managers can allow an adequate supply of carrion without substantially reducing hunter take. The effects of a more tractable food resource is likely to benefit scavengers in Yellowstone and other areas of the world where wolves have been or are currently being considered for reintroduction.

One of them was severely affected by sewage pollution and the other was located in a natural area without visible signs of organic enrichment. Results obtained through periodical sampling, recapture of marked specimens and controlled reciprocal translocations between both areas demonstrated increased growth (9.7 mm after one year) and low densities in the vicinity of the outfall. This area is characterized by an abundance of cyanophytes, diatoms and opportunist, ephemeral green algae, and also by the total absence of the mytilid Brachidontes rodriguezi (d'Orbigny). On the other hand, in unpolluted areas monopolized by B. rodriguezi at mid-intertidal levels, densities were high and growth was slower (6.2 mm after two years). Growth was also increased in specimens experimentally transported or swept by waves from the mussel community to tide-pools dominated by the green alga Ulva lactuca L. Growth in the natural environment or in enriched areas was remarkably lower than values reported in a previous study on floating substrata within Mar del Plata (38-degrees-03' S, 57-degrees-33' W) harbour (19.5 mm after one year). A positive correlation between growth and mortality rates was observed. Due to considerable habitat-induced variations in growth rate, estimation of age as a function of size in this species may be unreliable without taking into account the surrounding environment. Results obtained in the present study emphasize the influence of primary production and of the presence of other sessile organisms on the population dynamics of S. lessoni.","MUSEO ARGENTINO CIENCIAS NAT BERNARDINO RIVADAVIA,A GALLARDO 470,RA-1405 BUENOS AIRES,ARGENTINA",,,,,,,,57,38,39,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Females are expected to choose a site with many resources and few competitors or predators to allow the best performance for their progeny, assuming that mother knows best. However, this is not systematically observed. The Aphidoletes aphidimyza larvae are generalist aphid predators and females consequently lay their eggs near or inside aphid colonies. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of intraspecific competition on oviposition behavior of A. aphidimyza females. First, we counted the number of eggs laid by a female on a leaf with 20 aphids, in the presence of 0, 2, 4, or 6 conspecific eggs or in the absence of eggs but in presence of 3 virgin females. The same experiment was also performed under choice condition with 2 oviposition sites. Our results show that the presence of low densities of conspecific eggs, or the presence of conspecific females, have no significant impact on the number of eggs laid by A. aphidimyza females. One of the hypotheses advanced to explain these results is the advantages of conspecifics presence. At low densities, the presence of eggs on an oviposition site can indicate the suitability of the site for the females. The conspecific presence can also insure a dilution effect against predator and increase the presence of potential mating partners for this monogenic species.","[Kohandani, Fatemeh; Le Goff, Guillaume Jean; Hance, Thierry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, 4 Pl Croix Sud, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium","Kohandani, F (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Biodivers Res Ctr, Batiment Carnoy,4,Pl Croix Sud,Bte L7-07-04, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",Fatemeh.kohandani@uclouvain.be,,,Universite Catholique de Louvain,Fatemeh Kohandani is funded by Universite Catholique de Louvain for her work as teacher assistant.

We investigated the effects of nutrient enrichment and changes in the presence and density of two species of tadpoles, American toad (Anaxyrus americanus) and Gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), on freshwater snail abundance (Physella sp.). At low tadpole density, there was no difference in the abundance of Physella sp. among treatments. At high tadpole density, treatments with both species of tadpoles present and nutrient enrichment had a higher abundance of Physella than all other treatment combinations. Mesocosms with high tadpole densities had lower periphyton dry mass than those with low overall tadpole density. At the end of the experiment, increased abundance of Physella was related to earlier metamorphosis in A. americanus and H. versicolor and higher proportions of H. versicolor metamorphosing and surviving. Nutrient enrichment did not independently affect snails. Our results suggest that changes in the composition and density of tadpole assemblages can interact with nutrient enrichment to drive variation in freshwater snail abundances, indicating that ongoing declines in amphibian populations combined with continued anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of freshwater ecosystems may have complex effects on freshwater snail populations.","[Smith, Geoffrey R.; Burgett, Amber A.; Rettig, Jessica E.] Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA","Smith, GR (corresponding author), Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",smithg@denison.edu,,,Sherman Fairchild Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative/Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force seed grant,"Funding was provided in part by the Sherman Fairchild Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and an Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative/Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force seed grant.

Predation by native species may confer biotic resistance to communities, but the environmental context under which this form of biotic resistance occurs is not well understood. We evaluated several factors that influence the distribution of invasive Asian mussels (Musculista senhousia) in Mission Bay, a southern California estuary containing an extensive eelgrass (Zostera marina) habitat. Asian mussels exhibit a distinct spatial pattern of invasion, with extremely high densities towards the back of Mission Bay (up to 4,000 m(-2)) in contrast with near-complete absence at sites towards the front of the bay. We established that recruits arrived at sites where adult mussels were absent and found that dense eelgrass does not appear to preclude Asian mussel growth and survival. Mussel survival and growth were high in predator-exclusion plots throughout the bay, but mussel survival was low in the front of the bay when plots were open to predators. Additional experiments revealed that consumption by spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) and a gastropod (Pteropurpura festiva) likely are the primary factors responsible for resistance to Asian mussel invasion. However, biotic resistance was dependent on location within the estuary (for both species) and also on the availability of a hard substratum (for P. festiva). Our findings indicate that biotic resistance in the form of predation may be conferred by higher order predators, but that the strength of resistance may strongly vary across estuarine gradients and depend on the nature of the locally available habitat.","[Cheng, Brian S.; Hovel, Kevin A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Cheng, BS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",bscheng@ucdavis.edu,,"Cheng, Brian/0000-0003-1679-8398",Edna Bailey Sussman Foundation; Western Society of Malacologists; California Beach and Shore Preservation Association; San Diego State University; Division Of Graduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [0841297] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by grants from the Edna Bailey Sussman Foundation, Western Society of Malacologists, California Beach and Shore Preservation Association, and San Diego State University.

Since its inception, the GUD approach has been applied successfully to a vast range of foraging species and foraging scenarios. However, its application is not simple, as anyone who has tried to use it for the first time might attest. Limitations of the technique were noted at its conception, yet only the artificiality of the patches, the appropriateness of the food resource, and the possibility of multiple visiting foragers were identified. Here we show the current uses of GUD and outline the practical benefits as well as the often overlooked limitations of the technique. We define seven major points that need to be addressed when applying this methodology: (1) the curvilinearity between harvest rate and energy, (2) the energetic state of the forager, (3) the effect of group foraging, (4) food quality and substrate properties, (5) the predictability of the patch, (6) behavioral traits of the forager, and (7) nontarget species. We also suggest how GUD experiments can be enhanced by incorporating complementary methods (such as cameras) to better understand the foraging processes involved in the GUD itself. We conclude that the benefits of using GUD outweigh the costs, but that its limitations should not be ignored.

These ideas have been tested using protozoans in laboratory microcosms. However, the results are equivocal, and contrary to expectation, omnivory is common in natural food webs. Two recent developments lead us to re-evaluate these predictions using food webs assembled from protists and bacteria. First, recent modelling work suggests that omnivory is actually stabilizing, providing that interactions are not too strong. Second, it is difficult to evaluate the degree of omnivory of some protozoan species without explicit experimental tests. This study used seven species of ciliated protozoa and a mixed bacterial flora to assemble four food webs with two trophic levels, and four webs with three trophic levels. Protist species were assigned a rank for their degree of omnivory using information in the literature and the results of experiments that tested whether the starvation rate of predators was influenced by the amount of bacteria on which they may have fed and whether cannibalism (a form of omnivory) occurred. Consistent with recent modelling work, both bacterivorous and predatory species with higher degrees of omnivory showed more stable dynamics, measured using time until extinction and the temporal variability of population density, Systems with two protist species were less persistent than systems with one protist species, supporting the prediction that longer food chains will be less stable dynamically.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Gahr High Sch, Cerritos, CA 90703 USA","Holyoak, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,"Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009","Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627",,,,37,67,68,2,23,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1998,117,3,,,,,413,419,,10.1007/s004420050675,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,150LL,WOS:000077666300013,28307921,,,,2021-09-27,

Indirect effects, such as those that predators have on lower trophic levels, are a key process in community ecology. However, such top-down indirect effects have rarely been extended to mutualisms. Antagonists of one mutualist have the potential to negatively affect the second mutualist through negative effects on their partner, and the magnitude of such effects should vary with mutualism strength. Bumble bees are ecologically and economically important pollinators that are an ideal system to determine if such indirect effects play an important role in mutualisms. Bumble bees are attacked by an array of parasites and predators, and they interact with a range of plants that vary in their dependence on bumble bees for reproduction. We tested whether variation in parasitism rates by Nosema bombi, Crithidia bombi, and conopid flies correlated with reproduction of greenhouse-raised plants placed in the field. At multiple sites over two years, we studied four plant species that varied in reliance on bumble bees as pollinators. We found a consistent negative relationship between Nosema parasitism and measures of pollination for Trifolium pratense and Solanum carolinense, plant species with high bumble bee visitation, whereas Rudbeckia hirta and Daucus carota, plant species with generalized pollination, experienced no impacts of Nosema. However, both Crithidia and conopids showed inconsistent relationships with pollination service. Although these patterns are correlational, they provide evidence that parasites of bumble bees may have negative indirect effects on plants, and that mutualism strength can moderate the magnitude of such effects.","[Gillespie, S.

In Europe, it has been shown that the American mink Neovison vison can be affected by native competitors; however, such evidence has not been found in South America. We studied the southern river otter Lontra provocax and the American mink at five marine sites, where they coexisted, and at one freshwater site, where only mink were present, in southern Chile. We used the signs of both species to study their habitat use and diet, and radio tracking to study their activity patterns. The results indicated that otters and minks tended to use different habitats in marine environments, the otter favouring littoral areas that are rocky and steep while the mink favours areas of gravel with a gently sloping intertidal zone. These differences were also reflected in their diets. At one of the coastal sites where the diet of the two species was similar, the activity pattern of minks was mostly diurnal, which is unusual. While differential habitat use may be the way through which the American mink is able to coexist with the southern river otter in coastal habitats of southern Chile, it is possible that otters are having an effect on individual minks by affecting their activity patterns, although more observations are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","[Medina-Vogel, G.; Barros, M.] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ecol & Recursos Nat, Santiago, Chile; [Organ, J.

Field and laboratory settings were used to examine the impacts of circumference and depth of the pit on net energy gain rate. An optimization model predicted a point optimum circumference and angle of depression in an unconstrained system, and positive correlations between body mass, pit circumference, and pit angle of depression in the presence of physiological constraints on both measures. Such a physiological constraint is possible in this system due to a large one-time construction cost. All of these correlations were observed in a lab setting with filtered substrate and no competition; though none were significant in the field. Individuals additionally constructed wider, shallower pits in the field. These results are consistent with an angle of depression that is limited by the angle of repose of the substrate in the field, rather than physiology. These results provided suggestive evidence for sub-optimal pit dimensions in Myrmeleon sp., and for the importance of substrate type in understanding the architecture of natural ant lion pits. The model predicted that the frequency of relocation would not affect the optimal angle of depression, but it would affect the optimal pit circumference to a degree proportional to the square root of the change in the average time an ant lion occupies a single pit. These findings challenge the widely held assumption of adaptive optimality in animal foraging. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, females may receive several benefits from multiple paternity (indirect and directly), and a potential sexual conflict can arise. This research describes the mating systems of an exploited crab species (Metacarcinus edwardsii), integrating (1) the individual level by assessing the mating behavior in a scenario of potential polyandry, (2) the organ level by examining histological sections of seminal receptacles from localities with scenarios of contrasting sex ratios, and (3) the genetic level by measuring the number of parents involved in egg clutches. We found that females can mate with multiple males under experimental conditions. Further, in all localities, we found histological evidences that sperm receptacles stored ejaculates from more than one male. However, contrary to expectations, genetic analysis revealed high probability of single male paternity of all progeny in each egg clutch. In this mating system, males compete to be the single male that mates with a receptive female, investing energy in guarding behavior and foregoing opportunities to mate with other females, all in order to ensure their paternity. However, females benefit from multiple mating (or potential for it) by prolonged guarding behavior, protecting them from predation after molt (soft-shelled period). The mating system of M. edwardsii can be defined as polygamous (where both sexes can mate multiple times) with genetic monogamy.","[Pardo, Luis M.; Riveros, Marcela P.; Pablo Fuentes, Juan] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Fac Ciencias, Lab Costero Calfuco, Valdivia, Chile; [Rojas-Hernandez, Noemi; Veliz, David] Univ Chile, IEB, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Nucleo Milenio Ecol & Manejo Sustentable Islas Oc, Santiago, Chile","Pardo, LM (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Fac Ciencias, Lab Costero Calfuco, Valdivia, Chile.",luispardo@uach.cl,"Pardo, L M/A-3178-2008; Veliz, David/J-4205-2013","Pardo, L M/0000-0003-2005-4922; Veliz, David/0000-0002-5768-9887; Pardo, Luis Miguel/0000-0002-8179-5057","FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110445, 1150388]; Direction de Investigacion y Desarrollo of the Universidad Austral de Chile; Basal GrantComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL [PFB 023]","This study was supported by FONDECYT 1110445 and FONDECYT 1150388 to LMP and the Direction de Investigacion y Desarrollo of the Universidad Austral de Chile.

Stridulations are of common occurrence in a great number of ant species and have been observed in many behavioural contexts that could be extremely variable according to the species and the social organization of the colonies. Here we studied behavioural functions of the stridulations emitted in the Neotropical Pachycondyla apicalis species complex, which has been recently shown to exhibit striking temporal and frequency specificities between different cryptic species. First we examined the occurrence of stridulations in several behavioural contexts such as daily activity inside colony, nest disturbance, nest emigration, presence of potential predators and encounters between sexual individuals. Additionally, we considered worker responsiveness to homospecific and heterospecific stridulations in a playback experiment in order to understand if the differences in the signals produced by sympatric species could have evolved in response to competition between them. Our results showed that stridulations were produced in situations of nest disturbance and presence of predators. No acoustic signal was emitted during mating recognition or copulatory behaviour. However, freshly inseminated females stridulated when further males solicited mating. Finally, the playback test of homospecific and heterospecific stridulations did not trigger any behavioural responses in these ants. Thus our study emphasizes the context-dependent meaning of stridulations. Further play-back experiments considering the social context in which the acoustic signals are present are needed for a better understanding of the whole channel of acoustic communication in this group of closely-related cryptic ants.","[Ferreira, Ronara Souza; Cros, Emilie; Fresneau, Dominique] Univ Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Lab Ethol Expt & Comparee, EA 4443, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France; [Ferreira, Ronara Souza] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Setor Ecol, Lab Ecol Conservacao Invertebrados, Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Rybak, Fanny] Univ Paris 11, Ctr Neurosci Paris Sud, UMR 8195, F-91405 Orsay, France","Ferreira, RS (corresponding author), Univ Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Lab Ethol Expt & Comparee, EA 4443, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",ronararonara@yahoo.com.br,"Ferreira-Chaline, Ronara/J-7952-2012; Cros, Emilie/AAH-2016-2020","Ferreira-Chaline, Ronara/0000-0001-7335-2179; Cros, Emilie/0000-0002-9812-9392",Programme AlBanEuropean Commission; European Union Programme of High Level Scholarships for Latin AmericaEuropean Commission [E06D101212BR]; French Entomological Society; PRONEX FAPESB/CNPq PNX0011/2009,"We gratefully acknowledge Paul Devienne for his great help during ant collection, Riviane R.

It is now known that larval amphibians exposed to acid water may experience increased mortality or reduced rates of growth. At the interspecific level, species that respond differently to variation in abiotic factors such as pH may experience a shift in their interactions. I used naturally occurring pH levels (4.5, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0) in laboratory experiments to examine the effects of pH on the growth and predator-prey interaction of Ambystoma tigrinum and Pseudacris triseriata. Larvae of A. tigrinum exhibited reduced growth and increased developmental time at lower pH levels. However, pH had no significant effect on growth or developmental time in larvae of P. triseriata. In combination, these factors led to decreased predatory success of A. tigrinum larvae on P. triseriata larvae at lower pH levels. These results suggest that surface water acidification and perhaps other abiotic factors may have consequences at the community level that extend beyond direct lethal effects on amphibian populations in temporary ponds.",,"Kiesecker, J (corresponding author), UNIV NO COLORADO,DEPT BIOL SCI,GREELEY,CO 80639, USA.",,,,,,,63,35,38,0,11,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In a Peruvian flood plain forest, we studied seedling recruitment of the widespread clonal herb Heliconia metallica. We analyzed natural recruitment and experimentally added seeds, excluded predators and removed the understory vegetation at occupied and unoccupied sites to test whether seed limitation, predation, disturbance, and the presence of mature conspecific plants influence seedling recruitment. The number of naturally recruited seedlings was higher at flooded sites and close to flowering H. metallica ramets. Predation caused considerable seed loss shortly after sowing. Seed survival strongly increased with the openness of a site, but was not affected by the presence of mature conspecifics. Seed addition increased the number of seedlings at both occupied and unoccupied sites. Two years after sowing, the number of established seedlings and their size increased with light availability at a site. In experimentally disturbed plots, light availability, seedling establishment, and survival were higher. The effect of disturbance on seedling survival was stronger at occupied sites, probably due to strong light competition from mature H. metallica plants. Herbivore damage on leaves of seedlings was lower at occupied sites, but seedlings grew faster at unoccupied sites. We conclude that seedling recruitment of H. metallica depends on natural disturbance and is limited by both seed availability and the presence of mature conspecific plants.","[Schleuning, Matthias; Matthies, Diethart] Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Biol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Huaman, Vicky] Univ Nacl San Antonio Abad Cusco, Fac Ciencias Biol, Cuzco, Peru","Schleuning, M (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Zool, Abt 5 Okol,Becherweg 13, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",schleuni@uni-mainz.de,"Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015","Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X; Matthies, Diethart/0000-0003-2439-0501",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes,"PeruVerde provided us the opportunity to carry out this study in the surroundings of Manu Wildlife Center.

Seedling establishment and tiller number per plant were each compared where seeds (or plants) were exposed to abiotic variables with and without the presence of neighbours and (or) predators. For P. pratensis, which occurred naturally more often in hollows than on ridges, abiotic variation appeared to be most important in controlling its frequency on the gradient. Tiller production was significantly lower on ridges than in hollows where plants were exposed only to abiotic variables (i.e., neighbours removed and predators excluded). For P. compressa, which occurred naturally less often in hollows than on ridges, greater suppression of seedling emergence by neighbours in hollows than on ridges appeared to be the factor controlling its frequency on the gradient.

The success of each early life-history stage can vary in response to population density, interacting with intrinsic (e. g. behavioural) and environmental (e. g. competition, predation) factors. Here, we used the common reef-building coral Acropora millepora to investigate how density-dependence influences larval survival and settlement in laboratory experiments that isolated intrinsic effects, and post-settlement survival in a field experiment that examined interactions with environmental factors. Larval survival was exceptionally high (greater than 80%) and density-independent from 2.5 to 12 days following spawning. By contrast, there was a weak positive effect of larval density on settlement, driven by gregarious behaviour at the highest density. When larval supply was saturated, settlement was three times higher in crevices compared with exposed microhabitats, but a negative relationship between settler density and post-settlement survival in crevices and density-independent survival on exposed surfaces resulted in similar recruit densities just one month following settlement. Moreover, a negative relationship was found between turf algae and settler survival in crevices, whereas gregarious settlement improved settler survival on exposed surfaces. Overall, our findings reveal divergent responses by coral larvae and newly settled recruits to density-dependent regulation, mediated by intrinsic and environmental interactions.","[Doropoulos, Christopher; Babcock, Russell C.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia; [Evensen, Nicolas R.] Univ Queensland, Australia Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Evensen, Nicolas R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Gomez-Lemos, Luis A.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","Doropoulos, C (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia.",christopher.doropoulos@csiro.au,"Babcock, Russell C/A-3794-2012; Doropoulos, Christopher/B-7249-2016; Evensen, Nicolas/T-8852-2018","Babcock, Russell C/0000-0002-7756-1290; Doropoulos, Christopher/0000-0001-8038-2771; Evensen, Nicolas/0000-0003-3318-5593",Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership - Gorgon Barrow Island Net Conservation Benefits Fund; CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellowship,"This research was financially supported as part of the Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership funded by the Gorgon Barrow Island Net Conservation Benefits Fund which is administered by the WA Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) awarded to R.C.B., and a CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellowship awarded to C.D.",,65,32,32,0,17,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

In this study, we estimated the size-scaling of the foraging capacities on zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates in Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) to link size-dependent performance to effects from competition. The competitive interactions between two size-classes (YOY and 1-y) of char were then studied in a large-scale pond experiment and in two small subarctic lakes. The attack rate function on zooplankton was hump-shaped whereas the attack rate on benthic chironomids increased monotonically with size. The size-scaling exponent's for zooplankton and chironomids were 0.65 and 0.30, respectively, leading to that critical resource density (CRD) and maximum growth resource density (G(M)RD) increases with size, suggesting an exploitative competitive advantage of small individuals over large. Correspondingly, large (1-y) char growth was negatively affected by cohort competition whereas small (YOY) char growth was not. Diets of both size classes were dominated by macroinvertebrates with large overlap in prey size suggesting only small gape size advantages for large char. Small char fed to a larger extend on cladocerans which, due to the hump-shaped foraging efficiency function on zooplankton, were a relatively more profitable resource for small than large char. Estimates of CRD and G(m)RD were in correspondence with observed growth responses and resource estimates for zooplankton, whereas for macroinvertebrates only qualitatively correspondence with foraging estimates and char performance was found. Although we were able to explain our results with exploitative competition only, we suggest a general need for size-dependent foraging estimates on prey in more complex habitats in order to quantitatively link performance and resource abundances. Interference and size-dependent resource use as mechanisms for observed stable population dynamics in char was not supported by this study and instead a low per capita fecundity and early cannibalism on recruits are suggested to be potential mechanisms that may stabilize char dynamics.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquaculture, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Bystrom, P (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquaculture, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",par.bystrom@emg.umu.se,,,,,,52,48,49,1,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2005,110,3,,,,,523,536,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13543.x,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,952HU,WOS:000230995400012,,,,,2021-09-27,

Historically, such interactive effects have been examined using two approaches. Studies using the first approach have excluded plant neighbors and herbivores in a factorial experiment, and scored effects on plant biomass. Studies using the second approach have observed herbivore abundance or herbivory on plants with or without plant neighbors, and have identified a large number of mechanisms underlying such interactive effects. The two types of studies have produced somewhat conflicting results, where interactive effects have been commonly observed in studies using the second approach and only rarely in studies using the first approach. This is most likely a consequence of a biased choice of study systems. where studies using the first approach have primarily Studied mammalian herbivory while studies using the second approach have been more focussed on insect herbivory. Moreover, studies using the first approach have typically been very small-scale manipulations and this probably precludes most possible interactive effects in systems with mammalian herbivory. This points to the fact that studies examining interactive effects of herbivory and plant competition should more carefully consider the behaviour and life history of herbivores included in the study prior to the design of removal experiments.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Hamback, PA (corresponding author), SLU, Dept Ecol & Crop Prod Sci, POB 7043, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",peter.hamback@eup.slu.se,"Beckerman, Andrew P/D-3020-2011; Hamback, Peter A/A-8194-2008","Hamback, Peter A/0000-0001-6362-6199; Beckerman, Andrew P./0000-0002-4797-9143",,,,110,120,132,6,88,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2003,101,1,,,,,26,37,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12568.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,665EL,WOS:000182106600004,,,,,2021-09-27,

The selection of internal reference genes, however, can significantly impact the interpretation of RT-qPCR results. The overall goal of this study is to identify the reference genes in the highly invasive H.axyridis. Our central hypothesis is that the suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis can be selected from housekeeping genes. To test this hypothesis, the stability of nine housekeeping genes, including 18S, 28S, ACTB, ATP1A1, GAPDH, HSP70, HSP90, RP49, and ATP6V1A, were investigated under both biotic (developmental time, tissue and sex), and abiotic (temperature, photoperiod, in vivo RNAi) conditions. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the Delta Ct method. Our combined results recommend a specific set of reference genes for each experimental condition.

Little information is available on the importance of biotic interactions in shaping the communities in these habitats. A common observation in the freshwater rock pool community assembly process is the clearly separated density peaks of fairy shrimp (Anostraca) and cladocerans (Anomopoda) over time. Fairy shrimp (Anostraca), the flagship group and dominant filter feeders of temporary waters hatch early after inundation. This contrasts with the occurrence pattern of coexisting cladocerans, which despite higher chances of abortive hatching occur later during the hydroperiod. To study this apparent succession pattern and test the possible presence of a biotic interaction, we set up enclosure experiments in freshwater rock pools in Western Australia and monitored cladoceran (Macrothrix hardingii) densities in the presence of variable densities or absence of fairy shrimp (Branchinella longirostris). The anomopod cladoceran populations decreased with increasing anostracan densities revealing a negative biotic interaction. The competitive dominance of anostracans most probably was mainly due to exploitation competition, with possibly elements of interference competition or predation included. Early hatching and competitive superiority may help anostracans in temporary pools to monopolize the habitat with respect to small and/or other filter feeding invertebrates. As such they influence succession dynamics and invertebrate community structure, making anostracans keystone species of temporary pools.","[Jocque, M.; Vanschoenwinkel, B.; Brendonck, L.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Jocque, M (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Cent Lab Gen Ecol, 2 Yurii Gagarin St, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria.",MerlijnJocque@gmail.com,"Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/I-9021-2019","Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/0000-0002-8973-6297; Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420",IWT (Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); Fund for scientific research Flanders (FWO)FWO [G.0118.03],"We thank David Angeler, Anne Robertson and an anonymous reviewer for suggestions to improve the manuscript.

Although previous studies have demonstrated that habitat composition and configuration at large scales may affect the presence, survival and movement of carnivore species, no such analyses have been conducted for the gray fox Urocyon cinereoargenteus. We used a generalized correlative mapping approach to investigate the relationship of gray fox relative abundance to landscape variables at the county scale in Illinois, USA. Relative abundance of gray foxes was high in 37 of 102 (36%) counties. Four models were competitive based on Delta AIC(c) scores, and these models indicated that standard deviation of the perimeter-area ratio of agricultural patches, interspersion and juxtaposition index of grassland patches, coefficent of variation of the proximity index of forest patches and relative patch richness of the landscape affected gray fox relative abundance. The variables occurring in our competing models indicate that the relative abundance of the gray fox is higher in counties containing a high level of fragmentation of preferred habitat types (i.e. forests and grasslands) and lower dispersion of less preferred habitat types (i.e. agriculture). Our results reflect gray fox habitat use at smaller scales, and at the landscape scale, gray fox abundance is influenced by how cover-type patches are configured.","[Cooper, Susan E.; Nielsen, Clayton K.; McDonald, Patrick T.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Cooper, Susan E.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, US Dept Interior, Las Vegas, NV 89130 USA","Cooper, SE (corresponding author), So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",secooper5@yahoo.com; kezo92@siu.edu; Patrick.McDonald@illinois.gov,,,"Illinois Department of Natural Resources through the Illinois State Furbearer Fund; Cooperative Wildlife Research Laboratory, Department of Zoology and Graduate School at Southern Illinois University Carbondale","funding and support was provided by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources through the Illinois State Furbearer Fund.

The choice of tree species in managed forests has strong broad effects on the community of insects and fungi that attack the trees, as well as on their predators, competitors, and mutualists. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain and predict community interactions involving non-indigenous plants. Two leading ideas are the Enemy Release Hypotheses (ERH) and the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis (BRH). Predictions of the Enemy Release Hypothesis that a plant species introduced to a new region should experience reduced impacts from herbivores and pathogens compared to within their native range have been frequently supported. However, some studies show higher herbivory on introduced plants when compared with similar native species, which supports prediction of the Biotic Resource Hypotheses. When the introduced plant species is closely related with some natives, the abundance and diversity of insect and pathogens can be higher in the introduced because they are recognized as food by the native herbivores but are less defended than the native plants due to the lack of coevolution. In this paper, we tested prediction of both hypotheses in the important forestry area of Galicia (NW of Spain) by assessing how the choice of native Pinus pinaster vs. non-indigenous Pinus radiata influences stand risks from the main pests in the area. We compared nutritional quality, tree defenses and the abundance and diversity of plant enemies and their associates in stands of native and non-indigenous pine species. Additionally we assessed whether silvicultural thinning helps to protect forest resources. Results suggest that the choice of where and what to plant when establishing plantation forests will influence subsequent damage by pests and diseases. In our study, stands of the non-indigenous P. radiata were more vulnerable to fungi, and more suitable for a notable defoliating insect, than stands of the native P. pinaster. Relative to the non-indigenous pine species, stands of P. pinaster tended to experience more attacks by more species of stem borers, but these attacks were dramatically less in thinned stands and could be subject to stronger controls by predators and parasitoids. Managing for sustainably high forest productivity requires considerations of forest health when choosing tree species and silvicultural practices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this final part of the paper, interspecific relationships and comparisons are emphasised. The nine large gadoids considered are primarily benthopelagic and pelagic predators on fish and crustaceans. Because of their abundance and wide distribution, they are key members of the upper part of the food-web in the Norwegian Deep and its slopes. Particularly important trophic relationships exist between the gadoids and the euphausids, caridean decapods and Norway pout. It is likely that the strongest interactions involving the gadoids are of predator-prey type and exist between the most abundant gadoids and their main prey: small saithe and blue whiting as predators and the euphausids as prey, and between saithe and Norway pout. Because it seems unlikely that any of the species, even those showing rather extensive overlaps in their diets and spatial distributions, experience resource shortages, the overall impression is that competition plays a minor role among the gadoids. However, intraspecific resource overlap seemed rather strong among the lifestages found in this area.

Observations on the benthic community composition in floodplain lake sediments of the River Rhine, differing in contaminant level and food quality, were combined with laboratory and in situ bioassays, using the midge Chironomus riparius as a model species. The positive relation between food quality and the diversity of the communities indicated that food quality is an important factor regulating benthic community composition, overriding the potential effects of contaminants. Nevertheless, in sediments with high contaminant levels, high densities of species classified as 'pollution-tolerant', such as Chironomus sp., were observed. The laboratory bioassays verified that the contaminant concentrations in these sediments had no direct effect on survival and growth of C. riparius, although higher contaminant concentrations in the sediment resulted in a higher incidence of mentum deformities. Also, the high growth rate of C riparius in the in situ enclosures in two of the most contaminated sediments indicated chemical stress and mentum deformities did not exclude rapid growth. This observation agrees with the abundance of the resident pollution-tolerant chironomids of the Chironomus plumosus group. In addition, the in situ bioassay pointed out that predation on chironomids added to the field enclosures was significant and is also an important factor in regulating the abundance of chironomids. In sediments with the highest food quality and low levels of contaminants the opportunistic chironomids may have been outcompeted by benthic invertebrate taxa that are not able to persist at more contaminated sites. It is concluded that tolerance of opportunistic chironomids, such as Chironomus sp., combined with their rapid rate of development, enables them to persist in contaminated sediments that are organically enriched avoiding competition with other invertebrates.","Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Dept Aquat Ecol & Ecotoxicol, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands; Wageningen Univ Agr, Dept Environm Sci, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management Grp, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands","Kraak, MHS (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Dept Aquat Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Kruislaan 320, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands.",castella@science.uva.nl,"Koelmans, Albert A./D-8603-2014; Kraak, Michiel/K-6928-2012","Koelmans, Albert/0000-0001-7176-4356",,,,43,25,26,0,11,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

When parasite populations are at relatively low abundance, the negative effects on host populations may be insignificant, but when parasite abundance increases beyond critical thresholds, they can have population limiting effects on the host. Here, we used data from a 40-yr demographic study on breeding Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) and avian brood parasitic Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) in the mid-Atlantic United States to disentangle host-parasite interactions. The relative abundance for these two species has changed both locally and regionally over this time period with a reduction in host abundance coincident with an increase in the parasite population. We detected a fivefold increase in Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism rates of Wood Thrushes over the 40-yr time period leading to a reduction in Wood Thrush fitness (i.e.,adult survival, fecundity, and recruitment). After accounting for the effects of Wood Thrush age, individual, and annual and within-season variation in reproduction, we found that Wood Thrushes exhibited increased reproductive effort (produced more nests per year) as nest parasitism rates increased. Additionally, we found that as parasitism rates increased, both Wood Thrush clutch size and fecundity declined. In conjunction with widespread habitat loss and land use change on both wintering and breeding ranges, increasing rates of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism are reducing Wood Thrush fitness, and are likely contributing to observed regional Wood Thrush population declines. Coordinated local and regional efforts to reduce Brown-headed Cowbird populations, particularly in fragmented landscapes, may help reduce the decline for Wood Thrushes, and likely other parasitized Neotropical migratory species.","[Ladin, Zachary S.] Univ Delaware, Dept Entomol & Wildlife Ecol, 264 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [D'Amico, Vincent] US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, 531 South Coll Ave,Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Baetens, Jan M.] Univ Ghent, Dept Math Modeling Stat & Bioinformat, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Roth, Roland R.; Shriver, W.

In a site with NE slope and mainly southerly winds, we asked whether large and oblong seeds were more likely to be transported and deposited in water obstructions and underneath the northern part of shrub understories. We also asked whether seed standing crop was less variable in water obstructions than in other microsites less affected by seed deposition. Location A sand field in San Juan province, Argentina. Methods We sampled the soil seed banks of four microsite types: water obstructions where debris/litter accumulates, southern and northern shrub understories, and open spaces among shrubs. Sampling was carried out in 11 plots and replicated at six moments between 2010 and 2012. Results Debris microsites showed the highest levels of seed density, species richness and standing crop; seed density and standing crop were also least variable in these microsites. Debris microsites also contained high seed abundance of stress-intolerant, shrub-dependent species. Seed density, species richness, seed standing crop, and the proportions of both large and oblong seeds were all higher in northern than in southern understories. The relationship between seed mass and the proportion of seeds that were apparently retained (i.e., not washed away and deposited in water obstructions) was more strongly negative in southern than in northern understories. Conclusions Northern and southern understories appeared to act as water run-on (i.e., seed recipients) and run-off zones (i.e., seed donors), respectively. Seed accumulation under the shelter provided by shrubs may promote seed predation in these microsites. Abiotic dispersal would therefore contribute to the maintenance of vegetation patches when seed arrival underneath shrub canopies saturates granivore consumption.","[Rolhauser, Andres G.; Pucheta, Eduardo] Univ Nacl San Juan, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Dept Biol, Av Ignacio Roza Oeste 590,J5402DCS, San Juan, Argentina; [Rolhauser, Andres G.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Metodos Cuantitat & Sistemas Informac, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rolhauser, Andres G.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, IFEVA, Fac Agron, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rolhauser, Andres G.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA","Rolhauser, AG (corresponding author), Univ Nacl San Juan, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Dept Biol, Av Ignacio Roza Oeste 590,J5402DCS, San Juan, Argentina.; Rolhauser, AG (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",rolhauser@agro.uba.ar,,"Rolhauser, Andres/0000-0001-6781-6723",,,,64,1,1,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Therefore, it has always been a challenge for both gamekeepers and conservationists to reveal relationships between ungulates and large carnivores as well as to figure out relevant implications for their management. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the above-mentioned relationships using statistical data. Fortunately statistics on the abundance and hunting bag size of some game species in Latvia have been collected since the early 20th century The study uses these data to examine four types of relationship within the period 1958 - 2005: (1) prey-prey relationships between the population estimates of moose (Alces alces), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), (2) predator-prey relationships in the above four ungulate species, wolf and lynx; (3) relationships between the estimated numbers of wolf and lynx; (4) relationships among hunting bags in some of the species listed above. We applied unit root test to check if our statistical results suffered from the spurious correlation. We used regression analysis (dynamic OLS and generalized least square) to reveal statistical findings and examine them from the ecological point of view in order to check the validity of our results. Our statistical results suggest that (1) For the red deer, roe deer is a competitor and vice versa. For the roe deer, moose is also a competitor in addition to the red deer. For the moose, red deer is a competitor. (2) For the wolf, red deer, roe deer and moose are prey whereas for the lynx, only roe deer is prey. (3) For lynx, wolf is a competitor, but for the wolf, lynx is not. (4) The elasticity of hunting with respect to population size is 2.55%, 0.91%, 2.14, 0.42% and 0.82%, for roe deer, red deer, moose, wolf and lynx, respectively.

Results showed that at densities equal or higher than 0.8 ind. m(-2) carp suffers from intraspecific competition. At the same densities, carp produces an increment of water turbidity, but the relation is non-linear, suggesting a switch effect, from a clear-water-system to a turbid-water-system.

Methodology. Based on the World Bank Open Data and UNCTADSTAT, there was made the assessment of indirect socio-economic and innovative effects of contract production on the macroeconomic indicators of the individual countries development by means of the correlation-regression method. Results. The influence of institutional, political, and economic restrictions that restrain the investment activity of international corporations on the international markets of finished and intermediate products is disclosed. A trend that complicates the forms and methods of external expansion in terms of more flexible latent forms, in particular, through contractual relations (subordinate production, licensing, franchising, contract management) is identified. The role of international contractual relations in measuring nonlinear formats of the externalization of TNC business is revealed. Exogenous (related to the institutional environment of the host-countries) and endogenous factors (the sphere of activity, corporate strategy, formed competencies and competitive advantages of the companies) that allow TNCs to obtain competitive advantages from the use of contractual relations in multi-level network structures with coordination mechanisms and management regimes are determined. Practical implications consist in the improvement of a theoretical and methodical approach to assessing international contractual relationships from the positions of microeconomic analysis (means TNC's management strategies) and taking into account macroeconomic effects (means their influence on the macroeconomic development of the contracting and implementing parties is proposed). Value/originality. The article points on problems of expanding the practice of international contractual relations: optimization of taxation, predatory exploitation of human, technological and natural resources of host countries by TNCs, freezing of national subcontractors on the stages with low value added, distortion of export capabilities of host countries by products export imitation created by means of the foreign suppliers' give-and-take raw materials and, as a result, the distortion of the balance of payments.","[Melnik, Tetiana; Kudyrko, Liudmyla; Samsonova, Liliia] Kyiv Natl Univ Trade & Econ, Kiev, Ukraine","Melnik, T (corresponding author), Kyiv Natl Univ Trade & Econ, Kiev, Ukraine.",melnikknteu998@gmail.com; l.kudirko@ukr.net; samsonova.lilija.gov.ua@ukr.net,"Kudyrko, Liudmyla/L-7571-2016","Kudyrko, Liudmyla/0000-0002-9089-7223",Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine [0119U100625],"Gratitude.

Coincident with intense anthropogenic disturbance, the abundance of the Coastal Plain Toad (Incilius nebulifer) has increased significantly in degraded habitats. Subsequently, A. fowleri is found only in forested areas near permanent water bodies that are not preferred breeding habitat of I. nebulifer. We hypothesized that larval competition with I. nebulifer, a species that breeds in extremely ephemeral habitat commonly found in disturbed areas, contributed to A. fowleri's decline. We raised tadpoles in intra- and interspecific competition in artificial ponds under simulated permanent and temporary breeding habitat conditions. Competition with I. nebulifer tadpoles, but not pond drying, resulted in a decrease in body size measures and a lower rate of survival to metamorphosis for A. fowleri tadpoles. Incilius nebulifer tadpoles were slightly larger in drying than in permanent ponds and were larger and had a higher rate of survival to metamorphosis in interspecific tanks than in intraspecific tanks, suggesting that it is easier for I. nebulifer to outcompete other species than conspecifics. The Coastal Plain Toad's superior competitive ability in temporary breeding sites may have resulted in ecological displacement and is potentially contributing to a decline of regionally sympatric populations of Fowler's Toad in degraded landscapes.","[Vogel, Laura S.; Pechmann, Joseph H.

In amphibians, predator cues can make contaminants more lethal under laboratory conditions, but the opposite outcome has been observed under more natural conditions with stratified water columns; stratification causes more pesticide to be present near the surface while predator cues scare spring-breeding amphibians down to the benthos. I examined whether this phenomenon also occurs in three species of summer-breeding amphibians (Hyla versicolor, Rana clamitans, and Rana catesbeiana) that were raised in outdoor mesocosms. Specifically, I asked how amphibian survival was affected by multiple concentrations of a common herbicide (glyphosate; commercial name: Roundup), the herbicide combined with chemical cues from predators (caged larval dragonflies; Anax junius), and the herbicide combined with lethal predators. Environmentally relevant concentrations of the herbicide caused high rates of tadpole mortality, but this outcome was substantially reversed by the addition of predator cues. With lethal predators, the tadpoles experienced such high mortality that the herbicide caused no additional effect. Roundup also induced morphological changes in Hyla versicolor, and the induced traits were different from those induced by predators. Collectively, these results suggest that while predator cues can make pesticides less lethal when thermal stratification occurs, highly lethal predators can overwhelm these effects. Thus, the impacts of such contaminants can be dramatically different in environments that do or do not contain high-risk predators.","[Relyea, Rick A.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Troy, NY 12980 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Troy, NY 12980 USA.",relyer@rpi.edu,,,U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"My thanks to Nicole Diecks, Jason Hoverman, Lisa Hoverman, Christine Relyea, and Nancy Schoeppner for their assistance with the experiment.

Across North America, the impact of cougars (Puma concolor) on their prey varies regionally. To document the relationships between cougars, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and feral horses (Equus caballus) on the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area and the Pryor Mountains, we deployed GPS collars on 6 cougars (the total number residing on the study area), and visited their clusters to determine predation rates and foraging patterns. We examined the composition of cougar kills by species, mule deer sex-age classes, prey size classes, season, and cougar sex. As a measure of selection, we examined the composition of prey killed relative to the composition of ungulates obtained during an aerial survey. We found mule deer were the primary prey, while bighorn sheep constituted secondary prey. While cougars selected for bighorn sheep, this was attributable to a single cougar. Among mule deer, female cougars killed more does and male cougars killed more bucks. Family groups had the highest predation rates (i.e., the shortest time intervals between kills), while adult males had the lowest rate. During the study, cougars were not depredating any feral horses in the area. Maintaining predator and prey numbers will require agencies to monitor and manage all fauna within this complex ecosystem. Habitat manipulations may be necessary to increase populations of deer and bighorn sheep, while continued management of feral horses will be required to reduce competition with native ungulates.","[Blake, Linsey W.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Gese, Eric M.] Utah State Univ, Wildlife Serv, USDA, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr,Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Gese, EM (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Wildlife Serv, USDA, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr,Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",eric.gese@usu.edu,,,"U.S. National Park Service, Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area; US Department of Agriculture, Wildlife Services, National Wildlife Research Center; Presidential Fellowship from Utah State University","Funding and support provided by the U.S. National Park Service, Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area; US Department of Agriculture, Wildlife Services, National Wildlife Research Center; and a Presidential Fellowship from Utah State University.

Our findings, along with field evidence front other studies that inverse relationships exist between abundances of desert pupfish and nonnative species, are consistent with the hypothesis that predation by nonnative species is contributing to decline of desert pupfish.

They all use flagella to swim and to generate feeding currents to encounter prey and enhance nutrient uptake. At the same time, the beating flagella create flow disturbances that attract flow-sensing predators. Protists have highly diverse flagellar arrangements in terms of number of flagella and their position, beat pattern, and kinematics, but it is unclear how the various arrangements optimize the fundamental trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk. Here we describe the near-cell flow fields produced by 15 species and demonstrate consistent relationships between flagellar arrangement and swimming speed and between flagellar arrangement and flow architecture, and a trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk. The flow fields fall in categories that are qualitatively described by simple point force models that include the drag force of the moving cell body and the propulsive forces of the flagella. The trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk varies characteristically between flow architectures: Flagellates with multiple flagella have higher predation risk relative to their clearance rate compared to species with only one active flagellum, with the exception of the highly successful dinoflagellates that have simultaneously achieved high clearance rates and stealth behavior due to a unique flagellar arrangement. Microbial communities are shaped by trade-offs and environmental constraints, and a mechanistic explanation of foraging trade-offs is a vital part of understanding the eukaryotic communities that form the basis of pelagic food webs.","[Nielsen, Lasse Tor; Kiorboe, Thomas] Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Ocean Life, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Kiorboe, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Ocean Life, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",tk@aqua.dtu.dk,"Nielsen, Lasse Tor/L-9907-2014; Kiorboe, Thomas/G-3190-2011","Nielsen, Lasse Tor/0000-0003-4177-3205; Kiorboe, Thomas/0000-0002-3265-336X",Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [7014-00033B]; Villum Foundation,We thank Dr. A.

These modifications represent indirect effects of pathogens on host life-history traits and they have been largely overlooked-in both the theoretical and experimental literature. Here we consider an eco-epidemiological model that allows for differential competition amongst and between infected and uninfected prey individuals. We find that disease-induced modifications of competition can tremendously alter the stability and persistence of predator-prey systems. Specifically, differential prey competition can facilitate the coexistence of infected prey and predators, which is impossible if competitive abilities of healthy and diseased prey are equal. We also show that this scenario can be associated with bistability, in which case the populations coexist on the brink of disease-induced extinction. These results suggest that considering parasite-modified competition can be crucial in understanding the impact infectious diseases have on their host as well as on other species their host interacts with.

Due to the time costs of handling very large prey it may be optimal for gape-limited predatory fishes to select prey with body depths that are 60% of predator gape width. We tested for inverse relationships between the abundances of different sized rockfish (prey) and of lingcod (predator) large enough to be expected to select that rockfish size. We predicted that these relationships would be stronger when assuming that body depth of selected prey is 60%, rather than 100%, of lingcod gape width. Results were consistent with this prediction for small and medium size classes of rockfish. Regardless of prey selection assumptions there were no negative relationships between lingcod and large size classes of rockfish, possibly because only 2.3% of observed lingcod were large enough to select large rockfish when assuming prey body depth selection of 60% of predator gape width. Large rockfish, therefore, may have occupied a size refuge from lingcod risk. Our results, however, are characterized by large statistical uncertainty. We suggest that prey antipredator behaviour, which has the cost of reducing access to resources and the benefit of lowering mortality rates, might explain much of this uncertainty. Quillback and copper rockfish are long-lived species with late maturity. As such, they are expected to maximize fitness by investing heavily in antipredator behaviour, and this investment may have weakened numerical relationships between lingcod and small and medium size classes.","[Frid, A.; Marliave, J.] Vancouver Aquarium, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Connors, B.; Cooper, A.

We studied this by coevolving the prey bacterium Serratia marcescens with the predatory protozoa Tetrahymena thermophila in constant and pulsed-resource environments for approximately 1300 prey generations. Consistent with arms race theory, the prey evolved to be more defended, whereas the predator evolved to be more efficient in consuming the bacteria. Coevolutionary adaptations were costly in terms of reduced prey growth in resource-limited conditions and less efficient predator growth on nonliving resource medium. However, no differences in mean coevolutionary changes or adaptive costs were observed between environments, even though resource pulses increased fluctuations and mean densities of coevolving predator populations. Interestingly, a surface-associated prey defence mechanism (bacterial biofilm), to which predators were probably unable to counter-adapt, evolved to be stronger in pulsed-resource environment. These results suggest that temporal resource fluctuations can increase the asymmetry of antagonistic coevolution by imposing stronger selection on one of the interacting species.","[Friman, V. -P.; Laakso, J.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Friman, V. -P.; Laakso, J.; Koivu-Orava, M.; Hiltunen, T.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Ctr Excellence Evolutionary Res, Jyvaskyla, Finland","Friman, VP (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Tinbergen Bldg,S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",vifriman@gmail.com,"Laakso, Jouni/I-7794-2013; Hiltunen, Teppo/A-4308-2015","Laakso, Jouni/0000-0001-8245-9912; Hiltunen, Teppo/0000-0001-7206-2399; Friman, Ville-Petri/0000-0002-1592-157X","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [1106993]; Centre of Excellence in Evolutionary Research, University of Jyvaskyla","We thank T.

Because these predators may have a significant effect on krill abundance, we estimated the energy and prey requirements of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins and female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica and compared these estimates with catch statistics from the Antarctic krill fishery. Published data on field metabolic rate, population size, diet, prey energy content, and metabolic efficiency were used to estimate prey requirements of these breeding, adult, land-based predators and their dependent offspring. Due to their large population size, chinstrap penguins were the most significant krill predators during the period examined, consuming an estimated 7.8 x 10(8) kg krill, followed by Adelie penguins (3.1 x 10(7) kg), gentoo penguins (1.2 x 10(7) kg), and Antarctic fur seals (3.6 x 10(6) kg). Total consumption of all land-based predators on the South Shetland Islands was estimated at 8.3 x 10(8) kg krill. The commercial krill fishery harvest in the South Shetland Island region (1.0 x 10(8) kg) was approximately 12% of this. Commercial harvest coincides seasonally and spatially with peak penguin and fur seal prey demands, and may affect prey availability to penguins and fur seals. This differs from the conclusions of Ichii et al. who asserted that the potential for competition between South Shetland predators and the commercial krill fishery is low.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Croll, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",,,,,,,54,65,69,1,31,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0722-4060,,,POLAR BIOL,Polar Biol.,JUN,1998,19,6,,,,,365,374,,10.1007/s003000050261,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZR062,WOS:000073931800001,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, this role is often assumed, with limited or no experimental quantification of its real value. We examined publication trends in the research on ES provided by insects, ascertaining which ES and taxa have been more intensively investigated, and which methodologies have been used, with particular emphasis on experimental approaches. We first performed a systematic literature search to identify which ES have been attributed to insects. Then we classified the references retrieved according to the ES, taxonomic group and ecosystem studied, as well as to the method applied to quantify each ES (in four categories: no quantification, proxies, direct quantification and experiments). Pollination, biological control, food provisioning, and recycling organic matter are the most studied ES. However, the majority of papers do not specify the ES under consideration, and from those that do, most do not quantify the ES provided. From the rest, a large number of publications use proxies as indicators for ES, assuming or inferring their provision through indirect measurements such as species abundances, species density, species richness, diversity indices, or the number of functional groups. Pollinators, predators, parasitoids, herbivores, and decomposers are the most commonly studied functional groups, while Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera are the most studied taxa. Experimental studies are relatively scarce and they mainly focus on biological control, pollination, and decomposition performed in agroecosystems. These results suggest that our current knowledge on the ES provided by insects is relatively scarce and biased, and show gaps in the least-studied functional and taxonomic groups. An ambitious research agenda to improve the empirical and experimental evidence of the role played by insects in ES provision is essential to fully assess synergies between functional ecology, community ecology, and biodiversity conservation under current global changes.

A biological control program using copepods that feed on mosquito larvae has been practiced in Vietnam and some other countries, but the application of copepods was not always successful. (2) To understand why the utility of copepods varies, we evaluated the predation efficiency of a copepod species (Mesocyclops aspericornis) on a vector species (Aedes aegypti) by laboratory experiments under different temperatures, nutrition and prey-density conditions. (3) We found that copepod predation reduced intraspecific competition among Aedes larvae and then shortened the survivor's aquatic life and increased their pupal weight. In addition, the predatory efficiency of copepods was reduced at high temperatures. Furthermore, performance of copepod offspring fell when the density of mosquito larvae was high, probably because mosquito larvae had adverse effects on copepod growth through competition for food resources. (4) These results suggest that the increase in mosquitoes will not be suppressed solely by the application of copepods if the density of mosquito larvae is high or ambient temperature is high. We need to consider additional control methods in order to maintain the efficiency of copepods to suppress mosquito increase.","[Tuno, Nobuko] Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Tran Vu Phong; Takagi, Masahiro] Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Nagasaki 8528523, Japan; [Tran Vu Phong] Natl Inst Hyg & Epidemiol, Dept Med Entomol & Zool, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam","Tuno, N (corresponding author), Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan.",tuno@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; tranvuphong@yahoo.com; mstakagi@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,"Tuno, Nobuko/D-3239-2014","Tuno, Nobuko/0000-0003-4269-8753","Core University Program of Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [14256003, 19256002]","This study was partly supported Grands-in-aid for Scientific Research No. 14256003, No. 19256002, and by the Core University Program of Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).",,28,0,0,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,MAY,2020,11,5,,,,,,,307,10.3390/insects11050307,,,9,Entomology,Entomology,LZ2VE,WOS:000541085300008,32423079,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-27,

In 2001-2002, we evaluated factors that affect the growth and abundance of rainbow trout, both temporally and spatially, based on a series of field measurements and growth experiments. Based on our field measurements, the growth and condition of rainbow trout in Flaming Gorge Reservoir actually parallel those of rainbow trout of various strains in other systems, and some rainbow trout overwinter as many as 3 years in the reservoir. Overall, rainbow trout appear to be spatially limited by physical factors (e.g., temperature) during only a few isolated times of the year and not in all areas of the reservoir. Although zooplankton were abundant throughout the reservoir, primary and secondary production vary spatially with concordant effects on fish growth and condition. Diet analysis indicated that rainbow trout consume primarily aquatic macroinvertebrates along with some zooplankton and demonstrate an extremely limited switch to piscivory at larger sizes. Rainbow trout reared in net-pens and limited to a diet of zooplankton lost weight in all three areas of the reservoir. In addition, the reservoir supports a large population of trophy lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, which probably affects the abundance of rainbow trout directly through consumption and the growth potential of rainbow trout indirectly through risk-averse behavior. The combination of spatial variation in reservoir productivity and habitat type, differing stocking strategies, and behavioral responses caused by predators appears to determine the varying success of stocked rainbow trout in the different areas of the reservoir. Our study suggests that stocking strategies may be most effective when specific characteristics of the prey and predator base, the suitability of different habitats, and the genetic strain are explicitly evaluated within the context of the targeted angler population.","Utah State Univ, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources, US Geol Survey, Logan, UT 84332 USA","Budy, P (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources, US Geol Survey, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84332 USA.",phaedra.budy@usu.edu,"Budy, Phaedra/B-2415-2012","Budy, Phaedra/0000-0002-9918-1678",,,,56,18,18,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0275-5947,1548-8675,,N AM J FISH MANAGE,North Am.

Economical damage (i. e. reduction of the yield) is usually confined to fish farms. Grey Herons may take some 0.4-8 % of the production of efficiently managed farms, whereas Cormorants can be responsible for losses of 20 % to > 50 % under certain circumstances. The influence of birds is often overestimated by fish farmers if they do not separate predation from other causes of mortality. Neither economical nor ecological damage (i. e. negative influence on the population resulting in long-term decline) have been reported from lakes, although total fish stocks were rarely assessed. In these cases, waterfowl took less than 5 % of the biomass of most fish species; under brackish conditions the maximum was 36 %. Commercial catches are often 10-20 times higher than the consumption by the main avian predators (tab. 1). Even on Central European lakes with high Cormorant densities, fishermen take 4-12 times as much as the Cormorants, and annual variations in the catch can amount to a multiple of the bird consumption (fig. 1). Moreover, waterbirds often prey upon commercially unimportant and abundant fish and may therefore reduce competitive pressure on commercial species. Predation rates in streams and rivers are usually higher than in lakes, but in most cases the avian predation does not seem to exceed the range of compensatory mortality. The few reports of waterbirds apparently responsible for added mortality (thus competing with fisheries), mostly refer to canalised rivers with inadequate structural properties for the high fish populations they are stocked with. Altogether predator-prey relationships between waterbirds and freshwater fish remain little studied. Possibilities of fishponds for conducting experiments have particularly been underused.",,"SUTER, W (corresponding author), SCHWEIZER VOGELWARTE SEMPACH,CH-6204 SEMPACH,SWITZERLAND.",,,,,,,77,12,14,0,38,DEUTSCHE ORNITHOLOGIE-GESELL,FRANKFURT,"SENCKENBERGANLAGE 25, W-6000 FRANKFURT, GERMANY",0021-8375,,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Although this has been extensively studied in small mammals, the influence of predation and prey acquisition on the activity and behavior of large carnivores has received little attention. The diurnal activity described as typical for cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) has been explained in terms of their avoidance of antagonistic interactions with other larger predators. However, a recent study revealed that cheetahs are frequently active at night, especially during periods of full moon. Being both predator and prey in an environment with comparatively high densities of larger and competitively dominant nocturnal predator species, we investigated whether cheetah nocturnal behavior could be explained by favorable conditions for 1) predator avoidance or 2) prey acquisition. We used a data set of continuously recorded behavior created using machine-learning techniques on behavioral data collected in the field to transform recorded 2D activity values from radio-collars into 3 distinct behavioral states (feeding, moving, and resting). We found that 32.5% of cheetah feeding behavior occurred at night and that, in the dry season, nocturnal feeding behavior was positively correlated with moonlight intensity. Our results suggest that nocturnal and circalunar behavior of cheetahs is driven by optimal hunting conditions, outweighing the risks of encountering other predators. Using novel methodology, the results provide new insights into the temporal distribution of behavior, contributing to our understanding of the importance of moonlight and season on the behavior patterns of diurnal species.","[Broekhuis, Femke; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Dept Zool, Tubney OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Broekhuis, Femke; McNutt, John W.] Botswana Predator Conservat Trust, Maun, Botswana; [Gruenewaelder, Steffen] UCL, Graham Knight Comp Sci Dept, Ctr Computat Stat & Machine Learning, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Gruenewaelder, Steffen] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England","Broekhuis, F (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Dept Zool, Tubney House Abingdon Rd, Tubney OX13 5QL, Oxon, England.",femke.broekhuis@gmail.com,,"Grunewalder, Steffen/0000-0002-4017-2048; Broekhuis, Femke/0000-0002-4216-8819",Tom Kaplan Prize Scholarship; Wilderness Wildlife Trust,Tom Kaplan Prize Scholarship; Wilderness Wildlife Trust.,,54,31,32,1,93,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

It is now found even in the Palearctic and Oriental regions. During the summer of 2015 we found high densities (> 500 ind./l) of this species and low numbers of Brachionus angularis in Lake Albufera where the cyanobacterium (Microcystis aeruginosa) was dominant in the phytoplankton community. We hypothesized that the cyanobacterium was toxic to B. angularis but not to B. havanaensis hence the latter would outcompete the former in the presence of this cyanobacterium. To test the hypothesis, we conducted competition experiments between two coexisting rotifer species (B. angularis and B. havanaensis) from the Lake Albufera of Valencia using as food the green alga (Nannochloropsis oculata) and sonicated colonies of M. aeruginosa (single cells), separately and together (1:1 ratio based on biomass). The competition experiments using the population growth approach showed that B. havanaensis in controls had higher population abundances than B. angularis. However, when grown both together, B. havanaensis had a reduced population growth (nearly 50 %) in relation to B. angularis, in the absence ofMicrocystis in the diet. This reduced growth was more than that in the treatment of B. havanaensis alone when grown on a mixed diet of Microcystis and Nannochloropsis oculata. Brachionus havanaensis in all treatments (alone or in the presence of B. angularis) died completely when cultured on 100 % M. aeruginosa. The population growth rates of B. angularis, alone or in competition with B. havanaensis, were similar when Microcystis was excluded from the diet. However, Microcystis alone or together with Nannochloropsis was highly detrimental for the population growth of B. angularis. Our results showed the differences in the competitive outcome between the rotifers depending on the presence or absence of toxic cyanobacteria in the diet. Our study also showed that an exclusive diet of this cyanobacterium was toxic to both rotifers.","[Sarma, S. S.

In this work, we assessed the change of a riverine bacterial community in controlled incubations, where HNFs' predation pressure was initially released through filtration. Filtration did not prevent the passage of cysts, which grew in the enrichments afterwards. Data on the composition of the bacterial community were gathered by Catalyzed Reporter Deposition Fluorescent In situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) using 16S probes targeting phylogenetic groups. Bacterial cell size was also examined using image analysis. Overall, the initial filtration directly (through release of predation pressure) or indirectly (through competition among bacterial groups) affected the bacterial community composition. When nanoflagellate abundance rose, a reduction of bacterial abundance and changes in cell size distribution were observed. Gamma-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the groups showing the greatest reduction in abundance. Beta-Proteobacteria showed a reduction of cell size and were found in aggregates. Alpha-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria developed two distinct filamentous morphotypes: short, segmented rods and long chains of rods. Our results showed that the release of the predation pressure and the successive rise of the nanoflagellates changed the bacterial community in terms of composition at large phylogenetic scale. HNF grazing is highly group-specific and seems to reconstruct the community based on cell size, and thus, not only drastically changing the bacterial community composition, but also increasing its functional diversity.","[Batani, Giampiero; Fazi, Stefano] Natl Res Council Italy IRSA CNR, Water Res Inst, Rome, Italy; [Perez, German; Martinez de la Escalera, Gabriela; Piccini, Claudia] Inst Investigaciones Biol Clemente Estab, Dept Microbiol, Montevideo, Uruguay","Fazi, S (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy IRSA CNR, Water Res Inst, Rome, Italy.",fazi@irsa.cnr.it,"Piccini, Claudia/P-3840-2019; FAZI, STEFANO/AAX-5609-2020; FAZI, STEFANO/L-3976-2017","Piccini, Claudia/0000-0002-2762-1953; FAZI, STEFANO/0000-0001-7688-7179; FAZI, STEFANO/0000-0001-7688-7179",Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion ANII travel [CHA_1_2010_1],The project was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion ANII travel [grant number CHA_1_2010_1].,,101,11,12,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0270-5060,2156-6941,,J FRESHWATER ECOL,J.

Akin to predators, parasites influence host population sizes and engage in stage-structured interactions, yet whether parasites can increase host population biomass remains relatively unexplored. Using a stage-structured consumer-resource model and a mesocosm experiment with snails and castrating trematodes, we examined responses of host biomass to changes in infection prevalence under variation in host pathology and resource competition. Equilibrium adult host biomass increased with infection prevalence in the model when parasites castrated hosts and adults were superior competitors to juveniles. Juvenile biomass increased with infection prevalence whether parasites caused mortality or castration, but only when juveniles were superior competitors. In mesocosms, increases in infection by castrating trematodes reduced snail egg production, juvenile abundance, and adult survival. At high competition, juvenile growth and total biomass increased with infection prevalence due to competitive release. At low competition, juvenile biomass decreased with infection due to reduced reproduction. These results highlight how disease-induced biomass overcompensation depends on infection pathology, resource availability, and competitive interactions within and between host life stages. Considering such characteristics may benefit biocontrol efforts using parasites.","[Preston, Daniel L.; Sauer, Erin L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Preston, DL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",daniel.preston@wisc.edu,,"Sauer, Erin/0000-0002-8339-6498",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1311467]; University of Colorado; University of Wisconsin Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education,"We thank Ewelina Pena, Gerardo Hidalgo-Cuellar, Nora Brown, and Pieter Johnson for support with the experiment; Mark Novak and two reviewers gave useful comments on the manuscript; and Andre De Roos provided conceptual input.

We studied the seasonal succession of phyto- and zooplankton and the potential impact of predation by salmonids on zooplankton population dynamics in a high-mountain Swiss lake. 2. A comparison of patterns in the abundance, body length, fecundity and age structure in the Daphnia galeata population strongly suggests that trout predation had little impact on the population and was not the cause for a decline in summer. 3. The dominance in the lake of adult trout that feed mainly on benthic prey may buffer the effect of predation on the larger zooplankton. Further, the relatively high amount of phytoplankton after spring thaw could be important for sustaining the Daphnia population under moderate fish predation. 4. Partial correlation analyses proved circumstantial evidence for both exploitative and interference competition between some zooplankton taxa. D. galeata depressed performance of other plankton species through exploitative competition. 5. Our study shows that the impact of fish on zooplankton in high-mountain lakes depends strongly on food web structure and trophic state of the lake. Where fish predation is weak, invertebrate predation combined with competition for food may be responsible for the dominance of large-bodied zooplankton species.","EAWAG ETH, Dept Limnol, Dubendorf, Switzerland","Winder, M (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Box 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,,,,62,24,27,2,14,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The literature on its effects is reviewed and support is found for the general conclusion that sedimentation is an important ecological factor for hard bottom organisms. Sediments deeply affect the composition, structure and dynamics of rocky coast assemblages, and increased sediment load as a consequence of anthropogenic activities can be a threat to their diversity and functioning. Sediments that accumulate on rocky substrata are important agents of stress and disturbance. They can cause burial, scour and profound modifications to the characteristics of the bottom surface, and interact with other important physical and biological processes. The effects of sedimentation are complex, because they involve both direct outcomes on settlement, recruitment, growth or survival of individual species and indirect outcomes through mediation of competitive and/or predator-prey interactions. Not all species and assemblages are equally affected by sedimentation and responses vary over space and time, depending on the characteristics of the depositional environment, life histories of species and the stage of development of individuals and assemblages, and in relation to variable physical factors, including hydrodynamics, light intensity and bottom topography. Recent studies have much improved our ability to detect and understand the effects of sedimentation on rocky coast assemblages. However, little is still known about the underlying mechanisms. Overall, our present ability to make generalisations and predictions is limited by a paucity of quantitative and experimental research, and by the scant attention devoted to measuring the regime of perturbation by sediments and responses of organisms at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Predicting the magnitude of the effects that different sedimentation regimes have on rocky coast organisms and the critical levels above which detrimental effects become manifest remains a key issue for the ecology of rocky coasts and a challenge for future studies.","Univ Bologna, Ctr Interdipartimentale Ric Sci Ambientali Ravenn, I-48100 Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Biol Evoluzionist Sperimentale, I-48100 Bologna, Italy; Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England","Airoldi, L (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Ctr Interdipartimentale Ric Sci Ambientali Ravenn, Via Agricoltura 5, I-48100 Bologna, Italy.",,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012; Airoldi, Laura/I-3553-2019","Airoldi, Laura/0000-0001-5046-0871",,,,239,406,425,0,115,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,LONDON,"11 NEW FETTER LANE, LONDON EC4P 4EE, ENGLAND",0078-3218,,,OCEANOGR MAR BIOL,,,2003,41,,,,,,161,236,,,,,76,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,BX41L,WOS:000185182700004,,,,,2021-09-27,

This phenotypic plasticity could be beneficial for stock enhancement because such plasticity suggests potential for change with adjustments to rearing protocols to achieve improved ecological competence. We examine how specific plastic responses can affect crustacean ecology through effects on predation, foraging, competition, and reproduction. For developing stock enhancement programmes, we recommend consideration of plastic phenotypic patterns before large-scale releases are initiated. Researchers can identify environmental factors that cue plasticity during hatchery rearing, determine if induced responses are ecologically influential after release into the wild, and examine the temporal scale on which phenotypic plasticity operates. Communal hatchery rearing at low-to-medium stocking densities with predator cues and natural substrates along with in situ conditioning, releases during periods of low predation risk, and coupled laboratory-field studies can contribute to improved ecological performance during stock enhancement. Finally, presentation of non-significant research results is needed to avoid bias towards hatchery-wild differences and help guide future conditioning programmes.","[Daly, Benjamin J.; Long, W.

In situ populations of Australia's iconic marsupial, the greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis), are nearing extinction due to the impacts of competition and predation by feral animals and unpredictable climatic events (summer heat waves). In this study, we focussed our aim to identify a non-invasive method to measure adrenal activity in the species and also to identify potential factors that should be considered when comparing physiological stress in semi-free ranging populations of the species. We validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detecting fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) from fresh fecal pellets taken from bilbies within four captive sites and two semi-free ranging populations around Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Our FCM EIA successfully detected the 'raise and fall' pattern of FCM levels within 3 days of exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge. Mean FCM levels differed significantly between the captive sites and between sexes. All male bilbies grouped outdoor in captivity expressed the highest mean FCM level in comparison to all captive males that were housed individually or as groups indoors. Also, semi-free ranging bilbies expressed higher mean FCM levels than the captive bilbies. Overall, our study successfully validated a non-invasive tool for monitoring physiological stress in the greater bilby. In the future, it will be worthwhile to consider factors such as housing conditions, sex and location when comparing the adrenal sensitivity to environmental changes, to help evaluate the success of management interventions (such as predator free enclosures) and support the survival of the species.","[Narayan, Edward J.; Evans, Nicole; Hero, Jean-Marc] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia","Narayan, EJ (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",e.narayan@ga.griffith.edu.au,"Narayan, Edward/E-8238-2016","Narayan, Edward/0000-0003-2719-0900",Save the Bilby Fund; Griffith UniversityGriffith University; Griffith University's Animal Ethics Committee [ENV/17/11/AEC],"This project was completed in accordance with approval from Griffith University's Animal Ethics Committee (ENV/17/11/AEC).

Consideration of natural ecological parameters are thus of key importance for our understanding of an organism's biology. Curiously, the natural ecology of the model species Caenorhabditis elegans has long been neglected, even though this nematode has become one of the most intensively studied models in biological research. This lack of interest changed similar to 10 yr ago. Since then, an increasing number of studies have focused on the nematode's natural ecology. Yet many unknowns still remain. Here, we provide an overview of the currently available information on the natural environment of C. elegans. We focus on the biotic environment, which is usually less predictable and thus can create high selective constraints that are likely to have had a strong impact on C. elegans evolution. This nematode is particularly abundant in microbe-rich environments, especially rotting plant matter such as decomposing fruits and stems. In this environment, it is part of a complex interaction network, which is particularly shaped by a species-rich microbial community. These microbes can be food, part of a beneficial gut microbiome, parasites and pathogens, and possibly competitors. C. elegans is additionally confronted with predators; it interacts with vector organisms that facilitate dispersal to new habitats, and also with competitors for similar food environments, including competitors from congeneric and also the same species. Full appreciation of this nematode's biology warrants further exploration of its natural environment and subsequent integration of this information into the well-established laboratory-based research approaches.","[Schulenburg, Hinrich] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Zool Inst, Bot Garten 9, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Felix, Marie-Anne] Univ Rech Paris Sci & Lettres, Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, CNRS,INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France","Schulenburg, H (corresponding author), Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Zool Inst, Bot Garten 9, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.; Felix, MA (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75230 Paris 05, France.",hschulenburg@zoologie.uni-kiel.de; felix@biologie.ens.fr,"Schulenburg, Hinrich/A-3886-2009",,Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Norma Superieure; Fondation pour la Recherche MedicaleFondation pour la Recherche Medicale [Equipe FRM DEQ20150331704]; Agence Nationale pour la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-14-CE10-0003-02]; German Science Foundation within the Collaborative Research Center 1182 on the origin and function of metaorganisms,"We thank Christian Braendle and the reviewers for helpful suggestions on the manuscript.

Although regeneration may appear to be obviously beneficial, and many specific advantages to regeneration of lost portions have been demonstrated, comparisons of regeneration among species of sponges have consistently revealed substantial differences in style (i.e., relative rates of reconstituting surface features, infilling depressions, regaining lost primary substratum), and overall time course, raising questions about adaptive significance of variations in patterns of regeneration. Do sponges simply regenerate as quickly as possible, given constraints imposed by skeletal construction, morphology, or other traits that are determined primarily by evolutionary heritage? Does allocation of energy or materials impose trade-offs between regeneration versus competing processes such as growth or reproduction? Is regeneration time-course and style an integral part of coherent life history and morphological strategies? One approach to answering these questions is to compare regeneration among species that represent a spectrum of higher taxa within the demosponges as well as different growth forms and life-history strategies. Because detailed ecological studies of sponges have tended to focus on small sets of species of the same growth form, community-wide comparisons have been hampered. Data on growth rate, colonization, mortality, susceptibility to predation, and competitive ability have recently been accumulated for species of sponges typical of the Caribbean mangrove prop-root community. Experimentally generated wounds in individuals of 13 of these species allow comparison of the timing and style of regeneration among sponge species that span a range of life histories and growth forms. The species chosen represent four orders of the class Demospongiae, and include four sets of congeneric species, allowing distinction of patterns related to life history and morphology from those determined by shared evolutionary heritage.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32303 USA","Wulff, J (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32303 USA.",wulff@bio.fsu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0550599]; Marine Science Network of the Smithsonian Institution; Hunterdon Oceanographic Research Endowment; National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0940753] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (Grant number 0550599); the Marine Science Network of the Smithsonian Institution, supported in part by the Hunterdon Oceanographic Research Endowment; and the Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems Program (CCRE) of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution.",,28,27,27,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

We used laboratory experiments to show that damselfly larvae, Ischnura verticalis, suffer higher predation rates from pumpkinseed sunfish in low-density vegetation. However, larvae do not preferentially occupy microhabitats with high vegetation density in either the presence or absence of sunfish; when given a choice, the number of larvae per stem of vegetation was equal across all densities of vegetation. That larvae do not congregate in dense vegetation may reflect costs of aggressive interactions. Results from laboratory experiments indicated larval interactions increase conspicuous behaviours (most notably swimming) and consequently increase fish predation. A subsequent experiment indicated that frequency of larval interactions increases with increased vegetation density when number of larvae/stem is constant. Thus, larval microhabitat selection may reflect a trade-off between reduced risk of predation in areas of high vegetation density, caused by reduced fish foraging ability, and increased aggressive larval interactions, due to decreased proximity of larvae.

The anatomic and physiological explanations of why body size determines this hierarchy are embodied within the concept of gape limitation. The relaxation of gape limitation and an increase in energetic demands due to predators' larger body size determine the size and diversity of prey species. However, these patterns may be related to further trends in trophic interactions with body size, which have been less considered. Specifically, the passive incorporation of prey should involve a nested distribution of prey among predator size classes. However, predators avoid smaller resources because of their low energy return, with a clumped distribution of prey potentially generating modular organization with qualitative changes in prey identity (e.g. zooplankton, macroinvertebrates and fishes). Finally, size-mediated interactions (such as direct and indirect competition) may cause predators of similar body size to differentiate among prey organisms, resulting in a checkerboard distribution of prey identity. Consequently, nestedness, modularity and checkerboard distributions of prey among predators of different size classes should form emergent network structures that are directly related to clear ecological mechanisms. We analyse these predictions in a killifish guild, where trends in trophic positions, prey richness, evenness and the number of energy sources systematically scale with body size. We found significant nestedness and segregation in diet among different size classes, supporting the progressive incorporation of prey items coupled with prey differentiation among similar classes. However, we also detected an anti-modular' trend, which contradicts theoretical expectations and previous results. We hypothesize that this anti-modularity is determined by the high biodiversity of the system and the continuous representation of prey size classes. These results reinforce the concept of size-mediated interactions and its connection with community biodiversity as a main structuring force of food webs.","[Ortiz, Esteban; Arim, Matias] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol Evoluc, Igua 4225 Piso 9 SurCP, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Ortiz, Esteban; Arim, Matias] Univ Republ, Dept Ecol Teor & Aplicada, CURE, Maldonado, Uruguay","Ortiz, E (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol Evoluc, Igua 4225 Piso 9 SurCP, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay.; Ortiz, E (corresponding author), Univ Republ, Dept Ecol Teor & Aplicada, CURE, Maldonado, Uruguay.",estebanortizgrandal@gmail.com,,,grant ANII-Beca de Iniciacion a la Investigacion [INI_X_2013_1_101006]; grant Fondo Clemente Estable [FCE 2014_1_104763],This work was funded by grant ANII-Beca de Iniciacion a la Investigacion (INI_X_2013_1_101006) to E.

Nonetheless, invertebrates are abundant predators in terrestrial ecosystems, and some invertebrates (e. g., centipedes, spiders) attack and consume vertebrates. We used a combination of field data and laboratory experiments to determine whether a predatory centipede (Scolopendridae: Cormocephalus sp.) influences habitat selection by the nocturnal rock-dwelling velvet gecko, Oedura lesueurii. In the field, centipedes and geckos were syntopic, and sheltered beneath rocks with similar physical dimensions, thermal regimes and degree of sun exposure. Nonetheless, geckos rarely shared rocks with centipedes in the field. In laboratory trials, both geckos and centipedes selected shelters with narrow rather than wide crevices. The presence of a centipede modified habitat selection by juvenile geckos, which preferred wide crevices without centipedes to narrow crevices containing centipedes. In contrast, adult geckos continued to select narrow crevices even if these contained centipedes. When we added centipedes to narrow crevices beneath small and large rocks occupied by geckos, both juvenile and adult geckos exited the crevice (especially if it was under a small rather than large rock). Our results show that centipedes influence habitat selection by velvet geckos, and demonstrate that anti-predator behaviours of geckos are both size-and context-dependent. Ontogenetic shifts in behaviour and habitat selection by vertebrates in response to invertebrate predators may be widespread.","[Pike, David A.; Croak, Benjamin M.; Webb, Jonathan K.; Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Pike, DA (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",david.pike22@gmail.com,"Pike, David A/B-2032-2012","Webb, Jonathan/0000-0003-4822-6829; Croak, Benjamin/0000-0003-4191-5891","Australian Reptile Park, Australian Research Council, Forests New South WalesAustralian Research Council; Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Authority, New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change; Zoos Victoria; Australian Department of Education, Science and TrainingAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; University of SydneyUniversity of Sydney","We thank Nathan Psaila, Betsy Roznik and Alisa Sannikova for assistance.

Tadpoles and invertebrate predators were sampled in 38 ponds of different sizes and degrees of permanence. The collections were carried out twice, in spring 2007 and summer 2008. We ordinated guild composition in ponds in a single dimension through a non-metric multidimensional scaling. The relationships between tadpole richness and guild composition with environmental descriptors were tested through multiple regression. The species were classified into six guilds. Species richness increased with the abundance of predators and the mean water depth in summer. The ordination of guild composition was explained by permanence and mean depth in summer. Our results indicated a clear guild replacement through a permanence-depth gradient, confirming permanence as an important environmental filter. Therefore, most rich ponds would not contain species from all groups, and even very small, shallow and ephemeral ponds are important, given that some species groups are exclusive to such habitats.","[Both, Camila] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Both, Camila] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Zool, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Cechin, Sonia Zanini] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dep Biol, BR-97119900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Melo, Adriano S.; Hartz, Sandra M.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dep Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Melo, Adriano S.] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dep Ecol, Goiania, Go, Brazil","Both, C (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Av Ipiranga 6681, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",camilaboth@gmail.com,"Both, Camila/I-3656-2013; Cechin, Sonia T.

Studies of social vigilance often consider how group size or nearby conspecifics influence vigilance levels. Less is known about how more specific social variables, such as relative rank and kinship of a subject's neighbours, affect vigilance of wild animals along with predation risk. To evaluate alternative functional hypotheses for vigilance behaviour, including predator detection and both extra-and within-group conspecific monitoring, we investigated how predation risk and social factors account for variation in vigilance in wild blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis, which show strong aggressive competition between groups and mild aggression within them. Studying 18 adult females in two groups, we measured time spent vigilant in 90 s focal samples, recording the subject's activity, microhabitat conditions and identity of neighbours. We used data on dominance ranks and kinship to assess subject-specific social context for each sample. We compared generalized linear mixed models corresponding to each hypothesized function of vigilance, relating variation in vigilance to factors associated with a particular function. The best model related vigilance to predictor variables of all three functions, including recency of an antipredator event, height in canopy, position in forest (edge/interior), recency of an intergroup encounter, number of nearby kin, subject rank and presence of high-ranking neighbours. Overall, most variation in vigilance related to predation risk and between-group competition, while within-group social factors had smaller effects. The range of predictors suggests that vigilance behaviour serves multiple functions, including predator detection and both extragroup and intragroup conspecific monitoring. Species with different social systems might be expected to show different balances of factors that influence vigilance behaviour. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Many reef fish species have very restricted home ranges after settlement and, here, we quantify home-range size in juveniles of a widespread and abundant reef fish in New Zealand, the common triplefin (Forsterygion lapillum). We conducted visual observations on 49 juveniles (mean size=35-mm total length) within the Wellington harbour, New Zealand. Home ranges were extremely small, 0.053m(2)+/- 0.029 (mean +/- s.d.) and were unaffected by adult density, body size or substrate composition. A regression tree indicated that home-range size sharply decreased similar to 4.5 juvenilesm(-2) and a linear mixed model confirmed that home-range sizes in high-density areas (>4.5 juvenilesm(-2)) were significantly smaller (34%) than those in low-density areas (after accounting for a significant effect of fish movement on our home-range estimates). Our results suggest that conspecific density may have negative and non-linear effects on home-range size, which could shape the spatial distribution of juveniles within a population, as well as influence individual fitness across local density gradients.","[Mensink, Paul J.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Shima, Jeffrey S.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Victoria, New Zealand; [Shima, Jeffrey S.] Victoria Univ, Coastal Ecol Lab, 396 Esplanade, Wellington, New Zealand","Mensink, PJ (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",pjmensink@gmail.com,"Shima, Jeffrey/AAH-3702-2021","Shima, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5770-4859; Mensink, Paul/0000-0003-4036-7088","'OBI Coasts and Oceans' grant from the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology; Marsden grantRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)","This research was funded by an 'OBI Coasts and Oceans' grant from the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology that was awarded to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric science (NIWA) with a subcontract to J.

Here, we report on an experiment in which we examine the response of two gerbil species (Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum) to the presence of a snake predator, the desert diadema snake (Spalerosophus diadema), and to added illumination (a factor associated with increased risk of predation from owls). We measured rodent foraging behavior by the number of seed trays foraged in each microhabitat and amount of seed resources left in patches following exploitation by gerbils (giving-up densities; GUDs). Fewer seed trays foraged and higher GUDs are indicative of higher perceived predatory risk. Accordingly, both species foraged fewer seed trays in response to illumination, and G. pyramidum foraged fewer trays in the bush microhabitat. In response to the presence of snakes, G. pyramidum foraged fewer resource patches in the absence of added illumination. Overall, this species preferred the open microhabitat and may have intensified its use of the open in the presence of snakes. In contrast, G. allenbyi intensified its use of the bush microhabitat in the presence of added illumination. Both gerbil species left resource patches at a higher GUD in response to illumination and to snakes. While the GUD of G. allenbyi did not differ between microhabitats, G. pyramidum had a higher GUD in the bush than open microhabitat. Thus, gerbils altered their use of resource patches in response to the risk of predation. Predator facilitation is a higher order interaction in which the presence of one predator species makes it easier for another predator to capture prey. Predator facilitation may result when different predators place conflicting demands on the appropriate behavioral response of their prey. This requires that prey can distinguish among predator species and respond accordingly. We have previously shown experimentally that predation by owls causes G. allenbyi and G. pyramidum to alter their foraging activity; they shift their foraging effort away from risky patches in the open microhabitat and towards safer patches in the bush. Our current work shows that the gerbils also respond to snakes, and their response to snakes is qualitatively different than their response to owls. In accord with predator facilitation, our results support the hypothesis that owls exert a greater risk in the open microhabitat, and snakes may pose a greater threat in the bush microhabitat.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT BIOL SCI,CHICAGO,IL 60680","KOTLER, BP (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL,JACOB BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES,IL-84993 SEDE BOQER,ISRAEL.",,"Slotow, Rob/AAM-9053-2020; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Slotow, Rob/0000-0001-9469-1508",,,,41,100,103,1,40,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,1993,67,2,,,,,309,316,,10.2307/3545476,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LF016,WOS:A1993LF01600014,,,,,2021-09-27,

Three types of shrub habitats with intermediate cover levels along with alpine meadow inside the valley were equally preferred by the hares, whereas willow-rhododendron, with the densest cover, was avoided. Transect surveys showed that the hare population density in the preferred habitats was 13 ind./km(2) in spring and 27 ind./km(2) in autumn.

However, few studies test ecological hypotheses of predation in multi-predator microbial communities. The phytotelmic community found within the water-filled leaves of the pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, exhibits a simple trophic structure that includes multiple protozoan predators and microbial prey. Using this system, we sought to determine whether different predators target distinct microorganisms, how interactions among protozoans affect resource (microorganism) use, and how predator diversity affects prey community diversity. In particular, we endeavored to determine if protozoa followed known ecological patterns such as keystone predation or generalist predation. For these experiments, replicate inquiline microbial communities were maintained for seven days with five protozoan species. Microbial community structure was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (iTag) and analysis. Compared to the control (no protozoa), two ciliates followed patterns of keystone predation by increasing microbial evenness. In pairwise competition treatments with a generalist flagellate, prey communities resembled the microbial communities of the respective keystone predator in monoculture. The relative abundance of the most common bacterial Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) in our system decreased compared to the control in the presence of these ciliates. This OTU was 98% similar to a known chitin degrader and nitrate reducer, important functions for the microbial community and the plant host. Collectively, the data demonstrated that predator identity had a greater effect on prey diversity and composition than overall predator diversity.","[Canter, Erin J.; Mason, Olivia U.] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Cuellar-Gempeler, Catalina; Pastore, Abigail I.; Miller, Thomas E.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Mason, OU (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",omason@fsu.edu,"Mason, Olivia/AAP-2627-2021",,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1456425],This research was funded by the US National Science Foundation (DEB1456425) to TEM and OUM.,,46,5,5,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2018,99,3,,,,,652,660,,10.1002/ecy.2128,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FY0KK,WOS:000426499800014,29370451,hybrid,,,2021-09-27,

The relative importance of bottom-up effects by host plants and top-down effects by natural enemies on offspring performance were determined using field and laboratory experiments. In both years, egg density on blue cohosh was significantly higher than on thistle. A laboratory experiment demonstrated that larval survival from hatching to adult emergence was significantly higher, and developmental period shorter when larvae were reared on blue cohosh compared to thistle. The positive preference-performance linkage varied between years in the field. Top-down effects had a different impact on larval survival on the two host plant species. Arthropod predators, a lady beetle Harmonia axyridis and an earwig Forficula mikado, considerably depressed immature survival on thistle, while they were negligible on blue cohosh. Although the lack of effective predation increased larval survival on blue cohosh, it led to defoliation due to increased larval feeding late in the season. Because of severe intraspecific competition, old larvae had significantly lower survival on blue cohosh than on thistle. In 1994, as larval survival decreased due to defoliation on blue cohosh, the overall survival rate was significantly higher on thistle than on blue cohosh. This survival pattern was opposite to that found in the laboratory experiment. In contrast, in 1995, the increase in predatory lady beetles on thistle caused greater larval mortality. Thus, the overall survival was significantly lower on thistle than on blue cohosh, although severe intraspecific competition occurred on blue cohosh as it had in 1994. Consequently, the offspring performance on the two host plants is largely determined by the relative importance of arthropod predation determining larval survival on thistle and host plant defoliation reducing late larval survival on blue cohosh. These results indicate the important role of spatial and temporal variability of natural enemies on the preference-performance linkage of herbivorous insects.","Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan","Ohgushi, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Kamitanakami Hirano Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",,,,,,,42,32,34,0,8,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1999,119,2,,,,,183,190,,10.1007/s004420050775,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,196RJ,WOS:000080321100005,28307967,,,,2021-09-27,

To better understand the influence of sedimentation, it is important to clarify whether it alters the habitat required by fish, or merely preferred by them. We conducted two enclosure experiments in the field to examine (i) whether an endangered benthic fish, Cobitis shikokuensis, prefers sediment-free substrate and (ii) whether fine sediment deposition has negative effects on the physiological condition of C.shikokuensis. The first experiment, which used three types of substrates, cobble', pebble' and mixture of fine sediment and pebbles', showed that C.shikokuensis avoided the mixture. The second experiment, which compared the physiological condition of fish reared in enclosures with either a pebble or mixture substrate, showed that the condition of the fish in the latter group declined more quickly. These results suggest that, for C.shikokuensis, sediment-free substrate is a habitat requirement, not merely a preference, and that excessive input of fine sediment due to human activities can cause a decline in the population of this species.","[Kawanishi, Ryota; Dohi, Ryota; Fujii, Asuka; Inoue, Mikio] Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan","Kawanishi, R (corresponding author), Publ Works Res Inst, Water Environm Res Grp, 1-6 Minamihara, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan.",kawanishi.r@gmail.com,"Kawanishi, Ryota/S-7598-2018","Kawanishi, Ryota/0000-0003-1605-6757","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan [S9];  [23.9280]","We would like to thank C.

Without manipulative experiments, assessing the role of foraging ecology and interspecific competition in structuring diet is challenging. Systems with regular pulses of resources act as a natural experiment to investigate the factors that influence the dietary niches of consumers. We used natural pulses of mast-fruiting of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) to test whether optimal foraging or competition structure the dietary niche breadth and overlap between two congener rodent species (Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus), both of which are generalist consumers. We reconstructed diets seasonally over a 2-year period using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15) of hair and of potential dietary items and measured niche dynamics using standard ellipse area calculated within a Bayesian framework. Changes in niche breadth were generally consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory, with both species consuming more beechnuts (a high-quality food resource) and having a narrower niche breadth during masting seasons compared to nonmasting seasons when dietary niches expanded and more fungi (a low-quality food source) were consumed. In contrast, changes in dietary niche overlap were consistent with competition theory, with higher diet overlap during masting seasons than during nonmasting seasons. Overall, dietary niche dynamics were closely tied to beech masting, underscoring that food availability influences competition. Diet plasticity and niche partitioning between the two Peromyscus species may reflect differences in foraging strategies, thereby reducing competition when food availability is low. Such dietary shifts may have important implications for changes in ecosystem function, including the dispersal of fungal spores.","[Stephens, Ryan B.; Lee, Thomas D.; Rowe, Rebecca J.] Univ New Hampshire, Nat Resources & Environm, 114 James Hall,56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Hobbie, Erik A.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Stephens, RB (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Nat Resources & Environm, 114 James Hall,56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",rbd8@wildcats.unh.edu,,"Stephens, Ryan/0000-0001-8524-9873","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Project [0229197, 1006881]; University of New Hampshire NRESS Student Support Fund; New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Project, Grant/Award Number: 0229197 and 1006881; University of New Hampshire NRESS Student Support Fund; New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station",,75,5,5,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

This study investigates the vertical distribution of microbial biomass, meiofauna and macrofauna with respect to organic matter variation in Ubatuba, Brazil, a southeastern, subtropical coastal area. On three occasions, samples were collected in exposed and sheltered stations, at high and low hydrodynamic conditions. We hypothesize that benthic assemblages will have high meio- and macrofaunal densities and high microbial biomass at the sediment surface at the sheltered site, and lower and vertically homogeneous microbial biomass and densities of meio- and macrofauna are expected at the exposed site. The accumulation of fresh organic matter at the sediment surface was observed at both stations over the three sampling dates, which contributed to the higher densities of meiofauna in the first layers of the sediment column. Macrofauna followed the same trend only at the exposed station, but changes in the number of species, biodiversity and feeding groups were registered for both stations. Microbial biomass increased at the sheltered station over the three sampling dates, whereas at the exposed station, microbial biomass was nearly constant. Physical exposure did not influence organic matter loading at the sites and therefore did not affect overall structure of benthic assemblages, which negates our original hypothesis. Most of the benthic system components reacted to organic matter quality and quantity, but relationships between different-sized organisms (i.e. competition and/or predation) may explain the unchanged microbial profiles at the exposed site and homogeneous vertical distribution of macrofauna at the sheltered site. In conclusion, the high quality of organic matter was a crucial factor in sustaining and regulating the benthic system, but coupled results showed that interactions between micro-, meio- and macrofauna can be highly complex.","[Quintana, Cintia O.; Yoshinaga, Marcos Y.; Sumida, Paulo Y.

In 2004 and 2005, we investigated whether carnivore species richness and abundance were associated with management of domestic dogs and recreational visitation in protected areas in northern California. We surveyed for mammalian carnivores and human visitors in 21 recreation areas in which dogs were allowed offleash or onleash or were excluded, and we compared our observations in the recreation areas with observations in seven reference sites that were not open to the public. Carnivore abundance and species richness did not differ among the three types of recreation areas, but native carnivore species richness was 1.7 times greater (p < 0.01) and the relative abundances of native coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Lynx rufus) were over four times greater (p < 0.01) in the reference sites. Abundances of bobcats and all carnivores declined as the number of visitors increased. The policy on domestic dogs did not appear to affect species richness and abundance of mammalian carnivores. But the number of dogs we observed was strongly associated with human visitation (R-2 = 0.54), so the key factors associated with recreational effects on carnivores appear to be the presence and number of human visitors to protected areas.","[Reed, Sarah E.; Merenlender, Adina M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Reed, SE (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",sarah.reed@colostate.edu,,"MERENLENDER, Adina/0000-0002-0681-8642","Budweiser Conservation Scholarship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Phi Beta Kappa Doctoral Fellowship; Sigma Xi; Switzer Environmental Fellowship; Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management","We are grateful to the agencies, organizations, and private landowners who granted us permission to survey their properties.

However, relatively little attention has been paid to seasonal adaptation, in part, because it requires complex and integrative knowledge about seasonally fluctuating environmental factors, the effects of variable phenology on exposure to those factors, and evidence for temporal specialization. In the European corn borer moth, Ostrinia nubilalis, sympatric pheromone strains exploit the same host plant (Zea mays) but may genetically differ in phenology and be reproductively isolated by time. Z strain populations in eastern North America have been shown to have a prolonged larval diapause and produce one annual mating flight (July), whereas E strain populations complete an earlier (June) and a later (August) mating flight by shortening diapause duration. Here, we find evidence consistent with seasonal adaptation by time between these ecotypes. Results We use 12 years of field observation of adult seasonal abundance to estimate phenology of ecotype life cycles and to quantify life-stage specific climatic conditions. We find that the observed reduction of diapause duration in the E strain leads their non-diapausing, active life stages to experience a similar to 4 degrees C colder environment compared to the equivalent life stages in the Z strain. For a representative pair of populations under controlled laboratory conditions, we compare life-stage specific cold tolerance and find non-diapausing, active life stages in the E strain have as much as a 60% greater capacity to survive rapid cold shock. Enhanced cold hardiness appears unrelated to life-stage specific changes in the temperature at which tissues freeze. Conclusions Our results suggest that isolation by time and adaptation by time may both contribute to population divergence, and they argue for expanded study in this species of allochronic populations in nature experiencing the full spectrum of seasonal environments. Cyclical selective pressures are inherent properties of seasonal habitats. Diverse fluctuating selective agents across each year (temperature, predation, competition, precipitation, etc.) may therefore be underappreciated drivers of biological diversity.","[Wadsworth, Crista B.; Okada, Yuta; Dopman, Erik B.] Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, 200 Boston Ave,Suite 4700, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Wadsworth, Crista B.] Rochester Inst Technol, Thomas H Gosnell Sch Life Sci, 85 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA","Wadsworth, CB; Dopman, EB (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, 200 Boston Ave,Suite 4700, Medford, MA 02155 USA.; Wadsworth, CB (corresponding author), Rochester Inst Technol, Thomas H Gosnell Sch Life Sci, 85 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",cbwsbi@rit.edu; erik.dopman@tufts.edu,,"Dopman, Erik/0000-0002-8633-5527","United States Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2010-65106-20610]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1257251, 2011116050]",The study was funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (2010-65106-20610 to EBD) and the National Science Foundation (DEB1257251 to EBD; 2011116050 to CBW).,,73,3,3,1,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2148,,,BMC EVOL BIOL,BMC Evol.

However, the intensity of predation can vary dramatically among habitats. The habitat can directly affect the interaction between predator and prey; but also, by determining the distributions of predators and prey, the habitat can mediate the likelihood of a predatory encounter. Here, we used laboratory experiments to identify the likely predators of juvenile abalone Haliotis iris on temperate reefs in central New Zealand. Predator performance in the laboratory was assessed in conditions without prey refuge, in simulated juvenile habitat as well as in the presence of alternate prey. We then used surveys to compare the abundance of predators and juvenile abalone to explore if negative associations between predator and prey in the laboratory manifest in the field. Last, we manipulated algal habitat complexity at 2 depths and quantified the effect of predator exclusion on juvenile abalone survival in the field. We found that starfish were the likely predators of juvenile H. iris in our study system. Furthermore, predation of juvenile abalone by starfish was lowest in habitats with the greatest structural complexity, and there is evidence that predation by starfish in cobble habitats was size-dependent. Overall, we found that habitat variability mediates predation on juvenile abalone by determining the likelihood of an encounter between predator and prey.","[Aguirre, J.

Slowly moving odour-mediated predators that have a high capacity for temporal integration of signals can successfully navigate prey odour plumes in naturally turbulent environments, but their ability to do this in response to different distributions of prey in patches has not been assessed. We challenged knobbed whelk, Busycon carica, predators to detect and navigate to hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, prey patches with different distributions of individuals at two densities (three clams/patch: parallel versus perpendicular arrangement relative to the direction of water flow; 10 clams/patch: aggregated versus random distribution) in laboratory assays to better understand how prey-generated mixing impacts time-averaging predators. Whelks decreased navigational efficiency (movement speed and path linearity) and increased spatial sampling (scanning) in perpendicular treatments at low densities, but these did not result in differences in success. No differences in whelk foraging efficiency, incidence of spatial sampling or success were seen at high prey densities. Increased mixing at high and low prey density (parallel treatment only) may have mitigated information about the distribution of prey individuals within patches and accounted for our results. The whelks' ability to utilize time-averaging strategies effectively to extract information from odour plumes regardless of prey distribution allowed them to maintain foraging success and may enable them to occupy specific sensory niches that could reduce competition with other odour-mediated predators over resources.

Most studies that have provided evidence supporting the APH in arctic bird populations have been conducted in the eastern hemisphere, and considerably less evidence for APH has emerged from western hemisphere populations. We tested the hypothesis that predation pressure on shorebird nests would increase as lemming abundance decreases due to apparent competition between lemmings and shorebirds via their shared predators in the eastern Canadian High Arctic. Over a period of 5 years on By lot Island, Nunavut, Canada, we found that lemming abundance had a significant negative effect on predation risk as measured by artificial nests. Survival probabilities of artificial nests were also negatively related to fox abundance but positively associated with the abundance of breeding avian predators, likely due to predator exclusion around avian predator nests. Models of daily nest survival for real nests also indicated that interannual variation in nest survival was best explained by lemming abundance. Combined results from both artificial and real nests indicate that fluctuations in lemming populations likely have an indirect effect on predation pressure on shorebird eggs in the Canadian High Arctic, although mechanisms explaining the observed relationship require further investigation.","Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada","McKinnon, L (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",laura.mckinnon3@gmail.com,"Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016","Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985; Bety, Joel/0000-0002-8775-6411",Fonds Quebecois de recherche sur la nature et les technologies (FQRNT)FQRNT; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Environment CanadaCGIAR; W.

This is especially true for morphological plasticity in amphibian larvae induced by predators and competitors. This paper describes a seven-year survey of head and tail shape in eight species of anuran and newt larvae in northern Switzerland, involving 6824 individual larvae and 59 ponds. I tested relationships between geometric measures of size and shape and five habitat gradients: pond permanence, cover by forest canopy and aquatic vegetation, and the densities of predators and competitors. Responses to competitors and predators were often similar to those reported in experiments. High competitor density was associated with small size and a large head in newt larvae, a long or deep head/body in anuran larvae, and a short or shallow tail in newts and some tadpoles. High predator density was correlated with a deep tail fin and tail muscle in many species. In anurans, the change in shape between low-and high-predator ponds in nature closely paralleled the plastic response to nonlethal predators in mesocosm experiments. The survey revealed many previously undescribed relationships between morphology and the other habitat features. Several species had relatively large tails in ponds that were shaded or thickly vegetated. Associations between year-to-year changes in shape and habitat within ponds implicated phenotypic plasticity rather than genetic population divergence, at least in anurans. These results inspire confidence in the relevance of experiments and highlight many new patterns that will merit further study.","Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Van Buskirk, J (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",jvb@zool.uzh.ch,,"Van Buskirk, Josh/0000-0002-0486-3626",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission,"I am grateful to more than 40 people for their help in the field, including especially J.

While in the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific regions they are conspicuous elements of the reef community, in the tropical Southwestern Atlantic (Brazil) branching corals are lacking and massive forms dominate. The only branching forms that occur in Brazil are stinging fire-corals of genus Millepora (Hydrozoa). Preliminary observations showed that several fish species seek refuge within fire-corals in Brazil, suggesting that they may replace the functional role played by scleractinians in other regions. Here, the association of fishes to individual fire-coral colonies (Millepora alcicornis and M. brasiliensis) and the relationship between fire-coral cover and fish abundance was studied in eastern Brazil. A total of 38 fish species from 18 families (37 % of the regional species pool) were recorded within fire-corals. Most records were of relatively small-bodied fishes and juveniles of large-bodied fishes. Comparative observations between day and night indicated that fire-corals are used as sleeping sites by a few species. Volume of colonies was positively correlated with fish abundance and species richness. Over a large spatial scale (tens of kilometers) fire-coral cover had a positive and significant influence on the abundance of three fish species only (Abudefduf saxatilis, Acanthurus coeruleus and Microspatodon chrysurus). Although physical attributes of colonies and fire-coral cover may help to account for some of the spatial variability in fish abundance, fire-corals may be considered as an alternative instead of a critical microhabitat for fish. The advantages and drawbacks of living in a branching and stinging environment are discussed.","[Francini-Filho, Ronaldo Bastos] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Engn & Meio Ambiente, BR-58297000 Rio Tinto, PB, Brazil; [Kaufman, Les] Boston Univ, Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Cavalcanti Coni, Ericka Oliveira; Ferreira, Camilo Moitinho] Univ Estadual Paraiba, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-58109753 Campina Grande, PB, Brazil; [de Moura, Rodrigo Leao] Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidad, BR-45650000 Ilheus, BA, Brazil; [Meirelles, Pedro Milet] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Genet, BR-21944970 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Francini, RB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Engn & Meio Ambiente, Rua Mangueira S-N, BR-58297000 Rio Tinto, PB, Brazil.",rofilho@yahoo.com,"Meirelles, Pedro/AAK-5942-2021; Francini-Filho, Ronaldo/I-5708-2012; de Moura, Rodrigo Leao/AAL-5781-2020; Meirelles, Pedro/AAL-4542-2020; Ferreira, Camilo M/M-9427-2015","Meirelles, Pedro/0000-0002-1306-0331; Francini-Filho, Ronaldo/0000-0002-7678-6797; de Moura, Rodrigo Leao/0000-0002-5597-6196; Ferreira, Camilo M/0000-0001-9022-1963",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico/Pro-Abrolhos and Conservation International (CI),"We thank G.

Experiments were set up to: (1) contrast the response of the length of fronds and coverage of the brown alga Cystoseira compressa to the removal of algal turfs and mussels in habitats dominated by these organisms; (2) test whether any effect of mussels on C. compressa was consistent in space (at scales ranging from 1 to 1000 m) and as a function of the presence of limpets; (3) test for the temporal consistency in any effect of limpets on the development of macroalgae in habitat dominated by mussels and (4) test for spatial consistency in the temporal patterns of algal recovery in this habitat. Removal of the algal turfs had no effect on the length of fronds of C. compressa; no effect was observed on its coverage but this result was probably confounded by artifacts. In contrast, mussels had both positive and negative effects on C. compressa. The mean length of fronds of this alga was significantly reduced by the removal of mussels, this effect being particularly evident after a period of severe storms occurring soon after the initiation of the experiment. A possible mechanism to explain this could involve the stabilisation of the basal fronds of the plants, because mussels were often packed around them. Conversely, the coverage of C. compressa increased significantly after the removal of the mussels, this effect probably resulting from the inhibition of recruitment of the alga. The effects of mussels were consistent in space and almost independent of the presence of Limpets. In contrast, the herbivores influenced the temporal changes in abundance of the coarsely-branched algae and articulated corallines, but not those of the filamentous and foliose algae or of C. compressa. Finally, no space-time interactions were found in the analyses of variance, indicating that the course of succession was consistent among areas distributed along a stretch of shore about 1.5 km in length. The results of this study suggest that the assemblage of species dominated by mussels on the rocky coasts south of Livorno was not a highly interactive system.

Meiofaunal colonization of azoic sediment was studied in cages designed to exclude macrofauna to varying degrees. In all the cages high diversity assemblages developed rapidly. Considerable variation in species composition was found, both for nematodes and harpacticoids, and no indication that exclusion of the macrofauna was influencing the early colonizing individuals. For the harpacticoid species the results from multivariate analyses indicated a strong successional pattern inside the cages. However such a pattern was not obvious for the nematode component of the meiofauna. The semi-pelagic harpacticoid copepod Longipedia helgolandica became extremely abundant inside the cages, while it was hardly found in the background sediment. The initial colonization by most of the harpacticoids was marked by a high proportion of copepodites. The exclusion of macroepifauna did not result in a simpler meiofaunal community as one would expect if suppression of dominant competitive relationships by macroepifauna occurred. This study emphasizes the complexity of the community organization, where multitrophic relationships may be of vital importance as factors influencing community structure.","HERIOT WATT UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, EDINBURGH EH14 4AS, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",,,"Olafsson, Emil/D-4916-2012",,,,,78,18,20,0,4,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

BRACHYURA; GREEN CRAB; SETTLEMENT; PREDATION; MEGALOPAE; BEHAVIOR; COAST; PORTUNIDAE,"Previous studies on intra-specific interactions among green shore crabs have been undertaken in very large populations, in which individuals concentrate at high densities in physically complex substrates. Under such conditions, cannibalism and interference competition often override initial density patterns delivered by larval supply. In this study, we focused on a Carcinus maenas population receiving a low supply of settlers. We reported crab abundance in habitats of different physical structure, and measured cannibalistic interactions, in different substrates, at a prey density expected only after a major recruitment event. Different predator and prey sizes were used to verify if juveniles from a critical range attain a size refuge when coexisting with sub-adults, which are still commonly found in the nursery habitat. Virtually no juvenile shore crabs were found on sandy habitats, and differences between sparsely and densely vegetated cover were only detected shortly after a settlement pulse, indicating that nursery habitats are under their carrying capacity most of the time. Even under extreme high densities, cannibalism on juveniles of 10 mm carapace width (CW) remained undetected, and predation on crabs half this size was only significant in low and medium Zostera cover, when larger predators (20-25 mm CW) were included in experimental plots. The allometric model predicted the non-linear decrease of predation rate as a function of relative prey size, with a nearly asymptotic value of one prey consumed each 5 d by one predator in a square metre, when relative prey size attains 0.6. Such a relationship is expected for 'cruising' predators which rely on encounter rate. Growth estimates obtained using time series of the catch of distinct juvenile stages in artificial collectors indicated that crabs surviving 50 d after settlement have attained a size refuge from predation by larger conspecifics.

In this study, we assessed the utilization of space, time and prey resources by tigers Panthera tigris, leopards P. pardus and dholes Cuon alpinus in Manas National Park (MNP), India - a site where prey densities are not limiting, yet anthropogenic influences alter the spatial and temporal behaviour of prey. We use photographic capture data and predator scats collected over three sampling years (2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17) to assess patterns of (a) spatial use using a multispecies species occupancy framework, (b) time-activity patterns and overlap between predators and prey using non-parametric circular kernel-density functions, (c) fine-scale spatio-temporal behaviour by comparing time-to-encounters of subsequent events and (d) predator diets by analysing prey remains in predator scats. Our results highlight that the predators segregate through fine-scale spatio-temporal avoidance rather than displaying population-level changes in space-use, activity patterns or food habits. Overlap in space-use between tigers and leopards was high and time-activity patterns of the predators closely matched those of prey, suggesting that predators likely maximize resource acquisition in this prey-rich environment. Ungulate prey dominated the diet of predators, resulting in the high dietary overlap. From our results, we infer patterns of sympatry among large carnivores in the face of anthropogenic influences and highlight the need to understand interspecific interactions within a community before initiating conservation actions aimed at recovering these endangered species.","[Lahkar, D.; Ahmed, M.

Three-day-old S. couchii tadpoles reduced hatching success of B. speciosus eggs by nearly 90%. When S. couchii and B. speciosus eggs were laid the same day, S. couchii tadpoles reduced B. speciosus egg survivorship by 56%.

Reefs around Zanzibar are exposed to untreated sewage and runoff from the main city Stonetown. At many of these sites, sponge cover has increased over the last years. Sponges are one of the top spatial competitors on reefs worldwide. Their success is, in part, dependent on their strong chemical defenses against predators, microbial attacks and other sessile benthic competitors. This is the first study that investigates the bioactive properties of sponge species in the Western Indian Ocean region. Crude extracts of the ten most dominant sponge species were assessed for their chemical defenses against 35 bacterial strains (nine known as marine pathogens) using disc diffusion assays and general cytotoxic activities were assessed with brine shrimp lethality assays. The three chemically most active sponge species were additionally tested for their allelopathic properties against the scleractinian coral competitor Porites sp.. The antimicrobial assays revealed that all tested sponge extracts had strong antimicrobial properties and that the majority (80%) of the tested sponges were equally defended against pathogenic and environmental bacterial strains. Additionally, seven out of ten sponge species exhibited cytotoxic activities in the brine shrimp assay. Moreover, we could also show that the three most bioactive sponge species were able to decrease the photosynthetic performance of the coral symbionts and thus were likely to impair the coral physiology.","[Helber, Stephanie B.; Hoeijmakers, Dieuwke J.

Recent meta-analyses have shown that predator control (hereafter, predator removal) has mixed success in reducing livestock predation. Yet, it is unknown how effective predator removal is in decreasing predation on ungulates due to a lack of quantitative synthesis, despite the long history of implementation in North America. We quantified the demographic responses of ungulate survival and recruitment rates, abundance, and population growth to experimental predator removal and identified the ecological and experimental design factors affecting ungulate responses to predator removal. We conducted a literature review of management and natural experiments to increase ungulate demography finding 52 predator removal experiments and 10 natural experiments from 47 publications. We then conducted a meta-analysis to determine the overall effect size and factors which increased ungulate demography during predator removal. Lastly, we tested for evidence of publication bias and experimental rigour for these experiments. We found that predator removal in both management and natural experiments increased ungulate demographic responses by 13% (95% CI = 4.1%-23%), yet prediction intervals overlapped with 0 (95% PI = -34% to 93%). Focusing just on management removals, ungulate demographic responses increased only by 7.8% (95% PI = -32% to 72%), indicating that future experiments could have negligible effects. Predator removal in both management and natural experiments was more successful in improving the demography of young (e.g. recruitment ES = 44%, 95% CI = 13%-83%) but equivocal in improving adult survival (ES = 5.4%, 95% CI = -18% to 36%) and ungulate abundance (ES = 13%, 95% CI = -17% to 31%). The low and variable effectiveness of predator removal for ungulate populations might be linked to ungulates' slow life history and the compensatory mortality of carnivores on ungulates, though effects were stronger on endangered prey. We identified the experimental design factors that led to greater uncertainty in ungulate responses to predator removal, including lack of randomization, low replication and short temporal length. Lastly, we found evidence of publication bias, where experiments with poor rigour and negative effects (i.e. reduced ungulate demography following predator removal) were under-reported. Synthesis and Applications. We recommend future predator removal experiments be conducted with a more rigorous experimental design to overcome these weaknesses, especially for endangered species where predator removal may work more effectively. We suggest that managers attempting to evaluate experimental practices to increase ungulate populations through predator removal could employ an open standards framework akin to the 'Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation' framework.","[Clark, T.

These structural components influence animal behaviors such as inter-patch movement, foraging, and competition, and can impact community structure/dynamics in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The effects of SHC and FHC on predator-prey dynamics within an ecosystem may also have important cascading effects on neighboring ecosystems by altering the movement of individuals across ecosystem boundaries. For example, when aquatic insects emerge as adults, they enter terrestrial ecosystems where they become an important food resource for terrestrial predators. Using a multiple patch, predator enclosure design in ponds, we tested whether altering intra-patch plant stem densities (SHC) and inter-patch distances (FHC) would influence the impact a predatory fish has on the biomass, quality, and trophic composition of emergent insects. As expected, fish significantly reduced emergent insect biomass (33% +/- 7.6, mean +/- SE). Intra-patch stem densities (SHC) did not significantly alter fish effects; however, inter-patch distance (FHC) did significantly alter the impact of fish on the size of some emergent insects. Damselflies that emerged in treatments with fish present and shorter inter-patch distances were significantly larger, 4.1 +/- 0.1 mg/m(2) compared to 3.3 mg/m(2) +/- 0.1 in the long/fish treatments. In fish treatments, this effect on damselfly size resulted in greater reductions in total emergent insect biomass in long inter-patch distance treatments (47.3% +/- 6.9) compared to short inter-patch distance treatments (20.5% +/- 12.4). Our results suggest that physical components of a habitat, such as inter-patch distances, have important impacts on predator-prey dynamics within habitats. These altered predator-prey dynamics can then have cascading effects on adjacent habitats by influencing the abundance, trophic composition, and quality of exported trophic subsidies.","[Pitcher, Kristopher A.; Soluk, Daniel A.] Univ South Dakota, Dept Biol, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA","Pitcher, KA (corresponding author), Univ South Dakota, Dept Biol, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.",kristopher.pitcher@usd.edu,,,University of South Dakota Foundation: Raymond D.

Magnetic particles (MPs) have been recently proposed as promising phosphorus (P) adsorbents for lake restoration. This study focuses on assessing the effects of MPs on the abundance of the crustacean Daphnia magma under different levels of both intraspecific competition pressure and habitat heterogeneity. The experimental design consisted of two experiments (in homogeneous and heterogeneous habitats) done in glass jars with four concentrations of MPs: controls of 0 g MPs L-1, and treatments of 1, 1.5 and 2 g MPs L-1. In addition, competition treatments were established by using different population densities, and hence, no competition (C), low (L) and high (H) competition pressures were simulated. The experiments lasted for 7 days, with a 4-day pre-exposure period, in which competition was all allowed to take place, and a 3-day post-exposure period. Twenty-four hours after adding MPs, the MPs were removed by applying a magnetic separation technique. The results showed that competition pressures occurred and significantly reduced population, abundances during the pre-exposure period. During the post-exposure period, the combined effects of competition and MPs were detected in both homogeneous (Ho-) and heterogeneous (He-) habitat experiments, showing a significantly drastic reduction in abundances. In fact, the lethal concentration for 50% of the population (LC50 .24 h) was 0 and 0.16 g MPs L-1 in the Ho- and He-experiments respectively, indicating that the addition and especially the removal of MPs cause extreme mortality. These results indicated that even though competition plays a role in shaping populations, its influence was down-weighted by the stronger pressures of MPs. In addition, as no significant differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous habitats were found, we may state that the refuge offered was not protective enough to avoid the effects of MPs. In conclusion, the removal of the MPs causes drastic effects on D. magna abundances despite the concentration of MPs, competition or habitat structure. Finally, considering the validated high efficiency of MPs for P removal, and in the context of a future whole-lake application, it is essential to restrict the use of MPs to the moments when D. magna is absent in the study site. Further research on the effects of MP removal on other organisms is required before implementing the addition of MPs as a restoration tool.","[del Arco, Ana; de Vicente, Inmaculada] Univ Granada, Inst Agua, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Parra, Gema] Univ Jaen, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Ciencias Tierra CEATierra, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Jaen 23071, Spain; [de Vicente, Inmaculada] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","del Arco, A (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Inst Agua, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",,"de Vicente, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016; Anguita, Gema Parra/N-7191-2019; Parra, Gema/G-4796-2010","Anguita, Gema Parra/0000-0002-4519-4799; Parra, Gema/0000-0002-4519-4799; De Vicente Alvarez Manzaneda, Inmaculada/0000-0002-1449-5740; del Arco Ochoa, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-5690-4979","Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [P10-RNM-6630, P11-FQM-7074]; MINECO (Spain) [CTM 2013-46951-R, MAT 2013-44429-R, PCIN 2015-051]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Commission","This work was supported by Junta de Andalucia projects P10-RNM-6630 and P11-FQM-7074 (Proyectos de Excelencia, Spain), MINECO CTM 2013-46951-R, MAT 2013-44429-R and PCIN 2015-051 projects (Spain) and by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).",,53,2,2,0,11,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-6513,1090-2414,,ECOTOX ENVIRON SAFE,Ecotox.

To test this prediction, we used a laboratory model of vertebrate adaptive radiation to investigate the genetic basis of the response to selection for predatory behavior and compare it with evolution of aerobic capacity reported in an earlier work. After 13 generations of selection, the proportion of bank voles (Myodes [=Clethrionomys] glareolus) showing predatory behavior was five times higher in selected lines than in controls. We analyzed the hippocampus and liver transcriptomes and found repeatable changes in allele frequencies and gene expression. Genes with the largest differences between predatory and control lines are associated with hunger, aggression, biological rhythms, and functioning of the nervous system. Evolution of predatory behavior could be meaningfully compared with evolution of high aerobic capacity, because the experiments and analyses were performed in the same methodological framework. The number of genes that changed expression was much smaller in predatory lines, and allele frequencies changed repeatably in predatory but not in aerobic lines. This suggests thatmore variants of smaller effects underlie variation in aerobic performance, whereas fewer variants of larger effects underlie variation in predatory behavior. Our results thus contradict the view that comparable selection pressures for different quantitative traits produce similar molecular patterns. Therefore, to gain knowledge about molecular-level response to selection for complex traits, we need to investigate not only multiple replicate populations but also multiple quantitative traits.","[Konczal, Mateusz; Koteja, Pawel; Sadowska, Edyta T.; Babik, Wieslaw] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Konczal, Mateusz] Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol, CRG, Barcelona, Spain; [Konczal, Mateusz] UPF, Barcelona, Spain; [Orlowska-Feuer, Patrycja] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Zool, Dept Neurophysiol & Chronobiol, Krakow, Poland; [Radwan, Jacek] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Fac Biol, Poznan, Poland; [Orlowska-Feuer, Patrycja] Jagiellonian Univ, Malopolska Ctr Biotechnol, Krakow, Poland","Konczal, M (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland.; Konczal, M (corresponding author), Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol, CRG, Barcelona, Spain.; Konczal, M (corresponding author), UPF, Barcelona, Spain.",mateusz.konczal@gmail.com,"Sadowska, Edyta T./AAW-6965-2021; Koteja, Pawel/AAF-7903-2019; Konczal, Mateusz/M-6884-2015","Koteja, Pawel/0000-0003-0077-4957; Konczal, Mateusz/0000-0002-7691-8075; Orlowska-Feuer, Patrycja/0000-0002-7399-8516; Radwan, Jacek/0000-0001-8503-5701; Sadowska, Edyta T./0000-0003-1240-4814; Babik, Wieslaw/0000-0002-1698-6615","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [N N303 816740]; Jagiellonian University [DS/WBINOZ/INOS/757, DS/WBINOZ/INOS/762]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa [SEV-2012-0208]","This work was supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (N N303 816740 to P.K.) and Jagiellonian University (DS/WBINOZ/INOS/757 to P.K. and DS/WBINOZ/INOS/762 to W.B.).

In Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, surveys were used to quantify microhabitat use and selectivity in two live-coral specialist damselfishes (Pomacentridae), Chrysiptera parasema, and Dascyllus melanurus. A patch reef experiment was then conducted to test how intra- and interspecific competition interacts with two types of microhabitat to influence survival of recently settled C. parasema. Surveys demonstrated that C. parasema and D. melanurus recruits utilized similar coral microhabitats; 72% of C. parasema and 85% of D. melanurus used corymbose and bottlebrush growth forms of Acropora. One microhabitat type, Pocillopora sp. coral, was commonly used by D. melanurus but rarely by C. parasema. The patch reef experiment revealed that both microhabitat and interspecific competition influence abundance of recently settled C. parasema. Microhabitat had the strongest influence on survival of C. parasema. In the absence of interspecific competitors, 85% of C. parasema survived for 5 days after transplantation to high-complexity bottlebrush Acropora reefs when compared to only 25% survival of Pocillopora reefs. In both microhabitats, interspecific competition with D. melanurus, but not intraspecific competition, significantly decreased the survival of C. parasema. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed distribution of C. parasema results from specialized microhabitat requirements and competition for space in those microhabitats. This study demonstrates that interspecific competition and microhabitat type can interact to influence early post-settlement survival in coral reef fishes, though, whether and how these factors influence survival will depend on the behavioural attributes and strength of habitat associations among potential competitors.","[Bonin, M.

Current knowledge on marine mammals and seabirds is biased toward the adult component of populations and lacking are studies investigating the juvenile component. Our goal was to estimate demographic parameters on the pre-weaning stage of a subantarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) population on Amsterdam Island, suspected to be regulated by density-dependence. The influence of abundance on growth parameters (length and weight) and survival was assessed over a study period spanning 16 years. We evidenced a negative trend in population growth rate when density increased. Density-dependence models were favored for pup body size and mass growth. Abundance had a clear influence on body length at high population-density, pups grew slower and were smaller at weaning than pups born in years with low population density. Abundance partly explained pup body mass variation and a weak effect was detected on pre-weaning survival. The causal mechanisms may be increased competition for food resources between breeding females, leading to a reduction of maternal input to their pups. Our results suggested that pup favored survival over growth and the development of their diving abilities in order to withstand the extreme fasting periods that are characteristic of this fur seal population. This analysis provides significant insight of density-dependent processes on early-life demographic parameters of a long lived and top-predator species, and more specifically on the pre-weaning stage with important consequences for our understanding of individual long-term fitness and population dynamics.","[Pacoureau, Nathan; Delord, Karine; Guinet, Christophe; Barbraud, Christophe] Ctr Etudes Biol Chize, UMR CNRS 7372, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Authier, Matthieu; Delord, Karine] Univ Rochelle, Observat PELAGIS, UMS CNRS 3462, 4 Allee Ocean, F-17000 La Rochelle, France","Barbraud, C (corresponding author), Ctr Etudes Biol Chize, UMR CNRS 7372, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.",barbraud@cebc.cnrs.fr,"Barbraud, Christophe/A-5870-2012; Guinet, Christophe/AAR-8457-2020","Barbraud, Christophe/0000-0003-0146-212X; Authier, Matthieu/0000-0001-7394-1993",French Polar Institute IPEV [109]; Terres Australes et Antarctiques Francaises and Zone Atelier Antarctique et Subantarctique (CNRS-INEE) Handling,"We thank the field workers involved in missions on Amsterdam Island for collecting the data.

Each individual planktonic plant or animal is exposed to the hazards of starvation and risk of predation, and each planktonic population is under the control of resource limitation from the bottom up (growth and reproduction) and by predation from the top down (mortality). While the bottom-up and top-down impacts are traditionally conceived as compatible with each other, field population-density data on two coexisting Daphnia species suggest that the nature of the two impacts is different. Rates of change, such as the rate of individual body growth, rate of reproduction, and each species' population growth rate, are controlled from the bottom up. State variables, such as biomass, individual body size and population density, are controlled from the top down and are fixed at a specific level regardless of the rate at which they are produced. 2. According to the theory of functional responses, carnivorous and herbivorous predators react to prey density rather than to the rate at which prey are produced or reproduced. The predator's feeding rate (and thus the magnitude of its effect on prey density) should hence be regarded as a functional response to increasing resource concentration. 3. The disparity between the bottom-up and top-down effects is also apparent in individual decision making, where a choice must be made between accepting the hazards of hunger and the risks of predation (lost calories versus loss of life). 4. As long as top-down forces are effective, the disparity with bottom-up effects seems evident. In the absence of predation, however, all efforts of an individual become subordinate to the competition for resources. Biomass becomes limited from the bottom up as soon as the density of a superior competitor has increased to the carrying capacity of a given habitat. Such a shift in the importance of bottom-up control can be seen in zooplankton in habitats from which fish have been excluded.","Warsaw Univ, Dept Hydrobiol, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland","Gliwicz, ZM (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ, Dept Hydrobiol, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,,59,69,76,1,40,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Whereas predator potentially control standing biomass and species interactions in food webs, their effects on prey biomass and especially prey biodiversity have not yet been systematically quantified. Here, we test the effects of predation in a cross-system meta-analysis of prey diversity and biomass responses to local manipulation of predator presence. We found 291 predator removal experiments from 87 studies assessing both diversity and biomass responses. Across ecosystem types, predator presence significantly decreased both biomass and diversity of prey across ecosystems. Predation effects were highly similar between ecosystem types, whereas previous studies had shown that herbivory or decomposition effects differed fundamentally between terrestrial and aquatic systems based on different stoichiometry of plant material. Such stoichiometric differences between systems are unlikely for carnivorous predators, where effect sizes on species richness strongly correlated to effect sizes on biomass. However, the negative predation effect on prey biomass was ameliorated significantly with increasing prey richness and increasing species richness of the manipulated predator assemblage. Moreover, with increasing richness of the predator assemblage present, the overall negative effects of predation on prey richness switched to positive effects. Our meta-analysis revealed strong general relationships between predator diversity, prey diversity and the interaction strength between trophic levels in terms of biomass. This study indicates that anthropogenic changes in predator abundance and diversity will potentially have strong effects on trophic interactions across ecosystems.","[Katano, Izumi; Doi, Hideyuki; Hillebrand, Helmut] Carl Von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, DE-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Katano, Izumi] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Doi, Hideyuki] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Simulat Studies, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Eriksson, Britas Klemens] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Dept Marine Benth Ecol & Evolut, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands","Doi, H (corresponding author), Carl Von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Schleusenstr 1, DE-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",hideyuki.doi@icloud.com,"Hillebrand, Helmut/I-1717-2014; Doi, Hideyuki/D-2012-2010; Eriksson, Britas Klemens/D-8601-2015","Hillebrand, Helmut/0000-0001-7449-1613; Doi, Hideyuki/0000-0002-2701-3982; Eriksson, Britas Klemens/0000-0003-4752-922X; Katano, Izumi/0000-0002-1657-619X","German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Hi848/9]; Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K00596] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG grant Hi848/9 to HH) and Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS to HD).

There are frequently several predatory mite species present or available for introduction and it is difficult to tell whether a single species or combination of species should provide the most effective means of biological control. We used a simulation model to examine the interactions between predatory mites of two families, the Stigmaeidae and Phytoseiidae, representatives of which feed on phytophagous apple mites. To identify key differences in predatory behavior and life history, various stigmaeid parameters were substituted with those of phytoseiids, and changes in the efficacy of either stigmaeids alone or in combination with phytoseiids were evaluated graphically. At low prey densities stigmaeids held an advantage over phytoseiids in terms of efficacy because of their higher preference for prey eggs, higher oviposition relative to prey consumption and the ability to consume their own eggs, while at high prey densities the higher maximum predation rate of phytoseiids gave them a higher efficacy. Thus the weaker predator (the stigmaeid) is the more effective competitor at low prey densities. The model did not account for dispersal, but since stigmaeids are the weaker dispersers, the possibility of developing stability in this system is much greater than if phytoseiids were the better competitors. A combination of stigmaeids and phytoseiids was shown to have greater efficacy than either predator alone over a wide range of prey densities.",,"CLEMENTS, DR (corresponding author), UNIV GUELPH,DEPT CROP SCI,GUELPH N1G 2W1,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,,,,,,0,22,29,0,2,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

The study is the fourth in a series of papers based on exclusion experiments in two different parts of the mangrove system at Gazi Bay in southern Kenya. The permanent and visiting epibenthos were excluded using cages. Densities of the macrobenthic taxa Oligochaeta (families Tubificidae and Enchytraeidae), Amphipoda (genera Grandidierella and Ampelisca), Insecta larvae (family Dolichopodidae), Polychaeta (families Nereidae and Terebellidae), macro-Nematoda (family Oncholaimidae), and Gastropoda, and a broad range of environmental factors were followed over five months of caging. A significant increase of the dominant tubificid population and the polychaete Namalycastis spec. in the cage-covered sediment indicated a positive exclusion effect. The polychaetes seemed to be impacted by epibenthic predation. Resource competition for muddy detritus, however, was evidenced to be the structuring force for the numerically dominant oligochaetes. The bulk of the studied macrobenthic infauna is therefore proposed to be a trophic dead end and to have only a minor interactive position in the mangrove foodweb.

We evaluated size-dependent impacts of signal crayfish on a littoral marsh food web using in-situ enclosures in a northern Japanese marsh. During the 60-day experiment, large crayfish (<30 mm orbital carapace length) rapidly eliminated submerged macrophytes through mechanical destruction while the comparable impacts of small crayfish (>30 mm) appeared after more time had passed. Benthic algal biomass was reduced in the presence of large crayfish but was affected little by small crayfish, suggesting that large crayfish were significant bioturbators. On the other hand, total invertebrate biomass was reduced while total invertebrate density was enhanced in the presence of both crayfish size classes. Potential crayfish impacts on invertebrates are: (1) predation on large vulnerable taxa such as Trichoptera and predatory (2) mechanical destruction of macrophytes, thereby reducing microhabitats for invertein-vertebrates, brates, (3) heightened emigration of invertebrates in response to bioturbation and/or (4) predation or competition release on small invertebrates as a result of crayfish reducing their predators/competitors. Invertebrate taxa richness was nearly halved in the presence of large crayfish, probably reflecting reductions of rare taxa. Overall, functional roles of signal crayfish as omnivores and ecosystem engineers remained similar during the ontogenetic stage but the magnitude and rate of crayfish impacts intensified with increasing crayfish size. Thus, removal of large invasive crayfish alone may reduce detrimental impacts on aquatic biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we describe responses of benthic, trout stream communities to replicated, whole-ecosystem perturbations resulting from pathogen-induced reductions in populations of a dominant grazer the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior. Previous small-scale experiments suggested that Glossosoma had strong competitive effects on other grazers (through exploitation) and small-bodied filter-feeders (through interference). Glossosoma populations collapsed in a number of Michigan trout streams since the late 1980s and have been maintained at low levels by recurrent pathogen outbreaks. Here we address the effects on periphyton, grazers, and filter-feeders of parasite-induced Glossosoma reductions in six streams for which considerable pre-and post-collapse data are available, and we compare the results of this large-scale perturbation to responses predicted from a small-scale experiment that had been previously conducted in one of these streams. Periphyton and most grazers and filter-feeders showed marked increases in abundance following reduction in Glossosoma populations. Several grazers that were rare or absent prior to Glossosoma collapse have established sizable populations, suggesting that they had been excluded by competition with Glossosoma. The small-scale experiment successfully predicted the direction of response of most taxa to whole-stream reductions in Glossosoma abundance, but it tended to underestimate the extent and magnitude of Glossosoma's effects in the community. In these systems, observations at larger spatial and temporal scales have been essential to developing a clearer understanding of the mechanisms structuring communities.","UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH NAT RESOURCES & ENVIRONM, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA","Kohler, SL (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA.",,"Wiley, Michael/A-6853-2012",,,,,62,111,113,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1997,78,7,,,,,2164,2176,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2164:PORLSE]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XZ789,WOS:A1997XZ78900020,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

In an attempt to control the progress of these herbivores, chemical inputs are used on crops, but with limited success and negative impact on biodiversity and on human health. We investigated in a field experiment whether cover crop intercropping with coffee would reduce coffee pest population by increasing natural enemy abundance. The cover crops Crotalaria juncea and Fagopyrum esculentum were selected based on agronomic traits and on the provision of food resources to natural enemies. They were tested in plots in a single cultivation and in mix combination intercropped with coffee. The control treatment was represented by coffee monoculture with bare soil. Predation rate of a key coffee pest, the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella, was higher in intercropped plots than in the monoculture. Increased parasitism rate of L. coffeella was found in plots intercropped with F. esculentum. However, during the experimental period, L. coffeella abundance was not affected by the cover crops. Phytophagous mites from Tetranychidae family were less abundant when coffee was intercropped with C. juncea. Their predators, Phytoseiidae mites, were more abundant on coffee intercropped with C. juncea and C. juncea plus F. esculentum. Diversification of coffee crops by intercropping with cover crops promotes biological control of phytophagous mites and shows potential for coffee leaf miner control. These results, together with the improvement of chemical, physical and biological characteristics of the soil and reduced weed competition, make cover crop intercropping a suitable strategy for coffee cultivation.","[Rosado, Maria da Consolacao; de Araujo, Gustavo Junior; Pallini, Angelo] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Rosado, Maria da Consolacao; de Araujo, Gustavo Junior; Pallini, Angelo] Tech Assistance Co & Rural Extens Minas Gerais St, Teixeiras, MG, Brazil; [Venzon, Madelaine] Agr & Livestock Res Enterprise Minas Gerais EPAMI, Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Venzon, M (corresponding author), Agr & Livestock Res Enterprise Minas Gerais EPAMI, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",madelaine@epamig.br,"Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012","Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545; Venzon, Madelaine/0000-0001-9184-6818",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Fundacao de Amparo a` Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Consorcio Pesquisa Cafe [10.18.20.049.00.05]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG),"The authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) , and Fundacao de Amparo a` Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) for financial support and scholarships, and Consorcio Pesquisa Cafe (project 10.18.20.049.00.05) for the scholar-ship no 1993 of Gustavo Junior de Araujo.

However, little experimental evidence demonstrates whether local species can successfully compete with exotics. We experimentally determined the existence of competition for food between the exotic wasp Vespula germanica, one of the most recent Patagonian invaders, and the native ant assemblage. Both wasps and ants are generalist predators and scavengers, sharing habitat and food resources. We selected 30 sites within scrubland habitats where both ants and wasps were present. At each site, we placed containers with protein baits under three treatments: wasp exclusion, ant exclusion, and control (i.e., free access for wasps and ants). Ant exclusion increased the number of wasps (with regard to a control), but wasp exclusion did not affect ant abundance. This result suggests that native ants affect the foraging activity of exotic wasps but not vice versa. Aggressive behaviors and worker aggregation may explain the competitive advantage of ants. Ants bite wasp legs and massively aggregate on food sources, physically limiting the landing of wasps on baits. If the outcome of interactions at baits reported here influence wasp population-level parameters, this competitive interaction could be one of the factors explaining the low abundance of this exotic wasp in NW Patagonia in comparison with other invaded regions.","[Masciocchi, Maite; Farji-Brener, Alejandro G.; Sackmann, Paula] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, INIBIOMA, Lab Ecotono CRUB UNComa, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Farji-Brener, AG (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, INIBIOMA, Lab Ecotono CRUB UNComa, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",alefarji@crub.uncoma.edu.ar,"Masciocchi, Maite/K-3378-2019; Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/I-8372-2019","Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/0000-0001-7251-3866; Masciocchi, Maite/0000-0002-0095-2170",Agencia de Promocion Cientifica y TecnologicaANPCyT [PICT 25314],This work was partially supported by a grant from the Agencia de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica PICT 25314.

It is important to understand how ecological factors may trigger chemical mechanisms in marine Antarctic organisms as a response for survival. However, very little is known yet about the evolution of chemical compounds in Antarctic organisms. Investigations in chemical ecology have demonstrated over the last several years that defensive metabolites have evolved in numerous representative Antarctic species. This contradicts earlier theories concerning biogeographic variation in predation and chemical defenses. As reviewed here, a number of interesting natural products have been isolated from Antarctic organisms. However, we believe many more are still to be discovered. Currently, many groups such as microorganisms, planktonic organisms and deep-sea fauna remain almost totally unknown regarding their natural products. Furthermore, for many described compounds, ecological roles have yet to be evaluated. In fact, much of the research carried out to date has been conducted in the laboratory, and only in a few cases in an ecologically relevant context. Therefore, there is a need to extend the experiments to the field, as done in tropical and temperate marine ecosystems, or at least, to test the activity of the chemicals in natural conditions and ecologically meaningful interactions. Defense against predators is always one of the main topics when talking about the roles of natural products in species interactions, but many other interesting aspects, such as competition, chemoattraction, fouling avoidance and ultraviolet (UV) protection, also deserve further attention. In our opinion, challenging future developments are to be expected for Antarctic marine chemical ecology in the years to come.","[Avila, Conxita; Taboada, Sergi; Nunez-Pons, Laura] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Anim Biol Invertebrates, E-08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Avila, Conxita; Taboada, Sergi; Nunez-Pons, Laura] CSIC, CEAB, Girona, Catalonia, Spain","Avila, C (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Anim Biol Invertebrates, E-08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",conxita.avila@ub.edu,"Taboada, Sergi/AAB-9390-2021; Avila, Conxita/B-9466-2008","Taboada, Sergi/0000-0003-1669-1152; Avila, Conxita/0000-0002-5489-8376",,,,277,59,61,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-9565,1439-0485,,MAR ECOL-EVOL PERSP,Mar.

Then, different doses of nutrients (N and P) were added to the basins throughout the following three years. During the period of nutrient addition, macroinvertebrate grazers showed seasonal fluctuations with densities usually between 500,000 and I million individuals per mesocosm during summer and to a level of about 100,000 during, winter. The macroinvertebrate grazers mainly consisted of about 10 species of amphipods and isopods. among which the amphipod Gammarus locusta dominated strongly by biomass. Although the number of predators was very low. the grazer populations never reached a density where considerable grazing impact could be found on the macroalgae. No increase in grazer density was found in the basins with improved nutrient conditions. Thus food quality may be insufficient for further population growth, or density dependant regulation mechanisms may have prevented the grazers from flourishing, and overgrazing the system. In aquarium experiments we showed that G. locusta Could grow and reproduce on Fucus serratus. Ulva lactuca, periphyton and detritus, and that cannibalism by adult G. locusta on Juveniles may have great impact on the population growth. The basins were run with a water flow through system. Nets were placed in front of the inflow and Outflow tubes to measure immigration and emigration. Only few individuals (and no Gammarus sp.) were recorded in the inflowing water, while high numbers of both amphipods and isopods were found in the outflowing water. Emigration reached peak values during night-time. and it was then two to three times as high as during day-time. Emigration of mobile grazers from the basins amounted to 1-2% of the standing stock daily. These mechanisms that regulate grazers do contribute to maintenance of the seaweed dominance and thus the stability of the seaweed community.","NINA, N-0105 Oslo, Norway; Abo Akad Univ, FIN-20500 Turku, Finland","Christie, H (corresponding author), NINA, POB 736 Sentrum, N-0105 Oslo, Norway.",hartvig.christie@nina.no,,"Kraufvelin, Patrik/0000-0003-3224-8388",,,,46,33,35,0,21,CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC,MADRID,"VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN",0214-8358,1886-8134,,SCI MAR,Sci.

The experimental design allowed the effects of the larvae per se to be distinguished from the effects of their nets. H. siltalai larvae and nets affected all common insect taxa. The density of Ephemerella ignita (Ephemeroptera) nymphs was reduced by H. siltalai larvae, while the density of Simulium truncatum (Simuliidae) larvae was reduced by the presence of nets. Rhyacophila nubila (Trichoptera) and chironomid larvae increased their densities in response to nets of H. siltalai larvae. Laboratory experiments showed that predation was the most important mechanism whereby H. siltalai larvae affected E. ignita nymphs and S. truncatum larvae. Immigration and emigration rates of S. truncatum larvae were increased in the presence of H. siltalai nets. Data from the laboratory experiments and a simple colonization model were used to generate quantitative predictions of the effects of H. siltalai larvae and their nets on E. ignita nymphs and S. truncatum larvae.

Yet, both kinds of effects can drive dynamics of ecological systems and their covariation may confound interpretation. Predation by crabs and snails on competitively dominant mussels has long been recognized as an important process structuring communities on rocky shores of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. We experimentally manipulated the average intensity of predation in plots across a gradient of mussel recruitment to separately estimate the average and variability of responses of mussel recruitment and community composition. Predation did not affect the average number of mussels recruited to plots, nor the average multivariate composition of the community. Plots from which predators were excluded showed a -30% increase in spatial variability of mussel recruitment. After 1 year, the spatial variability in community composition was greater than that observed among plots that predators could access. An important, but less recognized, aspect of predation is its dampening effect on variability of community structure. As accelerating rates of environmental change disrupt species interactions, variability effects of ecological processes and corresponding responses are likely to be increasingly important determinants of community dynamics.","[Mutti, Alexa; Kubler-Dudgeon, Iris; Dudgeon, Steve] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Mutti, Alexa] Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, Santa Barbara, CA 93109 USA; [Kubler-Dudgeon, Iris] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Math, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Dudgeon, S (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",steve.dudgeon@csun.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1020480, DEB-1555641]; CSUN Office of Research; CSUN Graduate Equity Fellowships; PADI Foundation; Burnand-Partridge Foundation; Addison E.

Seed predation was monitored every month from 2010 to 2013. A generalized linear model was fitted using next spring seed density as the response variable and seed rain, micro-site conditions and annual climate variability as explanatory variables. Seed rain, distance to the nearest stump, basal area and Walter's drought index, along with percentage cover of herbaceous species, pine needle litter and shrub species, had significant positive effects. The number of neighboring trees had a significant negative effect on seed density. These results demonstrate how seed rain, summer drought and micro-site conditions are crucial to understand the effects of predation on the belowground seed bank.

The common jellyfish Aurelia aurita is a resident species in many of these areas, where it can reach high abundances. This work aimed to determine the potential for predation of A. aurita on zooplanktonic organisms and early life stages of fishes, measuring feeding rates at concentrations that mimic those occurring for zooplankton, fish eggs and larvae in an estuarine nursery area. A set of experiments was aimed at determining the feeding selectivity of jellyfish when offered a mixture of fish eggs and larvae and wild plankton. Clearance rates varied markedly with prey availability and concentrations. When given mixtures of different prey types, jellyfish preferentially elected some taxa (copepods and fish eggs). Data obtained in the laboratory experiments were used to infer the potential impact of jellyfish predation upon zooplankton and ichthyoplankton in the Guadiana estuary (Southern Iberia). Repeated sampling of zooplankton, fish eggs and medusae was undertaken during the summer season of 2011. Abundance determinations were combined with experimentally estimated clearance rates of individual medusa to infer the potential jellyfish-induced mortality on prey in the area. In June and early August jellyfish-induced mortality rates were very high, and half-life times (t(1/2)) were consequently short for the zooplankton and ichthyoplankton. Although the potentially overestimation of our feeding rates typical of confined laboratory experiments, the results show high ingestion and clearance rates at high temperatures, typical from summer condition, and results also suggest that either by predation on early life stages of fish, or by competition for food resources, jellyfish may have a significant impact on estuarine communities and its nursery function.

Prey depletion might cause trophic niche widening in generalist species, but not in specialists, which are expected to increase their foraging effort without diet shifts. In sympatric species feeding on similar resources, reduced food availability can increase interspecific competition and cause trophic niche segregation. To understand these processes, we studied the spatio-temporal variability in diet and niche width in 2 sympatric gull species, the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis and Audouin's gull Ichthyaetus audouinii, which have experienced exponential growth in recent decades due to an increase in anthropogenic food subsidies. We sampled feathers from chicks of both species in several colonies along the western Mediterranean from 2009 to 2011 and performed stable isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur on these feathers. Bayesian modelling shows that both species displayed opportunistic behaviour if different types of resources were available, but could also narrow their trophic niche if 1 resource was abundant. We also provide evidence of trophic segregation between the 2 gull species, suggesting the occurrence of interspecific competition for food. Our meta-population approach provides a comprehensive view of the trophic ecology and the competitive interactions of these gull species. We emphasize the usefulness of 3-dimensional isotope analyses to correctly assess spatio-temporal variability in trophic behaviour of predator species, revealing differences that would remain hidden in single population studies or when using only the isotopic ratios of 2 elements.","[Morera-Pujol, Virginia; Ramos, Raul; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob] Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Morera-Pujol, Virginia; Ramos, Raul; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Mendez, Nestor] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Sede Andina, Inst Invest Recursos Nat Agroecol & Desarrollo Ru, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Cerda-Cuellar, Marta] IRTA, CReSA, Campus Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona 08193, Spain","Morera-Pujol, V (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.; Morera-Pujol, V (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",morera.virginia@gmail.com,"Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Cerda, Marta/U-4534-2018; Morera-Pujol, Virginia/AAE-6412-2020; Perez-Mendez, Nestor/AAB-1505-2020; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/C-3942-2008; Ramos, Raul/S-3112-2016","Cerda, Marta/0000-0001-6842-1299; Morera-Pujol, Virginia/0000-0001-6500-5548; Perez-Mendez, Nestor/0000-0001-6264-2920; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/0000-0002-8691-9397; Ramos, Raul/0000-0002-0551-8605","Spanish INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [FAU2008-00012-C02-01]; MINECO [CGL2009-11278/BOS]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness programme [BES-2014-068025]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [JCI-2012-11848]","Legal permissions for the development of the fieldwork were obtained from the Dept. de Medi Ambient i Habitatge de la Generalitat de Catalunya, Conselleria de Medi Ambient i Mobilitat del Govern de les Illes Balears, Conselleria de Medi Ambient de la Generalitat Valenciana, Consejeria de Medio Ambiente de la Junta de Andalucia, Parc Natural del Delta de l'Ebre, Parc Natural del Montgri, les Illes Medes i el Baix Ter, Parc Natural Illes Columbretes and Parc Natural de Sa Dragonera.

One example is the introduction of the genus Gambusia Poey, 1854 into ponds and wetlands. Gambusia spp. are invasive in many parts of the world and have the potential to alter ecosystems by changing trophic interactions and extirpating amphibians. We sought to determine whether larval amphibians are capable of consuming larval mosquitoes as effectively as Gambusia spp. We tested the predation ability of larval Spotted Salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum (Shaw, 1802); n = 13), Southern Leopard Frog (Rana sphenocephala Cope, 1886; n = 12) tadpoles, and western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis (Baird and Girard, 1853); n = 13) across a range of body sizes in laboratory experiments. Our results showed that over a 24 h period, salamander larvae (mean +/- SE; 238 +/- 14) and mosquitofish (195 +/- 17) consumed a statistically equivalent number of mosquito larvae, whereas tadpoles consumed a large number (113 +/- 14) but significantly less. All species had significant (or marginally significant) positive relationships between body size and rate of mosquito consumption. Further studies into the ability of native larval amphibians to consume mosquito larvae are needed to assess whether amphibians can be successful at mosquito control instead of introducing nonnative species to new areas.","[Watters, Amanda M.; Rowland, Freya E.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Rowland, Freya E.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA","Rowland, FE (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.; Rowland, FE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.",frowland@umich.edu,"Rowland, Freya/AAE-4733-2021; Rowland, Freya/Q-3572-2019","Rowland, Freya/0000-0002-1041-5301",University of Missouri Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Mentorship Program Fellowship; University of Missouri TWA Scholarship,"We thank K.

Protozoa and nematodes are important microfauna predators in soil and compete for the same food resource, bacteria. Therefore, inhibition of competitors may enhance food acquisition and fitness of individual predator species. 2. We investigated chemical based interference between the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii in a bacteria-free gnotobiotic system. 3. Exoproducts of amoebae exhibited marked nematostatic activity, and repelled the worms. However, nematodes were able to reduce the activity of proteases and glycosidases, two enzymes playing an important role in the toxicity of A. castellanii. Exoproducts of nematodes also detrimentally affected amoebae by reducing growth and increasing encystation. 4. The results indicate that both protozoa and nematodes can inhibit each other, and that nematodes are also able to counteract the attack by protist competitors. Non-trophic interactions appear thus as a new factor affecting the structure of predator communities in soil.","[Neidig, Nina; Jousset, Alexandre] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany; [Jousset, Alexandre; Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Nunes, Frank; Paul, Ruediger J.] Univ Munster, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Bonkowski, Michael] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, D-50931 Cologne, Germany","Jousset, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany.",ajousse@gwdg.de,"Paul, Rudiger/ABG-3698-2020; Jousset, Alexandre/C-7607-2011; Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015; Bonkowski, Michael/C-3700-2013","Bonkowski, Michael/0000-0003-2656-1183",German Federal Foundation for the Environment (DBU),We are grateful to Tim Janowitz and Peter Gerke (University of Munster) for help in the stress signal transduction experiments.

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is an early season folivore that feeds exclusively on young foliage of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Most first-instar larvae are unable to colonize vigorous upper-crown apical buds due to the limited time during which newly burst buds are suitable to young larvae and the distinct acropetal bud development pattern exhibited by white spruce. However, late second- and early third-instar larvae abandon buds from the lower and middle crown and disperse to upper-crown apical buds once they become available for colonization. We carried out a 3-yr field study to test the hypothesis that ''acropetal'' dispersal by late second- and early third-instar Z. canadensis larvae through the crown of white spruce is an adaptive response to within-plant variability in foliage development. Survival and the size and developmental rate of survivors were highest when larvae developed on apical buds in the upper crown. Smaller buds located more proximally and/ or lower in the crown declined in quality earlier than did the larger buds in the upper crown. Larvae that developed in buds with several conspecifics survived better, were larger, and developed faster than those that developed alone. Intraspecific larval competition was evident only at the highest densities, where the entire apical bud unit was consumed. Individuals allowed to develop for two instars on buds from the lower crown before being transferred acropetally to complete development on apical buds once they became available, always survived better, were larger, and developed faster than nontransferred larvae, irrespective of initial bud position and/or larval density. In addition, acropetal dispersal did not increase the probability of mortality from Formica ants, the most common predators found foraging on young white spruce. Including the costs and benefits associated with competition and predation, the performance of individuals that were restricted to developing within even the highest quality upper-crown apical buds (i.e., alternative strategy) was lower than for individuals that were allowed to feed twice on new foliage (i.e., the observed strategy). Thus, acropetal dispersal increases individual fitness in a heterogeneous environment where the quality and quantity of required plant resources varies spatially and temporally.","UNIV NEW BRUNSWICK,DEPT FOREST RESOURCES,POPULAT ECOL GRP,FREDERICTON E3B 6C2,NB,CANADA",,,,,,,,59,28,28,3,14,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1994,75,7,,,,,1978,1990,,10.2307/1941602,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PK129,WOS:A1994PK12900012,,,,,2021-09-27,

Invasive species may benefit from anthropogenic disturbance, such as water pollution, to which they sometimes seem more resistant than native ones. They also allow investigating evolutionary divergence among populations occurring along pollution gradients. We assessed fish communities at 55 sampling sites in the degraded and heavily overstocked Mutara Rangelands of north-eastern Rwanda (upper Nile drainage), which receive pollution from domestic wastewater and cattle dung. Diverse fish communities became apparent that included invasive guppies (Poecilia reticulata, Poeciliidae), and canonical correspondence analyses found significant differentiation of community structures along several environmental parameters (condensed into principal components), including pollution-effects. As predicted, generalized linear models found guppies to have a higher likelihood of occurrence at polluted sites. Local abundances of guppies, however, decreased at polluted sites. Since guppies are color-polymorphic, and color patterns have a heritable basis, they allow inferences regarding both pollution-induced suppression of male ornamentation (e.g., through xenestrogens) and evolutionary population divergence. We thus quantified different ornament types (numbers and percent body surface cover). ANCOVAs uncovered several weak (based on effect strengths), but statistically significant pollution-effects and interactions with other environmental parameters. The direction of several interaction effects was similar for blue/black and red/orange ornaments, while white/iridescent ornaments responded dissimilarly. As responses differed between ornament types, they likely reflect evolutionary divergence due to site-specific alterations of selective regimes rather than developmental inhibition of male secondary sexual characters. We propose that pollution affects local fitness landscapes resulting, e.g., from predation and mate competition (as a function of local abundances), altogether driving evolutionary divergence of sexually selected traits. This study highlights how human activities not only impact ecological dynamics, but-mediated by altered Eco-Evo dynamics-might change the evolutionary trajectories of populations.

Over the last 20 years, we have tackled a broad range of topics to understand how the stress axis functions in four key herbivore species. The central challenge for snowshoe hares is coping with their predators, whereas for the others, it is primarily coping with each other (especially during reproduction) and with their physical environment. Hares are severely stressed by their predators during the population decline. The predator threat causes major changes in the stress axis of hares and reduces their reproduction; in addition, acting through maternal programming, it is the most plausible explanation for the extended period of low numbers following the population decline. Arctic ground squirrel males have an intense breeding season for two to three weeks in early spring, after which many of them die. The functioning of their stress axis changes markedly and is key in meeting their energy demands during this period. In contrast, red-backed vole males, though also short-lived, breed repeatedly only in the summer of their life, and their stress axis shows no change in function. However, their reproductive effort negatively affects their long-term survival. Territorial red squirrels experience marked interannual fluctuations in their major food source (white spruce seed), resulting in major fluctuations in their densities and consequently in the intensity of territorial competition. Changes in the densities of red squirrels also alter maternal stress hormone levels, inducing adaptive plasticity in offspring postnatal growth rates that prepares offspring for the environment they will encounter at independence. To survive winter, red squirrels need to defend their territories year-round, and the basis of this defense appears to be adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone, which has the benefits, but not the costs, of gonadal steroids. Arctic ground squirrels survive winter by hibernating in deeply frozen ground. Unlike all other hibernators, they have evolved a unique adaptation: high levels of adrenal androgens in summer to accumulate protein reserves that they then burn in winter. With a rapidly changing climate, the stress axis will play a key role in permitting northern animals to adapt, but the linkages between the changes in the abiotic and biotic components of the boreal forest and the phenotypic plasticity in the stress response of its inhabitants are not well understood for these or any other herbivore species.","[Boonstra, Rudy; Delehanty, Brendan] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Neurobiol Stress, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Dantzer, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Fletcher, Quinn E.] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Sheriff, Michael J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16801 USA","Boonstra, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Neurobiol Stress, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",boonstra@utsc.utoronto.ca,"Dantzer, Ben/E-9779-2011","Dantzer, Ben/0000-0002-3058-265X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Echo Foundation; Northern Scientific Training Program; International Polar Year,"All authors have contributed equally to the preparation of this paper.

These radical dietary fluctuations can lead to poor fertility, early embryonic death, poor hatchability, suppressed immune function, high chick mortality, and illness. To understand the variability of nutrient status in reproductive seasons, we measured select circulating nutrient concentrations (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and carotenoids, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals, and electrolytes) of 105 HP at Punta San Juan, Peru during the first reproductive seasons of 2007 and 2008. We determined significant differences in nutrient status between sexes, years of sampling, and reproductive stages. Males (4.5 +/- 0.38 kg) weighed more than females (4.0 +/- 0.29 kg) and exhibited higher concentrations of vitamin A (0.71 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.12 mu g/ml) and docosahexaenoic acid (6.70 +/- 1.61 vs. 5.65 +/- 1.59%). Males also displayed lower concentrations of beta-carotene (0.01 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.012 +/- 0.001 mu g/ml) and phosphorus (3.43 +/- 0.83 vs. 4.40 +/- 1.66 mg/dl). Comparison between the 2 years showed most circulating amino acid concentrations were higher in 2007. Significant differences in circulating amino acids and vitamins were also noted between different reproductive stages. These results demonstrate concentrations of nutrients can vary due to the physiological state of the animal, as well as the overall dynamics of their marine ecosystem habitat.","[Colchao, Paulo; Deem, Sharon L.] St Louis Zoo, Inst Conservat Med, One Govt Dr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Colchao, Paulo; Cardena, Marco; Cardenas-Alayza, Susana] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Ctr Sostenibilidad Ambiental, Lima, Peru; [Adkesson, Michael J.; Cardenas-Alayza, Susana] Brookfield Zoo, Vet Serv Dept, Chicago Zool Soc, Brookfield, IL USA; [Allender, Matthew C.] Univ Illinois, Coll Vet Med, Wildlife Epidemiol Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Fascetti, Andrea J.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Mol Biosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Dierenfeld, Ellen S.] LLC Comparat Anim Nutr Consulting, St Louis, MO USA","Deem, SL (corresponding author), St Louis Zoo, Inst Conservat Med, One Govt Dr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",deem@stlzoo.org,"Cardenas-Alayza, Susana/AAP-1748-2021","Cardenas-Alayza, Susana/0000-0002-8828-9552; Allender, Matthew/0000-0001-9067-1964; Deem, Sharon/0000-0002-2549-3636; Dierenfeld, Ellen/0000-0001-7295-0740",Saint Louis Zoo; Chicago Zoological Society; Saint Louis Zoo Field Conservation Fund; Chicago Board of Traded Endangered Species Fund; Sea World Busch Gardens Conservation Fund,"We thank the volunteers and staff from the Punta San Juan Program for their assistance with this project, as well as Dr. Zengshou Yu from the Amino Acid Laboratory at UC Davis for his help and expertise.

Although there is evidence to suggest that closely-related species are unlikely to occupy the same habitat because of competitive exclusion, there are many cases where closely-related species do co-occur. Research comparing sympatric and allopatric populations of co-occurring species provides a framework for understanding the role of phenotypic diversification in species coexistence. In the present study, we compare phenotypic divergence between sympatric and allopatric populations of the livebearing fish, Poeciliopsis baenschi. We focus on life-history traits and body shape, comprising two sets of integrated traits likely to diverge in response to varying selective pressures. Given that males and females can express different phenotypic traits, we also test for patterns of divergence among sexes by comparing size at maturity and sexual dimorphism in body shape between males and females in each population type. We take advantage of a natural experiment in western Mexico where, in some locations, P. baenschi co-occur with a closely-related species, Poeciliopsis turneri (sympatric populations) and, in other locations, they occur in isolation (allopatric populations). The results obtained in the present study show that sympatric populations of P. baenschi differed significantly in life-history traits and in body shape compared to their allopatric counterparts. Additionally, males and females showed different responses for size at maturity in sympatric conditions versus allopatric conditions. However, the amount of sexual dimorphism did not differ between sympatric and allopatric populations of P. baenschi. Hence, we conclude that not all traits show similar levels of phenotypic divergence in response to sympatric conditions.

Acidification experiments were conducted on zooplankton in 16-m3 enclosures suspended in a Precambrian Shield lake in central Ontario in order to identify mechanisms of community change. Changes in abundance, body size, egg ratio, and lipid status in zooplankton populations reflected changes in biotic interactions during acidification to pH between 5.0 and 6.0. Abundance of small cladocerans (especially Bosmina longirostris) increased following acidification despite increases in abundance or dominance of their cyclopoid predators. Increased reproduction of Bosmina, in the absence of detectable changes in edible phytoplankton biomass, suggests that this was due to competitive release from larger cladoceran species that did not survive acidification.","UNIV TORONTO,DEPT ZOOL,ERINDALE CAMPUS,MISSISSAUGA L5L 1C6,ON,CANADA",,,,,,,,45,22,22,0,5,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

The various predators may include both aerial and terrestrial species that can facilitate each other and present qualitatively different risks to prey. Animals therefore forage across a complex landscape of fear, with areas of risks and relative safety where resources are generally asymmetrically distributed. Therefore, a trade-off exists between remaining safe and locating food. Animals make foraging decisions regarding where, when and for how long to forage by titrating marginal costs and benefits of foraging within and the marginal value of foraging across depletable resource patches. We conducted a series of titration experiments to determine how Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) titrated food and safety when presented with predation risk from owls, vipers and the joint risk from both predators. We manipulated bush and open microhabitats by increasing food availability in the riskier patches. In response to the different levels of enrichment, gerbils titrated food and safety. Riskier open microhabitats needed to be four times as rich in food as bush patches to be of equal value when subjected to predation from owls and the joint risk from owls and vipers. In response to vipers alone, riskier bush patches needed to be 2-4 times as rich in food as safer open patches for the marginal value of foraging to equalize across microhabitats. Overall, predation risk from owls and the joint risk from owls and vipers resulted in the greatest foraging costs for gerbils in risky microhabitats. Thus, the combined overall risk from multiple predator species was equivalent to the risk presented by the gerbils' most dangerous predator (owls alone).","[Makin, Douglas F.; Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-8499000 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Makin, DF (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-8499000 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",doug.makin4@gmail.com,,,Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [976/14],This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant number: 976/14).,,63,1,1,3,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

In endangered salt marshes of south-east Australia, the non-indigenous rush Juncus acutus is currently displacing the native rush Juncus kraussii, which is a dominant habitat-forming species along the upper border of coastal salt marshes. We sampled insect assemblages on multiple plants of these congeneric rushes in coastal salt marshes in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, and compared the abundance, richness, diversity, composition and trophic structure between: (i) J. acutus and J. kraussii at invaded locations; and (ii) J. kraussii at locations either invaded or not invaded by J. acutus. Although J. acutus supported a diverse suite of insects, species richness and diversity were significantly greater on the native J. kraussii. Moreover, insect assemblages associated with J. kraussii at sites invaded by J. acutus were significantly different from, and more variable than, those on J. kraussii at non-invaded sites. The trophic structure of the insect assemblages was also different, including the abundance and richness of predators and herbivores, suggesting that J. acutus may be altering consumer interactions, and may be spreading in part because of a reduction in herbivory. This strongly suggests that J. acutus is not playing a functionally similar role to J. kraussii with respect to the plant-associated insect species assemblages. Consequently, at sites where this non-indigenous species successfully displaces the native congener, this may have important ecological consequences for community composition and functioning of these endangered coastal salt marshes.","[Harvey, Kerinne J.; Minchinton, Todd E.] Univ Wollongong, Inst Conservat Biol, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Harvey, Kerinne J.; Minchinton, Todd E.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Biol Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Britton, David R.] Australian Museum, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia","Harvey, KJ (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",kharvey@bio.mq.edu.au,,,Institute for Conservation Biology at the University of Wollongong; Australian Museum in Sydney,"We greatly appreciate the help of field volunteers William Harvey, Jodi Lee, John Martin and Mat Misdale.

In the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, these filter feeders are usually associated with seagrass. Two simultaneously conducted field experiments (a mussel density manipulation and a mussel predation experiment) were conducted to examine the potential positive interactions between the suspension-feeding mussel Modiolus americanus (Leach) and the seagrass Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Konig. The mussel density manipulations resulted in a doubling of the total nitrogen and total phosphorus levels of sediments, and a significant reduction in leaf tissue C:N, N:P and C:P ratios, demonstrating that the mussels increased the sediment nutrient content and that these increased nutrients were biologically available to the plant. T. testudinnm responded to the presence of mussels by significantly increasing leaf widths and lengths. In addition, productivity significantly increased in the mussel-addition treatments. Another response to the presence of mussels included a significantly reduced epiphytic load on the seagrass leaves. The mussel predation experiment evaluated the effects of seagrass on the survivorship of the associated mussel, M. americanus. Mean survival was significantly greater in vegetated habitats than in unvegetated sediments. Consequently, when mussels are present in seagrass meadows, they elevate seagrass productivity through either increased nutrient resource pools or reduced epiphytic loads on the leaves, while the seagrass increases mussel survivorship. Thus, this study demonstrates the reciprocal positive interactions of these organisms when associated and suggests that seagrass meadows may exist as a mosaic of nutrient and productivity 'hot spots' when suspension-feeding organisms are present. These positive interactions may have important consequences in the development, structure and organization of seagrass communities.","Florida Int Univ, SE Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA; Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; Dauphin Island Sea Lab, Dauphin Island, AL 36528 USA","Peterson, BJ (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Univ Pk, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",petersob@fiu.edu,,,,,,63,115,119,1,80,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Here, we studied whether larval environment had carry-over effects in brains of metamorphs. Tadpoles grown at high density had large optic tecta at metamorphosis, whereas tadpoles grown under predation risk had small diencephala. We found that larval density had a carry-over effect on froglet optic tectum size, whereas the effect of larval predation risk had vanished by metamorphosis.

One of the populations was roughly one-half the density of the other, following an experimental reduction 3-4 yr previously. Fecundity was high and independent of density, with > 70% of mature females pregnant in both populations. Age at maturity and juvenile mortality displayed some density dependence. Populations conformed to predictions of the food hypothesis, abundance being ultimately regulated by food-related juvenile mortality. At high density, juvenile mortality was there times as great as at low density, and was associated with poorer juvenile body condition and slower growth. Differences in rates of juvenile mortality are associated with nutritional status of lactating females, which is in turn determined by density-dependent competition for quality forage.

We measured stonefly growth rates after 10 d of conditioning on Baetis bicaudatus (Ephemeroptera) or one of two alternative mayfly prey species in replicated circular plexiglass flow through chambers powered by water from a stream in western Colorado. We then compared attacks per encounter (as an index of predator choice) of conditioned stoneflies to those of unconditioned controls given equal densities of all three prey types. We conducted additional behavioral observations to determine whether predators differentially encountered the alternative prey types on natural substrates, and to determine whether predator-prey microhabitat overlap was a mechanism explaining differential prey encounter rates among prey species. Megarcys exhibited a stereotyped attack bias toward swimming mayflies, such as Baetis, following the simple rule, ''attack any prey that swim,'' which results in Megarcys' selection of prey types that swim in response to stonefly encounters. This behavior remained unmodified after extended experience with alternate but palatable nonswimming mayfly species. A potential fitness advantage (measured as relative growth rate) of this behavioral specialization occurred for female Megarcys, but not for males. Female Megarcys grew faster on Baetis diets because they ate more Baetis, not because Baetis was a more intrinsically profitable prey item (in terms of promoting predator growth). Further, high feeding rates on Baetis were a result of disproportionately high encounter rates and attacks per encounter with Baetis compared to the other mayfly species. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that this predatory behavior arose and is maintained in female stoneflies due to a fitness advantage to individuals specializing on a relatively abundant, easily recognized prey resource. We speculate that this specialized behavior has not been lost in male stoneflies, for which we did not measure a fitness advantage, because there is no strong selection pressure against it. Effective pre-and post-contact prey defenses may exert enough selection pressure to prevent stoneflies from evolving specialization on alternative mayfly types.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS,CRESTED BUTTE,CO 81224","PECKARSKY, BL (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV,DEPT ENTOMOL,ITHACA,NY 14853, USA.",,,,,,,72,31,32,0,5,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1994,75,1,,,,,166,181,,10.2307/1939392,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MP602,WOS:A1994MP60200017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Fouling communities grown on artificial settlement substrata experienced disturbance regimes that differed in their inherent levels of temporal variability and timing of disturbance events, while disturbance intensity was identical across all levels. Additionally, undisturbed assemblages were used as controls. After 150 days of experimental duration, the assemblages were then compared with regard to their species richness, abundance and structure. The disturbance effectively reduced the average total cover of the assemblages, but no consistent effect of variability in the disturbance regime on the assemblages was detected. The results of this study were corroborated by the outcomes from simultaneous replicate experiments carried out in each of eight different biogeographical regions around the world.","Univ Coll Dublin, Ctr Sci West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin, Ireland; Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Warkworth, New Zealand; Humboldt Univ, Dept Biol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; Univ Auckland, Dept Stat, Auckland 1, New Zealand; Univ Kiel, IFM Geomar Leibniz Inst, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Atalah, J (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Ctr Sci West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",javier.atalah@ucd.ie,"Anderson, Marti J./AAQ-9038-2021; Wahl, Martin/D-2038-2016; Lenz, Mark/AAG-1734-2021; Costello, Mark/C-9267-2013","Anderson, Marti J./0000-0002-4018-4049; Wahl, Martin/0000-0001-8703-3857; Costello, Mark/0000-0003-2362-0328; Atalah, Javier/0000-0003-0625-3431",,,,38,9,9,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

However, there is growing awareness that hybridisation between different species may play a constructive role in animal evolution as a means to create variability. Thus, hybridisation and introgression may contribute to adaptive evolution, for example with regards to natural antagonists (parasites, predators, competitors) and adaptation to local environmental conditions. Here we investigated whether parasite intensity contributes to the continuous recreation of hybrids in 74 natural populations of Melanopsis, a complex of freshwater snails with three species. We also examined, under laboratory conditions, whether hybrids and their parental taxa differ in their tolerance of low and high temperatures and salinity levels. Infections were consistently less prevalent in males than in females, and lower in snails from deeper habitats. Infection prevalence in hybrids was significantly lower than in the parental taxa. Low hybrid infection rates could not be explained by sediment type, snail density or geographic distribution of the sampling sites. Interestingly, infected hybrid snails did not show signs of parasite-induced gigantism, whereas all parental taxa did. We found that hybrids mostly coped with extreme temperatures and salinity levels as well as their parental taxa did. Taken together, our results suggest that Melanopsis hybrids perform better in the presence of parasites and environmental stress. This may explain the widespread and long-term occurrence of Melanopsis hybrids as evidenced by paleontological and biogeographic data. Hybridisation may be an adaptive host strategy, reducing infection rates and resisting gigantism. (C) 2014 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The recent expansion of the pine marten into the intensively cultivated plain of the River Po (NW Italy), where previously only stone marten occurred, offered an interesting opportunity to analyse their relationships. We studied the distribution and diet of Martes species and trophic niche overlap between martens and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in two study areas, each with two pseudoreplicates, by analysing genotyped faeces. Our results seem to confirm the displacement of the stone marten from one study area, the pine marten being the only Martes species occurring where previously the stone marten had been reported. We found a large food niche overlap between red fox and both stone and pine martens, but with evidence of size-related differences in the consumption of some food items. We hypothesised that, due to the poor prey-base of the environment, highly altered by intensive crop cultivation, intense interspecific competition originally occurred between the red fox and stone marten. The heightening of interspecific competition caused by the entry of the pine marten in the predator guild may have caused the displacement of the stone marten, at least temporarily. The mechanism of such displacement needs to be clarified through further surveys in areas where the three species occur sympatrically.","[Remonti, Luigi; Balestrieri, Alessandro; Capelli, Enrica; Prigioni, Claudio] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz; Gomez-Moliner, Benjamin J.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Zool & Anim Cell Biol, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz; Gomez-Moliner, Benjamin J.] Univ Basque Country, CIEA Lucio Lascaray Ctr Res & Adv Studies, Systemat Biogeog & Populat Dynam Res Grp, Vitoria 01006, Spain","Remonti, L (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Taramelli 24, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",luigi.remonti@gmail.com; alebls@libero.it; aritz.ruiz@ehu.es; benjamin.gomez@ehu.es; capelli@unipv.it; prigioni@unipv.it,"Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz/A-1613-2013; Gomez, Benjamin/AAA-4119-2019; GONZALEZ, ARITZ RUIZ/P-3384-2019","GONZALEZ, ARITZ RUIZ/0000-0001-7409-4634; GOMEZ MOLINER, BENJAMIN JUAN/0000-0002-3054-8806","River Po Park (Vercelli province); River Po Park (Alessandria province); Basque Government through the Research group on Systematics, Biogeography and Population Dynamics [IT317-10, GIC10/76]; Dept. of Education Universities and Research of the Basque Government [BFI09.396]","This study has been partially supported by the River Po Park (Vercelli and Alessandria provinces) and by the Basque Government through the Research group on Systematics, Biogeography and Population Dynamics (Ref.

Species richness was not significantly different over 2.5 yr on stabilized oil and coal ash reefs compared to concrete control reefs. Of 19 species tested for significant differences in mean abundance, lane snapper was observed at significantly higher mean abundances on fossil-fuel ash reefs (stabilized oil ash/coal fly ash), while three reef species (hairy blenny, porkfish and gray snapper) were significantly more common on concrete control reefs. Further study is needed to determine whether contaminants (Cu, V, Ni and Zn) from stabilized ash blocks can cause abundance differences for some fishes. Plausible alternate explanations for the differences in mean abundance include both interspecific interactions (competition and predation) and differences in the attraction or retention of fish among reef replicates due to slight variations in reef dimensions.

Their establishment may therefore depend on coincidence of chance seed dispersal, favourable weather conditions and low rodent densities. 4 In addition, episodic burial by sand prevents most species from colonizing young dune ridges, while burial of seedlings by litter limits recruitment on older dune ridges with developing forest. The intensity of competition increases during succession. 5 Dune succession is better described as the transient dynamics of colonization and competitive displacement rather than the result of gradual soil development and competitive displacement.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Michigan, Biol Stn, Pellston, MI 49769 USA","Lichter, J (corresponding author), Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",jlichter@bowdoin.edu,,,,,,65,85,95,1,87,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Although such a maladaptive decision-making has been shown in a range of organisms, the mechanisms that underlie this habitat selection pattern often remain unidentified. We tested in a human-modified environment whether food availability and food use of a migratory species operate as functional drivers of an ecological trap. The Red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio) is a migratory bird that was shown to breed preferentially in forest plantation clearcuts where reproductive performance is however markedly lower than in the traditional farmland habitat. We examined whether differences in food availability between forest and farmland habitats resulted in contrasting food provisioning to the offspring with, in turn, significant impact on the quality of the offspring. Invertebrate prey items for shrikes were 41% more abundant in farmland, and prey size was 6% larger in forest habitat. Opposite to the pattern of prey size availability, larger prey items were delivered to the offspring in farmland than in forest habitat. Feeding visits by the parents were 22% more frequent in farmland, and evidence of strong among-nestling competition for food was found in forest only. This study demonstrates the existence of food limitation for an organism in a habitat type associated with high preference but low reproductive performance. This result offers a functional explanation for the mismatch between habitat preference and quality, and hence, for an ecological trap in the wild. Beyond the case of migratory birds, this study draws attention to the point that human-modified environments may lead to a biased perception of habitat quality relative to food availability and may induce an ecological trap for organisms that allocate only a limited time budget to habitat selection decision-making.","[Hollander, Franck A.; Van Dyck, Hans] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, Behav Ecol & Conservat Grp, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Titeux, Nicolas] Publ Res Ctr Gabriel Lippmann, Dept Environm & Agrobiotechnol, L-4422 Belvaux, Luxembourg","Van Dyck, H (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, Behav Ecol & Conservat Grp, Croix Sud 4-5 Bte L7-07-04, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",Hans.Vandyck@uclouvain.be,"Titeux, Nicolas/AAD-4439-2019; Titeux, Nicolas/G-4723-2016","Titeux, Nicolas/0000-0002-7719-7417; Titeux, Nicolas/0000-0002-7719-7417",Belgian National Fund of Scientific Research (FRIA PhD-grant)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"We are grateful to Hubert Baltus, Alice Martinage, Chris Pels and Thomas Walsdorff for their helpful assistance with the field and lab work.

By scat analysis and by snow-tracking we compared winter diet and habitat selection of martens before (1979-80) and after (1987) the decline in foxes to test potential effects of relieved competition on martens. We also used radiotelemetry to study habitat selection after the fox decline in winter and in summer. We were able to show that, at least in the winter situation, martens and foxes do not compete over field voles Microtus agrestis which are a favoured prey of foxes. Probably snow conditions rather than competition limited the consumption of voles by martens in winter. The avoidance of clearcuts by martens seemed to be related to the martens' escape behaviour and had not changed after the decline in foxes. Our data did not contradict relieved interference- and resource-competition as causes of the increase in the marten population.

Many species of this family are omnivores, i.e., besides on prey, they can feed on plant resources such as nectar and pollen. It has been shown that the addition of alternative food for predators to a crop enhances biological control. However, factors such as food availability and quality can also affect interactions such as cannibalism, and thus influence biological control. We investigated the role of quality of the alternative food in the tendency of Amblyseius herbicolus to engage in cannibalism, a common ecological interaction in many phytoseiid mite species. Cannibalism on eggs by A. herbicolus was significantly reduced in the presence of high-quality food (cattail pollen) compared to egg cannibalism without alternative food, whereas this was not the case in the presence of low-quality food (cotton pollen). This suggests that cattail pollen is a high-quality alternative food, not only because it results in increased development and reproduction of predators, but also because it can minimize cannibalism.","[Marcossi, Italo; Fonseca, Morgana M.; Carbajal, Paola A.

Path analysis indicated that the model provided a good fit to the observed data and identified strong effects of Coccinellidae on B. melaleucae and Pentatomidae on O. vitiosa. The other six predator groups exhibited little or no influence on the agents. Relatively low r(2) values within the path model indicated that predators were more likely to be influencing each other (though intraguild predation) than the agents. Experiments were conducted to investigate causality with some of these associations including a small plot experiment that found that predation, primarily by coccinellids, reduced the density of B. melaleucae by 85.6%. Another experiment to examine a potential mutualistic relationship between the subsocial web spinning spider Anelosimus studiosus and B. melaleucae showed that, while B. melaleucae nymphs sometimes shelter within webs where they may avoid predators like coccinellids, the overall densities of B. melaleucae were greater away from webs and that webs frequently contained entrapped B. melaleucae adults. Overall, generalist predators explained little of the variance found in densities of both agents which indicates that predation had little impact on the population dynamics of the intentionally introduced herbivores.

However, this behaviour has never been observed in the wild and was presumed to be ecologically extinct for the last two million years. This study documents for the first time expression of enemy-induced edge-drilling behaviour in the wild by C. dilectus and P. pomum. These observations are based on a multi-year survey between 2002 and 2015 in St Joseph Bay, Florida, a coastal lagoon in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Edge drilling was not recorded in 2002 in St Joseph Bay, but expression of edge-drilling behaviour was confirmed by direct observation for both species and two stations in the bay between 2007 and 2011. Edge-drilling predation traces produced by C. dilectus and P. pomum accounted for more than half of all their drilling attacks in bulk samples collected in 2007, with the frequency of occurrence in bulk samples declining at both stations over time. Intensive sampling along the west Florida shelf over the same time interval failed to find any other unambiguous evidence for expression of edge drilling by these species. St Joseph Bay has the highest densities of predators and lowest prey survival rates in the region and also highest secondary productivity in any seagrass habitat globally, confirming the use of edge drilling by C. dilectus and P. pomum as an indicator of Florida's 'enemy hotspots' and their fates in modern times and in the fossil record. The re-emergence of enemy-induced edge drilling by C. dilectus and P. pomum in Florida after two million years, but only in St Joseph Bay, suggests the present-day ecology of the bay is unique on geological time scales.","[Herbert, Gregory S.] Univ S Florida, Sch Geosci, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Herbert, GS (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Sch Geosci, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",gherbert@usf.edu,,,Florida Institute of Oceanography,"The author is grateful for field and laboratory support from University of South Florida students, facilities support from Jean Huffman and Sandra Chafin of the St Joseph Bay State Buffer Preserve, and ship-time grants from the Florida Institute of Oceanography.",,41,1,1,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0260-1230,1464-3766,,J MOLLUS STUD,J.

Here, we review mechanisms by which artificial light at night may restructure ecological communities by modifying the interactions between species. Such mechanisms may be top-down (predator, parasite or grazer controlled), bottom-up (resource-controlled) or involve non-trophic processes, such as pollination, seed dispersal or competition. We present results from an experiment investigating both top-down and bottom-up effects of artificial light at night on the population density of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum in a diverse artificial grassland community in the presence and absence of predators and under low-level light of different spectral composition. We found no evidence for top-down control of A. pisum in this system, but did find evidence for bottom-up effects mediated through the impact of light on flower head density in a leguminous food plant. These results suggest that physiological effects of light on a plant species within a diverse plant community can have detectable demographic effects on a specialist herbivore.","[Bennie, Jonathan; Davies, Thomas W.; Cruse, David; Inger, Richard; Gaston, Kevin J.] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9FE, England","Gaston, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9FE, England.",k.j.gaston@exeter.ac.uk,"Inger, Richard/D-3445-2009; Davies, Thomas W/H-8103-2013","Inger, Richard/0000-0003-1660-3706; Davies, Thomas W/0000-0002-4673-9893; Gaston, Kevin J./0000-0002-7235-7928; Bennie, Jonathan/0000-0003-4394-2041",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework programme (FP7)/ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [268504],The research leading to this paper was funded by the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant agreement no. 268504 to K.J.G.,,87,74,76,7,110,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

We examined the effects of three key components of ecological context - host density, size structure and predator cue - on interactions between larval frogs and trematode parasites (Digenea: Echinostomatidae) in mesocosms. We found that effects of parasites on host growth could be either negative or positive, depending on host size and overall growth rate, but not on predator presence. A surprising positive effect of parasites on host growth under some conditions could represent an adaptive host life history response, whereby enhanced growth allows escape from a smaller, less tolerant size class that experiences more negative fitness effects of infection. Notably, only host size class was a strong predictor of infection intensity, but not host density or predator cue. Overall, these results suggest that parasitism, competition and host size interact to influence host fitness. Ecological context thus mediates the interactions between parasites and their hosts, with implications for parasite effects in nature.","[Marino, John A., Jr.; Holland, Manja P.; Werner, Earl E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marino, John A., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, 431 West Hall,1085 South Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Marino, JA (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jamarino@umich.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1110137]; University of Michigan Edwin S.

I assembled food webs of bacteria and bacterivorous protist prey in laboratory microcosms with all combinations of five productivity levels, two top predator treatments (present or absent), and three prey compositions. Depauperate food chains contained one of two edible prey species, while more diverse food webs contained both edible prey species plus two additional less-edible/inedible prey. Equilibrium theory predicts that prey diversity should weaken the top-down and bottom-up effects on trophic level biomasses, due to density compensation among prey species. Top-down effects should increase with productivity in food chains, but decrease with productivity in food webs. Results revealed highly dynamic top-down effects, the strength of which varied more over time than among treatments. Further, top-down effects did not merely vary in absolute strength over time, but also in relative strength across different prey compositions and productivity levels. It might be expected that equilibrium models would qualitatively reproduce time-averaged results. However, time-averaged data largely failed to support equilibrium predictions. This failure may reflect strong temporal variability in treatment effects combined with nonlinear density dependence of species' per-capita growth rates. Strong temporal variability in the strength of top-down effects has not previously been demonstrated, but likely is common in nature as well.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Fox, JW (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr 1 NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",jefox@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,42,27,27,2,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2007,116,2,,,,,189,200,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15280.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,128DF,WOS:000243636800002,,,,,2021-09-27,

Four fish biomass levels were set as follows: 0, 116, 176 and 316 g m(-2), and lake water ( containing ca. 190 g m(-2) of filter-feeding fishes) was comparatively monitored. Nutrient levels were high in all treatments during the experiment. Lowest algal biomass were measured in fishless treatment. Algal biomass decreased during days 21-56 as a function of fish biomass in treatments of low (LF), medium (MF) and high (HF) fish biomass. Crustaceans biomass decreased with increasing fish biomass. Small-bodied cladocerans, Moina micrura, Diaphanosoma brachyurum and Scapholeberis kingii survived when fish biomass was high whilst, large-bodied cladocerans Daphnia spp. and the cyclopoids Theromcyclops taihokuensis, T. brevifuratus, Mescyclops notius and Cyclops vicinus were abundant only in NF enclosures. Evasive calanoid Sinodiaptomus sarsi was significantly enhanced in LF, but decreased significantly with further increase of fish biomass. Demographic data indicated that M. micrura was well developed in all treatments. Our study indicates that algal biomass might be controlled by silver carp biomass in eutrophic environment. Changes of crustacean community are probably affected by the age of the first generation of species. Species with short generation time were dominant and species with long generation time survived less with high fish biomass. Evasive calanoids hardly developed in treatments with high fish biomass because of the ( bottle neck) effect of nauplii. Species abundance were positively related to fish predation avoidance. Other than direct predation, zooplankton might also be suppressed by filter-feeding fish via competition.","Wuhan Sci & Technol Inst, Res Ctr Environm Sci, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Donghu Expt Stn Lake Ecosyst, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol China, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China","Lu, M (corresponding author), Wuhan Sci & Technol Inst, Res Ctr Environm Sci, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",erclu@wist.edu.cn,"Xie, Ping/AAL-7532-2020",,,,,50,41,53,0,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,NOV,2002,487,1,,,,,19,31,,10.1023/A:1022940716736,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,659EN,WOS:000181732400002,,,,,2021-09-27,

Here, we present a novel approach to estimate the size of all combined genomes for low coverage next-generation sequencing (NGS) data through empirically determined copy numbers of random DNA fragments. Methods and Results Size estimates were made based on analyses of two experimental soil micro-ecosystems simulating soil with and without earthworms. Our analyses showed combined genome sizes of about log 11 nucleotides for each of the soil micro-ecosystems, as estimated from qPCR determined copy numbers of random DNA fragments. This corresponds to more than 20 000 unique bacterial genomes in each sample. There seemed, however, to be a bacterial subpopulation in the earthworm soil, not being present in the nonearthworm soil. To describe the structure of the metagenomes, both total DNA and amplified 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries were generated with 454-sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of 454 sequence libraries showed a large functional but low taxonomic overlap between the samples with and without earthworms. A neutrality test indicated that rare species have a competitive advantage over abundant species in both micro-ecosystems providing a potential explanation for the large metagenome sizes. Conclusions We have shown that the soil metagenome is very large and that the large size is probably a consequence of top-down selection of the dominant bacterial species. Significance and Impact of the Study Estimates of metagenome size from low coverage NGS data will be important for guiding future NGS set-ups.","[Frisli, T.; Rudi, K.] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Educ & Sci, Hamar, Norway; [Frisli, T.; Haverkamp, T.

Among those, social animals are studied for one type of anti-predator defense. They aggregate in certain habitats to dilute risk, share vigilance, defend each other, and reduce their chances of being attacked. However, this tendency is not necessarily unique: solitary animals may also benefit from the presence of conspecifics. Thus, we hypothesize that even solitary animals should aggregate whenever there is safety in numbers. Additionally, this tendency to aggregate should create a risk pump, a positive feedback in aggregation because more individuals bring more safety, which brings more individuals. We also analyzed if they will aggregate in resource-rich or resource-poor environment. Aggregation in a richer and thus crowded environment implies risk pump is a stronger mechanism than competition. Aggregation in a resource-poor environment indicates the presence of risk pump, but one weaker than competition. To test the existence and direction of a risk pump in non-social animals, we compared quality between patches at different distances and population densities in three experiments. We used the most abundant gerbils of the Negev Desert: Gerbillus andersoni and G. pyramidum. Results supported the hypothesis of aggregation in the resource-poor patch for both species.","[Menezes, Jorge F.

While benthic communities in tropical and also Antarctic regions are thought to be mainly structured by intra- and interspecific interactions, these factors are proposed to be less important in northern high latitudes. Consequently, selective pressure for chemical defence should be low in these regions. To investigate the incidence of chemical defence against predation in northern high latitudes, crude extracts of 18 abundant sessile or slow-moving invertebrate species (4 sponges, 3 actinians, 1 soft coral, 4 bryozoans, 3 ascidians and the egg mass of a gastropod) from Kongsfjord (Spitsbergen) were tested for feeding deterrent activity. Laboratory assays were performed by offering artificial food with extracts to two different predators, the amphipod Anonyx nugax which is a common species in Kongsfjord, and the starfish Asterias rubens from the North Sea. Of the 18 extracts tested, 2 (Haliclona viscosa, Hormathia nodosa) exhibited significant feeding deterrent effects in the amphipod assay. Furthermore, 6 extracts had a significantly stimulating effect on the amphipod feeding, and 10 extracts did not affect consumption. In the starfish assay, only the crude extract of H. viscosa was significantly rejected. For H. viscosa, feeding deterrence could be established for two pure compounds, and for H. nodosa for one fraction. The present data show that feeding deterrent compounds are present in sub-Arctic marine invertebrates from Kongsfjord but are less abundant than in temperate, tropical and Antarctic species.

The study was conducted following a bloom of Dinophysis (Ehrenberg, 1839) at the end of March 2010. Analyses of stomach content showed considerable differences in phytoplankton consumption between the two investigated shellfish species. In M. galloprovincialis, a higher number of phytoplankton species was found than in O. edulis.

Most predators will scavenge in addition to killing their own prey, which alters predation effects and implies that one cannot treat these as independent processes. However, the relative importance of predation vs. scavenging and the mechanisms driving variation of such are relatively unstudied in ecological research on predator-prey relationships. Foraging decisions in facultative predators are likely to respond to environmental conditions (e.g., seasonality) and inter- or intraspecific interactions (e.g., prey availability, presence of top predators, scavenging competition). Using data on 41 GPS-collared wolverines (Gulo gulo) during 2401 monitoring days, in four study sites in Scandinavia, we studied variation in diet and feeding strategies (predation vs. scavenging), along a gradient of environmental productivity, seasonality, density, and body mass of their main prey, semidomestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). The most important factor affecting the relative extent of predation and scavenging was mean prey body mass. Predation was more pronounced in summer, when vulnerable reindeer calves are abundant, and individual kill rates were negatively related to local reindeer body mass. This relationship was absent in winter. The probability of scavenging was higher in winter and increased with decreasing local reindeer body mass, likely as a response to increased carrion supply. Wolverine feeding strategy was further influenced by predictable anthropogenic food resources (e.g., slaughter remains from hunted ungulates) and the presence of a top predator, Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), which provided a continuous carrion supply promoting scavenging. Our results suggest that wolverine feeding strategies are flexible and strongly influenced by seasonally dependent responses to prey body condition in combination with carrion supply. This study demonstrates that large-scale environmental variation can result in contrasting predator feeding strategies, strongly affecting trophic interactions and potentially shaping the dynamics of ecological communities.","[Mattisson, Jenny; Odden, John; Linnell, John D.

Nevertheless, responses of macrobenthic populations to environmental features are overlooked due to the need of consecutive samplings and time-consuming measurements. We examined the population dynamics of the filter-feeding bivalve Anomalocardia brasiliana on a tidal flat over the course of one year to investigate the hypothesis that, as accepted for macrobenthic communities, populations inhabiting environments with low hydrodynamic conditions such as tidal flat should have higher attributes than populations inhabiting more energetic habitats (i.e. areas more influenced by wave energy such as reflective and intermediate beaches). This would be expected because the harsh conditions of more energetic habitats force organisms to divert more energy towards maintenance, resulting in lower population attributes. We found that A. brasiliana showed moderate growth and secondary production at the study area. Moreover the recruitment period was restricted to a few months. A comparison with previous studies showed that, contrary to expected, A. brasiliana populations from areas with low hydrodynamic conditions have lower abundance, growth, recruitment and turnover rate. It is likely that morphodynamic characteristics recorded in these environments, such as larger periods of air exposure and lower water circulation, may affect food conditions for filter-feeding species and increase competition. In addition, these characteristics may negatively affect macrobenthic species by enhancing eutrophication processes and anoxia. Overall, our results suggest that models accepted and applied at the macrobenthic community level might not be directly extended to A. brasiliana populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Australian vertebrate assemblages changed significantly following European colonisation, which resulted in the establishment of invasive vertebrates and the loss of native marsupials, many of which consume invertebrates. Conservation focusses on the removal of invasive carnivores and the reintroduction of regionally extinct species to fenced sites, resulting in what could be considered a reconstruction of pre-European vertebrate assemblages. In semi-arid Australian spinifex mallee ecosystems, we asked: (1) what is the effect of reconstructed pre-European vertebrate assemblages on native arachnid assemblages? and (2) what direct or indirect mechanisms (predation, disturbance and/or competition) could plausibly be responsible for these effects? We compared sites with reconstructed vertebrate assemblages with paired control sites. Arachnids were sampled using pitfall trapping and direct searching. Hypotheses regarding mechanisms were tested using scat analysis (predation) and by comparing burrow depth (disturbance) and scorpion mass (competition) between control and reconstructed sites. The dominant dune scorpion, Urodacus yaschenkoi, was less abundant and a wolf spider (Lycosa gibsoni species group) more abundant in reconstructed sites. Differences in spider assemblage composition were marginally non-significant. Scat analysis confirmed native vertebrate predation on scorpions and we found no evidence that competition or disturbance affected scorpions. We, thus, suggest that changes in spider assemblages may have resulted from ecological cascades via decreases in dune scorpions. The loss of omnivorous mammals and other changes associated with the invasion of carnivores may, therefore, have had broad-reaching consequences for native arachnid assemblages in Australian ecosystems.","[Silvey, Colin J.; Gibb, Heloise] La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3068, Australia; [Silvey, Colin J.] Museum Victoria, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Hayward, Matthew W.] Australian Wildlife Conservancy, Scotia Sanctuary, Wentworth, NSW 2648, Australia; [Hayward, Matthew W.] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales","Gibb, H (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3068, Australia.",h.gibb@latrobe.edu.au,"Gibb, Heloise/B-8338-2013; Hayward, Matt W./F-3569-2010","Hayward, Matt W./0000-0002-5574-1653; Gibb, Heloise/0000-0001-7194-0620",Australia and Pacific Science Foundation [APSF 0904]; Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT130100821],"We thank the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC) staff, in particular, Jennifer Cathcart, Tony Cathcart, Felicity L'Hotelier and Joe Stephens, for their hospitality and assistance at Scotia Sanctuary.

We examined how this affected the structure of 24 quantitative replicate plant-aphid-parasitoid networks constructed using DNA-based methods. Simulated climate warming affected species richness, significantly altered consumer-resource asymmetries and reduced network complexity. Increased temperature induced an aphid outbreak, but the parasitism rates of aphids by parasitoid wasps remained unchanged. It also drove changes in the crop, altering in particular the phenology of the wheat as well as its quality (i.e., fewer, lighter seeds).

If the effect strength is linked to functional traits of the herbivores then this would allow for more general predictions. Due to the generally sub-lethal effects of herbivory in terrestrial systems, trophic cascades manifest themselves in the first instance in the fitness of individual plants, affecting both their numerical and genetic contributions to the population. We directly compare the indirect predator effects on growth and reproductive output of individual Vicia faba plants mediated by the presence of two aphid species: Acyrtosiphon pisum is characterised by a boom and bust strategy whereby colonies grow fast and overexploit their host plant individual while Megoura viciae appear to follow a more prudent strategy that avoids over-exploitation and death of the host plant. Plants in the field were infested with A. pisum, M. viciae or both and half the plants were protected from predators. Exposure to predators had a strong impact on the biomass of individual plants and the strength of this effect differed significantly between the different herbivore treatments. A. pisum had a greater direct impact on plants and this was coupled with a significantly stronger indirect predator effect on plant biomass. Although the direct impact of predators was strongest on M. viciae, this was not transmitted to the plant level, indicating that the predator-prey interactions strength is not as important as the plant-herbivore link for the magnitude of the indirect predator impact. At the individual plant level, the indirect predator effect was purely due to consumptive effects on herbivore densities with no evidence for increased herbivore dispersal in response to presence of predators. The nature of plant-herbivore interactions is the key to terrestrial trophic cascade strength. The two herbivores that we compared were similar in feeding mode and body size but differed their way how they exploit host plants, which was the important trait explaining the strength of the trophic cascade.","[van Veen, F.

The goal of our study was to compare the diets of striped and unstriped P. cinereus over a range of seasonal conditions to better understand if the reported differences observed in the fall season at our field site remain consistent through the active season of this species. Diet differences between the two morphs were greatest during spring and fall when salamanders are most abundant at the surface. These diet differences were driven largely by two prey categories. In the spring, striped salamanders ate more oribatid mites and in the fall they consumed more entomobryomorph Collembola.

Several factors are known to affect predator choice, including the prey's relative abundance and conspicuousness. In polymorphic prey species, predators often target the most common or most visible morphs. To test if predator choice can explain why in Midas cichlid fish the more visible (gold) morph is also more rare than the inconspicuous dark morph, we conducted predation experiments using two differently coloured wax models in Nicaraguan crater lakes. Contrary to expectations, we observed an overall higher attack rate on the much more abundant, yet less conspicuous dark models, and propose frequency-dependent predation as a potential explanation for this result. Interestingly, the attack rate differed between different types of predators. While avian predators were biased towards the abundant and less colourful dark morphs, fish predators did not show a strong bias. However, the relative attack rate of fish predators seemed to vary with the clarity of the water, as attack rates on gold models went up as water clarity decreased. The relative differential predation rates on different morphs might impact the relative abundance of both colour morphs and thus explain the maintenance of the colour polymorphism.

Spine lengths are reversible with predator addition and removal, confirming developmental induction as the major short-term response. Laboratory assays reveal major geographic variation, implying active evolution. Responses range from almost no spine elongation where Epischura is historically absent (Europe), to major elongation where the predator and prey are in prolonged contact (Laurentian Great Lakes). Trade-offs (i.e., loss of competitive ability) can be related to spine lengths of the prey species. However, induction is not exclusive to Epischura, as a collection of invertebrate predators also induce spine elongation. Bosmina responses to individual predator species are different, implying active recognition of multiple predation threats in nature. The absence of induction responses to some exotics (e.g., Bythotrephes) may help explain disproportionate food web impacts. Both revelations underscore the importance of ongoing evolution in aquatic communities.","[Kerfoot, W.

In an attempt to develop and test generic hypotheses explaining these differences, we studied 84 populations of the gray-sided vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in Hokkaido, Japan. We show that these populations are limited by a combination of density-independent factors (such as climate) and density-dependent processes (such as specialist predators). We show that density-dependent regulation primarily occurs in winter months, so that populations experiencing longer winters tend to have a stronger delayed density-dependence and, as a result, exhibit regular density cycles. Altogether, we demonstrate that seasonality plays a key role in determining whether a vole population is cyclic or not.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600811, Japan; Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Stenseth, NC (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, POB 1031 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",n.c.stenseth@bio.uio.no,"Saitoh, Takashi/D-6021-2012; Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016; Viljugrein, Hildegunn/N-6657-2015; Hansen, Thomas F/B-9021-2009","Saitoh, Takashi/0000-0003-4085-5014; Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; Viljugrein, Hildegunn/0000-0002-3798-5267",,,,45,103,109,0,34,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.
