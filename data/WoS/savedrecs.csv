Although the keystone predator effect (i.e., local coexistence and species diversity mediated by predator consumption) is commonly reported, negative effects of predators on species coexistence are also common. The balance depends critically on the asymmetry of competition, predator preferences for different prey, and the effective mortality rates exerted by predator populations on prey per capita growth rates. Here we studied the role of predation on two competing mussels, the dominant competitor Perumytilus purpuratus that dominates in abundance at most shores, and the subordinate Semimytilus algosus, which is common, but persistently abundant only at a smaller set of shores. We examined the potential for keystone effects by quantifying and evaluating the patterns of mussel consumption rates of sea star (Heliaster helianthus) and crab (Acanthocyclus gayi) predators in laboratory experiments, and under natural field conditions. Field sites with contrasting mussel abundance and recruitment (i.e., different local prey population growth rates) were chosen. Laboratory experiments showed that crabs would first consume Semimytilus over Perumytilus in mixed mussel clumps, while the larger sea star predators made no distinction between mussel species. Regardless of the order in which mussel species were first ingested, consumption rates of the two mussel species through the experiment were not different for either predator species. A similar temporal pattern was partly observable in the field through specific differences in the order of mussel consumption; however, experimental mussels of both species where consumed after the first two months of exposure to predators at both sites. Thus, in this system predation could not foster coexistence between mussel species and it may instead favor the occurrence of local extinction of the subordinate competitor, especially at sites where the smaller and more selective crab predators are relatively more abundant and recruitment of the subordinate species is low. Existing patterns of locally abundant Semimytilus beds are probably related to high site-specific recruitment rates of this species and should be further explored.","[Escobar, Joan B.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, LINCGlobal, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, ECIM,Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile; [Knight, Christopher] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Knight, Christopher] San Diego State Univ, Coastal Marine Inst Lab, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Escobar, JB (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, LINCGlobal, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, ECIM,Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile.",jescobar@bio.puc.cl,,"Knight, Christopher/0000-0002-7522-4127","FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160289, 1120158]; Center for Marine Conservation, Nucleo Milenio Initiative [P10-033F]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [2110170]; Fulbright","We thank Elliott Ramos, Simon Karythis, Emily Lamb, Mirtala Parrague and Rodrigo Uribe for invaluable assistance in the field and during laboratory experiments.

The most abundant lizard and web-spider species (Anolis sagrei and Merepeira datona, respectively), were manipulated within field enclosures over a 30-mo period. The design was a 2 x 2 factorial: A. sagrei present and removed, crossed with M. datona present and removed. A. sagrei reduced abundance of Eustala cazieri, the second most abundant web spider, and tended to reduce abundance of all rare spider species combined. M. datona had no significant effect on abundance of E. cazieri or of all rare species combined. In each statistical analysis of abundance, the A. sagrei x M. datona interaction term was not significant, indicating that lizards did not intensify (or reduce) interactions among spider species. Furthermore. data on spider food supply, body length, and web height showed no evidence for two proposed mechanisms in which interactions among spider species are stronger with lizards than without. Thus, this experiment supports the hypothesis that direct predation is the major mechanism by which lizards reduce the abundance and species richness of spiders.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Spiller, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",daspiller@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,47,16,19,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2001,82,6,,,,,1560,1570,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1560:AETFPM]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,446PG,WOS:000169521200005,,,,,2021-09-27,

In spite of week-to-week fluctuations, the population density for each of two common European Daphnia species was found to be remarkably similar within single lakes (from station to station on a single date, and from date to date at a single station) as well as from lake to lake, regardless of trophic state. All lakes on all dates revealed densities in the range 10-50 ind l(-1) for the smaller-bodied D. cucullata and 1-5 ind l(-1) for the larger-bodied D. hyalina, in spite of different intensity of reproduction resulting from different food levels (chlorophyll a between 0.2 and 4.2 mug/l). It can be asserted that the population density of each species remains far below the carrying capacity of the habitat K, and does not depend on food levels, which merely set the rate of population increase, while the population density reflects the species' vulnerability to predation by planktivorous fish. The reactive distance (the distance over which a foraging fish can see its prey) in 1+ roach, a dominant planktivore in the lakes studied, has been found to be twice as great for D. hyalina as for D. cucullata, whatever the light intensity. The relative reactive field volume was therefore an order of magnitude greater for the former than for the latter, showing that the densities of the two prey species would be assessed by a foraging roach as equal when, in reality, they differed by an order of magnitude, as they do in various lakes and in various seasons. The first of the two conclusions is that whatever the growth and reproduction in a population of a cladoceran such as Daphnia, its density would be fixed by mortality induced by fish predation. The second would be, that the difference between the bottom-up and top-down effects in freshwater is more than merely the upward or downward direction along the food web, since the bottom-up effects are about the flow control (the rate of net production, individual growth rate, rate of reproduction) and the top-down about the standing-crop control (biomass, individual body size, population density level).","Univ Warsaw, Dept Hydrobiol, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland","Gliwicz, ZM (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Dept Hydrobiol, Banacha 2, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland.",Gliwicz@hydro.biol.uw.edu.pl,,,,,,30,25,26,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN,2001,442,1-3,,,,,291,300,,,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,418ZL,WOS:000167924900028,,,,,2021-09-27,

The wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) Hogna helluo (Walckenaer) and Pardosa milvina Hentz co-occur in soybean fields of south-west Ohio, U.S.A. As adults, Hogna is the larger species and has the competitive advantage in most interactions; due to differing phenologies, however, their size-classes frequently overlap and as such there is potential for shifts in competitive ability and intra-guild predation. The hypothesis that competitive interactions and intra-guild predation will favour Pardosa when Pardosa is similar-sized, or has a size advantage over Hogna, was tested in laboratory and field experiments. 2. Studies in laboratory arenas, pairing similar-sized individuals of these species and Hogna spiderlings with larger spiders of both species, revealed that intra-guild predation seldom occurs with similar-sized Hogna and Pardosa, however Pardosa will consume small Hogna individuals in laboratory arenas. 3. Field experiments involved stocking high densities (50 m(-) (2)) of Pardosa and Hogna in enclosures placed in soybean fields. In experiments with spiders of similar size, no interspecific effects were uncovered, but an intraspecific effect was found for Pardosa as its survival and weight gain were lower in the presence of more conspecifics. Large Hogna or Pardosa had no effect on the survival or weight gain of Hogna spiderlings. 4. Although Hogna is a better competitor as an adult, it has no advantage over Pardosa when their size-classes overlap, and Pardosa effects on Hogna may be inconsequential under field conditions. Therefore, the co-existence of these species is fostered by the fact that there are few negative interspecific interactions during their ontogeny.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Rypstra, AL (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 1601 Peck Blvd, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA.",,"Walker, Sean E/A-4722-2008","Walker, Sean/0000-0001-9310-3305; Buddle, Christopher/0000-0002-7494-9732",,,,40,41,43,0,13,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Recently a number of ecologists have attempted to clarify the concepts of strong- and weak-interactors in a community, and to derive techniques for quantifying interaction strengths in the field, using metrics that are consistent, comparable, and of relevance to theoreticians. In this paper we examine potential biases in different empirical approaches to quantifying variation in interaction strengths within and among natural communities. Using both simulated and published data, we explore the behavior of four commonly used or recently proposed empirical measures of the strength of consumer-prey interactions. The type of index used, the experimental protocol, and the underlying model of predator-prey interaction all strongly influence one's perception of both (1) the distribution of interaction strengths among species (e.g., presence of keystone species), and (2) the specific identity of the interactions that appear to be most important. Raw treatment differences tend to emphasize effects on very abundant prey, while the three proportional indices tend to emphasize effects on extremely rare prey. Two of the proportional indices are inherently asymmetric about zero, and they inflate positive or negative effects, respectively. When predators exhibit a saturating functional response, the three proportional measures of per capita effect are biased toward a skewed distribution of interaction strengths dominated by effects on the rarest prey. Predator interference causes the per capita measures to emphasize the effects of rare predators. Estimates of per capita effects are also problematic when (1) the per capita effects are back-calculated from experiments designed to measure collective effects (e.g., predator exclusions), and (2) the collective effect of a predator is constant across a wide range of predator densities, as may be common for keystone predators. Finally, since all of the indices show time-dependent behavior, they are differentially suited fur different experimental protocols (e.g., short-term vs, long-term results, or community initially near vs. far from equilibrium). All the indices explored here have the potential to provide useful, complementary information about ecological impacts of species in natural communities. In this analysis, we attempt to clarify what each index actually measures and the conditions under which each is most revealing.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Berlow, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012; Briggs, Cheryl/F-7456-2013; Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013","Briggs, Cheryl/0000-0001-8674-5385",,,,30,170,175,2,114,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1999,80,7,,,,,2206,2224,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2206:QVITSO]2.0.CO;2,,,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,243QU,WOS:000083009400007,,,,,2021-09-27,

The distributions of the two species are sometimes defined with a small overlapping zone (called a 'sympatric area') which generally shifts. Exclusion is necessary to explain the persistence and shift of such a spatial pattern. Field studies are carried out to identify the type of interaction that leads to the required exclusion. This is usually achieved by estimating competition and predation parameters to define the type of interaction strong enough to imply exclusion. But interaction parameters are estimated by quantitative methods which require prolonged observation (5-10 years). These estimations are thus difficult to obtain and are open to criticism because of the spatial and temporal variations in the biotic context. Now the study of these variations requires estimation of several other interaction parameters (for different times and sites); therefore, we are unable to discuss these criticisms from a study of realistic duration. We have, therefore, developed a faster study method using the spatial properties of the sympatric: area (width and velocity). We used a between-species competition and a predation model, spatially extended with coupled map lattice formalism (CML), to generate substitution waves corresponding to the 'moving sympatric area' and to study their spatial properties (asymptotic width and velocity). The relationships between the asymptotic width and the interaction level had different shapes with competition and predation parameters. We used this difference to define a rapid study method that does not use quantitative estimations of the interaction parameters. This method is more reliable than the usual method with respect to the above criticisms. These findings may have considerable consequences for field studies of parapatry.

However this positive feedback can result in unrealistic dominance of single species. We examine in which way this feedback can be modelled to maintain species diversity and species composition similar to observed forests. A submodel of the spatio-temporal forest model TreeMig for simulating seed production, seed dispersal, seed bank dynamics and sapling development is presented. With the extended model, interactions of different factors that can influence species diversity in a forest are examined. In simulations under different bioclimatic conditions of Switzerland differential hypotheses for maintaining species diversity are tested. The simulated species diversity and dominant species are compared to data compiled from the Swiss National Forest Inventory. Intra-specific density regulation is necessary to produce in the simulations a species diversity and species composition similar to data. Without this intra-specific density dependence, strong seed producers, such as birch (Betula pendula) dominate the stand, in contrast to the data, and decrease species diversity. With intra-specific density regulation, species diversity is further increased by spatial or temporal variability. Temporal variability in environmental factors alone can enhance species diversity if the factors fluctuate between the favourable and unfavourable range of the strong seed producers.

Fluctuating densities and dietary overlap may account for massive ecological and evolutionary changes in fish communities. We sampled a mixed juvenile (0+ stages, being younger than 1 year of age) fish community at the Lower Rhine over three consecutive years, including native and newly established species (similar to 64,000 captured individuals and similar to 4200 dissected fish). Our aim was to develop a new approach in which data on density, individual consumption rates, and diet overlaps (both intra- and interspecific) solely originating from the natural environment, were used and combined to estimate species-specific competitive strengths within and between seasons and species. The juvenile fish community at the food-limited Rhine was dominated by invasive gobies. Species-specific consumption rates decreased depending on the dietary overlap with other juveniles. Two invasive gobies (Neogobius melanostomus and N. fluviatilis) showed the greatest competitive abilities, followed by a third invasive Gobiid species (Ponticola kessleri) and the native Aspius aspius, a species utilizing an exclusive food source. Both other native species (Perca fluviatilis and Sander lucioperca) had the lowest estimates of food-related competitive strength, indicating that these species are forced into a juvenile competitive bottleneck by the invasive gobies, before they finally can develop into successful predators on gobies later in life. Our new analytical approach to measure dietary competitive strength among individuals provides a powerful tool to empirically study eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics in the field.","[Borcherding, Jost; Heubel, Katja; Storm, Svenja] Univ Cologne, Dept Gen Ecol, Inst Zool, Ecol Field Stn Rees, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Borcherding, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Dept Gen Ecol, Inst Zool, Ecol Field Stn Rees, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",Jost.Borcherding@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011; Heubel, Katja/J-4060-2012","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861; Heubel, Katja/0000-0002-7946-5542","Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia; Volkswagen foundationVolkswagen [92 002]","We thank Pavel Jurajda (Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno) and the members of his team for their help during several fishing campaigns, as well as numerous students from the University of Cologne who helped with field assistance.

Predation exerted by other species and predation by self (cannibalism) are commonly the chief sources of post-settlement mortality and can profoundly influence population dynamics and adult spatial distribution. In Chile, two predatory crab species (Acanthocyclus gayi and Acanthocyclus hassleri) coexist in the intertidal zone. Both settle preferentially in mussel beds, but adults show remarkable spatial segregation, apparently as a result of asymmetric competition for refuges. Although early recruits of A. gayi are an order of magnitude more abundant than A. hassleri, late juveniles are similarly abundant. Recruits of A. gayi are probably subjected to higher mortality before competition for refuges intensifies. Here, through laboratory experiments, we quantified the strength of intra and inter-cohort cannibalism and inter-specific predation as probable sources of differential post-settlement mortality. Intra-cohort cannibalism (among recruits of same size) accounted for the mortality of up to 30% of recruits in both species, with no evidence of density-dependent effects on mortality. Rates of cannibalism between juveniles and recruits (inter-cohorts) were also similar between the two species. Both species exhibit type III functional responses of juvenile predators with a tendency to consume heavily upon the most abundant recruits (A. gayi in the field), which could potentially provide A. hassleri recruits with a virtual refuge from the inter-cohort predation in the field. The combination of these different sources of mortality might contribute to the large reduction in abundance of A. gayi recruits by the time they reach juvenile stages.

However, predators can alter such competitive interactions substantially. Predation can promote the coexistence of species in a situation where it would otherwise be impossible, for example if a tradeoff between the competitive abilities and predation resistance of the prey species exists. The field vole Microtus agrestis and the sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis are sympatric grassland species, which compete for the same resources. At the population level sibling voles are suggested to be superior competitors to field voles, yet more vulnerable to predation. We tested the effects of predation on the two species in 0.5 ha outdoor enclosures by exposing vole populations to radio-collared freely-hunting least weasels Mustela nivalis nivalis for three weeks. Lethal and non-lethal impacts of predation limited population densities of both species during and after the experimental period, but the effect was more pronounced in sibling voles in which population densities decreased markedly during the treatment period and even after that. Field vole population densities remained stable under weasel predation, while densities increased in controls. Survival in both species was lower in treatment populations compared to controls, but the effect tended to be more pronounced in sibling voles and in females of both species. The average mass of adults in both species declined in the treatment populations. These results suggest that predation by least weasels can limit vole populations locally, even during favourable summer conditions, and have extended negative effects on the dynamics of vole populations. In addition, predation alleviated interspecific competition between the vole species and is, therefore, a potential factor enabling the coexistence of them.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Biomed & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Koivisto, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",elanko@utu.fi,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509",,,,57,8,8,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2008,117,1,,,,,6,12,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15938.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,237PG,WOS:000251387000002,,,,,2021-09-27,

We separated the effects of density on species richness that are due to sampling, from those due to density-dependent ecological processes such as competition or predation, by manipulating the density of an entire community. 2 A seed bank from a community of desert annual plants that occur on semi-stabilized sand dunes in Israel was collected from the field and sown in an experimental garden at a range of densities from 1/16 to eight times the natural density. The species pool observed in the lowest density plots was used as the null community, which was repeatedly sampled to calculate the species richness land other diversity indices) in higher density plots that would be expected from sampling considerations alone. The significance of deviations of observed diversity from this expected diversity was then evaluated. 3 Both observed and expected number of species increased substantially with the experimental increase in density. However, observed species richness, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were often significantly lower than that expected based on sampling considerations. The magnitude of the deviation from expected increased significantly with increasing density for richness and the Shannon-Wiener index. This provides some of the first direct experimental evidence from diverse natural assemblages that increasing competition among all the individuals in a community can lead to competitive exclusion.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Goldberg, DE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Nat Sci Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,16,43,43,0,8,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Most ecological research has focused on negative species interactions, especially competition, predation and parasitism. Yet the relevance of positive interactions - mutualisms and commensalisms - have been brought to the fore in recent years by an increasing number of empirical studies exploring their impact on range limits. Based on a review of 73 studies from a Web of Science search, we found strong evidence that positive interactions can influence the extent of species' geographic or ecological ranges through a diversity of mechanisms. More specifically, we found that while obligate interactions, and especially obligate mutualisms, tend to constrain the ranges of one or both partners, facultative positive interactions tend to widen ranges. Nonetheless, there was more variation in effects of facultative interactions on range limits, pointing to important context-dependencies. Therefore, we propose that conceptual development in this field will come from studying ecological interactions in the context of networks of many species across environmental gradients, since pairwise interactions alone might overlook the indirect and environmentally-contingent effects that species have on each other in communities of many interacting species. Finally, our study also revealed key data gaps that limit our current understanding of the pervasiveness of effects that positive interactions have on species' ranges, highlighting potential avenues for future theoretical and experimental work.","[Stephan, Pauline; Mora, Bernat Bramon; Alexander, Jake M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland","Stephan, P (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",stephanp@student.ethz.ch,"; Alexander, Jake/P-2580-2014","Stephan, Pauline/0000-0002-5218-3852; Alexander, Jake/0000-0003-2226-7913",European UnionEuropean Commission [678841],We thank Thomas Stadler and students on the course `Ecology and Evolution: Term Paper' at ETH Zurich for suggestions that helped improve an early version of this manuscript.

Field experiment 1 tested which species has a competitive advantage as larvae developing in water-filled tires. Densities and al availability of resources (leaf litter, which is a substrate for microorganisms fed upon by larvae) were manipulated in a factorial design. Contrary to previous laboratory experiments, A. albopictus was clearly the superior competitor in this tire environment, maintaining positive population growth at higher combined density and lower per capita resource availability than did A. aegypti. The primary determinant of success in this experiment was survivorship to adulthood, and A. aegypti only survived well in this environment when raised alone at low density, with high resource availability. Field experiment 2 tested whether this advantage for A. albopictus resulted from apparent competition mediated by shared protozoan parasites in the genus Ascogregarina. In field experiment 2, A. albopictus larvae had moderate to high levels of parasitism, but A. aegypti larvae were virtually free from Ascogregarina in all experimental tires, implying that Ascogregarina played little or no role in producing the advantage for A. albopictus in field experiment 1. Thus, apparent competition does not appear to be necessary to account for the replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus. As a first step toward understanding variation in the outcome of this invasion, numbers of Aedes immatures and masses of adults from field collected pupae (indicators of the intensity of competition) were compared for three sites with known histories of invasion by A. albopictus ana decline or A. aegypti. Differences among sites in both number of Aedes per container and masses of adults of both species were consistent with the hypothesis that intensity of competition varies among sites, and suggest that A. aegypti persists only at sites where interspecific competition is less intense. Resource competition among larvae appears to be sufficient to account for replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus in suburban and rural areas of South Florida, which may have been marginal habitats for A. aegypti.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Grp, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Juliano, SA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Grp, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",,,,57,276,279,1,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1998,79,1,,,,,255,268,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0255:SIARAM]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YR740,WOS:000071525500023,,,,,2021-09-27,

The extensive use of insecticides in attempts to control its populations eliminates natural enemies and competitor flower thrips species, thereby increasing its populations. An unsustainable situation develops with concomitant resistant pest populations, secondary pest outbreaks, and environmental degradation. Integrated pest management utilizes knowledge of pest and natural enemy relationships to implement tactics that are environmentally friendly and sustainable. Minute pirate bugs are the most important worldwide predators of thrips. They can suppress and ultimately control Frankliniella species flower thrips. Flower samples taken at least weekly are needed to understand predator-prey dynamics. Shown here is the sampling of the flowers of fruiting vegetables and companion plants to estimate the densities of individual thrips and minute pirate bug species. Representative data illustrates how the protocol is used to determine the efficacy of management tactics over time and how to evaluate the benefits of predation by minute pirate bugs. The sampling protocol is similarly adaptable to sampling thrips and minute pirate bugs in other plant species hosts.","[Funderburk, Joseph; Martini, Xavier; Freeman, Josh; Strzyzewski, Iris; Traczyk, Edward] Univ Florida, North Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Skarlinsky, Thomas] USDA, Anim & Plant Hlth Inspect Serv, Plant Protect Quarantine, Miami Plant Inspect Stn, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Adkins, Scott] ARS, US Hort Res Lab, USDA, Washington, DC USA","Funderburk, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, North Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jef@ufl.edu,,,"Specialty Crop Block Grants from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services [01856, 024049]; USDA-ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service [58-6618-2-096, 58-6618-4-035]; University of FloridaUniversity of Florida [58-6618-2-096, 58-6618-4-035]","Support was provided by Specialty Crop Block Grants from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Numbers 01856 and 024049.

Newts and sirens had no effect on anuran species richness in SC. Instead, another salamander (Ambystoma talpoideum, mole salamander) absent from the NC ponds was identified as a strong keystone in SC. It functioned independently of environmental factors and the densities of other predators.

The species responded differently in their proportional use of two habitat types, a low cover (productive but riskier) and a high cover (safer but poorer). When alone, field voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability at low densities, but decreased its use with increasing density. Sibling voles, however, avoided the low-cover habitat in single-species populations. Under interspecific competition, the habitat-use patterns switched between species: sibling voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability, with decreasing use as densities increased. Sibling voles responded to predation risk by showing a stronger density-dependent decrease in the use of low-cover habitat. Field voles, initially using mostly high cover, did not change behaviour under risk of predation.

Correlations between Vibrio and phytoplankton abundance have been noted, suggesting that growth is enhanced during algal blooms or that association with phytoplankton provides a refuge from predation. Here, we investigated relationships between particle-associated Vibrio spp. and phytoplankton in Delaware's inland bays (DIB). The relative abundances of particle-associated Vibrio spp. and algal classes that form blooms in DIB (dinoflagellates, diatoms, and raphidophytes) were determined using quantitative PCR. The results demonstrated a significant correlation between particle-associated Vibrio abundance and phytoplankton, with higher correlations to diatoms and raphidophytes than to dinoflagellates. Species-specific associations were examined during a mixed bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica (Raphidophyceae) and indicated a significant positive correlation for particle-associated Vibrio abundance with H. akashiwo but a negative correlation with F. japonica. Changes in Vibrio assemblages during the bloom were evaluated using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), which revealed significant differences between each size fraction but no significant change in Vibrio assemblages over the course of the bloom. Microzooplankton grazing experiments showed that losses of particle-associated Vibrio spp. may be offset by increased growth in the Vibrio population. Moreover, analysis of Vibrio assemblages by ARISA also indicated an increase in the relative abundance for specific members of the Vibrio community despite higher grazing pressure on the particle-associated population as a whole.

Seed availability, competition from established neighbors, and seedling predation may all limit seedling recruitment. In this field experiment, we followed the emergence and survival of seedlings of three perennial forbs, Achillea millefolium, Hypericum perforatum, and Monarda fistulosa, in old-fields in southeastern Michigan, USA. As adults, all three have aromatic foliage that may deter herbivory, but seedlings may be more susceptible than adults. To establish the relative importance of potential controls on seedling numbers, we manipulated seed availability through seed additions, the influence of competitors by neighbor-removals, and the influence of insect herbivores with insecticide in a fully factorial field experiment. Seed addition and insecticide never affected seedling emergence for any species. Competition from established neighbors controlled seedling emergence for all three species and decreased Achillea survival. Insecticide significantly increased Monarda seedling survival in competition plots, significantly increased Hypericum survival in open plots, and had no effect on Achillea. Notably, insecticide increased survival of the native Monarda fistulosa more than the two introduced species. While neighbors strongly reduced emergence and survival of all three species, herbivores acted on a species-specific basis. These results suggest the differential effects of insects may contribute more to the seedling species composition and abundance patterns than the less-selective influence of competition.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Greiling, DA (corresponding author), BioMedware, 516 N State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.",,,,,,,37,10,10,2,20,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,APR,2002,159,2,,,,,175,183,,10.1023/A:1015521016568,,,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,552TV,WOS:000175636900006,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, less is known about mechanisms that determine the responses of different species to the same pulse. We hypothesized that these differences are related to the size of the species, as increasing size may be correlated with increasing competitive ability and decreasing tolerance to predation. A factorial experiment quantified the magnitude and timing of species' responses to a resource pulse using the aquatic communities found in the leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. We added prey to leaves and followed the abundances of bacteria and bacterivores (protozoa and rotifers) in the presence and absence of a top predator, larvae of the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii. Resource pulses had significant positive effects on species abundances and diversity in this community; however, the magnitude and timing of responses varied among the bacterivore species and was not related to body size. Larger bacterivores were significantly suppressed by predators, while smaller bacterivores were not; predation also significantly reduced bacterivore species diversity. There were no interactions between the effects of the resource pulse and predation on protozoa abundances. Over 67days, some species returned to pre-pulse abundances quickly, others did not or did so very slowly, resulting in new community states for extended periods of time. This study demonstrates that species-specific differences in responses to resource pulses and predation are complex and may not be related to simple life history trade-offs associated with size.","[Miller, Thomas E.; Buhler, Maya L.; Cuellar-Gempeler, Catalina] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Miller, TE (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",miller@bio.fsu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0519170, DEB 1456425]",This work was partially funded by grants from the National Science Foundation (DEB 0519170 and DEB 1456425 to TEM).,,40,2,2,3,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2019,190,1,,,,,169,178,,10.1007/s00442-019-04393-1,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IA0JN,WOS:000469243000015,30941498,,,,2021-09-27,

In all three treatments, the survival of S. nigrolineata larvae was high at the beginning of experiment, 0.39-0.83 between the 1st and 5th stages, but later high mortality was observed. C. producta adults tended to invade experimental rock pools and towards the end of the experiment larvae of this species were dominant. Oviposition rates and developmental rates of the three species are comparable. In laboratory tests, young larvae of S. nigrolineata were more vulnerable to interspecific predation than those of the rock-pool species, and older larvae proved to be less efficient predators. In rock pools, there are no environmental factors preventing successful reproduction by S. nigrolineata.

However, the mechanisms underlying environmental changes, such as a decrease in the relative abundance of native species, are poorly understood. Since the introduction of the ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), in Chile in the 1970s for biological control of aphids, a reduction in the relative abundance of the native ladybird beetle Eriopis connexa (Germar) has been noticed. To explore the role of cannibalism, intraguild predation (IGP) or competition as possible mechanisms that might increase dominance of H. variegata over E. connexa, several laboratory experiments were carried out. The native and the exotic species were very similar in their voracity and biotic interactions. Although H. variegata was able to maintain constant reproductive performance, E. connexa reproduction decreased at lower densities of aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The impacts of cannibalism, IGP, and competition exerted by these species were very symmetrical in both larvae and adults. We conclude that these biotic factors may not fully explain the increase in relative abundance of H. variegata. The higher sensitivity of E. connexa to prey patch size, along with other factors such as chemical-mediated negative interspecific interactions may be operating in alfalfa fields, changing the composition of associated coccinellid assemblages.","[Grez, A.

I manipulated interaction pathways between the spider and the plants using different combinations of the grasshopper species. I changed the modality of predator-prey interactions to isolate density-mediated from trait-mediated effects using natural spiders (predation spiders) or spiders that were prevented from subduing prey by mouthpart manipulation (risk spiders). I found that indirect effects were stronger in speciose, reticulate food webs than in linear food chains owing to a trait-mediated effect, a diet shift by herbivores in response to predation risk. Spiders alone did not have significant effects on grasshopper densities in the field experiments, removing any possibility of density-mediated indirect effects.

We conducted a series of laboratory experiments with a freshwater assemblage consisting of two predators that differd in their foraging modes ( a crayfish, Procambarus sp., and the western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis) and their prospective anuran prey (tadpoles of the narrow-mouthed toad, Gastrophyrne carolinensis, and the squirrel treefrog, Hyla squirella). We examined whether competition occurs within and between these two prey species and, if so, whether the non-lethal presence of predators alters the outcome of competitive interactions. We also asked whether the two species of prey differ in their susceptibility to the two types of predators and whether interspecific differences in predator avoidance behavior might account for this variation. Our results indicated that Gastrophyrne was a stringer competitor than Hyla at high densities of surviving conspecifics that metamorphosed. However, the presence of mosquitofish did not alter the outcome of this competition, nor did either type of predator affect the density-dependent responses of Gastrophryne. In laboratory foraging trials, the number of tadpoles of each species that was killed, but not completely consumed by mosquitofish, was similar for Gastrophryne and Hyla. Yet, significantly more individualsof Gastrophryne than of Hyla were killed and completely eaten by mosquitofish at the end of the experiment. The two species of prey did not differ in their spatial avoidance of either type of predator, suggesting that this behavior did not play a significant role in the differential vulnerability of the prey to predation. By reducing the abundance og G. carolinensis, the potential exists for predators, such as mosquitofish to ameliorate this species' competitive impact on other species. In this way, predators may promote coexistence of species withi some assemblages of amphibians.","Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA","Walls, SC (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Natl Wetlands Res Ctr, Biol Resources Div, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA.",,,,,,,53,9,9,1,18,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,EMPORIA,"EMPORIA STATE UNIV, DIVISION BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 1200 COMMERCIAL ST, EMPORIA, KS 66801-5087 USA",0018-0831,,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,MAR,2002,58,1,,,,,104,118,,10.1655/0018-0831(2002)058[0104:IDISTC]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Zoology,Zoology,527EB,WOS:000174172700009,,,,,2021-09-27,

We conducted an outdoor artificial pool experiment to assess the individual and interactive effects of a predator (Anax imperator) and controphic species (primarily Daphnia magna) on larval populations of two common mosquitoes, Culex pipiens and Culiseta longiareolata. Controphic species did not significantly affect survival to pupation of C. pipiens but did increase time to metamorphosis and reduce size at metamorphosis. Culex pipiens and D. magna, both primarily filter feeders, probably compete for food resources. Controphic species caused a small reduction (21.9%) in C. longiareolata survival, an unexpected result given that C. longiareolata larvae are thought to be primarily periphyton grazers while D. magna is a filter feeder. Controphic species did not affect C. longareolata time to, or size at, pupation. Anax imperator reduced C. longiareolata survival to pupation (78%) and size at pupation (11.5%) while increasing development time in males only (11.3%). Anax imperator caused a smaller (32.4%), but statistically significant, reduction in the number of C. pipiens surviving to the pupal stage but did not significantly affect size at or time to pupation. The predator did not reduce controphic species densities, and controphic species did not result in increased predator growth. We predicted that controphic species, by serving as competitors, would result in fewer C. pipiens surviving to pupation in the absence of predators. In the presence of the predator, the negative competitive effect of controphic species would be attenuated by the positive effect of serving as alternative prey. Our results followed this pattern although the predator X controphic species interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.157). Because previous studies showed that D. magna did not affect predation rates by A. imperator on C. longiareolata larvae, and because controphic species did not have a strong competitive effect, we did not predict and did not find a predator X controphic species interactive effect.","Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biol, Ctr Biol Control, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",leon@research.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,76,44,47,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

This study tested whether these changes in gammaridean dominance could have been determined by interspecific competition and unequal mortality, for example by intraguild predation (IGP). Single and two species tests have been carried out in aquariums provided with all substrata present in the main channel of the Rhine. Changes in substratum choice, increased swimming activity and increased mortality of a species were used as indicators of interspecific competition during interaction between gammaridean species. Interspecific competition and mortality between the most abundant invasive gammaridean species in the Rhine, viz. Gammarus tigrinus, Echinogammarus ischnus and Dikerogammarus villosus were tested. In single-species experiments, G. tigrinus and D. villosus showed similar preferences for a stony substratum, whereas E. ischnus mostly occupied the water column. The two-species aquarium experiments indicated direct interference competition for substratum and unequal mortality between G. tigrinus and D. villosus, with D. villosus being the stronger competitor. Competitive stress was influenced by population density, was size-dependent and varied between the different types of substratum due to substratum choice. G. tigrinus did not show any behaviour indicative of interference competition in the presence of E. ischnus, and neither did E. ischnus or D. villosus in the presence of any of the other gammarideans. Swimming in the water layer may already enable E. ischnus to minimise its encounters with the stone-dwelling D. villosus and G. tigrinus. To maximise the encounters between E. ischnus and D. villosus, a fish (Lepomis gibbosus) was added to occupy the water layer during the aquarium experiments. E. ischnus showed a higher mortality in the presence of both D. villosus and fish, probably due to increased stress, as shelter opportunities to escape the predators had been minimised. The study shows that interference competition between gammaridean species can explain the replacement of the North American invader G. tigrinus by D. villosus in the river Rhine. E. ischnus and D. villosus both Ponto-Caspian invaders did not show interference competition in our experiments and co-exist in the Rhine.","[van Riel, M.

However, lacking direct evidence, the majority of studies only infer some form of interspecific interaction, often competition, as reinforcing these gradients. There is usually the further implication that environmental factors mediate asymmetries in the interaction. Recognising the lack of explicit experimental considerations of how key inter-specific interactions are modified by the environment, we chose a study system where we were able to bring the species in question into the laboratory and conduct experiments to test hypotheses about gradient-induced asymmetries in an interspecific interaction. To this end, we tested the hypothesis that a species-salinity gradient may be reinforced by changes in the asymmetry of intraguild predation between two species of amphipod crustaceans with wide salinity tolerances. River and estuary surveys showed that Gammarus duebeni and Gammarus zaddachi have overlapping distributions, with both surviving and reproducing in salinities ranging from freshwater to fully marine. However, the former species is relatively more abundant in low salinities and the latter in higher salinities. In the laboratory, survival of both species was high in all salinities and cannibalism occurred at low frequencies. However, intraguild predation by males on moulted females was asymmetric in favour of G. duebeni at low salinities, this asymmetry completely reversing to favour G. zaddachi at higher salinities. Thus, we provide evidence that this species environment gradient occurs due to overlapping physiological tolerances and salinity-driven shifts in the asymmetry of a key inter-specific interaction, intraguild predation.

Incorporating interspecific interactions in predictive models is common in ecology, yet most methods do not adequately account for indirect interactions (where an interaction between two species is masked by their shared interactions with a third) and assume interactions do not vary along environmental gradients. Markov random fields (MRF) overcome these limitations by estimating interspecific interactions, while controlling for indirect interactions, from multispecies occurrence data. We illustrate the utility of MRFs for ecologists interested in interspecific interactions, and demonstrate how covariates can be included (a set of models known as Conditional Random Fields, CRF) to infer how interactions vary along environmental gradients. We apply CRFs to two data sets of presence-absence data. The first illustrates how blood parasite (Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and nematode microfilaria spp.) co-infection probabilities covary with relative abundance of their avian hosts. The second shows that co-occurrences between mosquito larvae and predatory insects vary along water temperature gradients.

We assessed the temporal and spatiotemporal interactions between Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) and six focal sympatric species in South Florida, where Florida panther abundance has increased by more than 6-fold since the 1990's. Using camera trap data, we quantified species' diel activity patterns, temporal overlap, and time-to-encounter (i.e., time between consecutive visits of a Florida panther and a focal species and vice versa). The Florida panther and bobcat (Lynx rufus) displayed a nocturnal activity pattern; the black bear (Ursus americanus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) were mostly diurnal; and the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was cathemeral. Prey species and black bears minimized encounters with Florida panthers by being active during the day and displaying longer time-to-encounter, whereas Florida panthers visited a site after a prey species at higher probabilities than after competitor species, and were more likely to visit an elevated site or upland habitat. Our results suggest that interactions between Florida panthers and sympatric species in our study system are driven by species-specific behavioral responses. Gaining a better understanding of the crucial interactions driving species coexistence is important for a better understanding of the structure and function of ecological communities and help manage the potential expansion of the Florida panther into Central Florida.","[Prat-Guitart, Marta; Oli, Madan K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, 110 Newins Ziegler Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Onorato, David P.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 298 Sabal Palm Rd, Naples, FL 34114 USA; [Hines, James E.] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA","Prat-Guitart, M (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, 110 Newins Ziegler Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",mprat@wildlandscapes.org,,,"Florida Panther Research and Management Trust Fund; la Caixa FoundationLa Caixa Foundation [100010434, LCF/BQ/AN15/10380035]","We thank the Florida Panther Research and Management Trust Fund, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, National Park Service, and the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the University of Florida, for facilitating this study.

The research presented here uses a survey, foraging observations, and a manipulative field experiment that test the included-niche competition hypothesis as a mechanism structuring the distribution of a generalist grasshopper, Melanoplus femurrubrum, along a food-resource gradient. A field survey of 10 old fields revealed a step-like reduction in M. femurrubrum abundance as the proportion of grass cover in the fields exceeded 60%. Furthermore, M. femurrubrum abundance and the abundance of a potential competitor, the grass specialist Chorthippus curtipennis, were negatively correlated among the fields. Experimental foraging observations showed that M. femurrubrum was a polyphagous feeder that preferred grass and consumed less grass in the presence of C. curtipennis. The pattern of grasshopper distribution and foraging data support an included-niche competition hypothesis. However, in a field experiment that manipulated C. curtipennis presence and absence and the composition of vegetation in which competition might occur, growth and mortality rates in M. femurrubrum did not respond to C. curtipennis competition. Performance was predicted to be lowest in grass-dominated conditions, those corresponding to the locations when M. femurrubrum does not exist. Instead, growth rates were highest and mortality rates were lowest in grass-only treatments. While the survey and foraging observations support the included-niche hypothesis, the experiments suggest that interspecific competition in adult grasshoppers is not the cause of the grasshopper distribution pattern. Similar experiments in western North American prairies indicate that interspecific competition can be important and that foraging ecology can be a good indicator of the interaction. This study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge about interspecific competition's role in organism distributions. It demonstrates that geographic similarity in natural history need not lead to a similar importance of limiting factors.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Beckerman, AP (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Inst Biol Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",a.p.beckerman@stirling.ac.uk,"Beckerman, Andrew P/D-3020-2011","Beckerman, Andrew P./0000-0002-4797-9143",,,,54,25,28,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,948,957,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0948:COOICB]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500007,,,,,2021-09-27,

Naturally established populations of these two species were studied intensively over two consecutive years (2010 and 2011) in an old field in southeastern Virginia, to compare life history features relevant to how they coexist, or whether one or the other of them is likely to be more successful in the same habitat. Populations of both species declined about 50% from 2010 to 2011 (adults from 47 to 21 for T. a. sinensis; 37 to 20 for T. angustipennis), but T. a. sinensis oviposited 10 oothecae and T. angustipennis only one in 2011. Tenodera a. sinensis was more abundant in the study site in both years, hatched earlier, and matured and oviposited earlier than T. angustipennis. Fewer females of both species survived to maturity in 2011 than in 2010, possibly indicating a reduction in prey or habitat suitability in 2011. We suggest that T. angustipennis will always be at a disadvantage as a result of its smaller body size, because of interspecific predation (and potentially competition) from its congener, lower clutch size, and susceptibility to egg parasitism. Further, environmental variability across field habitats and years profoundly affects populations of both species in successional old fields.","[Gall, Cory A.; Rose, Robert K.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Gall, Cory A.] Washington State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Hurd, Lawrence E.] Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA","Hurd, LE (corresponding author), Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",cgall@vetmed.wsu.edu; brose@odu.edu; hurdl@wlu.edu,,,Old Dominion University Department of Biological Sciences; Washington and Lee University; John T.

If two species are distributed across an environmental gradient, and differ in their ability to cope with environmental conditions, the outcome of competitive interactions may be dependent on prevailing abiotic conditions. Two closely related species of poison frogs in north-central Peru were observed to occupy parapatric distributions across an elevation gradient. Ameerega bassleri is a highland endemic restricted to a small region of Peru, and A. trivittata is distributed throughout lowland Amazonia. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of an abiotic factor (elevation) on two biotic factors (intraspecific and interspecific competition), by measuring growth and survival in the larvae of A. trivittata and A. bassleri. Using mesocosm experiments arranged in a fractional factorial design, we found that (1) A. bassleri had a strong negative effect on the growth and survival of A. trivittata regardless of elevation, (2) A. trivittata had no effect on the growth of A. bassleri at either elevation, but did appear to reduce the survival of A. bassleri more strongly in the lowlands than highlands, (3) lowland conditions uniformly reduced survival in all treatments and in both species, and (4) competition was strongly asymmetric between A. bassleri and A. trivittata. We conclude that the perceived low density of A. trivittata in highland sites may be influenced by the presence of A. bassleri, but the lower limit to the distribution of A. bassleri cannot be explained by competition with A. trivittata and may be due to physiological constraints imposed by lowland conditions.","[Twomey, Evan; Summers, Kyle] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Morales, Victor] Univ Ricardo Palma, Fac Ciencias Biol, Lima, Peru","Twomey, E (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",emt0424@mail.ecu.edu,,,,,,66,14,15,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2008,117,8,,,,,1175,1184,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16676.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,335KE,WOS:000258288700006,,,,,2021-09-27,

While PVA is a widely sanctioned tool in conservation biology, the field of population viability is in its infancy with respect to species interactions. In this paper, I review available methods for evaluating extinction risk when species interactions contribute significantly to population viability. This review includes an evaluation of six broad categories of species interactions (predation, disease, competition, mutualism, parasitism and host-parasitoid interactions) in population viability analysis, with a particular focus on predation as a case study. I first evaluated how often species interactions are considered when PVA is applied to population data from imperiled species. I identified 378 articles in commonly cited conservation journals, of which 24 attempted a viability analysis for populations threatened by interactions with other species. Most of these PVA's treat a putative species interaction as a constant source of mortality rather than a coupled, dynamic population process. Second, I reviewed the literature to identify the availability of time-series of abundance data for two interacting species in which at least one species was threatened or endangered. Adequate time-series data were available for both species comprising an interacting pair in only 9 out of 407 papers reviewed. Third, I used a stochastic, fully stage-structured predator prey model to create time-series data (vital rates and projection matrices) in order to quantify the efficacy of two matrix-based, single-species PVA approaches. Simple single-species PVAs confound stochastic variation with population cycles induced by species interactions (in this case predation). As a result these models provide conservatively biased forecasts of viability. Unfortunately, the data needed to construct more complex PVA's with feedback and multi-species stochasticity are rarely collected. I close with a discussion of key advances needed to escape the population vacuum in a move toward more realistic estimates of extinction risk.

Orconectes rusticus, an invading crayfish species, is replacing O. propinquus and O. virilis in northern Wisconsin lakes. We test the hypothesis that periodicity of species interactions influences invasion success. Specifically, we test whether the intensity of interspecific competition varies on a diel cycle as a function of predation risk from visually feeding fishes. We tested for competitive exclusion in experimental pools (1.4 m in diameter) by determining habitat use of the three crayfishes in single- and three-species treatments. The pools contained equal area habitats of cobble, open sand, macrophytes in organic sediments (muck), and macrophytes in sand. In single-species treatments, all three species preferred cobble habitat during the day with a secondary preference for muck-macrophyte habitat. In three-species relative to single-species pools, O. rusticus increased daytime use of cobble habitat while O. virilis and O. propinquus reduced use of cobble and increased use of muck-macrophyte and sand-macrophyte habitats, respectively. Crayfish were evenly distributed among habitats at night. All three crayfishes altered habitat use between night and day, consistent with the need to forage at night and seek refuge from predation during the day. Results of a laboratory experiment giving crayfish the choice of feeding in the open or hiding in clean cobble in the presence and absence of a predator showed that crayfish chose habitat on the basis of food availability when predation risk was low and on the basis of shelter availability when risk was high. Data from experiments were consistent with habitat use observed in single-and mixed-species lakes, supporting our hypothesis that the interaction of competition with diel fluctuations in predation risk contributes to the ongoing O. rusticus invasion.","UNIV NOTRE DAME,DEPT BIOL SCI,NOTRE DAME,IN 46556",,,"Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021",,,,,44,120,123,1,29,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1994,75,7,,,,,2118,2126,,10.2307/1941615,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PK129,WOS:A1994PK12900025,,,,,2021-09-27,

The model consists of community matrices with density-dependent species interactions and a limit on the total population of each species. A general natural pattern forms the basis of the model: organisms which are most similar compete, those which are less similar may enter into a predator-prey relationship, and those which are most different may be mutualistic. In this model, contrary to some previously published studies, increasing the number of species increased stability of community matrices. The rate of change in phenotype was varied to assess the response of community characteristics. At the highest rate of random phenotypic change there were the most species; the minimum number of species was found at intermediate rates of change. The models were run in the absence of predation, competition, or mutualism. The absence of mutualism led to more extinction. The absence of competition caused communities to quickly reach a population ceiling.

The effects of crayfish presence, crayfish size and water depth on the consumption of G. holbrooki by P. clarkii were analyzed, as were the effects of mosquitofish presence and water depth on the consumption of recently hatched crayfish (RHC) by mosquitofish. To better understand this subject we conducted aquaria and open air mesocosm experiments simulating a rice field section. Aquarium experiments showed that P. clarkii consumes G. holbrooki and that G. holbrooki consumes RHC. Adult crayfish size did not significantly affect the consumption of mosquitofish and water depth had no effect on the consumption of G. holbrooki by P. clarkii and vice versa. In the outdoor mesocosm experiments P. clarkii caused no statistically significant effect on G. holbrooki numbers or biomass when compared with controls without crayfish. In spite of this, the analysis of crayfish stomach contents clearly demonstrated that several G. holbrooki individuals were consumed, indicating that crayfish can profit from the presence of G. holbrooki. Results from our study suggest that in shallow pools there are strong interactions between the two invasive species since adult crayfish predate mosquitofish and mosquitofish predate recently hatched crayfish. Therefore, there are bidirectional trophic interactions between these invasive species which change depending on their relative size. We believe that these interactions should become more relevant in confined areas such as small shallow pools formed during the late summer and autumn. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

To describe and understand an ecosystem as a tangled bank, multiple ways of interaction and their effects have to be considered, such as predation, competition, mutualism and facilitation. Understanding the resulting interaction networks is a challenge in changing environments, e.g. to predict knock-on effects of invasive species and to understand how climate change impacts biodiversity. The elucidation of complex ecological systems with their interactions will benefit enormously from the development of new machine learning tools that aim to infer the structure of interaction networks from field data. In the present study, we propose a novel Bayesian regression and multiple changepoint model (BRAM) for reconstructing species interaction networks from observed species distributions. The model has been devised to allow robust inference in the presence of spatial autocorrelation and distributional heterogeneity. We have evaluated the model on simulated data that combines a trophic niche model with a stochastic population model on a 2-dimensional lattice, and we have compared the performance of our model with L1-penalized sparse regression (LASSO) and non-linear Bayesian networks with the BDe scoring scheme.

Previous experimental studies in central Chile demonstrated that interference competition for refuges is the primary factor driving habitat segregation between the predatory crabs Acanthocyclus gayi and A. hassled, with the latter species monopolizing galleries inside mussel beds in the mid intertidal zone and limiting A. gayi to rock crevices. Yet, habitat partitioning between rival species can result from differences in habitat preferences and not solely from interference interactions. Moreover, since A. gayi is also known to shelter in turf-forming algae (predominantly Gelidium), which dominates extensive areas in the low intertidal zone, among-sites variation in the turf morphology and abundance could modify habitat preferences and the pattern of inter-specific interactions. We experimentally evaluated refuge habitat preferences of individual, similarly-sized adult A. gayi and A. hassleri in the laboratory, comparing choice patterns across multiple trials with paired combinations of the main refuge types commonly used by crabs in the field: a) mussel galleries, b) rock crevices, c) short algal turf, and d) tall algal turf Our results showed that both species display a strong ranking of preferences for some refuge habitats over others. In general, mussel galleries were the preferred refuge type for both crab species, but their preference rankings changed depending on turf morphology. When turf was short, A. hassleri and A. gayi made identical refuge choices, strongly preferring mussel galleries over crevices and these over the short turf. In contrast, when the turf was tall A. gayi selected equally the tall turf or mussel galleries, and these were strongly preferred over crevices. A. hassleri, on the other hand, largely ignored tall turf and kept the highest preference for mussel galleries. A field experiment in which crabs were offered to foraging birds demonstrated that A. hassleri is more susceptible than A. gayi to predation by kelp gulls when outside refuges. Differences in patterns of coloration between crabs may underlie between-species differences in predation susceptibility and their habitat choices. These results suggest that the among-site differences in turf morphology (height and shape of fronds), which is largely driven by varying intensity of upwelling, could affect crab preferences for refuge habitats and the relative importance of inter-specific interference competition.

However, blanket protection of species within a reserve may shelter nonindigenous species that are normally affected by harvesting, intensifying their impacts on native species. I studied a system of marine reserves in the San-Juan Islands, Washington, USA, to examine the extent to which marine reserves are invaded by nonindigenous species and the consequences of these invasions on native species. I surveyed three reserves and eight non-reserves to quantify the abundance of intertidal suspension-feeding clam species, three of which are regionally widespread nonindigenous species (Nuttallia obscurata, Mya arenaria, and Venerupis philippinarum). Neither total nonindigenous nor native species' abundance was significantly greater on reserves. However, the most heavily harvested species, V. philippinarum, was significantly more abundant on reserves, with the three reserves ranking highest in Venerupis biomass of all 11 sites. In contrast, a similar, harvested native species (Protothaca staminea) did not differ between reserves and non-reserves. I followed these surveys with a year-long field experiment replicated at six sites (the three reserves and three of the surveyed non-reserve sites). The experiment examined the effects of high Venerupis densities on mortality, growth, and fecundity of the confamilial Protothaca, and whether differences in predator abundance mitigate density-dependent effects. Even at densities 50% higher than measured in the field survey, Venerupis had no direct effect on itself or Protothaca; only site, predator exposure, and their interaction had significant effects. Analyses incorporating environmental variables tracked at each site indicated that crab biomass most heavily influenced clam responses, causing lower growth of both species and higher mortality of Venerupis, whose annualized loss rate was 50% when exposed to predators. A laboratory prey choice experiment indicated that Cancer productus, an influential intertidal crab predator, favored small adult Venerupis at least 1.7 times over Protothaca. Venerupis' high susceptibility to excavating crab and human predators, as well as its faster growth compared to Protothaca can be explained by its shallower burial depth. By growing quickly and residing near the surface, Venerupis apparently absorbs the brunt of harvest pressure while Protothaca maintains high biomass even outside of reserves.","Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Zool, 46 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jebyers@unh.edu,,"Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,60,47,51,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2005,86,2,,,,,487,500,,10.1890/03-0580,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,906IM,WOS:000227634400024,,,,,2021-09-27,

Ecologists frequently use regression to test fur a nonlinear saturating relationship between local community richness and regional species pool richness, suggesting that species interactions limit the number of locally coexisting species. However, communities in different regions are not independent if regions share species. We present a Monte Carlo test for whether an observed local-regional richness relationship is significantly different from that expected when regions are nonindependent and species interactions do not limit community membership. We illustrate this test with data from experimental microcosm communities. A conventional F-test suggests a significant saturating relationship between realized community richness and species pool richness. However, the Monte Carlo test fails to reject the null hypothesis that species interactions do not affect community richness. Strong species interactions do not necessarily set an absolute upper limit to the number of locally coexisting species.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Fox, JW (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",,"Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633",,,,48,31,31,0,31,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

The question of what mechanisms drive the displacement of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni by the often introduced G pulex is presented as a case study Patterns of displacement are well documented throughout Europe, but the speed and direction of displacement between these species can be varied. From early studies proposing interspecific competition as causal in these patterns, I review research progress to date. I show there has been no evidence for interspecific competition operating, other than the field patterns themselves, a somewhat tautological argument. Rather, the increased recognition of behavioural attributes with respect to the cannibalistic and predatory nature of these species gave rise to a series of studies unravelling the processes driving field patterns. Both species engage in 'intraguild predation' (IGP), with moulting females particularly vulnerable to predation by congeneric males. G pulex is more able both to engage in and avoid this interaction with G duebeni. However, several factors mediate the strength and asymmetry of this IGP, some biotic (e.g. parasitism) and others abiotic (e.g. water chemistry). Further, a number of alternative hypotheses that may account for the displacement (hybridization; parasite transmission) have been tested and rejected. While interspecific competition has been modelled mathematically and found to be a weak interaction relative to IGP, mechanisms of competition between these Gammarus species remain largely untested empirically. Since IGP may be finely balanced in some circumstances, I conclude that the challenge to detect interspecific competition remains and we require assessment of its role, if any, in the interaction between these species. Appreciation of behavioural attributes and their mediation should allow us to more fully understand, and perhaps predict, species introductions and resultant distributions.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Med Biol, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland","Dick, JTA (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Med Biol, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",j.dick@qub.ac.uk,,,,,,67,45,46,1,33,UNIV AMSTERDAM,AMSTERDAM,"LIBRARY FACULTY BIOLOGY, PLANTAGE MIDDENLAAN 45, AMSTERDAM, 1018 DC, NETHERLANDS",1383-4517,,,CONTRIB ZOOL,Contrib.

We performed a field experiment to determine whether effects of current abiotic conditions and interspecific competition with O. hylas were responsible for displacement of O. peruncus from parts of their former range. We examined growth and survival of juvenile male O. peruncus exposed to juvenile male O. hylas in enclosures at two sites in the former range of O. peruncus. Enclosures contained 8 (low density) or 16 individuals (high density) and had O. peruncus only (control) or both species (interspecific treatment). Juvenile O. peruncus were able to survive and grow in portions of their former range, implicating biotic versus abiotic factors in the displacement of O. peruncus. Survival rates of O. peruncus did not differ among treatments at either site. Orconectes peruncus showed significant growth in all treatments and interspecific effects were not greater than intraspecific effects on O. peruncus growth rates. High-density treatments showed significantly reduced O. peruncus growth rates compared to low-density treatments, except in Carver Creek interspecific treatments. When considered in the context of previous studies examining the effects of O. hylas on O. peruncus, results suggest that neither direct competition between juvenile males of the two species or abiotic change are responsible for the decreased range of O. peruncus.

Studies on the robustness of ecological communities suggest that the loss or reduction in abundance of individual species can lead to secondary and cascading extinctions. However, most such studies have been simulation-based analyses of the effect of primary extinction on food web structure. 2. In a field experiment we tested the direct and indirect effects of reducing the abundance of a common species, focusing on the diverse and self-contained assemblage of arthropods associated with an abundant Brazilian shrub, Baccharis dracunculifolia D.C. (Asteraceae). 3. Over a 5-month period we experimentally reduced the abundance of Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae (Sternorrhyncha: Psyllidae), the commonest galling species associated with B. dracunculifolia, in 15 replicate plots paired with 15 control plots. We investigated direct effects of the manipulation on parasitoids attacking B. dracunculifoliae, as well as indirect effects (mediated via a third species or through the environment) on 10 other galler species and 50 associated parasitoid species. 4. The experimental manipulation significantly increased parasitism on B. dracunculifoliae in the treatment plots, but did not significantly alter either the species richness or abundance of other galler species. Compared to control plots, food webs in manipulated plots had significantly lower values of weighted connectance, interaction evenness and robustness (measured as simulated tolerance to secondary extinction), even when B. dracunculifoliae was excluded from calculations. 5. Parasitoid species were almost entirely specialized to individual galler species, so the observed effects of the manipulation on food web structure could not have propagated via the documented trophic links. Instead, they must have spread either through trophic links not included in the webs (e.g. shared predators) or non-trophically (e.g. through changes in habitat availability). Our results highlight that the inclusion of both trophic and non-trophic direct and indirect interactions is essential to understand the structure and dynamics of even apparently discrete ecological communities.","[Barbosa, Milton; Lewis, Owen T.; Morris, Rebecca J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Fernandes, G.

The effects of predation on species diversity have traditionally been tested in experiments and theoretical models of simple trophic systems. In complex natural ecosystems, however, disentangling multiple sources of variation is difficult. In groundwater-fed environments, a significant effect of predation can be expected due to the relatively stable environmental conditions; however, it has never been properly examined. We analysed species diversity and total abundance of macroinvertebrate assemblages in 48 Western Carpathian spring fens, separately for whole sites and mesohabitat/season, and partitioned the effects of predation intensity from those of environmental variables in robust models using a bootstrapping technique. We verified our results by accounting for taxa resistant to predation. The assumption that predation-mediated coexistence of species is the main mechanism responsible for the relatively species-rich assemblages in the Western Carpathian spring fens was not supported. However, predation may significantly influence abundance of non-predatory species and, under some conditions, it may contribute to explaining patterns in species diversity. The effect of predation did not differ between the mesohabitats with different stability. However, we found higher environmental control in spring and a stronger effect of predators in autumn, which suggests that different mechanisms influence fen assemblages in different seasons.

This study examined the size-dependency of interference competition between the sea stars Pisaster ochraceus and Evasterias troschelii using field surveys and behavioral experiments to better understand the indirect demographic effects of sea star wasting disease (SSWD) on competitive interactions. In Puget Sound, Washington, where these species utilize similar prey resources and intertidal habitat, SSWD has reduced population densities and body sizes similarly for both species. Interference behaviors were not apparent among stars <4 cm arm length, but among larger individuals, Pisaster was dominant. In the field, small stars were found in aggregations of conspecifics and heterospecifics more often than were large stars. In behavioral trials, small stars responded neutrally towards conspecifics and hetero specifics, but large Evasterias responded submissively towards large Pisaster. Additional observations suggested that aggressive use of pedicellariae by Pisaster was the mechanism for these avoidance behaviors. Although demonstration of limiting resources is required to conclude that competition occurs in the field, our results suggest that SSWD has decreased the intensity of potential competitive interactions between Pisaster and Evasterias by reducing not only population density, but also body size. Prior to SSWD and if/when Pisaster recovers, interference competition may allow Pisaster to dominate in preferred habitats. However, if Pisaster recovers more slowly than Evasterias, Evasterias may move into areas formerly dominated by Pisaster, and potentially fill Pisaster's ecological role.","[Rogers, Tanya L.; Schultz, Haila K.; Elliott, Joel K.] Univ Puget Sound, Dept Biol, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA; [Rogers, Tanya L.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA","Rogers, TL (corresponding author), Univ Puget Sound, Dept Biol, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA.; Rogers, TL (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.",rogers.ta@husky.neu.edu,,,McCormick Undergraduate Summer Research Grant from UPS; Mellam Family Foundation Undergraduate Summer Research Grant from UPS; UPS,"This research was conducted at the University of Puget Sound (UPS) and at Friday Harbor Laboratories (University of Washington), which we thank for use of their facilities.

Various studies suggest that several species of native ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) have declined in abundance in particular habitats (especially crops) and/or geographic regions following the colonization of North America by the seven-spotted ladybird beetle (Coccinella septempunctata L.). However, the factors responsible for such declines are unclear. Long-term sampling of alfalfa fields in northern Utah revealed that as C. septempunctata established itself and increased in numbers, densities of native species decreased significantly over the period 1992-2001. The decline in numbers of native ladybirds mirrored a decline in numbers of their principal prey in alfalfa, pea aphids. Field experiments with induced aphid outbreaks were conducted to test the hypothesis that dispersing native adults have shifted their foraging efforts away from alfalfa as the introduced species has increased in numbers and depressed prey availability. As predicted by the hypothesis, native ladybirds rapidly reaccumulated in alfalfa when prey became abundant. Their presence was brief, however, as they and especially the more numerous C. septempunctata quickly suppressed experimental aphid outbreaks. The ratio of densities within experimental plots with high aphid numbers to densities in the surrounding field was greater for native ladybirds than for C. septempunctata. Also, densities of native ladybirds varied more closely with aphid densities among fields in late May 2001 than did densities of C. septempunctata. Hence, native ladybirds appear especially responsive to local aphid density. C. septempunctata's impact on aphid density in alfalfa appears to have reduced significantly the degree to which the habitat retains foraging native adults. Thus, introduced species may influence the distribution and abundance of native competitors not only by reducing survivorship in local habitats, but also by altering the dynamics of dispersal and habitat use across the landscape.","Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Evans, EW (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ewevans@biology.usu.edu,,,,,,44,141,148,1,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2004,85,3,,,,,637,647,,10.1890/03-0230,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,805VD,WOS:000220392900007,,,,,2021-09-27,

These indirect effects can ramify through a community and affect many species, including some that may not have been directly affected by the perturbation. Identifying these chains of indirect effects is difficult, and most studies only follow indirect effects across two or three species. Here, we use a factorial field experiment to demonstrate that precipitation affects spotted aphids through a complex chain of indirect interactions that are mediated by other herbivores and a generalist predator. We experimentally simulated drought, which reduced water content in alfalfa plants. While water stress in alfalfa had no direct effect on spotted aphids, it lowered the population growth rate of pea aphids, another common alfalfa pest. Because ladybeetle predators were attracted to high pea aphid densities, predator densities were lower in drought treatments. Consequently, spotted aphid densities were released from top-down control (apparent competition) in drought treatments and reached densities three times higher than spotted aphids in ambient treatments with high pea aphid densities. Thus, drought affected spotted aphids in the interaction chain: drought alfalfa pea aphids predators spotted aphids. This result illustrates the lengthy path that indirect effects of climate change may take through a community, as well as the importance of community-level experiments in determining the net effect of climate change.","[Barton, Brandon T.; Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Barton, BT (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 430 Lincoln Dr,Birge Hall,Room 460, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",btbarton@wisc.edu,,,US-NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1240804]; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2007-35302-18266],"We thank N.

Indirect effects will occur if an associate species changes the abundance of intermediate species in a chain of interactions that ultimately affect the growth of some focal species. A model of species interactions in a community is presented here and used to quantify direct and indirect effects in a five-species weedy plant community. This method quantifies indirect effects by measuring changes in the abundance of the intermediate species and then estimating how such changes will affect the focal species. The experiments demonstrated that the direct effects in this community were generally negative (competitive) and could be quite large. Indirect effects were positive (facilitative) and negatively correlated with the direct effects, which thus acted to mitigate the usually larger competitive effects. The magnitudes of most species interactions in this community were primarily determined by large direct effects of Ambrosia artemisiifolia and, to a lesser extent, Agropyron repens.

We hypothesized that the contracted border at sites that experienced low tidal currents was due to flow-medisted recruitment that resulted in reduced survival due to the absence of neighbor buffering of thermal stress (i.e., positive intraspecific interactions). We tested this hypothesis by manipulating the density of recently settled barnacles and their thermal environment in a field experiment. Counter to our original hypothesis, barnacles with neighbors suffered severe mortality at low-flow sites. When density-dependent predation by the green crab (Carcinus maenus) was experimentally eliminated, however, we did detect evidence for positive interactions at the low-flow sites but not at the high-how sites. In spite of the close proximity of the sites, maximum daily rock temperatures at the low-flow sites were slightly, but consistently, greater than those at high-flow sites. Our findings suggest that the upper intertidal border of S. balanoides in the Damariscotta River is limited at low-flow sites by a combination of reduced recruitment, elevated mortality from thermal stress and enhanced predation by green crabs. More generally, oar findings highlight how physical stress and predation interact to alter the nature of density-dependent species interactions in natural assemblages.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","Leonard, GH (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,58,35,36,2,33,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,1999,118,4,,,,,492,502,,10.1007/s004420050752,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,183LU,WOS:000079555700012,28307417,,,,2021-09-27,

We took an experimental approach to investigate whether absence of A. carolinensis and A. sagrei from these islands results from the inability of populations to become established and whether the presence of the other species has a negative effect on population density and probability of successful colonization. We introduced propagules of five lizards of each species, either in allopatry or sympatry, on five blocks of three islands each. Populations were censused yearly using mark-recapture methods. Anolis sagrei populations thrived on almost all islands, whereas within three years, many A. carolinensis populations had gone extinct, and most others were very small. We conclude that an inability to successfully establish populations on small islands might explain the absence of A. carolinensis from these islands, but not the absence of A. sagrei. Anolis carolinensis was not more likely to become extinct on islands containing A. sagrei, but population densities of A. carolinensis were lower on islands with both species (sympatric islands) compared to allopatric islands. In addition, A. carolinensis tended to perch higher, relative to available vegetation, on sympatric islands than they did on allopatric islands. conversely, the presence of A. carolinensis had little impact on A. sagrei populations. However, inspection of population changes through time suggest that A. carolinensis may have initially had an effect on A. sagrei, but this effect decreased as A. carolinensis populations declined. The observed absence of A. sagrei from these islands may indicate that its dispersal abilities are limited relative to the frequency of devastating hurricanes.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Losos, JB (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",Losos@biodec.wustl.edu,,,,,,27,43,50,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1999,80,1,,,,,252,258,,10.2307/176994,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,157DV,WOS:000078045600019,,,,,2021-09-27,

Such species are expected to display community drift dynamics analogous to neutral alleles undergoing genetic drift. While entire communities of species are not ecologically equivalent, recent field experiments have documented the existence of guilds of such neutral species embedded in real food webs. What demographic outcomes of the interactions within and between species in these guilds are expected to produce ecological drift versus coexistence remains unclear. To address this issue, and guide empirical testing, we consider models of a guild of ecologically equivalent competitors feeding on a single resource to explore when community drift should manifest. We show that community drift dynamics only emerge when the density-dependent effects of each species on itself are identical to its density-dependent effects on every other guild member. In contrast, if each guild member directly limits itself more than it limits the abundance of other guild members, all species in the guild are coexisting, even though they all are ecologically equivalent with respect to their interactions with species outside the guild (i.e. resources, predators, mutualists). Hence, considering only interspecific ecological differences generating density dependence, and not fully accounting for the preponderance of mechanisms causing intraspecific density dependence, will provide an incomplete picture for segregating between neutrality and coexistence. We also identify critical experiments necessary to disentangle guilds of ecologically equivalent species from those experiencing ecological drift, as well as provide an overview of ways of incorporating a mechanistic basis into studies of species coexistence and neutrality. Identifying these characteristics, and the mechanistic basis underlying community structure, is not merely an exercise in clarifying the semantics of coexistence and neutral theories, but rather reflects key differences that must exist among community members in order to determine how and why communities are structured.","[McPeek, Mark A.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",mark.mcpeek@dartmouth.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021","McPeek, Mark/0000-0001-7794-9466",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1748945],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1748945",,71,8,8,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Eighteen months of surveys of 31 primary forest lentic sites examined phenological patterns of tadpole and predator species. I tested for a relation between predator and metamorph presence using the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square. I tested for differences in survival and development for each tadpole species as a function of predator identity. I examined correlations between growth of surviving tadpoles and both the number of conspecific and the total number of surviving tadpoles. Two-way ANOVAs tested for differences in predation rate among predators and experiments. Finally, I tested for differences in selectivity for each prey species. Odonate naiads were the most common predator in upland isolated pools and peccary wallows, while fish were most common in lowland, stream-associated habitats. No relation was found between the presence of metamorphs and of predators in natural sites, except for metamorph presence (a positive relation for all tadpole species pooled) and presence of aeshnid larvae in natural sites. Predators reduced tadpole survival in three of four different prey-species combinations. Aeshnid naiads were the most effective predators, followed by libellulid naiads. Fish were never the most effective predators and their effect was variable. Predation rate on each of the three prey species varied among predators and sometimes depended upon which species were present, indicating that predation rate in the system was a function of the particular combination of prey species. No significant differences were found in selectivity for any prey species among individual predator types. All predators, however, preferred P. tomopterna, the less abundant species, over O. taurinus whenever the two species were together. Growth of tadpoles was inversely related to the number of surviving conspecific tadpoles. Predators, therefore, have the potential to modify the composition of tadpole species assemblages through differential predation.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA",,,,,,,,45,42,43,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1992,73,3,,,,,971,980,,10.2307/1940173,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU767,WOS:A1992HU76700023,,,,,2021-09-27,

In this study, the antipredator behaviours of juvenile roach (Rutilus rutilus) and juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis) were studied in wading pools with three kinds of structural complexity: no structure, structure simulating vegetation and structure simulating bottom crevices. Predation experiments with piscivorous perch and habitat choice experiments with the prey were performed, and the foraging success and prey choice of the predators were related to the type of structure. Predator foraging success was lower in the vegetation than in the other treatments. In the absence of structure and with vegetation structure, predators preferred perch over roach, while the preference was reversed in the crevice treatment. Roach and perch differed in their antipredatory behaviours. Roach responded to the presence of predators by schooling, moving fast and remaining at the surface, and escaped from attacks by jumping out of the water. In contrast, perch moved more slowly, dispersed after attacks and tried to hide at the bottom. Perch always preferred the vegetation structure to the non-structured part of the pool, while roach showed preference for the vegetation structure only when predators were present. Roach never occurred in crevices, whereas perch used crevices when predators where present. Predator pursuit speed was lower in the vegetation structure than in the non-structured treatment, but prey escape speed was unaffected. The results suggest that both the quantity and quality of structural complexity interacting with species-specific antipredator behaviours are important for predator-prey dynamics. It is also suggested that the presence of structure can have substantial effects on the structure of North Eurasian fish communities, by affecting relative and absolute predation pressures from piscivorous perch on prey species.",,"CHRISTENSEN, B (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV,DEPT ANIM ECOL,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN.",,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,,,,63,123,124,0,31,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Most explanations have focused on increased extinction, but, instead, we test experimentally whether increased soil fertility reduces recruitment. Specifically, we test whether variation in recruitment is due to source limitation, germination limitation or establishment limitation, and how litter accumulation and seed predation contribute to these processes. 2 We established four crossed experimental treatments in a perennial-dominated early successional plant community over 3 years. We added seed of 30 species, manipulated access by selected seed predators, removed litter and added slow release fertilizer at four levels (0, 8, 16 and 32 g N m(-2)). 3 Species recruitment and richness both decreased with increasing fertility, but, counter to our expectations, we found that neither seed additions nor litter removal could counteract the negative effects of fertilizer. 4 Seed additions increased seedling density at all fertilizer levels, and seed predation appeared to have no influence on seedling densities. In spite of high seedling densities at all fertilizer levels, final stem density declined by 70% as fertilizer increased. A strong stem density-species richness relationship suggests that declines in final stem density caused more than half of the decline in species richness along this fertility gradient. 5 These results suggest that establishment limitation, i.e. the reduction of growth and survival from seedling to adult, controls species recruitment in highly fertile sites. 6 The high degree of recruitment limitation commonly observed in productive habitats suggests that high productivity causes establishment limitation, thereby isolating these communities from the regional species pool.

The present study was conducted to examine factors explaining the displacement of N. womersleyi by N. californicus. First, we confirmed under laboratory conditions that N. californicus could exclude N. womersleyi if they initially coexisted in a 1:1 ratio. During a 2-h continuous observation period, none of the heterospecific pairs had copulated and after 5 days together with heterospecific males, none of the females had laid eggs. When these females were placed with conspecific males, normal numbers of offspring were produced. Moreover, conspecific matings were not substantially disturbed in the presence of heterospecific males or females. Total fecundity was significantly lower in N. womersleyi than in N. californicus, but their r (m) values did not differ from each other. On the other hand, the frequency of intraguild predation by N. californicus on N. womersleyi was significantly higher than vice versa. From these results, we concluded that not reproductive interference nor differential female fecundity but asymmetrical intraguild predation seemed to explain the competitive exclusion of N. womersleyi by N. californicus.","[Gotoh, Tetsuo; Hanawa, Masumi; Shimazaki, Sayaka; Yokoyama, Natsuki; Fu, Chun-Qing; Sugawara, Reo] Ibaraki Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Appl Entomol & Zool, Ami, Ibaraki 3000393, Japan; [Yano, Shuichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Gotoh, T (corresponding author), Ibaraki Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Appl Entomol & Zool, Ami, Ibaraki 3000393, Japan.",gotoh@mx.ibaraki.ac.jp; yano@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,34,9,10,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

We tested the hypothesis that site-specific heterogeneity in the physico-chemical environment alters the dominance of two competing amphipods: Gammarus fasciatus, the dominant native species in the upper St. Lawrence River, and Echinogammarus ischnus, a euryhaline Ponto-Caspian species that invaded the river in the late 1990s. E. ischnus has replaced G. fasciatus as the dominant amphipod at some sites, while remaining inferior at other sites-even several years after invasion. We tested the effect of water chemistry (conductivity) on the outcome of interactions between these two species in the laboratory and in the river in 2006 and 2007. Field experiments involved transplanting both species to different sites along a gradient of conductivity within the river, whereas the laboratory experiments examined interspecific predation in water collected from these sites. The laboratory experiments revealed that these species are mutual predators and their rate of predation on each other varies with conductivity; E. ischnus is the dominant predator at higher conductivity, while G. fasciatus dominates at lower conductivity. The field experiments showed interannual variation, but supported the lab results at high conductivity in 2006 and at low conductivity in 2007. E. ischnus was more sensitive than G. fasciatus to variation in conductivity, which apparently mediates this invader's ability to replace or dominate the native species in a heterogeneous environment.","[Kestrup, Asa M.; Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Ricciardi, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",asa.kestrup@mcgill.ca; tony.ricciardi@mcgill.ca,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",,,,43,40,40,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

In these areas populations of the native mud snail, Cerithidea californica, have declined precipitously. Since both species feed on epipelic diatoms, I hypothesized that the decline in Cerithidea was a result of exploitative competition with Batillaria. To test this hypothesis I manipulated snail densities in Bolinas Lagoon, California, to estimate their effects on, and responses to, food resources. For two size classes of each snail species I quantified (1) the effect of intraspecific density on food availability, and (2) the growth response of each size class to different food levels. These relationships were used to generate predictions of the exploitative competitive effect of each snail on the other species. These predictions were tested against direct measurements of the effect of interspecific competition on snail tissue growth using field experiments. The observed values of snail growth matched well the predicted relationships, suggesting that exploitative competition does occur. Although the two snails did not differ in their effect on resource levels at any experimental snail density, the introduced snail was always more efficient at converting limited resources to tissue growth. Similar results were obtained in three different experimental periods. Batillaria's enhanced resource conversion efficiency provides a sufficient explanation for its successful invasion and subsequent exclusion of Cerithidea. Theoretically, conversion efficiency of resources should be just as important as resource suppression and uptake to exploitative competitive ability, but it is rarely examined experimentally. By separating exploitative competition into its component parts, the protocol used here allowed identification of a seldom implicated mechanism that can affect invasion success.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Friday Harbor Marine Lab, 620 Univ Rd, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,104,220,227,1,92,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2000,81,5,,,,,1225,1239,,10.2307/177203,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,309XQ,WOS:000086795100004,,,,,2021-09-27,

We report here the first experimental field test that predation is both stronger and has a disproportionate effect on species richness in the tropics relative to the temperate zone. We conducted predator-exclusion experiments on communities of sessile marine invertebrates in four regions, which span 32 degrees latitude, in the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Over a three-month timescale, predation had no effect on species richness in the temperate zone. In the tropics, however, communities were from two to over ten times more species-rich in the absence of predators than when predators were present. While micro-and macro-predators likely compete for the limited prey resource in the tropics, micropredators alone were able to exert as much pressure on the invertebrate communities as the full predator community. This result highlights the extent to which exposure to even a subset of the predator guild can significantly impact species richness in the tropics. Patterns were consistent in analyses that included relative and total species abundances. Higher species richness in the absence of predators in the tropics was also observed when species occurrences were pooled across two larger spatial scales, site and region, demonstrating a consistent scaling relationship. These experimental results show that predation can both limit local species abundances and shape patterns of regional coexistence in the tropics. When preestablished diverse tropical communities were then exposed to predation for different durations, ranging from one to several days, species richness was always reduced. These findings confirmed that impacts of predation in the tropics are strong and consistent, even in more established communities. Our results offer empirical support for the long-held prediction that predation pressure is stronger at lower latitudes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the magnitude to which variation in predation pressure can contribute to the maintenance of tropical species diversity.","[Freestone, Amy L.] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Freestone, Amy L.; Osman, Richard W.; Ruiz, Gregory M.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Torchin, Mark E.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama","Freestone, AL (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",amy.freestone@temple.edu,,"Ruiz, Gregory/0000-0003-2499-441X",Smithsonian's Marine Science Network,"We are grateful to G.

When different species produce acoustic signals simultaneously, the signals create a noisy environment, with potential acoustic interference between species. Theoretical studies suggest that such reproductive interference may have strong effects on species interaction. For example, the inferior resource competitor can survive if its disadvantage is counterbalanced by superiority in reproductive interference. Two field cricket species, Teleogryllus occipitalis (Audinet-Serville) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) and Loxoblemmus equestris Saussure (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), cooccur in the same habitat. A previous study has shown that L. equestris is an inferior species to T. occipitalis in terms of resource competition. Therefore, we predicted that mate location and choice behavior of female T. occipitalis would be negatively affected by the acoustic signals of L. equestris and tested this with a series of playback experiments.The mate choice behavior of female T. occipitalis was not significantly affected by the calling song of L. equestris.

Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Using a new factorial metaanalysis technique, we combined the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments to ask whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects and to compare the average effects of competition and predation. Across all studies, the effects of competition in the presence of predators were less than in the absence of predators, and the interaction between competition and predation for most response variables was statistically significant. Removal of competitors had much more positive effects on organisms' growth and mass than did exclusion of predators. Predator exclusion had much more beneficial effects on organisms' survival than did competition. The mean effects of competition and predation on density did not differ from one another. The results differed among trophic levels. Further understanding would benefit greatly from more field experiments that manipulate both competition and predation, that focus on a wider range of organisms and environments, that focus on population-level parameters such as density, and that report results more completely, including data such as sample sizes and variances.","SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Coll New Jersey, Dept Biol, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Gurevitch, J (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",,"Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008","Hedges, Larry/0000-0002-7531-0631",,,,76,296,309,5,193,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

Furthermore, species displacement by introduced or invaded species is also an important environmental problem for biological control and conservation ecology. We tested whether two species of phytoseiids could coexist in closed cages with ample quantities of the extraguild prey species Carpoglyphus lactis (L.). Three species of phytoseiid mites-Amblyseius eharai Amitai & Swirski (a species native to China), Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) and Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans) (both species were introduced from outside of China)-were tested under experimental conditions (25 +/- 1 degrees C, 90 +/- 5% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 14:10 [L:D] h). With extraguild prey, we found that the numbers of a single population of each phytoseiid species (initial density of 10 females per cage) reached a plateau between 18 and 25 d after introduction into the experimental cages, suggesting that density-dependent factors were operating. In closed environments, one of these density-dependent factors might be cannibalism by these species. With regression analyses, Lotka-Volterra equations estimated the rate of population increase (r) and the carrying capacity (K) of each species with the data from observations on population dynamics. We next observed the interactions of two phytoseiid species with abundant extraguild prey. In all species combinations, one species went extinct and the other increased in population size, despite the availability of sufficient extraguild prey, suggesting some type of competition must have caused the extinctions. We suggested that intraguild predation is the most plausible hypothesis to explain the results.","[Ji, J.; Zhang, Y. -X.; Saito, Y.] Fujian Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Fuzhou 350013, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Saito, Y.] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Takada, T.] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Tsuji, N.] Hokkaido Univ, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan","Saito, Y (corresponding author), Fujian Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Fuzhou 350013, Fujian, Peoples R China.; Saito, Y (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",jj124421@sina.com; xuan7616@sina.com; yutsat@res.agr.hokudai.ac.jp; takada@ees.hokudai.ac.jp; n-tsuji@census.hokudai.ac.jp,,,Science and Technology Innovation Team of Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences [CXTD-2-13-13]; China Recruitment Program of Global Experts (Foreign Experts) [WQ20123500080]; State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs Key Project for Introduction of Foreign Expert [SZ2013003]; Ministry of Agriculture Special Fund for Scientific Research in the Public Interest [201103020]; 863 ProgramNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2011AA10A201],"We thank S.

In order to study how forest habitat patchiness and seed species influence post-dispersal seed predation, we monitored seed predation of native common understory plant species in Patagonia temperate forests. By performing a cafeteria-style experiment, we assessed consumption on the three most common understory seed species, in forest interior and forest gaps. We found that seed predation by rodents differed between habitats and, independently, between seed species. Seed predation was more than 2 x higher in forest gaps than in forest interior, and medium-sized seed species were the least preyed-upon. Although counterintuitive, given that granivores such as rodents usually prefer sheltered habitats to forage, these results highlight the importance of site-specific variables in plant-granivore interactions.","[Motta, Luciana; Vitali, Agustin; Rodriguez-Cabal, Mariano A.] Univ Nacl Comahue, Grp Ecol Invasiones, INIBIOMA, CONICET, Ave Pioneros 2350, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Motta, Luciana] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Parque Nacl Nahuel Huapi, APN, CENAC, Fagnano 244, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Amico, Guillermo C.] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA, CONICET, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 BAR San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Garcia, Daniel] Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organismos & Sistemas, Inst Mixto Invest Biodiversidad IMIB, CSIC,UO,PA, Oviedo 33071, Spain; [Rodriguez-Cabal, Mariano A.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Motta, L (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, Grp Ecol Invasiones, INIBIOMA, CONICET, Ave Pioneros 2350, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.; Motta, L (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Parque Nacl Nahuel Huapi, APN, CENAC, Fagnano 244, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",motta.lucianam@gmail.com,"Garcia, Daniel/A-1236-2011","Garcia, Daniel/0000-0002-7334-7836; Motta, Luciana/0000-0001-5263-6885; Vitali, Agustin/0000-0002-0642-4520; Amico, Guillermo/0000-0002-3709-3111",University of Oviedo [CYTED-XII-6];  [BIOCON2003-162],"We acknowledge mobility funding from the project CYTED-XII-6 and from the University of Oviedo to MAR-C a contract Ramon y Cajal'' (MCYT-Fondo Social Europeo) to DG, and the project BIOCON2003-162 (Fundacion BBVA) to DG.",,71,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUL,2021,222,7,,,,,819,827,,10.1007/s11258-021-01145-1,,MAY 2021,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,SU2BP,WOS:000652567200001,,,,,2021-09-27,

The gradients contrast in precipitation but not temperature, allowing us to separate these two climatic factors. Location Montane rainforest in Costa Rica. Time period 2015-2016. Major taxa studied Bromeliad-dwelling aquatic insect larvae. Methods We estimated the elevational preferences of five insect taxa by surveying 170 bromeliads along the moist Atlantic and the dry Pacific slopes of Monteverde and determined their critical thermal maxima (CTmax) experimentally. We determined whether taxon-specific heat tolerances predicted their elevational preferences, using Deming regressions, and tested whether potential predators mediated effects on the elevation of insect distributions, using structural equation models. Results On the moist Atlantic slope, heat tolerances of insects explained their elevational distributions: taxa with high heat tolerances preferred low elevations where conditions were warmest, whereas taxa with low heat tolerances preferred high elevations where conditions were coldest. In contrast, on the drier Pacific slope, the elevational abundance pattern of many insects reflected negative interactions from crane fly larvae. These larvae are known to become predatory in drought conditions and were disproportionally abundant at low elevations on the Pacific slope. Main conclusions We show that under drought, indirect effects mediated by species interactions can override any direct physiological effects of environmental conditions on insect distributions. The relative importance of limits to physiological tolerance and species interactions thus depends on the environmental context, an important insight given that environmental conditions are expected to shift with climate change.","[Amundrud, Sarah L.; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Amundrud, SL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",amundrud@zoology.ubc.ca,,"Amundrud, Sarah/0000-0002-0457-1551; Srivastava, Diane/0000-0003-4541-5595",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Killam Trusts; Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: CGS-D, Discovery grant and MSFSS; Killam Trusts, Grant/Award Number: Killam Doctoral Scholarship; Agence Nationale de la Recherche",,64,2,2,5,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

The continuing threat to freshwater biodiversity of biological invasions indicates that biotic factors do, however, have important structuring roles. In Irish rivers, the native amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus has become locally extinct, ostensibly through differential predation by the more aggressive and introduced G. pulex. This mechanism explains impacts of G. pulex at within-river spatial scales on native macroinvertebrate community diversity, including declines in ephemeropterans, plecopterans, dipterans and oligochaetes. To determine if these patterns are predictable at larger spatial scales, we assessed patterns in native macroinvertebrate communities across river sites of the Erne catchment in 1998 and 1999, in conjunction with the distribution of G. pulex and G. d. celticus. In both years, G. pulex dominated invaded sites, whereas G. d. celticus occurred at low abundance in uninvaded sites. In both years, invaded sites had lower diversity and fewer pollution sensitive invertebrate species than un-invaded sites. Community ordination in 1998 showed that invaded sites had higher conductivity, smaller substrate particle size and comprised a lower proportion of pollution sensitive taxa including Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera. In contrast, in 1999, conductivity was the only variable explaining site ordination along axis 1, but was unable to separate sites with respect to invasion status. A second explanatory axis separated sites with respect to invasion status, with invaded sites having fewer taxa, including lower abundance of ephemeropterans, dipterans and plecopterans. Laboratory experiments examined the potential role of differential predation between the two Gammarus species in explaining these taxon specific patterns in the field. Survival of the ephemeropterans, Ephemerella ignita and Ecdyonurus venosus and the isopod, Asellus aquaticus, was lower when interacting with G. pulex than with G. d. celticus. This study indicates that G. putex may alter invertebrate community structure at scales beyond those detected within individual rivers. However, effects may be influenced by gradients in physico-chemistry, which may be temporal or depend on catchment characteristics. Invasions by amphipods have increased globally, thus comprehensive assessments of their impacts and of other aquatic invaders, may only be apparent when studies are conducted at a range of spatio-temporal scales.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada","Kelly, DW (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",dwkelly@uwindsor.ca,,,,,,55,21,25,0,26,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

Moreover, identification of habitat selection mechanisms of invasive organisms is crucial for predicting their distribution and impact in novel areas. We evaluated experimentally the habitat selection by Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides (Gammaroidea, Amphipoda, Crustacea), invasive in European fresh and brackish waters, with regard to depth, the presence of predators, the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus, and heterospecific gammarid competitors. We exposed gammarids in single- and mixed-species treatments in a 100-cm-long depth gradient (depth: 10-100cm, levels every 10cm) or in a control shallow tank (constant depth: 10cm) in the presence or absence of predators located behind a mesh barrier adjacent to the deeper side of the gradient. Dikerogammarus villosus always selected deeper locations than P.robustoides. Both species did not affect each other's depth selection, but P.robustoides limited the distribution of D.villosus and pushed it towards the mesh barrier in the shallow tank. Dikerogammarus villosus responded to predators only in the depth gradient, retreating to shallower sites and climbing towards the surface. Pontogammarus robustoides moved away from the predator area in the shallow tank, indicating that its response was independent of depth selection. Thus, different depth distributions of both gammarids result from their specific preferences rather than from competitive displacement. The observed behaviour is likely to result in their segregation in the field, limiting inter-specific competition, allowing for optimum utilization of resources and decreasing predatory pressure.","[Kobak, J.; Jermacz, L.; Rutkowska, D.; Pawlowska, K.; Witkowska, L.; Poznanska, M.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Torun, Poland","Kobak, J (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",jkob73@umk.pl,"Poznanska, Malgorzata/H-6261-2014; Jermacz, Lukasz/B-8728-2017; Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013","Jermacz, Lukasz/0000-0001-9182-116X; Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Poznanska-Kakareko, Malgorzata/0000-0001-7224-3093","National Science CentreNational Science Centre, Poland [2012/05/B/NZ8/00479, 2013/09/N/NZ8/03191]",Our study was supported by the grants of the National Science Centre no. 2012/05/B/NZ8/00479 and 2013/09/N/NZ8/03191.,,48,7,8,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Here we examine relationships between two prey species that do not compete directly, the field vole Microtus agrestis, a common rodent with fluctuating populations, and the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica, a gamebird inhabiting open moorland, during a 27-year study on a moor in south-west Scotland. First, we test whether vole abundance was related to grouse density and demographic rates. Second, we test whether vole abundance was related to abundance indices of four common predators of both voles and grouse (red fox vulpes vulpes, weasel Mwtela nivalis, hen harrier Circus cyanew and common buzzard Buteo buteo). Third, we test whether these vole-grouse and vole-predator relationships differ in relation to grouse management, which includes the culling of foxes and weasels. We found no association between vole abundance and grouse densities, adult summer survival or nesting success. However, the ratio of young grouse per adult and the proportion of female grouse with broods in July were negatively associated with field vole abundance, suggesting increased predation of grouse chicks in years with high vole abundance. Fox indices showed a weak positive association with vole abundance when their numbers were not controlled, whilst weasel indices showed no relationship with voles. The numbers of breeding hen harriers and buzzards were also not associated with vole abundance, but the number of buzzard sightings was higher when voles were more plentiful. Our results are consistent with a negative interaction between field voles and red grouse chick survival in a pattern expected for apparent competition. Although the underlying mechanisms could not be disentangled, this interaction may be at least partly mediated by rodent-hunting raptors such as buzzards and, in periods without grouse management, foxes.","[Ludwig, Sonja C.; Baines, David] Game & Wildlife Conservat Trust, Coach House,Eggleston Hall, Barnard Castle DL12 0AG, England; [Ludwig, Sonja C.] Langholm Moor Demonstrat Project, Estate Off, Ewesbank DG13 0ND, Langholm, Scotland; [Roos, Staffan] RSPB Scotland, RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Roos, Staffan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Swedish Species Informat Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden","Ludwig, SC (corresponding author), Game & Wildlife Conservat Trust, Coach House,Eggleston Hall, Barnard Castle DL12 0AG, England.",sludwig@gwct.org.uk,,"Ludwig, Sonja/0000-0003-3209-0568",Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust; Scottish Natural Heritage; Buccleuch Estates; Royal Society for the Protection of Birds; Natural England,"This study was conducted as part of the Langholm Moor Demonstration Project (2008-2017), funded by the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, Buccleuch Estates, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Natural England.",,64,1,1,1,6,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,1903-220X,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,,2020,2020,2,,,,,,,wlb.00642,10.2981/wlb.00642,,,10,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,MO3LS,WOS:000551432400011,,gold,,,2021-09-27,

It has been suggested that C. septempunctata negatively impacted C. novemnotata through a combination of mechanisms. We investigated the effects of scramble competition and intraguild predation between groups of C. septempunctata and C. novemnotata. A novel aspect of these experiments for this species combination was that we provided beetles the option to cannibalize conspecifics or predate on heterospecifics (i.e. intraguild predation); thus, we were able to compare interspecific versus intraspecific competition. Increasing prey density resulted in significantly lower rates of intraguild predation on C. novemnotata by C. septempunctata. Percentage survival of C. novemnotata grouped with C. septempunctata at low and high aphid densities was 6 and 61%, respectively. For our second study, we increased the spatial complexity and volume of the assay system, and provided prey ad libitum. C. novemnotata survival from first-instar to adult was significantly lower than C. septempunctata survival when grouped heterospecifically (43 vs 61% survival, respectively). Finally, we conducted a study to determine if hungry larvae discriminate conspecific versus heterospecific larvae by testing whether they predated selectively on the basis of species, which they did not appear to do. We conclude that C. novemnotata larvae suffer greater rates of intraguild predation from C. septempunctata compared with cannibalism, that this difference appears to be due to size asymmetry between the two species, and that local conditions impact the severity of intraguild predation by C. septempunctata.","[Tumminello, Giuseppe; Ugine, Todd A.; Losey, John E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Tumminello, G (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",gt95@cornell.edu,,,Informal Science Education Program of the National Science Foundation [DRL-0741738],"We would like to thank the Lost Ladybug Project for helping us to collect lady beetles to start our colonies.

Based on the premise that an invader's vulnerability to predation is influenced by its evolutionary experience with the predator and its ability to compete for refugia, we hypothesized that amphipod species replacement is facilitated through selective predation by the round goby Neogobius melanostomus, a Ponto-Caspian fish that invaded the Great Lakes in the early 1990s and is now colonizing the St. Lawrence River. in laboratory experiments, we determined if E. ischnus excludes G. fasciatus from mussel patches, and if the vulnerability of G. fasciatus to predation by gobies is increased in the presence of the invasive amphipod. E. ischnus and G. fasciatus did not differ in their use of mussel patches, either when alone or in each other's presence. Both species were equally vulnerable to predation by the round goby. In field experiments, we determined if the round goby exerts a stronger impact than native predators on the relative abundance of amphipod species. Our results suggest that E. ischnus is more vulnerable to native predators, but the round goby does not have a differential impact on the native amphipod. We conclude that competition with E. ischnus does not increase the vulnerability of G. fasciatus to goby predation, and that the Found goby does not promote the replacement of G. fasciatus by E. ischnus in the St. Lawrence River. The outcome of antagonistic interactions between exotic and native amphipods is mediated more by abiotic factors than by shared evolutionary history with other co-occurring exotic species.

Two site-specific (spot) treatments, the miticide bifenazate (Acramite (R)) and the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus McGregor, were compared with whole-plot treatments of bifenazate or N. californicus to determine whether T. urticae could be effectively managed in field-grown strawberry using only site-specific tactics. Additionally, the cost of site-specific tactics was compared with whole-plot treatments to determine the economic value of using site-specific management tactics for T. urticae in strawberries. In the greenhouse, all treatments equivalently reduced the number of T. urticae below control. In the field during the 2011-2012 season, more T. urticae eggs and motiles were in the whole-plot treatments of both N. californicus and bifenazate in the mid-season and late season, respectively, compared with the spot treatments. With the exception of site-specific N. californicus during the 2011-2012 field season, there were no differences in marketable yields between plots with site-specific treatments and whole-plot management. An economic analysis demonstrated a significant cost savings (75.3 %) with site-specific treatments of N. californicus compared with whole-plot application of N. californicus. Similarly, a 24.7 % reduction in cost was achieved in using site-specific bifenazate compared with whole-plot application of bifenazate.

Non-consumptive predator effects are an important driver in predator-prey interactions. While indirect effects of predation risk shape interspecific species interactions, e.g. in fuelling trophic cascades, knowledge about non-consumptive predator effects on intraspecific interactions among intimidated prey is scarce. 2. In laboratory experiments, we tested whether predation by male and female green crabs (Carcinus maenas) is stronger on small than on larger specimens of the periwinkle Littorina littorea, an important herbivore species in intertidal habitats of the temperate zone. Moreover, we asked whether size-specific differences in predation-induced mortality reflect as a stronger effect of predation risk (caused by nearby consuming crabs) on the foraging behaviour of more threatened periwinkles and ultimately on the recruitment success of the brown seaweed Fucus serratus. Furthermore, predator activity and prey abundance was measured in the field and the efficacy of predation risk on the survival of seaweed recruits was assessed in three field experiments with two different set-ups (open plots and crab exclosures). 3. Male crabs consumed smaller periwinkles more often than larger conspecifics, while females refused periwinkles as food. In summer, 80-90% of periwinkles in the field attained a size at which crab predation was minimal in laboratory assays. The observed up to 15-fold decrease in the consumption of seaweed recruits by periwinkles in the presence of nearby consuming crabs in laboratory assays was, however, independent of the size of periwinkles. Predation risk effects from the laboratory were only confirmed in field experiments using crab exclosures but not with open plots, suggesting an artefact due to trespassing by wild crabs in the open plot set-up. 4. Synthesis. Predation risk may not change intraspecific competition for food in L. littorea. Yet, risk effects on foraging behaviour of periwinkles that experience a low threat of real predation indicate that non-consumptive predator effects may affect prey population dynamics more strongly than consumptive predator effects. Thus predation risk effects may be indirectly beneficial for the survival of basal species like perennial seaweeds, as experimental evidence from field and laboratory experiments indicates.","[Molis, Markus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Sect Funct Ecol, Marine Stn, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany; [Preuss, Inken] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainable Sci, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Firmenich, Annika] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Dept Marine Biol, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Ellrich, Julius] Univ Marburg, Dept Morphol & Evolut Anim, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Molis, M (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Sect Funct Ecol, Marine Stn, Kurpromenade 201, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany.",markus.molis@awi.de,,"Ellrich, Julius/0000-0003-0884-3726",,,,49,15,15,2,52,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Yet its effects on resource exploitation remain, largely unexplored for species that compete for dynamic resources. Here, I present a model of exploitative and interference competition with explicit resource dynamics. The model incorporates both biotic and abiotic resources. It considers interference competition both in the classical sense (i.e. each species suffers a net reduction in per capita growth rate via interference from, and interference on, the other species) and in the broad sense (i.e. each species suffers a net reduction in per capita growth rate via interference from, but can experience an increase in growth rate via interference on, the other species). Coexistence cannot occur under classical interference competition even when the species inferior at resource exploitation is superior at interference. Such a trade-off can, however, change the mechanism of competitive exclusion from dominance by the superior resource exploiter to a priority effect. Now the inferior resource exploiter can exclude the superior resource exploiter provided it has a higher initial abundance. By contrast, when interference is beneficial to the interacting species, coexistence is possible via a trade-off between exploitation and interference. These results hold regardless of whether the resource is biotic or abiotic, indicating that the outcome of exploitative and interference competition does not depend on the exact nature of resource dynamics. The model makes two key predictions. First, species that engage in costly interference mechanisms (e.g. territoriality, overgrowth or undercutting, allelopathy and other forms of chemical competition) should not be able to coexist unless they also engage in beneficial interference mechanisms (e.g. predation or parasitism). Second, exotic invasive species that displace native biota should be superior resource exploiters that have strong interference effects on native species with little or negative cost. The first prediction provides a potential explanation for patterns observed in several natural systems, including plants, aquatic invertebrates and insects. The second prediction is supported by data on invasive plants and vertebrates.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 5th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",amarasek@uchicago.edu,,,,,,52,167,169,5,177,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2945,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Yet predictive relations between grazer abundance and seagrass performance are elusive, in significant part because of poorly understood diversity in mesograzer feeding biology. We conducted experiments in eelgrass Zostera marina microcosms to explore how differences in feeding between 2 common grazing amphipod taxa affected accumulation and species composition of epiphytes on eelgrass, as well as amphipod population growth, competition and production, over a 4-week period in summer. Gammarus mucronatus and ampithoids (a mixture of Cymadusa compta and Ampithoe longimana) were stocked, singly and in combination, along with a grazer-free control treatment. Amphipod population growth rates indicated that the 2 taxa competed for a common limiting resource, presumably periphyton, which was essentially eliminated in all grazer treatments. Final abundances of both amphipod taxa were 53 to 68% lower in treatments where the other grazer was present than in single-species grazer treatments. A common carrying capacity was also indicated by the nearly identical final biomass of amphipods across treatments, despite 2-fold. variation in initial amphipod densities. These results support the hypothesis that the 2 amphipod taxa are roughly equivalent in terms of resource requirements and production rates. Despite this equivalence, subtle differences in diet breadth between amphipod taxa translated into substantial differences in biomass and composition of the fouling assemblage among treatments. Whereas grazer-free eelgrass became heavily fouled with periphyton and tunicates, eelgrass exposed to G. mucronatus alone was overgrown by the red alga Polysiphonia harveyi, which reached a biomass equal to the total fouling mass of grazer-free controls. P. harveyi was nearly absent from all other treatments. In contrast, eelgrass with ampithoids was virtually devoid of all fouling material. Thus, similar mesograzer species can have markedly different impacts on fouling assemblages, and these occur despite strong similarity in grazer energetics and primary food sources. Our results may help to reconcile evidence of diet overlap and diffuse competition among mesograzer species with the different feeding preferences and community impacts shown for several mesograzers in experimental studies.","Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","Duffy, JE (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",jeduffy@vims.edu,"Duffy, J.

Both abiotic stress and species interactions can limit populations and potentially set range boundaries, but we have a poor understanding of when and where each is most critical. A commonly cited hypothesis, first proposed by Darwin, posits that abiotic factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) are stronger determinants of range boundaries in apparently abiotically stressful areas (stress indicates abiotic factors that reduce population growth), including desert, polar, or high-elevation environments, whereas species interactions (e.g., herbivory, competition) play a stronger role in apparently less stressful environments. We tested a core tenet of this hypothesis-that population growth rate is more strongly affected by species interactions in less stressful areas-using experimental manipulations of species interactions affecting a common herbaceous plant, Hibiscus meyeri (Malvaceae), across an aridity gradient in a semiarid African savanna. Population growth was more strongly affected by four distinct species interactions (competition with herbaceous and shrubby neighbors, herbivory, and pollination) in less stressful mesic areas than in more stressful arid sites. However, contrary to common assumptions, this effect did not arise because of greater density or diversity of interacting species in less stressful areas, but rather because aridity reduced sensitivity of population growth to these interactions. Our work supports classic predictions about the relative strength of factors regulating population growth across stress gradients, but suggests that this pattern results from a previously unappreciated mechanism that may apply to many species worldwide.","[Louthan, Allison M.; Morris, William F.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Louthan, Allison M.; Pringle, Robert M.; Goheen, Jacob R.; Palmer, Todd M.; Doak, Daniel F.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki 10400, Kenya; [Louthan, Allison M.; Doak, Daniel F.] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Pringle, Robert M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Palmer, Todd M.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Louthan, AM (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.; Louthan, AM (corresponding author), Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki 10400, Kenya.; Louthan, AM (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",allisonmlouthan@gmail.com,,"Louthan, Allison/0000-0002-2735-6539; Palmer, Todd/0000-0001-5710-9750","Philanthropic Educational Organization Scholar Award; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization-L'Oreal International Fellowship; Wyoming National Aeronautics and Space Administration Space Grant; Universities of Colorado and Wyoming; National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Environmental Biology (DEB)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1311394]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1355122, DEB-1457691, IOS-1656527]; NSF DEB Early Concept Grants [1547679]; NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1556728, 1149980, 1242355, 1352781]; University of Wyoming; University of Wyoming Biodiversity Institute; Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program Grant [15 RC01-096]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council Research Tools and Instruments grant","We acknowledge funding from the Philanthropic Educational Organization Scholar Award; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization-L'Oreal International Fellowship; Wyoming National Aeronautics and Space Administration Space Grant; funds from the Universities of Colorado and Wyoming; National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) Grant 1311394 (with D.F.D.)

One explanation, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), proposes that elevated species diversity is a product of moderate levels of disturbance that allow the subsequent invasion of less competitive species. Here, we assess the shifts in species diversity in a mysid (Mysidae Dana, 1850) zooplankton community, where at least 10 species have, over the last 15 years, have come to comprise the primary prey base of summer resident gray whales (Eschrictius robustus Lilljeborg, 1861) in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia. We evaluate trends in the community structure of mysids (species dominance, diversity, and richness) across mysid habitat in the study area during the gray whale foraging season (May-September) for the period 1996 and 2008. Mysid species composition varies among years and diversity has increased as whales shifted their predatory focus from benthic amphipods (Ampeliscidae Costa, 1857) to mysids, near our starting point in 1996. Holmesimysis sculpta Tattersall, 1933 was the dominant species in early years; however, in 2007, the dominance shifted to Neomysis rayi Murdoch, 1885. The habitat restrictions and life history attributes of local populations of coastal mysids leave them vulnerable to the cumulative impacts of increased predation pressure by gray whales. This case study presents a unique examination implicating predation as an agent of disturbance capable of altering the species structure of a local prey community.","[Feyrer, Laura Joan; Duffus, David A.] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Whale Res Lab, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada","Feyrer, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Whale Res Lab, PO 3060 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada.",laura.joan@gmail.com,"Feyrer, Laura Joan/H-5144-2016","Feyrer, Laura Joan/0000-0002-9300-1947",Province of British Columbia Pacific Leaders Fellowship; American Cetacean Society Puget Sound Chapter; Department of Geography at the University of Victoria; Society for Coastal and Ecological Research (SEACR); Derek Sewell Foundation,"Research was conducted in the traditional territory of the Ahousaht First Nation.

Mongoose introductions to Pacific islands have diminished the abundance of diurnal lizards and in some cases have led to extinctions. Through these population level effects, biogeographic patterns are produced, such as the reciprocal co-occurrence pattern seen with the tuatara and its predator, the Polynesian rat, and with the tropical gecko competitors Hemidactylus frenatus and Lepidodactylus lugubris in urban habitats in the Pacific. Although competition has led to changes in abundance and has caused habitat displacement and reduced colonization success, extinctions of established reptile populations usually occur only as a result of predation. These introductions, along with many manipulative experiments, demonstrate that present day competition and predation are potent forces shaping community structure and geographic distributions. The human introduction of species to islands can be viewed as an acceleration of the natural processes of range expansion and colonization. The immediate biotic consequences of these natural processes should be of the same intensity as those of the human introductions. Coevolution may subsequently act to ameliorate these interactions and reduce the dynamical response of one species to the other. The role played by coevolution in mediating interactions between competitors and predator and prey is highlighted by the susceptibility of predator-naive endemic species to introduced predators and the invalidity of species-poor communities.",,"CASE, TJ (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,DEPT BIOL C-016,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.",,,,,,,0,153,166,2,58,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Yet, providing strong experimental or observational support (or refutation) for this has proven evasive. Such models have usually assumed host groups to correspond to the species level, typically delimited by 16S rRNA gene sequence data. Recent model developments take into account the resolution of species into strains with differences in their susceptibility to viral attack. With strains as the host groups, the models will have explicit viral control of abundance at strain level, combined with explicit predator or resource control at community level, but the direct viral control at species level then disappears. Abundance of a species therefore emerges as the combination of how many strains, and at what abundance, this species can establish in competition with other species from a seeding community. We here discuss how species diversification and strain diversification may introduce competitors and defenders, respectively, and that the balance between the two may be a factor in the control of species diversity in mature natural communities. These models can also give a dominance of individuals from strains with high cost of resistance; suggesting that the high proportion of dormant cells among pelagic heterotrophic prokaryotes may reflect their need for expensive defense rather than the lack of suitable growth substrates in their environment.","[Thingstad, T.

Local guilds have historically been a major focus of community ecology; however, studies of local guilds rarely measure consequences of coexistence for fitness-related traits or test predictions of alternative hypotheses for how species may interact. We studied consequences of coexistence for Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata) and Virginia's Warblers (V. virginiae), which have overlapping breeding territories in central Arizona. We used reciprocal removal experiments to examine (1) whether coexistence results in ecological consequences with respect to access to nest sites, access to food resources, nest predation, and adult female predation, and (2) whether ecological consequences result in fitness consequences with respect to reproductive success (clutch size, number of young fledged per nest), or adult female survival (within a breeding season). When we removed Virginia's Warblers, Orange-crowned Warblers experienced reduced nest predation rates compared with control plots where Virginia's Warblers were present. When we removed Orange-crowned Warblers, Virginia's Warblers (1) shifted their nest sites to sites indistinguishable from Orange-crowned Warbler nest sites, (2) increased feeding rates during both the incubation and nest:ling periods, and (3) suffered reduced nest predation rates, compared with control plots where Orange-crowned Warblers were present. When the two species coexist, increased nest predation rates for both species appear to result from density-dependent functional shifts in nest predator behavior (short-term apparent competition). Reduced access to preferred nest sites for Virginia's Warblers coexisting with Orange-crowned Warblers appears to result from both Orange-crowned Warbler interference during nest site selection and building periods, and from Orange-crowned Warbler preemption of nest sites preferred by both species. The mechanisms whereby Orange-crowned Warblers may reduce access to food resources for coexisting Virginia's Warblers, however, are not yet fully understood. Both. Orange-crowned and Virginia's Warblers fledged between 78% and 129% more young per nest on plots where the opposite species had been removed, indicating that both species suffer substantial fitness costs of coexistence. Overall, results illustrate that (I) Orange-crowned and Virginia's Warblers do not coexist independently of each other, (2) interactions between the two species are complex and asymmetrical, (3) interactions between the two species result in substantial fitness costs of coexistence for both species, and (4) ecological interactions between the two species extend far beyond competition for food resources which has dominated studies of terrestrial vertebrate communities.","Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Avian Studies Program, US Geol Survey,Biol Resources Div, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Martin, PR (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Avian Studies Program, US Geol Survey,Biol Resources Div, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867",,,,89,121,128,0,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2001,82,1,,,,,189,206,,10.2307/2680096,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393UN,WOS:000166488200016,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

Here, the effect of predation on the diversity and abundance of young coral reef fishes was experimentally examined in Moorea, French Polynesia. Effects of predators were quantified by monitoring recruitment of fishes onto standardized patch reefs in predator-exclosure cages or uncaged reefs. At the end of the 54-day experiment, recruits were 74% less abundant on reefs exposed to predators than on caged ones, and species richness was 42% lower on reefs exposed to predators. Effects of predators varied somewhat among families, however, rarefaction analysis indicated that predators foraged non-selectively among species.

The field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the sibling vole (M. rossiaemeridionalis) are sympatric close relatives which compete for similar resources. Previous non-experimental studies suggest that the smaller sibling vole is a superior competitor, yet more vulnerable to predation than the larger field vole. We studied the effects of coexistence on population densities, reproductive parameters, and survival in these two species by means of experimentation in large, predator-free outdoor enclosures. While populations of both species reached higher densities in the absence of the other, field voles appeared to suffer more from interspecific competition than sibling voles. The proportion of young individuals in the population was higher in the sibling vole than in the field vole at the end of the experiment. The presence of a coexisting species reduced the survival of field voles. Sibling voles, on the other hand, appeared to suffer more from intraspecific competition than interspecific competition. On a population level, the sibling vole seems to be a superior competitor in the absence of predators due to better survival and possibly a higher reproductive capacity. However, predation probably has a profound influence on the interspecific dynamics of these two species indicating that in natural surroundings apparent competition (i.e. competition via shared predators) is stronger than direct competition.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Koivisto, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",elanko@utu.fi,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509",,,,46,11,12,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2007,116,1,,,,,156,162,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15254.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,125AJ,WOS:000243413600015,,,,,2021-09-27,

Invaders negatively affect the abundance of native species due to direct interactions like predation and competition. Additionally, invaders may benefit native biota by imposing indirect effects on resident species interactions. Invaders indirectly affect resident species via both density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs) and trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs). Previous studies on these different indirect interactions have largely examined the effects on structuring ecological systems, with paying little attention to the role of body size. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that an invasive habitat modifier of European coastal waters, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), alters the population structure of native mussels (Mytilus edulis) by modifying the size specific predator-prey interaction between the mussels and the shore crab (Carcinus maenas). In laboratory split-plot experiments, the presence of Pacific oysters reduced the mortality of unconditioned mussels as well as mussels that were acclimatized in presence of predatory cues, while being exposed to predation by crabs of two different size classes. The reduction in mortality was size-dependent both in terms of the predators and the prey. The presence of oysters notably reduced mussel mortality in presence of small crabs, while the mortality rate in presence of big crabs was less affected. Mussels that benefited the most by the presence of oysters were those of recruitment stages, smaller than 20 mm in shell length. Our results suggest that oysters cause a strong shift in the population structure of M. edulis, reducing particularly the mortality of smaller sized mussels.","[Waser, Andreas M.; Splinter, Wouter; van der Meer, Jaap] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Ecol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands","Waser, AM (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Ecol, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.",andreas.waser@nioz.nl,"Waser, Andreas/J-2082-2016","Waser, Andreas/0000-0002-9455-4447",Waddenfonds; Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment; province of Fryslan; province of North Holland,"We are grateful to David W.

We examined interactions among a pair of early season grasshopper species (May-June; Arphia conspersa and Pardalophora apiculata) and a late season pair (July-August; Melanoplus femur-rubrum and Melanoplus bivittatus). Each grasshopper species was placed in cages by itself and with another grasshopper species. Grasshoppers generally survived at higher density in fertilized cages and they reduced plant abundance relative to empty cages, suggesting that grasshoppers may be food limited at these densities. In unfertilized plots, early season grasshoppers preferred grasses (Schizachyrium scoparium and Poa pratensis) and favored the growth of forbs (especially Solidago spp.). However, late in summer, Melanoplus spp. preferred Solidago spp. and favored the growth of grasses. The pattern of grasshopper survivorship and plant reduction within these experimental environments provide preliminary support for some of the predictions of resource competition theory. Grasshoppers exhibited interspecific competition only if they significantly reduced plant biomass. If two species competed, a grasshopper species was eliminated only if the superior competitor, when living by itself, could reduce plant biomass to a significantly lower level than the inferior competitor. Competitors persisted only if they did not differ in their ability to reduce plant biomass or reduced the abundance of different plant species.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA","RITCHIE, ME (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,40,48,48,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1992,89,4,,,,,524,532,,10.1007/BF00317159,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL791,WOS:A1992HL79100011,28311883,,,,2021-09-27,

However, manipulating single species in isolation can lead to unexpected consequences for other species, with outcomes such as mesopredator release demonstrated both theoretically and empirically in vertebrate assemblages with at least two trophic levels. Less is known about the consequences of species removal in more complex assemblages where a greater number of interacting invaders increases the potential for selective species removal to result in unexpected changes in community structure. Using a replicated Before-After Control-Impact field experiment with a four-species assemblage of invasive mammals we show that species interactions in the community are dominated by competition rather than predation. There was no measurable response of two mesopredators (rats and mice) following control of the top predator (stoats), but there was competitive release of rats following removal of a herbivore (possums), and competitive release of mice following removal of rats.","[Ruscoe, Wendy A.; Pech, Roger P.; Sweetapple, Peter J.; Yockney, Ivor; Barron, Mandy C.; Perry, Mike; Nugent, Graham; Carran, Roger; Duncan, Richard P.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Ramsey, David S.

However, it remains unexplored how they jointly modify the niche differences stabilising species coexistence and the average fitness differences driving competitive dominance. We conducted a field study in Mediterranean annual grasslands to parameterise population models of six competing plant species. Spatially explicit floral visitor assemblages and soil salinity variation were characterised for each species. Both floral visitors and soil salinity modified species population dynamics via direct changes in seed production and indirect changes in competitive responses. Although the magnitude and sign of these changes were species-specific, floral visitors promoted coexistence at neighbourhood scales, while soil salinity did so over larger scales by changing the superior competitors' identity. Our results show how below and aboveground interactions maintain diversity in heterogeneous landscapes through their opposing effects on the determinants of competitive outcomes.","[Lanuza, Jose B.] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia; [Bartomeus, Ignasi] CSIC, EBD, C Americo Vespucio 26, E-41092 Seville, Spain; [Godoy, Oscar] CSIC, IRNAS, Avda Reina Mercedes 10, E-41012 Seville, Spain","Godoy, O (corresponding author), CSIC, IRNAS, Avda Reina Mercedes 10, E-41012 Seville, Spain.",ogodoy@irnas.csic.es,"Godoy, Oscar/D-3976-2011","Godoy, Oscar/0000-0003-4988-6626; Bartomeus, Ignasi/0000-0001-7893-4389","European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie [661118-BioFUNC]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Explora Program [CGL2014-61590-EXP]","We thank three anonymous referees for their helpful comments on the manuscript.

However, in a forest with intense herbivory by non-specialists, what causes a diversifying seedling bank if rare species do not benefit from negative density-dependency in dominant species? We hypothesize that generalist herbivores can cause unevenly distributed species-specific mortality, which mediates recruitment dynamics and therefore affects species coexistence. To answer this question, we conducted a fence-control experiment in a montane cloud forest, Taiwan, and found that herbivorous damages were mainly caused by ungulates, which are generalists. We explored ungulate herbivory effects on recruitment dynamics by censusing tree seedling dynamics for three years. We found that herbivorous damages by ungulates significantly cause seedling death, mostly at their early stage of establishment. The percentage of death caused by herbivory varied among species. In particular, nurse plants and seedling initial height help shade-tolerant species to persist under such intense herbivory. Whereas, deaths caused by other factors occurred more often in older seedlings, with a consistent low percentage among species. We then tested species coexistence maintenance by dynamic modelling under different scenarios of ungulate herbivory. Raising percentages of death by herbivory changes relative species abundances by suppressing light-demanding species and increasing shade-tolerant species. Density-dependent mortality immediately after bursts of recruitments can suppress dominance of abundant species. With ungulate herbivory, fluctuating recruitment further prevent rare species from apparent competition induced by abundant species. Such bio-processes can interact with ungulate herbivory so that long-term coexistence can be facilitated.","[Weng, Chi-Yu; Hsieh, Chih-hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Chih-hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Chih-hao] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Chih-hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Chih-hao] Natl Ctr Theoret Sci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Su, Mong-Huai] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Conservat, Taipei, Taiwan","Su, MH (corresponding author), Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Conservat, Taipei, Taiwan.",smh2@faculty.pccu.edu.tw,"Weng, Chiyu/I-9284-2019; Hsieh, Chih-hao/B-3797-2008","Weng, Chiyu/0000-0001-9278-5201; Hsieh, Chih-hao/0000-0001-5935-7272",Yushan National Park and Taiwan Forestry Bureau,"We thank Bo-kai Ciou for help in surveying herbivory for the fence experiment and preparing raw-data, as well as animal species captured from camera traps.

We set up 3 types of experimental plots in the paddy fields where D. major predominated. The two plots contained single species of either D. japonicus or D. major, respectively, and one plot had both species in equal number. We compared the development and the reproductive performance between plots in each species. In D. japonicus, the number of eggs and early instar nymphs were significantly smaller in the plots containing both species than in the monospecific plots. However, the numbers of late instar nymphs and newly emerged adults were not significantly different between plots. The proportions of starved nymphs in both plots were larger than those in the D. japonicus's natural habitats. The final densities of adults in both plots were lower than those in the natural habitats. These results suggest that lower density of D. japonicus in these paddy fields is due to the lack of available food for nymphs rather than the effects of interspecific competition with D. major. In D. major, significant differences were not found in the number of eggs, each instar nymphs and adults. These results suggest that the effects of interspecific competition did not affect the reproductive performance of D. major.","OKAYAMA COLL SCI,FAC AGR,APPL ENTOMOL LAB,OKAYAMA 700,JAPAN",,,,,,,,12,2,3,0,1,SOC POPULATION ECOLOGY,KYOTO,"SHIMOTACHIURI OGAWA-HIGASHI KAMIKYO-KU, KYOTO 602, JAPAN",0034-5466,,,RES POPUL ECOL,Res.

In Little Chucky Creek, a tributary to the Nolichucky River in Tennessee, the severe population decline of Chucky Madtoms Noturus crypticus has been partially attributed to an increase in the abundance of cavity-dwelling crayfish after the establishment of two nonnative species. Although it has been suggested that the crayfish exclude the cavity-dwelling fish from shelter, we are not aware of studies that have been conducted to demonstrate that crayfish directly outcompete madtoms in this regard. Our objective was to experimentally test the hypothesis that shelter competition between crayfish and Mountain Madtoms Noturus eleutherus, a surrogate species for Chucky Madtoms, is a function of relative size. We conducted behavioral trials in which shelter was the limited resource for the two potential competitors. We recorded the madtoms' success at occupying the provided cover object for 5 d as well as health condition at the end of the competition phase. Both madtom occupancy and health condition were positively correlated with increasing relative size. As the size differential increased between madtoms and crayfish, madtoms were more successful at occupying the cover object, and overall condition was greater at the end of the trial. Conversely, when madtoms were smaller than crayfish, individuals were more commonly excluded from the cover object or even killed. Juvenile madtoms experienced 100% mortality. We concluded that crayfish exhibit a size-specific competitive advantage over Mountain Madtoms when shelter is limited, and that crayfishes may catalyze fish population declines at least partially through shelter exclusion and predation on juveniles.","[Harris, Meredith H.] Tennessee Aquarium Conservat Inst, 175 Baylor Sch Rd, Chattanooga, TN 37405 USA; [Womble, Kristin, I] Tennessee Technol Univ, Tennessee Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Box 5114, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; [Alford, J.

In order to test whether the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) holds in less exposed shores comprised exclusively of smaller rocks (cobbles) we measured 1) the size frequency distribution of cobbles (mass and basal surface area), 2) the incidence of barnacle encrustation as an indirect measure of cobble disturbance, 3) the abundances of the dominant macroinvertebrates occurring beneath cobbles (the crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus, the chiton Sypharochiton pelliserpentis and the snail Diloma zealandica), and 4) macroinvertebrate fidelity beneath a range of cobble sizes. Only large cobbles were found to be encrusted with barnacles, indicative of their greater resistance to physical disturbance by waves and currents. Mark and relocate experiments indicated fidelity to a given cobble over two tidal cycles was 11-14% for crabs and did not vary with cobble size. In contrast, fidelity to medium and large cobbles was higher for chitons (26-45%) and snails (17-31%) and generally increased with increasing cobble size. In contrast to the predictions of the IDH, there was a positive correlation between increasing cobble size and increasing species diversity of organisms found under the cobbles. This pattern is not simply attributable to greater space available beneath large cobbles as there was a significantly greater density of macroinvertebrates beneath medium and large, compared to the small cobbles. Increasing species diversity with increasing cobble size appears to be independent of patterns of species recolonization associated with small cobbles being subject to high disturbance or interspecific competitive hierarchies associated with low disturbance beneath large cobbles. Instead, factors such as aggregative behaviors, and reducing vulnerability to predators and desiccation stress are likely to explain the relationship between cobbles and their associated macroinvertebrate communities.

The three-species, the three two-species combinations, and one-species controls were used. The predictions from island biogeography and metapopulation theory that extinctions rates increase with decreasing patch size and increasing number of species present were also examined. Analyses of reproductive indices and population dynamics indicated that the species used similar resources and that interspecific competition operated during substantial parts of each year. The number of eggs per adult female (adult female egg ratio; E(A)) in the three species were positively related to each other, and concordant changes in the E(A)-values of pairs of species between subsequent sampling dates were significantly more common than discordant changes. There were negative relationships between E(A)-values and total Daphnia density in each species, but these were strong in one species only. Relative extinction rates (extinctions-population-1.year-1) were higher in experiments with three species initially present than in two-species experiments. No extinctions occurred in the one-species controls. Relative extinction rates were also higher in smaller than in larger volumes. The large species D. magna went extinct fewer times than the two smaller species D. pulex and D. longispina. In two-species experiments in volumes larger than 4 l, coexistence of both species after four years was the rule, in spite of interspecific competition. This is not consistent with the classical view that interspecific competition should lead to either niche differentiation or competitive exclusion, but it supports the view that environmental variability may promote coexistence of competing species. Although interspecific competition by itself may not be the most important factor determining the distribution of rockpool Daphnia, the finding that extinctions were most common in three-species experiments still indicates that competition may limit species richness in the rockpool system.","UNIV UPPSALA, DEPT ZOOL, S-75122 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",,,,,,,,98,34,36,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1993,67,3,,,,,451,464,,10.2307/3545357,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LN449,WOS:A1993LN44900007,,,,,2021-09-27,

Understanding the networks that form the systems is of growing importance, e.g. to understand how species will respond to climate change, or to predict potential knock-on effects of a biological control agent. In recent years, a variety of summary statistics for characterising the global and local properties of such networks have been derived, which provide a measure for gauging the accuracy of a mathematical model for network formation processes. However, the critical underlying assumption is that the true network is known. This is not a straightforward task to accomplish, and typically requires minute observations and detailed field work. More importantly, knowledge about species interactions is restricted to specific kinds of interactions. For instance, while the interactions between pollinators and their host plants are amenable to direct observation, other types of species interactions, like those mentioned above, are not, and might not even be clearly defined from the outset. To discover information about complex ecological systems efficiently, new tools for inferring the structure of networks from field data are needed. In the present study, we investigate the viability of various statistical and machine learning methods recently applied in molecular systems biology: graphical Gaussian models, L1-regularised regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), sparse Bayesian regression and Bayesian networks. We have assessed the performance of these methods on data simulated from food webs of known structure, where we combined a niche model with a stochastic population model in a 2-dimensional lattice. We assessed the network reconstruction accuracy in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which was typically in the range between 0.75 and 0.9, corresponding to the recovery of about 60% of the true species interactions at a false prediction rate of 5%. We also applied the models to presence/absence data for 39 European warblers, and found that the inferred species interactions showed a weak yet significant correlation with phylogenetic similarity scores, which tended to weakly increase when including bio-climate covariates and allowing for spatial autocorrelation. Our findings demonstrate that relevant patterns in ecological networks can be identified from large-scale spatial data sets with machine learning methods, and that these methods have the potential to contribute novel important tools for gaining deeper insight into the structure and stability of ecosystems.

The number of prey eaten by a focal crab during a given challenge was recorded for both crab species using competition treatments (solitary crab, 2 conspecifics or 2 heterospecifics) crossed with 2 different prey densities (4 or 30 mussels) and 3 different temperatures (5, 12 or 20 degrees C). To validate laboratory results, complementary field experiments were carried out in aquaculture leases in Prince Edward Island, Canada, in 2007, during which crab stomach contents from identical competition treatments were studied and mussel socks were surveyed monthly for crab abundance. In the laboratory, predation rates of both crab species generally increased with temperature and mussel density, and were not affected by the presence of a heterospecific regardless of the season, During autumn 2006, the Temperature x Mussel density interaction influenced the predation rate of rock crab while only temperature affected the predation rate of green crab. During spring 2007, the predation rate of green crab varied again according to temperature whereas the predation rate of rock crab was affected by the Temperature x Mussel density x Competition interaction. In the field, blue mussels Mytilus edulis were the most abundant food item observed in stomach contents, The competition treatments did not affect the stomach contents. Both crab species displayed different abundance patterns and seemed to avoid each other on mussel socks. Overall, our results suggest that the 2 crab species can potentially coexist.","[Belair, Marie-Christine; Miron, Gilles] Univ Moncton, Dept Biol, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada","Miron, G (corresponding author), Univ Moncton, Dept Biol, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada.",gilles.miron@umoncton.ca,,,Department of Fisheries and Oceans; Canadian Foundation for Innovation and Universite de Moncton; Universite de Moncton and Patrimoine canadien,"We thank S.

While survival of tropical tree seedlings is often negatively density-dependent, the causes have rarely been identified. We tested whether insects and plant pathogens cause density-dependent seedling recruitment and survival in five forest tree species in Belize, Central America. We manipulated densities of seeds or newly germinated seedlings in small (1 m(2) or 0.25 m(2)) plots close to fruiting conspecific trees. Using a factorial design, we excluded enemies from subsets of the plots with fungicides and insecticides. Seed germination (for two species) and early seedling survival (for all species) were monitored at approximately weekly intervals for up to eight weeks, during the period when plants are likely to be most susceptible to natural enemies. In Terminalia amazonia, seed germination was negatively density-dependent and the proportion of seeds germinating increased when insects were excluded. However, the magnitude of the insecticide effect was independent of density. The only significant density effect for survival of young seedlings was in Acacia polyphylla; counter to expectation, seedling survival was higher at high densities. In a few cases pesticide application had a significant effect on seedling survival, but in only one case (Terminalia amazonia) was a significant pesticide x density interaction detected. Our results caution against generalising from studies conducted on a single species at a single time and place and illustrate the challenges of experimentally testing for enemy-mediated negative density-dependence. Experimental outcomes are likely to depend on the spatial scale at which the principal enemies disperse and respond to plant density, and the timescales over which they act. Gathering information on these variables will improve our understanding of the natural histories of tropical forest species and help inform the design of future experiments.","[Gripenberg, Sofia; Bagchi, Robert; Gallery, Rachel E.; Narayan, Lakshmi; Lewis, Owen T.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Freckleton, Robert P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Gripenberg, S (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",sofia.gripenberg@utu.fi,"Lewis, Owen T/B-9531-2011; Bagchi, Robert/F-1732-2011; Freckleton, Rob P/B-6455-2013; Gallery, Rachel E/I-2169-2014","Bagchi, Robert/0000-0003-4035-4105; Freckleton, Robert/0000-0002-8338-864X; Lewis, Owen/0000-0001-7935-6111; Gallery, Rachel/0000-0002-9159-8778","NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/D010721/1]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [126296, 138299]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/D010721/1] Funding Source: researchfish","SG and RB are joint first authors.

To predict the community-level consequences of global climate change we need to understand the relative roles of both the direct and indirect effects of warming. We used a laboratory experiment to investigate how warming affects a tropical community of three species of Drosophila hosts interacting with two species of parasitoids over a single generation. Our experimental design allowed us to distinguish between the direct effects of temperature on host species performance, and indirect effects through altered biotic interactions (competition among hosts and parasitism by parasitoid wasps). Although experimental warming significantly decreased parasitism for all host-parasitoid pairs, the effects of parasitism and competition on host abundances and host frequencies did not vary across temperatures. Instead, effects on host relative abundances were species-specific, with one host species dominating the community at warmer temperatures, irrespective of parasitism and competition treatments. Our results show that temperature shaped a Drosophila host community directly through differences in species' thermal performance, and not via its influences on biotic interactions.","[Thierry, Melanie; Hrcek, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Thierry, Melanie; Pardikes, Nicholas A.; Lue, Chia-Hua; Hrcek, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Biol Ctr, Inst Entomol, Dept Ecol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Lewis, Owen T.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England","Thierry, M (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.; Thierry, M (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Biol Ctr, Inst Entomol, Dept Ecol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",m.thierry@entu.cas.cz,"Thierry, Melanie/AAB-3589-2019; Hrcek, Jan/D-7335-2015","Thierry, Melanie/0000-0003-4169-2413; Hrcek, Jan/0000-0003-0711-6447",Grantova Agentura Ceske RepublikyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-27184Y]; Jihoceska Univerzita v Ceskych Budejovicich [038/2019/P]; OTL by the UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N010221/1],"We acknowledge funding support of JH from the Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky no. 17-27184Y.

Although a species may not be categorized as rare or vulnerable, it still may be sensitive to environmental change and, therefore, at risk of decline. To illustrate the importance of determining species sensitivity, we documented the relative sensitivities of four species of tree frogs, none of which have been designated particularly rare or vulnerable, to environmental change. Our research was conducted in central Florida, where prior research had suggested that Dryophytes femoralis and Dryophytes gratiosus were more sensitive to environmental change than Dryophytes cinereus and Dryophytes squirellus. A comparison of species characteristics and a field study of local abundances supported the dichotomy. Particularly, important environmental factors affecting the two more-sensitive species adversely appear to be habitat selectivity, at a smaller scale, and nearness to the species' southern range limits, at a larger scale. We suspected that one of the more-sensitive species, D. gratiosus, is particularly sensitive to environmental change and that the cause is related to reproduction and/or growth. A series of laboratory analyses suggested strongly that the realized production of adults was less for D. gratiosus than for D. femoralis. Despite their identical placement in categorization schemes, the four species exhibited substantial differences in sensitivity to environmental change. A strong case can be made that the degree of sensitivity of D. gratiosus warrants increased conservation attention for the species. Our results indicate the potential value of field work and the generation of species-specific information in improving categorization schemes, of broadening the categorization criteria typically employed, to accommodate sensitivity to environmental change, and of considering geographical scale in categorization schemes more than is done at present.","[McCoy, Earl D.; Mushinsky, Henry R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Delis, Pablo R.] Shippensburg Univ, Biol Dept, Shippensburg, PA 17257 USA","Mushinsky, HR (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",mushinsk@usf.edu,,,,,,84,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,MAY,2021,12,5,,,,,,,e03526,10.1002/ecs2.3526,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SJ4AN,WOS:000655473800006,,gold,,,2021-09-27,

Theory predicts that such secondary extinctions are driven primarily by loss of species from intermediate or basal trophic levels. In contrast, most cases of secondary extinctions from natural systems have been attributed to loss of entire top trophic levels. Here, we show that loss of single predator species in isolation can, irrespective of their identity or the presence of other predators, trigger rapid secondary extinction cascades in natural communities far exceeding those generally predicted by theory. In contrast, we did not find any secondary extinctions caused by intermediate consumer loss. A food web model of our experimental system-a marine rocky shore community-could reproduce these results only when biologically likely and plausible nontrophic interactions, based on competition for space and predator-avoidance behaviour, were included. These findings call for a reassessment of the scale and nature of extinction cascades, particularly the inclusion of nontrophic interactions, in forecasts of the future of biodiversity.","[Donohue, Ian; Jackson, Andrew L.; Yang, Qiang; O'Connor, Nessa E.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Petchey, Owen L.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kefi, Sonia; Genin, Alexandre] Univ Montpellier, Inst Sci Evolut, BioDICee Team, CNRS,IRD,EPHE,CC065, Montpellier, France","Donohue, I (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.",ian.donohue@tcd.ie,"Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011; Jackson, Andrew L/D-3441-2009","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633; Jackson, Andrew L/0000-0001-7334-0434; Donohue, Ian/0000-0002-4698-6448; O'Connor, Nessa/0000-0002-3133-0913; Genin, Alexandre/0000-0002-3333-1338; Kefi, Sonia/0000-0002-9678-7770",EPA Ireland STRIVE [2008-FS-W-7-S5]; Irish Research Council Embark Postdoctoral Fellowship; EPA Ireland STRIVE Fellowship [2007-FS-B-8-M5],"EPA Ireland STRIVE, Grant/Award Number: 2008-FS-W-7-S5; Irish Research Council Embark Postdoctoral Fellowship and an EPA Ireland STRIVE Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: 2007-FS-B-8-M5",,77,24,24,1,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Either way this may have positive effects on the density of shared prey. Using large outdoor enclosures, we experimentally studied whether the presence of the Tengmalm's owl Aegolius funereus affects the hunting efficiency of the smallest member of the vole-eating predator guild, the least weasel Mustela nivalis, as measured by population responses of coexisting prey species, the field vole Microtus agrestis and the sibling vole M. levis. We compared the density and survival probability of vole populations exposed to no predation, weasel predation or combined predation by a weasel and an owl. The combined predation of both owl and weasel did not result in obvious changes in the density of sibling and field vole populations compared to the control populations without predators, while predation by least weasel alone decreased the densities of sibling voles and induced a similar trend in field vole densities. Survival of field voles was not affected by predator treatment while sibling vole survival was lower in predator treated populations than in control populations. Our results suggest that weasels are intimidated by avian predators, but without changing the effects of predators on competitive situations between the two vole species. Non-lethal effects of intraguild predation therefore will not necessarily change competitive interactions between shared prey species.","[Hoset, Katrine S.; Koivisto, Elina; Huitu, Otso; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Huitu, Otso] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Suonenjoki Unit, FI-77600 Suonenjoki, Finland; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Hoset, KS (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",katrine.hoset@utu.fi,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016; Hoset, Katrine S./A-5090-2010","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509; Hoset, Katrine S./0000-0002-1371-012X","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [8206140, 8123379]","We are grateful for the assistance of Teppo Puolakka and Anniina Lindroos during fieldwork in Lapua.

In a laboratory experiment, females were provided with excess numbers of their principal prey in these fields, pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hams). Among the five species, both the number and total volume of eggs (number x mean egg volume) produced per day increased with increasing female size and were greatest for C. septempunctata Rates of reproduction also increased with increasing female size within species Similarly sized females of C. septempundata and transverse lady beetle.

Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances reduce the structural complexity of habitats, leading to homogenization. High abundances of common, generalist species in disturbed habitats may be driven by reduced competition from specialists in similar habitats. We quantified habitat availability for and utilization of three co-occurring arboreal geckos (Australian native house geckos [Gehyra dubia], northern velvet geckos [Oedura castelnaui] and eastern spiny-tailed geckos [Strophurus williamsi]) in four replicated grazing regimes in an experimental grazing trial in north-east Queensland, Australia. Native house geckos were most abundant in heavily grazed habitats, whereas the two other species rarely co-occurred (either with each other or with native house geckos). Geckos displayed resource partitioning of habitat features, such as tree species and structural characteristics. We found evidence of interspecific competition among gecko species, in which native house geckos shifted their habitat selection in the presence of velvet geckos. In the absence of other geckos, native house geckos preferred rough, peeling bark and dead trees, yet in the presence of velvet geckos, native house geckos shifted away from dead trees, and used more structurally complex trees, probably due to high niche overlap with velvet geckos. Native house geckos were more resistant to the negative effects of livestock grazing than either velvet or spiny-tailed geckos. In the absence of other species, native house geckos used a wider range of microhabitats. Synthesis and applications. Species assemblages are often the results of multiple or complex factors, including predation pressure, habitat availability or competitive interactions. The homogenizing effects on habitat structure caused by livestock grazing reduce diversity and suitability for microhabitat specialists. Reduced competition can therefore promote the abundance of microhabitat generalist species, such as Australian native house geckos, suggesting that livestock grazing leads to homogenization and simplification of habitat structure, which ultimately leads to changes in species composition through reduced competition. Understanding species' responses to disturbance, and more broadly, habitat complexity, is crucial for maintaining or increasing biological diversity in anthropogenically modified landscapes.","[Nordberg, Eric J.; Schwarzkopf, Lin] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Nordberg, EJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",ericjnordberg@gmail.com,"Schwarzkopf, Lin/C-1242-2012","Schwarzkopf, Lin/0000-0002-1009-670X; Nordberg, Eric/0000-0002-1333-622X",Meat and Livestock AustraliaMeat and Livestock Australia [B.ERM.0088],"Meat and Livestock Australia, Grant/Award Number: B.ERM.0088",,74,11,11,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Subterranean carabid larvae are more numerous than surface-active adults, yet very little is known about their ecological significance, dietary preferences or ability to regulate populations of prey species, particularly pests. Part of the reason for this is that predator-prey interactions beneath the soil are almost impossible to observe. 2. Extensive field studies have shown that adult Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) can affect the temporal and spatial dynamics of their slug prey. However, if larvae too are feeding on slugs, this could radically affect overall predator-prey dynamics. 3. We tested the hypotheses that P. melanarius larvae would kill and consume two slug species, Deroceras reticulatum Muller and Arion intermedius Normand, under laboratory and semi-field conditions, and that there would be no significant difference in rates of predation on these slug species. 4. A new monoclonal antibody was developed that was capable of detecting the presence of slug proteins in the guts of P. melanarius larvae. 5. Pterostichus melanarius larvae killed both A. intermedius and D. reticulatum in the laboratory, feeding to a greater extent, and growing more rapidly, on the latter. The larvae were equally effective at reducing numbers of both slug species in a crop of wheat grown in semi-field mini plots, but predation was affected by density-dependent intra-specific competition amongst the beetle larvae. 6. Future modelling of the dynamic interactions between carabids and slugs will need to take into account predation by larvae.","[Thomas, R. S.; Harwood, J. D.; Glen, D. M.; Symondson, W. O.

Naivete, towards a novel competitor is unlikely to result in immediate mortality, but could potentially affect access to resources and hence population growth and survival. In cases where only one species (either native or alien) remains naivete to the other, the species that recognizes the other will gain advantage, with implications for both the persistence of the native species and the establishment and spread of the invasive. The invasive black rat (Rattus rattus) has spread throughout many coastal areas of Australia, and competes with the native bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) wherever they coexist. As these rats have now been interacting for approximately 200 years, and multi-species rodent communities generally maintain their structure through olfactory communication, our aim was to determine whether these two very closely related species recognize one another's odors and use them to mediate their interactions. We used remote-sensing cameras deployed in single- and mixed-species sites to record the behavioral responses of each species to conspecific, heterospecific and control odors. Black rats investigated bush rat odors but not vice versa, suggesting that bush rats may remain naivete towards their new competitor. Highly successful invaders such as black rats may possess traits such as broad recognition templates and rapid learning capabilities that contribute to their ongoing success in invading new environments.","[Heavener, Stephen J.; Carthey, Alexandra J.

We conducted preliminary field experiments to determine whether Orconectes eupunctus were displaced from their former range and whether interspecific competition with O. neglectus chaenodactylus was responsible for the displacement. To determine whether Orconectes eupunctus were displaced from their former range by negative biotic interactions with other species we placed single adult male O. eupunctus in cages at two sites: an upstream site where O. eupunctus was formerly abundant and a downstream site where it is currently abundant. Orconectes neglectus chaenodactylus were additionally paired alongside O. eupunctus at the upstream site. We also conducted a field competition experiment with treatments consisting of (1) 3 O. eupunctus, (2) 6 O. eupunctus, and (3) 3 O. eupunctus and 3 O. neglectus chaenodactylus at a site where both species occur. In the first experiment, O. eupunctus gained significantly more weight at the downstream site than the upstream site during 2003, but not during 2002. At the upstream site, O. eupunctus showed significantly greater growth rates than O. neglectus chaenodactylus during 2002, but not during 2003. In the competition experiment, O. neglectus chaenodactylus did not significantly reduce the growth or survival of O. eupunctus. These results suggest that O. eupunctus have been displaced from their former range by biotic interactions, but interspecific competition between adult male O. eupunctus and O. neglectus chaenodactylus does not appear to be the mechanism responsible for this displacement. Further study is needed to investigate the disappearance of O. eupunctus.","Univ Arkansas, US Geol Survey, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Magoulick, DD (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, US Geol Survey, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",danmag@uark.edu,"Magoulick, Daniel/AAG-1556-2020","Magoulick, Daniel/0000-0001-9665-5957",,,,48,13,13,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Such bi-directional predation can be important during the establishment and spread of an invading species, but its role remains poorly understood. Using a combination of laboratory and mesocosm experiments and field introductions, we demonstrate that guppies, Poecilia reticulata, prey on juvenile killifish, Rivulus hartii, and thereby facilitate their establishment in the habitat of a potential predator. Laboratory studies found that mature guppies can consume larval Rivulus, and experimental stream studies showed that guppies reduced the number of Rivulus surviving from eggs. Growth trials found that interspecific competition, while significant, cannot account for the declines in the survival of juvenile Rivulus seen in field surveys. Finally, a field experiment, in which guppies were introduced into previously guppy-free stream reaches, resulted in a marked reduction in the abundance of juvenile Rivulus relative to guppy-free controls. Together, these results indicate that reducing the native Rivulus population represents an important mechanism promoting guppy invasion success.","[Fraser, Douglas F.] Siena Coll, Dept Biol, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA; [Lamphere, Bradley A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Fraser, DF (corresponding author), Siena Coll, Dept Biol, 515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA.",fraser@siena.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0108365, EF-0623632]","We thank Ronnie Hernandez (Simla research station), Daren Bhawanie of Ramdeen Estate (Ramdeen Stream), and our laboratory and field assistants: Sarah Beaudin, Dave Herasimtchuck, Pierson Hill, Ramon and Jose Rodriguez, Ephraim Farfan, and Kelley Malchan.

The source of the estimation problems is the particular parameterization used to specify species co-occurrence probability. We develop a new parameterization for estimating patterns of co-occurrence of interacting species that allows the effects of covariates to be specified quite naturally without estimation problems. In our model, the occurrence of one species is assumed to depend on the occurrence of another, but the occurrence of the second species is not assumed to depend on the presence of the first species. This pattern of co-occurrence, wherein one species is dominant and the other is subordinate, can be produced by several types of ecological interactions (predator-prey, parasitism, and so on). A simulation study demonstrated that estimates of species occurrence probabilities were unbiased in samples of 50-100 locations and three surveys per location, provided species are easily detected (probability of detection >= 0.5). Higher sample sizes (>200 locations) are needed to achieve unbiasedness when species are more difficult to detect. An analysis of data from treefrog surveys in southern Florida indicated that the occurrence of Cuban treefrogs, an invasive predator species, was highest near the point of its introduction and declined with distance from that location. Sites occupied by Cuban treefrogs were 9.0 times less likely to contain green treefrogs and 15.7 times less likely to contain squirrel treefrogs compared to sites without Cuban treefrogs. The detection probabilities of native treefrog species did not depend on the presence of Cuban treefrogs, suggesting that the native treefrog species are naive to the introduced species.","[Waddle, J.

When a top predator feeds on an intermediate predator and they both feed on a shared basal resource, a phenomenon labeled intraguild predation (IGP), the potential exists for complex food web dynamics due to predation and competitive effects. Here we investigate the relative importance of direct predation vs. competition by a top predator on an intermediate predator. The study system is the rocky intertidal interaction web formed by the predatory seastar Pisaster ochraceus, the predatory whelks Nucella emarginata and N. canaliculata, and a shared resource species, the mussel Mytilus trossulus. Previous experiments documented strong negative effects of Pisaster on mussels and whelks, but the mechanisms responsible for the effects on whelks, whether competition or predation, were not identified. Here we report results of a field experiment that manipulated both Mytilus and Pisaster to determine the short- and longer-term changes in whelk populations. Using a simplified dynamic model for changes in abundance over the initial stages of the experiment, we separated and quantified the top-down effect of direct predation by seastars vs. the bottom-up effects of competition and food limitation. Short-term results were in agreement with longer-term responses. Results suggest that direct and indirect bottom-up influences of mussels were far stronger than predation, and thus, whelk increases in the absence of seastars were due to reduced competition with Pisaster. Large differences between the body sizes of seastars and whelks make it difficult to determine the ultimate nature of the resource under competition between predators. Small mussels may constitute only a food resource for seastars, but to some extent, they also represent a microhabitat for whelks. Differences in the magnitude of the response to mussel manipulations between Nucella species might be due to slight differences in the way the species utilize mussel beds. Some of the predictions of theoretical IGP models regarding coexistence and stability of species may not apply to this interaction web because it includes species with both open and closed populations, rather than just closed populations as assumed by the models.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Navarrete, SA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",snavarre@genes.bio.puc.cl,"Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013; Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012",,,,,75,52,53,0,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2000,81,8,,,,,2264,2277,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2264:SIIIFW]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,346UF,WOS:000088888900019,,,,,2021-09-27,

Daphnia pulicaria is mostly found in the hypolimnion whereas D. galeata mendotae undergoes diel vertical migration between the hypolimnion and the epilimnion. I examined how habitat segregation between these two potentially competing species might be affected by trophic interactions with their resources and predators by performing a field experiment in deep enclosures in which I manipulated fish predation, nutrient levels, and the density of epilimnetic Daphnia. The results of the experiment indicate that habitat use by D. pulicaria can be jointly regulated by competition for food from epilimnetic Daphnia and predation by fishes. Patterns of habitat segregation between the two Daphnia species were determined by predation by fish but not by nutrient levels: The removal of epilimnetic fish predators resulted in higher zooplankton and lower epilimnetic phytoplankton densities and allowed D. pulicaria to expand its habitat distribution into the epilimnion. In contrast, increased resource productivity resulted in higher densities of both Daphnia species but did not affect phytoplankton levels or habitat use by Daphnia. The two species exhibit a trade-off in their ability to exploit resources and their susceptibility to predation by fish. D. g. mendotae (the less susceptible species) may thus restrict D. pulicaria (the better resource exploiter) from the epilimnion when fish are common due to lower minimum resource requirements than those needed by D. pulicaria to offset the higher mortality rate imposed by selective epilimnetic fish predators.

Although Semibalanus is a competitively dominant barnacle species that can reach a size refuge from predation and potentially monopolize space, more than 50% of the rock surface is bare. Within the barnacle beds, bare space occurs intermingled among the large adult barnacles, which are a few centimeters apart, and in small patches (0.1-1 m(2)) devoid of adult Semibalanus. The present study builds on previous experiments in order to investigate spatial and temporal variation in the processes maintaining bare space in this community and to evaluate the benefits and limitations of previous experimental information in this system. Working at the same study site over 23 years ago, Dayton (1971) demonstrated that predation by whelks and bulldozing of newly settled barnacles by limpets were important in maintaining bare space in small patches initially cleared of barnacles. Since the focus of this earlier work was on the factors influencing the provision of bare space after a disturbance (e.g., in areas where large barnacles were initially cleared), no experiments were done in intact beds of large barnacles. We repeated Dayton's factorial manipulations of whelks and limpets both under conditions similar to those described in the original study (i.e., small patches cleared of barnacles), as well as in adjacent intact Semibalanus beds to directly test whether the importance of these consumers in maintaining bare space varied with the presence or absence of large adult Semibalanus. A number of ancillary experiments and observations were conducted to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the observed responses. Our results showed that: (1) Under the conditions of the original experiments (small patches), the importance of whelks and limpets in maintaining bare space was strikingly consistent over time; (2) initial experimental conditions, whether the sessile community was left intact or initially cleared, strongly influenced field measures of consumer-prey interactions; (3) the processes maintaining bare space varied dramatically over small spatial scales. Whelks and limpets played key roles in small patches without large Semibalanus, but they had no effect on the maintenance of bare rock within adjacent beds of the large barnacles. in this case, much of our observational and experimental information on predator densities, behavior, and potential physiological stresses was not useful for predicting community dynamics in Semibalanus beds from previous experimental results.

In visually guided organisms, the prevalent view is that predators have large binocular visual fields and high acuity, whereas prey have wide lateral areas and low acuity, which could affect vigilance behaviour. We characterized the configuration of the visual system (visual fields, retinal topography, visual acuity) and vigilance behaviour (head movement rate) of two ground-foraging avian prey (white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys, California towhee, Pipilo crissalis) with laterally placed eyes. We found that the binocular field of both species (45 degrees) was actually wider than those of some of their avian predators. Both species also had a single retinal specialization (high ganglion cell density area) located in the centro-temporal sector of the retina, which projected into the lateral and frontal part of the head. Wide binocular fields may increase binocular contrast to detect and visually guide the bill towards prey items. Both species had wider lateral visual fields and faster head movement rates than some of their predators, probably to enhance detection and visual tracking of predators. California towhees made faster sideways movements of the head than did white-crowned sparrows, probably to cover visual space more quickly with their retinal specialization because of the comparatively lower spatial resolution of their retinal periphery. Alternatively, California towhees might move their heads more rapidly to monitor for potential risks (e. g. competitors, predators), as they rely mostly on personal information because of their degree of territoriality. Our findings suggest that the visual system and vigilance behaviour of these two avian prey species combine traits to enhance predator detection through large visual coverage and fast head movements, but also to enhance food detection at close range through enhanced binocular vision. 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

This cursorial spider is a common generalist predator in the leaf litter of forests of the eastern United States. In our study site in Maryland, densities of recently dispersed young S. ocreata can reach 60-90 individuals/m(2), but decline to <15 spiders/m(2) by early autumn. We investigated the cause of this rapid decline in spiderling density. We first performed a predator-exclusion field experiment to determine if natural enemies contributed significantly to spider mortality. Replicated enclosures with lip barriers to prevent emigration were stocked with newly dispersed S. ocreata spiderlings at either 0.75x or 3x mean field density, or had no S. ocreata added (0x). Before spiderlings were introduced, we reduced potential enemies in half of the plots by sifting the litter and removing other spiders, centipedes and predaceous beetles, and by installing 3-mm mesh netting to exclude birds, wasps and other predators of S. ocreata. Over a period of 2.5 mo we measured effects of natural enemies and spider density on prey (Collembola), spider growth, and spider survival. Spider mortality was high (approximate to 80%) and strongly density dependent (DD). Survival in the 3x field-density plots was 50% lower than in the 0.75x plots. Increasing spiderling density did not significantly reduce Collembola density and resulted only in a minor DD reduction in spiderling growth (approximate to 10%). Although overall spider mortality was high, excluding natural enemies did not significantly improve spider survival. The absence of emigration and the high spider mortality rates in the predator-reduction treatment strongly implicate cannibalism as the major DD mortality factor. We then conducted two laboratory experiments in order to obtain direct measurements of the rates of cannibalism. Rates of cannibalism were measured in 0.3-m(2) arenas stocked with S. ocreata at densities equivalent to those used in the field experiment. In Experiment 1, habitat complexity and prey availability were manipulated in arenas stocked with S. ocreata at 3x mean held densities. In Experiment 2, we manipulated spider density (0.75x and 3x) and prey density to evaluate the DD component of cannibalism. The laboratory experiments confirmed the importance of cannibalism as a DD mortality factor. DD mortality from cannibalism was influenced by both prey abundance and habitat complexity. The presence of prey significantly reduced rates of cannibalism, and there was a significant interaction between habitat complexity and prey availability. When prey were present, rates of cannibalism were higher in the complex habitat than the simple habitat. In the absence of prey, increasing habitat complexity had no effect on rates of cannibalism. Rates of cannibalism in the treatment that most closely mimicked field conditions-complex leaf-litter with prey at natural densities-did not differ significantly from the rate of mortality of S. ocreata in the field experiment. Considered together, the results of our field and laboratory experiments lead to the conclusion that cannibalism can act as a strong DD mortality factor for young instars of S. ocreata, with the potential to regulate densities of this abundant cursorial spider.","UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT BIOL SCI,BALTIMORE,MD 21228; UNIV KENTUCKY,COLL AGR,DEPT ENTOMOL,LEXINGTON,KY 40546",,,"Wise, David./J-6111-2019","Wise, David./0000-0003-4072-0080",,,,68,121,122,3,44,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1996,77,2,,,,,639,652,,10.2307/2265637,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TY198,WOS:A1996TY19800025,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, this viewpoint has not been adequately tested. We quantified the effect of brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) predation on the abundance and size of lizards on Guam by contrasting lizards in two 1-ha treatment plots of secondary forest from which snakes had been removed and excluded vs. two 1-ha control plots in which snakes were monitored but not removed or excluded. We removed resident snakes from the treatment plots with snake traps and hand capture, and snake immigration into these plots was precluded by electrified snake barriers. Lizards were sampled in all plots quarterly for a year following snake elimination in the treatment plots. Following the completion of this experiment, we used total removal sampling to census lizards on a 100-m(2) subsample of each plot. Results of systematic lizard population monitoring before and after snake removal suggest that the abundance of the skink, Carlia ailanpalai, increased substantially and the abundance of two species of gekkonids, Lepidodactylus lugubris and Hemidactylus frenatus, also increased on snake-free plots. No treatment effect was observed for the skink Emoia caeruleocauda. Mean snout-vent length of all lizard species only increased following snake removal in the treatment plots. The general increase in prey density and mean size was unexpected in light of the literature consensus that snakes do not control the abundance of their prey species. Our findings show that, at least where alternate predators are lacking, snakes may indeed affect prey populations.","[Adams, Amy A.

Whether multiple co-occurring foundation species have additive or interactive effects on communities depends on the extent to which they are functionally redundant, and on the density-dependent functions within and across species. We compared how 2 secondary foundation species -the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata and the free-floating fucalean algae Hormosira banksii, each facilitated by the grey mangrove Avicennia manna-influence the recruitment and survival of associated invertebrates. Field experiments revealed that effects of the 2 species on recruitment processes were generally distinct and additive. S. glomerata recruitment was enhanced in the presence of oysters but unaffected by algal biomass. Barnacle recruitment, however, decreased with oyster or algal habitat biomass. The efficacy of secondary foundation species in ameliorating predator-prey interactions was dependent on body size relative to the refuge space provided by the foundation species. The naticid gastropod Conuber sordidum was sufficiently small to penetrate habitats, such that neither foundation species influenced its predation on the gastropod Batillaria australis. By contrast, each foundation species reduced predation of the toadfish Tetractenos hamiltoni on small crabs, Paragrapsus laevis, which were able to seek refuge in the interstitial space provided by either habitat. Differential effects of co-occurring secondary foundation species on key ecological processes (recruitment and predation) will result in their facilitation of distinct ecological communities. Hence, models of community assembly should consider interactions among primary and secondary foundation species, and of co-occurring secondary foundation species, which may occur in complex networks.","[Vozzo, Maria L.; Bishop, Melanie J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Vozzo, Maria L.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia","Vozzo, ML (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.; Vozzo, ML (corresponding author), Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia.",maria.vozzo@mq.edu.au,,"Vozzo, Maria/0000-0002-3885-9908; Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500","Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University","This work would not have been possible without help of many field volunteers, especially V.

The predatory devil crayfish, Cambarus diogenes Girard functions as an ecosystem engineer constructing extensive burrow systems through aquatic habitats. Despite crayfish posing a serious predation threat, preliminary data indicate that the federally endangered Hines Emerald dragonfly larvae, Somatochlora hineana Williamson regularly inhabit crayfish burrows. During late summer, S. hineana larval habitat dries up; leaving crayfish burrows as some of the only wetted habitats. Thus, C. diogenes can affect S. hineana through both direct, negative and indirect positive effects. We examined the positive role of crayfish burrows as drought refuges, and the threat of predation by C. diogenes on S. hineana larvae. Monthly field sampling indicated that S. hineana use open channel areas in spring and early summer moving into burrow systems in mid summer when channel areas normally dry. Laboratory experiments and field observations confirmed that crayfish prey on S. hineana larvae. Adult crayfish were a larger predation threat than juvenile crayfish. Despite their negative predatory impact, removal of crayfish from burrows in the field did not enhance densities of S. hineana larvae. Although S. hineana may face the threat of predation in burrows, they face a greater risk of desiccation if they remain in the open channel. These results lead to the counterintuitive conclusion that the maintenance of a predator is important for conserving an endangered prey species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the formulation of MCT is mathematically clear, its application to empirical cases is still challenging, which precludes its adoption by a large range of ecologists and evolutionary biologists interested in broad questions related to community assembly and the maintenance of species diversity. We developedcxr, anrpackage that provides a complete toolbox for calculating species vital rates and interaction parameters, from which the user can obtain estimates of coexistence outcomes based on stabilizing niche differences and average fitness differences. Our aim is to offer a highly versatile package to accommodate different research needs. This means that the user can define population models, use different optimization algorithms and include the effect of external covariates on species interactions, which may include environmental variables (e.g. temperature, precipitation, salinity) and biotic controls (e.g. predation, pollination, mycorrhizae). To illustrate the functionality and versatility ofcxr, we provide a complete set of population dynamic models and a dataset from a highly diverse grassland community. By building bridges between MCT formulation and its implementation, we provide tools to obtain a deeper mechanistic understanding of how species interactions determine basic patterns such as species abundances and dominance, which are core information for many applied fields, such as conservation, restoration and invasion biology. Finally, the package is not limited taxonomically to any particular group. The application of tools derived from MCT to a wide range of different systems can create feedbacks between empirical and theoretical studies in a way that stimulates a better understanding of the processes maintaining biodiversity.","[Garcia-Callejas, David; Bartomeus, Ignasi] Estn Biol Donana, Seville, Spain; [Garcia-Callejas, David; Godoy, Oscar] Univ Cadiz, Inst Univ Invest Marina INMAR, Dept Biol, Puerto Real, Spain","Garcia-Callejas, D (corresponding author), Estn Biol Donana, Seville, Spain.; Garcia-Callejas, D (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Inst Univ Invest Marina INMAR, Dept Biol, Puerto Real, Spain.",david.garcia.callejas@gmail.com,"Godoy, Oscar/D-3976-2011; Garcia-Callejas, David/C-3779-2017","Godoy, Oscar/0000-0003-4988-6626; Garcia-Callejas, David/0000-0001-6982-476X; Bartomeus, Ignasi/0000-0001-7893-4389",,,,22,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

This is also true for intraguild predation (the killing and eating of potential competitors), where the size or ontogenetic stage of an individual determines whether it is the intraguild predator or the intraguild prey. Studying size- or stage-specific interactions is therefore important, but can be challenging in species with complex life histories. Here, we investigated predatory interactions of all feeding stages of the two predatory mite species Neoseiulus californicus and Phytoseiulus macropilis, both of which have complex life cycles, typical for predatory arthropods. Populations of these two species compete for two-spotted spider mites, their prey. We evaluated both the capacity to kill stages of the other predator species and the capacity to benefit from feeding on these stages, both prerequisites for the occurrence of intraguild predation. Ontogeny played a critical role in the occurrence of intraguild predation. Whereas the juveniles of P. macropilis developed from larva until adulthood when feeding on N. californicus eggs, interestingly, adult female P. macropilis did not feed on the smaller stages of the other species. We furthermore show that intraguild predation was reciprocal: both juveniles and adult females of N. californicus preyed on the smallest stages of P. macropilis. These results suggest that a proper analysis of the interactions between pairs of species involved in intraguild predation should start with an inventory of the interactions among all ontogenetic stages of these species.","[Fonseca, Morgana Maria; Pallini, Angelo; Lima, Eraldo] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Evolutionary & Populat Biol, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Evolutionary & Populat Biol, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",morganamaria.fonseca@gmail.com; pallini@ufv.br; eraldo.lima@ufv.br; arne.janssen@uva.nl,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/Z-3908-2019; Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/0000-0002-2135-8488",National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq-Brazil)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [151777/2013-6]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Foundation for Research Support of the State of Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG-Brazil); National Institute of Science and Technology (INCT-Brazil) Semiochemicals in Agriculture (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [465511/2014-7]; National Institute of Science and Technology (INCT-Brazil) Semiochemicals in Agriculture (FAPESP) [2014/50871-0]; FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [CBB-3000309]; Econtrole Pesquisa & Consultoria Ltda,"We thank Econtrole Pesquisa & Consultoria Ltda, Aline Francez and Igor Gomes for support with the rearing of arthropods and plants and the colleagues from the Laboratory of Acarology of the Federal University of Vicosa for suggestions on experimental design and discussion of the results.

Most studies examine relationships of newcomers with native species, but interactions among introduced species could also affect community shifts. As early ontogenetic stages are particularly vulnerable to biotic interactions, we explored direct and indirect interactions across early life-history stages in space-dominating marine invertebrates. We used introduced ascidians and both native and introduced mussels. To increase generality, we ran our experiments in 2 distant locations, one in the northern and one in the southern hemisphere (Mediterranean and South Africa). We found no sperm interference between the ascidians, nor were there interspecific effects on settlement or metamorphosis success. However, larvae of the ascidian species reacted to each other by shifting from aggregated to random settlement. Juvenile mussels consumed large numbers of ascidian larvae, though larvae that avoided mussel predation showed higher settlement success. Mussel species in the southern hemisphere locality (native Perna perna and introduced Mytilus galloprovincialis) consumed more ascidian larvae than mussels in the northern locality (native M. galloprovincialis), with a tendency for ascidian larvae to avoid settling close to mussels in the northern locality. We conclude that larval consumption by mussels affects the establishment of ascidians, but that the magnitude of this effect is context dependant. These results emphasize the importance of the composition of the receiving community in determining its susceptibility to invasion. Whether the species comprising this community are native or introduced is, however, less important than what manner of species they are.","[Ordonez, Victor; Pascual, Marta] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Genet, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Rius, Marc] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [McQuaid, Christopher D.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Pineda, M.

These enclosures allowed each species to experience environmental conditions within each lake without directly interacting with each other. In the four-species lake, two other sets of enclosures addressed the effects of intra- and interspecific competition. Changes in total biomass of enclosure stocks (from growth and mortality) indicated that in the absence of other species, perch did best in the lake containing the richest fish assemblage, intermediate in the two-species lake, and worst in the mudminnow-only lake. Mudminnow stocks similarly performed significantly better in the four-species lake than the mudminnow-only lake. These results suggest that the lakes' environmental conditions contribute to the patterns of presence and abundance of perch, but that interspecific interactions override a similar contribution for the mudminnow, which is regarded as a fugitive species. Perch performances were also sensitive to fish densities within enclosures, declining significantly when stocks were doubled, either by adding more perch or equal numbers of mudminnows.",,"PASZKOWSKI, CA (corresponding author), UNIV ALBERTA,DEPT ZOOL,EDMONTON T6G 2E9,ALBERTA,CANADA.",,"Tonn, William M/A-3765-2014","Tonn, William M/0000-0002-0509-3184",,,,19,1,1,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

However, it is relatively unknown how potential competitive interactions could be taking place. In many freshwater turtles, semiochemicals from different glands might facilitate species and sex recognition. We hypothesized that chemosensory detection of competitor species might affect space use and habitat selection by freshwater turtles. We analyzed whether T. scripta and M. leprosa turtles recognized chemical cues from male and female conspecifics and heterospecifics in water. We compared time spent by turtles in clean water pools vs. water pools containing the different chemical stimuli. Introduced T. scripta did not avoid nor prefer water pools with chemical stimuli of native M. leprosa terrapins, which might favor the expansion of the invasive species. In contrast, M. leprosa preferred water with chemical stimuli of conspecifics and avoided water with chemical cues of T. scripta, which suggests that chemical cues could be used by native M. leprosa to avoid water pools occupied by introduced T. scripta. We suggest that this avoidance behavior of native M. leprosa may be one of the causes that contribute to the observed displacement of their populations by invasive T. scripta.","[Polo-Cavia, Nuria; Lopez, Pilar; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Martin, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",Jose.Martin@mncn.csic.es,"Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014; , Nuria/L-5372-2014; Lopez, Pilar/K-6221-2014","Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; Lopez, Pilar/0000-0001-6577-1509",Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2005-00391/BOS]; El Ventorrillo'' C.S.I.C.,"We thank an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments, the Grupo de Rehabilitacion de la Fauna Autoctona y su Habitat'' ( GREFA) for providing sliders, and El Ventorrillo'' MNCN Field Station for use of their facilities.

This may happen via differential individual properties of prey animals (e.g. vigilance, escape) or via habitat effects making hunting by a predator easier and more rewarding in some habitats, or both. Furthermore, community dynamics may be influenced by predator mediated apparent competition, in which an increase in one prey type has negative effects on another prey type indirectly via the shared predator. We summarize the current knowledge from the field in a model predator-prey system consisting of sympatric boreal vole species and their common specialist predator and review field studies using predator manipulation and studies on the responses of individuals in the laboratory and in outdoor enclosures. The vole species studied represent different prey types that are thought to have different vulnerabilities. Our observations on the main resident specialist predator, the least weasel (Mustela nivalis nivalis L.), show that it hunts according to prey availability and suitability of the hunting habitat. Prey voles respond to the presence of the predator behaviorally in various ways to avoid predation. We conclude that even if the least weasel is a specialized predator of small rodents it acts like a generalist predator within the small rodent guild and may facilitate the coexistence of prey species via predator switching. This may lead to interspecific synchrony between prey populations, which has often been observed. We suggest that the processes determining the community impact of predator-prey interactions are driven by the behavioral arms race between the predator and the prey, together with the habitat-dependent density of prey and net gain for the predator.","[Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland","Sundell, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",janne.sundell@helsinki.fi,,,"Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [52045, 44887, 208478]","We are grateful to the Academy of Finland (projects 52045, 44887 and 208478) for funding our research.

The leeches, Erpobdella octoculata, Glossiphonia complattata and Helobdella stagnalis, and their prey were manipulated inside experimental enclosures, matched by controls, erected on the stony shore of an eutrophic, English lake. 2. Five separate manipulations were performed: the addition of tubificid oligochaetes, the addition of snails, the increase in numbers of G. complanata and H. stagnalis, the increase in numbers of E. octoculata, and the reduction in numbers of all three leech species. All invertebrates were sampled, using trays buried in the substratum, in early March, prior to leech reproduction, in July and in late October/early November when breeding had ceased. Leech manipulations were executed immediately after the first sampling of invertebrates, when food addition, at fortnightly intervals, also commenced. 3. The addition of tubificids resulted in significantly greater numbers and biomasses of E. octoculata and H. stagnalis in the experimental compared to the control sites in the autumn sample, i.e. after breeding. The same was true for G. complanata when snails were added. When the numbers of leeches were either decreased or increased, no significant differences in numbers or biomass of the manipulated species were obtained in the autumn. 4. Elevation or readjustment of leech numbers appeared to be achieved through changes in juvenile mortality and to a lesser extent through fecundity. 5. Current results, together with previous findings, provide evidence for food limitation, with a high mortality of recruited young (up to 98%) which is linked to food supply. There is also some evidence for interspecific competition for food, though the occurrence of food refuges, the temporal separation of breeding peaks, and differences in feeding behaviour, involving body size and foraging strategies, between the glossiphoniids reduce the intensity of interactions.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

First-stadium mantids, Tenodera sinensis, were added to replicated open-field plots in numbers corresponding to naturally occurring egg hatch density and allowed to remain for approximate to 2 mo. Sticky-trap dispersal barriers around both control and mantid-addition plots allowed us to monitor emigration of arthropods continuously during the experiment. Biomass of herbivores, carnivores, and plants, and abundances of arthropod taxa within plots were determined at the beginning, middle, and end of the experiment. The impact of mantids on the community was a top-down trophic cascade, beginning at the fourth trophic level and evident at each of the lower three levels. Mantids induced marked behavioral responses in other predators, but interference among predators did not prevent the trophic cascade. The most common predators, cursorial spiders, emigrated from mantid addition plots in significantly greater numbers than from controls. This behavioral response may have resulted from avoidance of predation or competition. Mantids decreased biomass of herbivorous arthropods through predation, and this decrease in turn increased biomass of plants. Therefore, these generalist predators were able to decrease herbivory enough to affect plant growth. This and other recent studies indicate that top-down effects can be important in structuring terrestrial communities. Ours is the first example of a top-down cascade by a generalist arthropod predator in a nonagricultural ecosystem and illustrates the importance of detecting behavioral responses in studies of trophic interactions.","UNIV DELAWARE,ECOL PROGRAM,DEPT BIOL,NEWARK,DE 19716; INDIANA UNIV PENN,DEPT BIOL,INDIANA,PA 15705","Moran, MD (corresponding author), WASHINGTON & LEE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,LEXINGTON,VA 24450, USA.",,"Rooney, Thomas/A-5410-2008","Rooney, Thomas/0000-0001-7412-3204",,,,54,115,115,1,44,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1996,77,7,,,,,2219,2227,,10.2307/2265715,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VM421,WOS:A1996VM42100025,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

The study focused on the early life stages, from the dispersal of seeds to the fate of seedlings at the end of the second growing season, of common old-field invaders, primarily Acer rubrum, Pinus strobus, Cornus racemosa, and Rhamnus cathartica. We investigated patterns of survivorship and causes of mortality during each of these life stages in microsites dominated by previously established herbs and in experimental openings in the herb canopy. Establishment of a tree or shrub seedling was much less likely from seeds landing among herbs than in openings. During the fall, seed predation by mice, especially under the cover of herbs (median of averages across all species = 6% in open, 85% under herbs), was an important process regulating the relative abundance and spatial distribution of seeds after dispersal. Seedling emergence rates were generally quite low, but for most species tended to be greater in the presence of perennial herbs (12%) and were lower under annuals and biennials (7%) and in bare soil (6%). For cohorts of seedlings followed for two growing seasons (Experiment 6A), some mortality occurred due to frost heaving (17% in open, 4% under herbs) and apparent heat stress or desiccation during the summer (5% in open, 0% under herbs); however, the largest source of mortality, especially under the herb canopy, was predation by rodents, especially meadow voles (6% in the open, 62% under herbs). Competition with herbs, especially aboveground competition, significantly reduced growth of woody seedlings. In spite of growth reduction in the presence of herbs, there was no significant relationship between seedling size and survivorship within any treatment, indicating that mortality could not be directly attributed to competition. For different species, and at different life stages, support was found for all three of the succession models of Connell and Slatyer (1977). The tolerance model was supported in some cases of seed predation (Experiment 2), seedling emergence (Experiments 4 and 5, in part), and seedling predation (Experiment 7). The facilitation model was supported in some cases by increased seedling emergence (Experiments 4 and 5, in part) and increased seedling survivorship in the presence of herbs during periods of environmental stress (Experiments 6A and 8). The inhibition model was also supported in some cases of decreased growth (Experiment 6B) and decreased survival of seeds and seedlings (Experiments 1, 3, 6A, and 8) in the presence of herbs. The lower survivorship under herbs was largely the result of seed and seedling predation, which were the two most important processes regulating tree and shrub colonization of old fields in this study. Reduced growth of later colonists due to competition with earlier colonists is considered direct inhibition, while increased mortality due to predation on later colonists caused by animals whose activity is necessarily associated with the presence of earlier colonists is considered indirect inhibition. Seed and seedling predation are potentially important mechanisms regulating succession and should be explicitly included in studies of succession.","CORNELL UNIV, ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA",,,,,,,,77,213,223,0,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

A faunal succession of organisms was observed on both fields. Grazers were the first to colonize the paddies after a dry period when pesticides were applied, followed by development into nymphs and by an increase in the abundance of the species after the application of fertilizers. At the end of the season when no pesticides or fertilizers were applied, the communities changed with the presence of adult predators as a result of an increase in prey. Insecticide application revealed specific taxa increase due to the lack of competition with the target organism. Macroinvertebrates tended to prefer infested field margins with aquatic, submerged vegetation, revealing a spatial distribution along the paddies. Two different sampling devices were used and proved necessary in documenting the macroinvertebrate communities (grab for benthic and hand-net for pelagic organisms).","Inst Ambiente, Lab Reference Ambiente, P-2611 Amadora, Portugal; Univ Evora, Water Lab Ctr Appl Ecol, P-7001 Evora, Portugal; Inst Super Agron SAPI, Dept Protect Plantas & Fitoecol, P-1349 Lisbon, Portugal","Leitao, S (corresponding author), Inst Ambiente, Lab Reference Ambiente, P-2611 Amadora, Portugal.",saraleitao@yahoo.com,,"Pinto, Paulo/0000-0002-5050-7956",,,,34,22,26,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

We used both experimental herbivore manipulations and observations of changes in vegetation cover to evaluate the longer-term impacts of small-mammal herbivores and granivores on woody plant invasion into old fields in New York State. Over a 5-yr period, we manipulated the density of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) within partial enclosures replicated at five study sites. Average vole activity in enclosures with high vole density was significantly greater than that in enclosures with low vole density. In contrast, activity of competitively inferior white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) was significantly greater within enclosures designated as low vole density. Colonization by tree seedlings, as well as shrubs and vines. was significantly greater in enclosures under the low vole density treatment. Further, tree seedling abundance was higher in shrub-dominated enclosures with low vole, but high mouse, activity. Five years of contrasting mouse and vole activity within adjacent enclosures revealed that seedling predation by voles had a greater net effect on changes in woody vegetation cover in old fields than did seed predation by mice, despite studies reporting higher rates of seed vs. seedling predation in these areas. We conclude that short-term measures of predation intensity may not accurately predict the longer-term effects of small-mammal herbivores on vegetation dynamics and suggest that voles may be a keystone herbivore in old-field succession.","Inst Ecol AC, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Manson, RH (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Km 2-5 Antigua Carretera Coatepec 351,Congregac, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",manson@ecologia.edu.mx,"Canham, Charles D/F-6161-2011; Manson, Robert Hunter/AAD-6443-2021; Manson, Robert H/Q-9015-2018","Canham, Charles D/0000-0001-8361-9148; Manson, Robert H/0000-0001-9732-8894; Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301",,,,65,86,89,0,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2001,82,12,,,,,3320,3329,,10.2307/2680155,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,503GY,WOS:000172791800005,,,,,2021-09-27,

This may allow communities to maintain functioning during a disturbance and may be particularly important when the perturbation is novel to the system, such as the establishment of an invasive species. We examined how dispersal of native species may influence crustacean zooplankton communities in freshwater lakes invaded by the invertebrate predator, Bythotrephes longananus. Using large enclosures, we experimentally tested the effect of dispersal on zooplankton community abundance, richness, and composition in (1) a community invaded by Bythotrephes, (2) the same community with the invader removed, and (3) a community that was never invaded. Dispersal increased zooplankton community abundance and richness; however, these effects were usually only significant in the invader-removed treatment: Dispersal tended to make the invader-removed communities more similar to never-invaded communities in abundance, richness, and composition. Dispersal had little effect, on zooplankton abundance in the invaded community; however, richness significantly increased, and the community composition changed to resemble a never-invaded community by the end of the experiment. Our results have implications for understanding the role of dispersal during transitory states in communities. Dispersal of native taxa may be particularly important during the period between the arrival and broad-scale establishment of Bythotrephes, as dispersal through space or time (i.e., from resting eggs) may rapidly increase zooplankton abundance when the invader is absent or in low abundances. Overall, our results suggest that communities with strong local predatory and competitive interactions may be closed to immigration from colonists, but that invasive species may alter the conditions under which species can establish. These results have implications for the interaction of native and invasive species across broad spatial scales, as regional dispersal of native taxa may forestall the local extirpation of native species. In particular, transient :phases that result from variable persistence of invaders within habitats or across a region may permit native colonists to successfully establish, and thus increase local and regional resistance to future disturbance.","[Strecker, Angela L.; Arnott, Shelley E.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Strecker, AL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",angelast@u.washington.edu,"Strecker, Angela/E-9430-2016","Strecker, Angela/0000-0001-9387-1654; Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Ontario Graduate Scholarship in Science and Technology; Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters; Queen's University,"We thank A.

Here we explore a positive feedback loop between the provisioning rate of habitat-forming branching corals and their associated fishes and show how interactions between two groups of fish-the planktivorous damselfish and predatory hawkfish-altered the feedback. A field experiment confirmed that skeletal growth of branching coral (genus Pocillopora) increased substantially with increasing numbers (biomass) of resident fishes, likely because they greatly increased the interstitial concentrations of nutrients. Because there is a positive relationship between colony size and number (biomass) of associated fishes (primarily damselfishes in the Family Pomacentridae), a structure-function feedback loop exists in which increasing numbers of damselfish enhance coral growth and larger corals host greater abundances (and species richness) of fish. However, interactions between damselfishes and arc-eye hawkfish, Paracirrhites arcatus, a largely solitary resident, can disrupt this positive feedback loop. Field surveys revealed a marked pattern of fish occupancy related to coral size: Pocillopora colonies of sufficient size to host fish (> 40 cm circumference) had either groups of damselfish or an arc-eye hawkfish; only larger colonies (> 75 cm) were occupied by both the damselfish and hawkfish. Subsequent short- and long-term experiments revealed that on intermediate-sized Pocillopora colonies, arc-eye hawkfish prevented the establishment of damselfish by suppressing their recruitment. The demographic consequences to the host coral were substantial; in a 1-year-long experiment, intermediate-size Pocillopora occupied by hawkfish grew at half the rate of corals that hosted groups of damselfish. These findings indicate that: (1) species which occupy a biogenic habitat can enhance the provisioning rate of their habitat; (2) such positive feedbacks between community structure and ecosystem function can be disrupted by a strong interactor; (3) even substantial consequences on ecosystem processes that arise can be difficult to discern.","[Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.; Brooks, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Holbrook, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",holbrook@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 04-17412, OCE 10-26851]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation","We thank K.

By causing large reductions in native prey, invasive predators may modify native species interactions. I conducted a manipulative field experiment in The Bahamas to investigate the possibility that the invasive Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) alters competition between planktivorous fairy and blackcap basslets (Gramma loreto and Gramma melacara, respectively). Competition between these coral-reef fishes is known to have symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species, whereby the feeding positions under reef ledges and growth rates of these individuals are hindered. Following baseline censuses of local populations of competing basslets, I simultaneously manipulated the abundance of lionfish on entire reefs, and the abundance of basslets in local populations under isolated ledges within each reef, resulting in three treatments: unmanipulated control populations of both basslets, reduced abundance of fairy basslet, and reduced abundance of blackcap basslet. For eight weeks, I measured the change in biomass and feeding position of 2-5cm size classes of each basslet species and calculated the growth rates of similar to 2cm individuals using a standard mark-and-recapture method. Experimental populations were filmed at dusk using automated video cameras to quantify the behavior of lionfish overlapping with basslets. Video playback revealed lionfish hunted across all ledge positions, regardless of which basslet species were present, yet lionfish differentially reduced the biomass of only juvenile (2cm) fairy basslet. Predation reduced the effects of interspecific competition on juvenile blackcap basslet as evidenced by corresponding shifts in feeding position toward coveted front edges of ledges and increases in growth rates that were comparable to the response of these fish in populations where competition was experimentally reduced. Thus, an invasive marine predator altered the outcome of interspecific competition via differential predation, which tipped the balance of competition between native prey species from symmetrical to asymmetrical effects on juveniles. This study reveals a newly demonstrated context in which predation can indirectly facilitate prey, further broadening our understanding of the interactive effects of predation and competition in the context of invasive species.","[Kindinger, Tye L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Kindinger, Tye L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.; Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",tkinding@ucsc.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-08-51162, OCE-12-33027]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This study is a chapter from the author's doctoral dissertation (committee: M.

Less known is whether guilds of shared seed predators can induce a negative dependence of recruitment on the density of different species of the same plant functional group. We studied 54 plots in tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, with contrasting mature tree densities of three coexisting large seeded tree species with shared seed predators. Levels of seed predation were far better explained by incorporating seed densities of all three focal species than by conspecific seed density alone. Both positive and negative density dependencies were observed for different species combinations. Thus, indirect interactions via shared seed predators can either promote or reduce the coexistence of different plant functional groups in tropical forest.","[Garzon-Lopez, Carol X.; Ballesteros-Mejia, Liliana; Olff, Han; Jansen, Patrick A.] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Garzon-Lopez, Carol X.] Fdn Edmund Mach, GIS & Remote Sensing Unit, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Biodivers & Mol Ecol, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy; [Ballesteros-Mejia, Liliana] Univ Fed Goias UFG, Lab Genet & Biodiversidade, ICB, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Ordonez, Alejandro] Aarhus Univ, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Dept Biosci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Bohlman, Stephanie A.; Jansen, Patrick A.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 084303092, Panama; [Bohlman, Stephanie A.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Jansen, Patrick A.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Garzon-Lopez, CX (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Box 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands.",c.x.garzon@gmail.com,"Ordonez, Alejandro/ABH-2824-2020; Garzon-Lopez, Carol/G-6251-2014; Ballesteros-Mejia, Liliana/AAC-4971-2019; Olff, Han/A-8516-2008; Jansen, Patrick/G-2545-2015","Ordonez, Alejandro/0000-0003-2873-4551; Garzon-Lopez, Carol/0000-0002-4099-2740; Ballesteros-Mejia, Liliana/0000-0003-2790-8652; Olff, Han/0000-0003-2154-3576; Jansen, Patrick/0000-0002-4660-0314",Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Ubbo Emmius Scholarship programme; University of Groningen; EU BON (Building the European Biodiversity Observation Network) project; European UnionEuropean Commission [308454]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [ERC-2012-StG-310886-HISTFUNC],"We thank Erik Vasquez, Helen Esser and Eduardo Medina for their help in the field and laboratory; and Egbert Leigh, Robert Holt and two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments.

The diversity and density of predators, and the way in which they interact, determine whether and how the effects of different predators on prey combine. Intraguild predation, for instance, was observed to dampen the effects of predators on prey in many ecosystems. In marine systems, species at high trophic levels are particularly susceptible to extinction (at least functionally). The loss of such species, which is mainly attributed to human activities (mostly fishing), is presently decreasing the diversity of marine predators in many areas of the world. Experimental studies that manipulate predator diversity and investigate the effects of this on strongly interactive consumers (i.e. those potentially capable of causing community-wide effects) in marine systems are scant, especially in the rocky sublittoral. I established an experiment that utilised cage enclosures to test whether the diversity and density of fish predators (two sea breams and two wrasses) would affect predation upon juvenile and adult sea urchins, the most important grazers in Mediterranean sublittoral rocky reefs. Changes in species identity (with sea breams producing major effects) and density of predators affected predation upon sea urchins more than changes in species richness per se. Predation upon adult sea urchins decreased in the presence of multiple predators, probably due to interference competition between sea breams and wrasses. This study suggests that factors that influence both fish predator diversity and density in Mediterranean rocky reefs (e.g. fishing and climate change) may have the potential to affect the predators' ability to control sea urchin population density, with possible repercussions for the whole benthic community structure.","Univ Salento, Lab Zool & Marine Biol, DiSTeBA, I-73100 Lecce, Italy","Guidetti, P (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Lab Zool & Marine Biol, DiSTeBA, Via Prov Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",paolo.guidetti@unile.it,,"Guidetti, Paolo/0000-0002-7983-8775",,,,59,30,30,0,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2007,154,3,,,,,513,520,,10.1007/s00442-007-0845-5,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,234FU,WOS:000251146900008,17763873,,,,2021-09-27,

Previous Studies have focused on systems with at least two different predator species and one prey species. However, most predators undergo extreme ontological changes in phenotype Such that interactions between different-sized cohorts of a predator and its prey could lead to nonadditive effects in systems with only two species. This may be important since different-sized individuals of the same species can differ more in their ecology than similar-sized individuals of different species. This study examined trait-mediated indirect effects in a two-species system including a cannibalistic predator with different-sized cohorts and its prey. I tested for these effects using larvae of two stream salamanders, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (predator) and Eurycea cirrigera (prey), by altering the densities and combinations of predator size classes in experimental streams. Results showed that the presence of large individuals can significantly reduce the impact of density changes of smaller conspecifics oil prey survival through nonlethal means. In the absence of large conspecifics, ail increase in the relative frequency of small predators significantly increased predation rates, thereby reducing prey Survival. However, with large conspecifics present, increasing the density of small predators did not decrease prey survival, resulting in a 14.3% lower prey mortality than predicted from the independent effects of both predator size classes. Small predators changed their microhabitat use in the presence of larger conspecifics. Prey individuals reduced activity in response to large predators but did not respond to small predators. Both predators reduced prey growth. These results demonstrate that the impact of a predator can be significantly altered by two different types of trait-mediated indirect effects in two-species systems: between different sized cohorts and between different cohorts and prey.

Despite potential benefits for fisheries, little is known about how introduced species interact with native communities at the food-web level, or impact energy transfer dynamics and accumulation of contaminants in lake ecosystems. Here, we explored the trophic structure of a large, oligotrophic subarctic lake and assessed the trophic niche use and potential ecosystem-wide consequences of two introduced salmonid species: piscivorous lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and zooplanktivorous vendace (Coregonus albula). We used a combination of diet, stable isotope and total mercury concentration data to test the hypotheses that the introduced fishes: (i) show partial niche overlap with the native fish community; (ii) increase total isotopic food-web size and dietary linkages by increasing the diversity of niches present within the system, in comparison to analyses where only the native species were considered; and (iii) have differing mercury bioaccumulation rates from native species due to differences in trophic ecology and habitat preferences, being higher in pelagicthan in littoral species. Trophic interactions between the introduced and native species were extensive, with evidence of reciprocal predation, resource competition and possible competitive exclusion apparent. Despite partial niche overlap with native species, the inclusion of introduced species in our analysis increased both total isotopic niche space and the number of dietary linkages present in the food web. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that introduced vendace may have led to a shift in system-wide reliance on pelagically derived energy, whereas generalist foraging by piscivorous lake trout may have further integrated littoral and pelagic food-web compartments. Mercury bioaccumulation rates were highly species-specific and varied among habitats, but were generally higher in the pelagic food-web compartment. However, contrary to expectations, vendace had lower mercury levels than native pelagic species, potentially reducing the extent of biomagnification within the lake. Our study demonstrates how introduced fishes may elicit complex and unpredictable responses in food-web structure and ecosystem function, and thus complicate contaminant bioaccumulation and transfer processes within freshwater ecosystems.","[Thomas, Stephen M.; Malinen, Tommi; Lodenius, Martin; Kahilainen, Kimmo K.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Kiljunen, Mikko; Eloranta, Antti P.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Eloranta, Antti P.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Dept Aquat Ecol, Tungasletta 2, N-7004 Trondheim, Norway; [Amundsen, Per-Arne] Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway","Thomas, SM (corresponding author), EAWAG Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Biogeochem, Dept Fish Ecol & Evolut, Seestr 79, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland.",stephen.thomas@eawag.ch,"Eloranta, Antti Pekka/AAA-1426-2020","Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135; Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [140903, 1268566]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission [A30205]; Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry","We thank T.

Using a field experiment, we tested the hypothesis that congeneric butterfly species interact indirectly through a shared pupal parasitoid. We predicted that symmetrical apparent competition would lead to high parasitism of both species, and the effect would increase with regional butterfly abundance. Instead, parasitism of one host, Melitaea cinxia, was reduced in the presence of the second host, M. athalia. Parasitism of M. athalia did not differ whether or not M. cinxia was present. This pattern did not vary with regional butterfly abundance, though overall rate of parasitism did. Details of the experiment suggest that the apparent commensalism occurred because M. cinxia pupae are protected by silk tents whereas M. athalia are exposed, causing locally foraging parasitoids to favour the more accessible host where the two are present together. The local short-term apparent commensalism favouring M. cinxia opposes the landscape scale trend, in which parasitism increases where butterfly density is high. The outcome of this study illustrates short-term apparent commensalism, that host suitability can depend on relative accessibility, and that indirect interactions occurring at different scales may be in opposition.","[van Nouhuys, Saskya] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [van Nouhuys, Saskya; Kraft, Thomas S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","van Nouhuys, S (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Saskya@cornell.edu,"van Nouhuys, Saskya/C-6813-2013","van Nouhuys, Saskya/0000-0003-2206-1368; Kraft, Thomas/0000-0002-0634-9233","Mellon Foundation; Academic Academy of Finland [213547, 130958]","We thank L.

Facilitation is recorded from diverse plant-insect interactions, including pollination and herbivory. 2. The significance of facilitation resulting from the behavior of males of multiple fig wasp species inside figs was investigated. Female fig wasps emerge from natal figs via exit holes dug by males, especially male pollinators. When no males are present, the females struggle to escape and may die. 3. Ficus microcarpa L. is a widely-established invasive fig tree from Southeast Asia. Its pollinator is absent in South Africa, so the tree cannot reproduce, but two Asian non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFW) Walkerella microcarpae and Odontofroggatia galili occupy its figs. Abundance patterns of the two NPFW and the proportion of male-free figs in South Africa, Spain (where the pollinator is introduced), and in China, where the native fig wasp community is diverse, were compared to determine the consequences of reduced species richness for insect survival. 4. Female fig wasps in male-free figs were found to be trapped, and small clutch sizes contributed to the absence of males in both species. The presence of pollinators in Spain allowed most NPFW to develop in figs containing males. Far more male-free figs were present in South Africa, elevating mortality rates among female NPFW. Facilitation of female release by males of other NPFW species nonetheless benefitted the rarer species. 5. Selection pressures in South Africa currently favour greater aggregation of NPFW offspring and/or less female biased sex ratios.","[Wang, Rong; Harper, Maximilian; Quinnell, Rupert J.; Compton, Stephen G.] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wang, Rong] E China Normal Univ, Tiantong Natl Stn Forest Ecosyst, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Segar, Simon T.] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Yu, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Compton, Stephen G.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","Compton, SG (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.g.a.compton@leeds.ac.uk,"Segar, Simon/K-6783-2015; Barwell, Louise J J/F-3309-2019","Barwell, Louise J J/0000-0002-1643-1046; Wang, Rong/0000-0003-4652-2149",China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council; project Postdoc USB through EU Education for Competitiveness Operational Programme [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0006]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Czech State Budget,"We thank Dr Simon van Noort for helpful advice on fig wasps in South Africa.

These interactions can have important implications on the invasion process, potentially determining whether NIS become widespread and abundant, survive in small numbers, or fail to establish and disappear. Although many studies have naturally focused on the interactions between NIS and native species to examine their effects and the biological resistance of the recipient community to invasion, few have examined the effects that NIS have on each other. In some cases, interactions can facilitate the invasion process of one or both species (i.e., invasional meltdowns), but competition or predation can lead to negative interactions as well. The introduction of the vase tunicate, Ciona intestinalis, in Prince Edward Island (Canada) has harmed mussel aquaculture via heavy biofouling of equipment and mussels. Through both a broad-scale survey and small-scale field experiments, we show that Ciona recruitment is drastically reduced by caprellid amphipods, including the NIS Caprella mutica. This study provides an exciting example of how established invasive species can negatively impact the recruitment of a secondary invader, highlighting the potential for non-additive effects of multiple invasions.","[Collin, Samuel B.; Johnson, Ladd E.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","Collin, SB (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, 1045 Av Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",samuel.collin.1@ulaval.ca; ladd.johnson@bio.ulaval.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada through the Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Fisheries and Oceans Canada; Quebec-Ocean; Departement de biologie of Universite Laval,"We thank Chris McKindsey, Brian Leung and Paul Edwards for their constructive comments and thank Valerie Nearing and Maura Forrest for their assistance in the field.

Understanding these interactions is thus essential for correctly predicting species' responses to climate change. We focussed on an avian forest guild of four hole-nesting species with differing sensitivities to climate that show a range of well-understood reciprocal interactions, including facilitation, competition and predation. We modelled the potential distributions of black woodpecker and boreal, tawny and Ural owl, and tested whether the spatial patterns of the more widespread species (excluding Ural owl) were shaped by interspecific interactions. We then modelled the potential future distributions of all four species, evaluating how the predicted changes will alter the overlap between the species' ranges, and hence the spatial outcomes of interactions. Forest cover/type and climate were important determinants of habitat suitability for all species. Field data analysed with N-mixture models revealed effects of interspecific interactions on current species abundance, especially in boreal owl (positive effects of black woodpecker, negative effects of tawny owl). Climate change will impact the assemblage both at species and guild levels, as the potential area of range overlap, relevant for species interactions, will change in both proportion and extent in the future. Boreal owl, the most climate-sensitive species in the guild, will retreat, and the range overlap with its main predator, tawny owl, will increase in the remaining suitable area: climate change will thus impact on boreal owl both directly and indirectly. Climate change will cause the geographical alteration or disruption of species interaction networks, with different consequences for the species belonging to the guild and a likely spatial increase of competition and/or intraguild predation. Our work shows significant interactions and important potential changes in the overlap of areas suitable for the interacting species, which reinforce the importance of including relevant biotic interactions in predictive climate change models for increasing forecast accuracy.","[Brambilla, Mattia; Scridel, Davide; Iemma, Aaron; Pedrini, Paolo; Assandri, Giacomo] Museo Sci, Sez Zool Vertebrati, Trento, Italy; [Brambilla, Mattia; Bazzi, Gaia; Ilahiane, Luca] Fdn Lombardia Ambiente, Settore Biodiversita & Aree Protette, Seveso, MB, Italy; [Scridel, Davide; Bogliani, Giuseppe; Assandri, Giacomo] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Terra & Ambiente, Pavia, Italy; [Bassi, Enrico] Parco Nazl Stelvio, Bormio, SO, Italy; [Bionda, Radames] Parco Nat Alpe Veglia & Devero Alta Valle Antrona, Varzo, Italy; [Genero, Fulvio] Riserva Nat Reg Lago Cornino, Cornino, UD, Italy; [Teufelbauer, Norbert] BirdLife Austria, Vienna, Austria; [Vrezec, Al] Natl Inst Biol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kmecl, Primoz; Mihelic, Tomaz] DOPPS BirdLife Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Schmid, Hans] Schweiz Vogelwarte, Sempach, Switzerland; [Pontarini, Renato] Progetto Lince Italia, Tarvisio, UD, Italy; [Braunisch, Veronika; Arlettaz, Raphael] Univ Bern, Div Conservat Biol, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Bern, Switzerland; [Chamberlain, Dan] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Biol Sistemi, Turin, Italy","Brambilla, M (corresponding author), Museo Sci, Sez Zool Vertebrati, Trento, Italy.",brambilla.mattia@gmail.com,"Scridel, Davide/Q-9430-2019; Bazzi, Gaia/AAP-9154-2020; Braunisch, Veronika/AAH-8260-2020; Assandri, Giacomo/H-6962-2019; Chamberlain, Dan/K-1809-2015","Scridel, Davide/0000-0003-3849-1178; Braunisch, Veronika/0000-0001-7035-4662; Assandri, Giacomo/0000-0001-5161-5353; Brambilla, Mattia/0000-0002-7643-4652; Chamberlain, Dan/0000-0002-5381-2024; BAZZI, GAIA/0000-0002-7220-6054",RDP Trento province; Parco Naturale Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino; Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P1-0255],"RDP Trento province; Parco Naturale Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino; Slovenian Research Agency, Grant/Award Number: P1-0255",,94,8,9,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Infra-guild predation (IGP) has been suggested as the main mechanism causing such species displacements. This study elucidates a mechanism for species displacement that is based on competition for shelter, viz, species excluding each other from a shelter place. Preferences of Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus roeselii for shelter space were studied in laboratory experiments. In contrast with night conditions both species showed a strong preference for shelter sites under daytime conditions so that all experiments were carried out under permanent light conditions. Single individuals of D. villosus sheltered more than those of G. roeselii. Intraspecific competition experiments with different size classes and sexes showed that in contrast with D. villosus, the size class had a significant effect on the mean sheltering proportion of individuals of G. roeselii. When both species were brought together in a basin with a shelter site to test interspecific competition, individuals of G. roeselii were actively pushed out of their shelters within 24 h, while D. villosus showed no change in shelter. This led to a significantly increased predation risk for G. roeselii, which was confirmed in an experiment in which a benthic fish was added. IGP only manifested itself after 48h, indicating that competition for shelter preceded IGP When shelter opportunities are in short supply, shelter exclusion may be one of the initial mechanisms for gammarid species displacements.","[de Gelder, S.; van der Velde, G.; Leung, N.; Hendriks, H.

We extend a predator-prey model previously parameterized for voles and weasels to two prey species, a 'Microrus' (field vole) type which is competitively superior to but more vulnerable to predation than a 'Clethrionomys' (bank vole) type. 2. The model explains four patterns in the dynamics of multispecies rodent assemblages in Fennoscandia: a predictable shift in the relative abundances of different prey species during one multiannual population cycle; long-term (supracyclic) variation in relative prey abundances; an association between the amplitude of population oscillations and the type of the numerically dominant prey species; and increasing rodent species number with increasing latitude, 3. The model results illustrate the complex and often unexpected behaviour of strongly connected multispecies assemblages, of which the Fennoscandian rodent-predator community is a prime example. 4. Since the mid 1980s, rodent oscillations in many, though not all, parts of northern Fennoscandia have become distinctly less regular (non-cyclic), a change which is reflected in the entire animal community linked to the keystone species. the arvicoline rodents, We demonstrate that such long-term changes in the amplitude and regularity of rodent oscillations are not unexpected in multispecies prey-predator assemblages.","FINNISH FOREST RES INST, DEPT FOREST ECOL, SF-01301 VANTAA, FINLAND","Hanski, I (corresponding author), UNIV HELSINKI, DEPT SYSTEMAT & ECOL, DIV POPULAT BIOL, POB 17, ARKADIANKATU 7, SF-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND.",,,,,,,84,160,164,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Foraging stations, containing equal quantities of each species, were randomly placed in each of the cover types. In addition, nutrient composition and total energy were measured. Fruit consumption was nonrandom based on compositional analysis (P < 0.05). Honeysuckle was consumed over native staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina); otherwise, it was consumed less than all natives. Honeysuckle fruits had significantly less lipids (0.67%) than all natives (P < 0.05), and one of the lowest protein contents (0.66%). Total energy was important in distinguishing the highest selected fruits: black cherry (Prunus serotina; 0.45 kcal) and common dewberry (Rubus fiagellaris; 0.36 kcal). Selection of high-nutrient native fruits over those of honeysuckle may confer additional competitive advantages to the seeds of this invasive shrub. In this way, white-footed mice may contribute to the establishment of Morrow's honeysuckle in multiple cover types.","[Rose, Charnee L.; Selego, Stephen M.; Anderson, James T.] W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Wildlife & Fisheries Resources Program, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Turk, Philip J.] W Virginia Univ, Dept Stat, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Rose, CL (corresponding author), W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Wildlife & Fisheries Resources Program, POB 6125,Percival Hall, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",charnee.rose@yahoo.corn,,,National Park Service; West Virginia University Environmental Research Center,"Funding was provided by the National Park Service and the West Virginia University Environmental Research Center.

In recent studies, habitat traits have emerged as stronger predictors of species occupancy, abundance, richness and diversity than competition. However, in many cases, it remains unclear whether habitat also mediates processes more subtle than competitive exclusion, such as growth, or whether intra- and interspecific interactions among individuals of different species may be better predictors of size. 2. To test whether habitat traits are a stronger predictor of abundance and body size than intra- and interspecific interactions, we measured the density and body size of three species of larval salamanders in 192 ponds across a landscape. 3. We found that the density of larvae was best predicted by models that included habitat features, while models incorporating interactions among individuals of different species best explained the body size of larvae. Additionally, we found a positive relationship between focal species density and congener density, while focal species body size was negatively related to congener density. 4. We posit that salamander larvae may not experience competitive exclusion and thus reduced densities, but instead compensate for increased competition behaviourally (e.g. reduced foraging), resulting in decreased growth. The discrepancy between larval density and body size, a strong predictor of fitness in this system, also highlights a potential shortcoming in using density or abundance as a metric of habitat quality or population health.","[Ousterhout, Brittany H.; Anderson, Thomas L.; Drake, Dana L.; Peterman, William E.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Peterman, William E.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Ousterhout, BH (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 110 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",BOusterhout@gmail.com,"Peterman, William/H-7809-2013","Peterman, William/0000-0001-5229-9268; Ousterhout, Brittany/0000-0001-5303-515X",NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Life Sciences Fellowship; Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [SERDP RC-2155],"We thank J.

A key step in this process is identifying which details are relevant for predicting dynamics. Currently. this remains a limiting step in development of analytical theory because experimental field ecology, which provides the key empirical insight, and theoretical ecology, which translates empirical knowledge into analytical theory, remain weakly linked. I illustrate how an individual-based computational model of species interactions is a useful way to bridge the gulf between empirical research and theory development. I built a computational model that reproduced key natural history and biological detail of an old-field interaction web composed of a predator species, a herbivore species and two plant groups that had been the subject of extensive previous field research. I examined, using simulation experiments, how individual behavior of herbivores in response to changing resource and predator abundance scaled to long-term population-level and community-level dynamics. The simulation experiments revealed that the long-term community dynamics could be highly predictable because of two counterintuitive reasons. First, seasonality was a strong forcing variable on the system that removed the possibility of serial dependence in population abundance over time. Second, because of seasonality, short-term behavioral responses of herbivores played a much stronger role in shaping community structure than longer-term processes such as density responses. So, simply knowing the short-term responses of herbivores at the evolutionary ecological level was sufficient to forecast the long-term outcome of experimental manipulations. This study shows that an individual-based model, once it is calibrated to the real-world held system, can provide key insight into the biological detail that analytical models should include to predict long-term dynamics.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Schmitz, OJ (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",oswald.schmitz@yale.edu,,,,,,42,42,43,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2000,89,3,,,,,471,484,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.890306.x,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,318PR,WOS:000087293400006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Spodoptera frugiperda is in the same feeding guild as the indigenous species Ostrinia furnacalis, with both pests attacking maize plant tissues such as whorls and tassels. In this study, the interaction of these species was assessed under laboratory and field conditions by examining the survival and predation rate of larvae in maize whorls and tassels. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions of larvae were assessed to characterize movements in arenas in the presence and absence of food. When S. frugiperda and O. furnacalis were present at an equal ratio, S. frugiperda prevailed over O. furnacalis with a high survival rate (over 90%) and predation rate of O. furnacalis (over 40%) under most scenarios in both laboratory and field conditions. When both species occurred at different ratios in the field, S. frugiperda had on average almost 16 times the number of survivors as O. furnacalis on whorls, and 8.3 times the number on tassels, highlighting a substantial advantage in these environments. Spodoptera frugiperda larvae undertook a low frequency of lethal attacks (strikes) and showed a higher incidence of defensive movements compared to O. furnacalis. A field survey showed that S. frugiperda larvae can colonize vegetative plant stages in maize, but it remains to be seen if competitive interactions can be linked to population dynamics of both species though they are expected to favor S. frugiperda.","[Zhao, Jing; Jiang, Yiping; Xiao, Liubin; Tan, Yongan; Bai, Lixin] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jing] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Food Qual & Safety Jiangsu Prov, State Key Lab Breeding Base, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Hoffmann, Ary] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Bio21 Inst, Pest & Environm Adaptat Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zhou, Changyong] Huai Yin Inst Agr Sci Xuhuai Regionin Jiangsu, Huaian, Peoples R China","Xiao, LB (corresponding author), Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",xlb@jaas.ac.cn,,,Chinese Agricultural Research System of MOF and MARA [CARS-15-18]; Foundation project of Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences [CX19 (2004)]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31901889]; Integration research and demonstration of the technology of cotton fertilizer and pesticide reduction of China [2017YFD0201900],"This work was supported by Chinese Agricultural Research System of MOF and MARA (CARS-15-18), the Foundation project of Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CX19 (2004)), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31901889), the Integration research and demonstration of the technology of cotton fertilizer and pesticide reduction of China (2017YFD0201900).",,33,0,0,8,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

Previous work has shown that the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping niche differentiation can vary among populations, suggesting that the strength of niche differences among species should likewise vary geographically. Most tests of this idea compare different species in different locations, not the same species in different locations. Thus, it is unclear whether niche differences vary spatially because of variation in community composition or because populations of the same species experience differences in the strength of niche effects. To test this latter hypothesis, we used field experiments to manipulate the relative abundances of the same pair of Enallagma damselfly species at two lakes. Manipulating relative abundances allowed us to quantify the demographic signature of niche differences that could stabilize coexistence, because if species are niche differentiated, they should experience lower mortality in response to their shared fish predator, and higher growth in the face of resource competition, when rare. We found that both species experienced lower mortality when rare in one location but not the other. No differences in growth were detected, indicating that competition for prey resources may not be a key factor affecting coexistence. These results suggest the species are ecologically differentiated among populations in ways shaping survivorship in response to a shared predator, which should promote their coexistence. We discuss several factors that could contribute to the differences we observed, focusing on the ideas that either (1) niche differentiation between species evolves locally, or that (2) spatial variation in environmental factors affects the manifestation of species niche differences. We therefore argue that the problem of species coexistence' is not a problem of species, but rather is one of understanding if species' populations coexist. Such results imply a role for microevolutionary processes in structuring communities.","[Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, SCEN 601,850 W Dickson St, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Bried, Jason T.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Siepielski, AM (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, SCEN 601,850 W Dickson St, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",amsiepie@uark.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021; Bried, Jason/AAF-9492-2021","Bried, Jason/0000-0002-8659-9848","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1620046, 1748945]","We thank R.

We tested whether an invasive ecosystem engineer, the alga Caulerpa taxifolia, indirectly facilitated community diversity by modifying the behaviour of a native ecosystem engineer, the clam Anadara trapezia, in southeastern Australia. In this study, clams in Caulerpa-invaded sediments partially unburied themselves, extending >30% of their shell surface above the sediment, providing rare, hard substrata for colonization. Consequently, clams in Caulerpa had significantly higher diversity and abundance of epibiota compared with clams in unvegetated sediments. To isolate the role of clam burial depth from direct habitat influences or differential predation by habitat, we manipulated clam burial depth, predator exposure and habitat (Caulerpa or unvegetated) in an orthogonal experiment. Burial depth overwhelmingly influenced epibiont species richness and abundance, resulting in a behaviourally mediated facilitation cascade. That Caulerpa controls epibiont communities by altering Anadara burial depths illustrates that even subtle behavioural responses of one ecosystem engineer to another can drive extensive community-wide facilitation.","[Gribben, Paul E.] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Byers, James E.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Biol Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Byers, James E.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Zool, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Clements, Michael; McKenzie, Louise A.; Steinberg, Peter D.] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Clements, Michael; McKenzie, Louise A.; Steinberg, Peter D.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Wright, Jeffrey T.] Univ Tasmania, Australian Maritime Coll, Natl Ctr Marine Conservat & Resource Sustainabil, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia","Gribben, PE (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",paul.gribben@uts.edu.au,"Frankel, Victor/F-7943-2011; Wright, Jeffrey/J-7536-2014","Wright, Jeffrey/0000-0002-1085-4582; Gribben, Paul/0000-0003-2650-5501; Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287","University of Technology-Sydney; Institute for Conservation Biology, University of Wollongong; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society","We thank Dr David Warton for statistical advice.

For instance, introduced predators may directly affect some native species via predation, which may in turn have indirect consequences for other species that are released from competition. We explore this possibility in East Africa's Lake Victoria basin, where the introduction of the predatory Nile perch, Lates niloticus, in the 1950s and 60s contributed to the overall or local extinction of hundreds of native fish by the 1980s. We ask whether this dramatic change in assemblage composition has led to competitive release and niche expansion in Rastrineobola argentea, a resilient native cyprinid that has thrived in this highly perturbed ecosystem. To address this question, we compare the trophic ecology of R.argentea before (1966) and after (2011) the introduction of the Nile perch in Lake Victoria; and across eight satellite lakes that differ in their history of Nile perch invasion. Using this combination of spatial and temporal comparisons, we test for increases in dietary niche breadth (niche expansion) and changes in the level of individual specialisation of R.argentea in invaded versus uninvaded contexts. In our historical comparison, we find good evidence for dietary niche expansion and an increase in interindividual diet variation in R.argentea over time. Across lakes, however, strong bottom-up effects (i.e. variation in prey availability) appear to obscure any potential top-down effects of the Nile perch introduction on the trophic ecology of R.argentea. Overall, we find substantial temporal and spatial variation in the diet and niche breadth of R.argentea, but the underlying drivers remain uncertain, given the complexity of both anthropogenic and natural ecological changes in Lake Victoria over the past century. Understanding both the direct and indirect impacts of introduced species is challenging, but important for successful long-term management of human-altered ecosystems.","[Sharpe, Diana M.

These studies have found that increasing enemy diversity can strengthen, weaken, and not affect prey suppression, demonstrating that multi-enemy effects on prey are context-dependent. Here we ask how one factor, plant species identity, influences multi-enemy effects on prey. We focused on two plant species of agricultural importance, potato (Solanum tuberosum), and collards (Brassica oleracea L.). These species share a common herbivorous pest, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), but vary in structural and chemical traits that affect aphid reproductive rates and which may also influence inter-enemy interactions. In a large-scale field experiment, overall prey exploitation varied dramatically among the plant species, with enemies reducing aphid populations by similar to 94% on potatoes and similar to 62% on collards. Increasing enemy diversity similarly strengthened aphid suppression on both plants, however, and there was no evidence that plant species identity significantly altered the relationship between enemy diversity and prey suppression. Microcosm experiments suggested that, on both collards and potatoes, intraspecific competition among natural enemies exceeded interspecific competition. Enemy species showed consistent and significant differences in where they foraged on the plants, and enemies in the low-diversity treatment tended to spend less time foraging than enemies in the high-diversity treatment. These data suggest that increasing enemy diversity may strengthen aphid suppression because interspecific differences in where enemies forage on the plant allow for greater resource partitioning. Further, these functional benefits of diversity appear to be robust to changes in plant species identity.","[Straub, Cory S.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99163 USA","Straub, CS (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",straub@entomology.wisc.edu,,"Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102",,,,49,80,82,2,94,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2008,89,6,,,,,1605,1615,,10.1890/07-0657.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,310OZ,WOS:000256540300014,18589525,,,,2021-09-27,

Typhlodromus pyri (Phytoseiidae) was usually more important than Zetzellia mali (Stigmaeidae) in the direct reduction of the apple rust mite population growth rate. When both predators contributed to lowering apple rust mite growth, ?: pyri acted earlier in the season than did Z. mali. Predation by T. pyri was not affected by plant quality (nitrogen content or cultivar), but predation by Z. mall was enhanced by high nitrogen levels and was influenced by cultivar. There was little evidence of direct competition between Panonychus ulmi and apple rust mite in these orchards, possibly due to the low densities of P. ulmi. The indirect effects were generally smaller than the direct effects, but were occasionally important. Apparent competition between P. ulmi and apple rust mite was observed at times in some orchards, more often mediated by Z. mali than by T. pyri.

Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain diversity and to resolve what has become known as the paradox of the plankton. We propose a dichotomy among these mechanisms in order to enable empiricists to begin testing their relative importance. Specifically, the mechanisms can be categorized as being internally generated or as depending on forces external to the competitive community. Here we tested whether the internal competitive dynamics of a phytoplankton assemblage or externally generated resource variability (a disturbance) were more effective at maintaining species diversity over time. We also tested whether the species composition of assemblages was important in determining the persistence of species diversity. We employed controlled microcosm experiments in which we either imposed exogenous variability in nutrient availability via serial dilution or allowed the communities to remain completely undisturbed. We found that species diversity was maintained most effectively in undisturbed microcosms in which only internal dynamics regulated coexistence. We also found that the community composition of the assemblage significantly interacted with the disturbance regime in determining species diversity. This confirmed the importance of internal dynamics and community composition in maintaining species diversity.","[Narwani, Anita; Berthin, Julie; Mazumder, Asit] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Water & Aquat Sci Res Program, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada","Narwani, A (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Water & Aquat Sci Res Program, POB 3020,Stn CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.",anarwani@uvic.ca,,"Narwani, Anita/0000-0003-4561-0163",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) CGSMNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC USRANatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC DGNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC IRCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank A.

To quantify the strength of an interaction between two species, we must therefore use techniques that integrate these various responses into estimates of overall effect. Demographic models of populations provide such a framework. Here we develop a demographic model describing the life history of a hemimetabolous insect to evaluate the relative importance of predator effects on mortality and growth of damselflies (Enallagma boreale) in fishless ponds and mayflies (Baetis bicaudatus) in trout streams. Previous experiments have shown that dragonfly predators in fishless ponds inflict direct mortality and cause reduced growth rates in Enallagma damselflies. Parameterization of the demographic model from these data show, however, that only the direct mortality effects of dragonflies should significantly influence damselfly population dynamics. This is because damselfly size at emergence does not influence adult female fecundity, so the effects of dragonflies on damselfly larval growth do not influence adult fecundity. Likewise, both trout and stonefly predators inflict mortality on larval Baetis mayflies and cause decreases in growth rates. However, our demographic analyses indicate that the growth effects of both predators should dominate the population-dynamic effects on Baetis. This is because size at emergence translates directly into adult fecundity in mayflies. We also present data suggesting that developmental responses to changes in environmental conditions (e.g., predator abundances, resource availabilities) differ between species depending on these same life history parameters. The biological significance of lethal vs. sublethal predator impacts must be evaluated in a demographic framework to identify whether alterations in growth rate, and the timing of and size at metamorphosis, significantly influence population dynamics. The demographic model used for any particular organism must be tailored to its life history, but the various impacts of interactions with other species can all be integrated into estimates of projected population growth that can then be readily compared among species with different life histories.","Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

In greenhouse experiments using small clusters of plants containing pea aphids and/or potato leafhoppers, the predation rates on both pea aphids and potato leafhoppers were independent of the presence of the other species, indicating no indirect interactions. In greenhouse experiments using cages containing 48 plants, when aphids and leafhoppers were confined to separate plants among which nabids could move, pea aphids had a positive effect on the survival of potato leafhoppers from predation. The positive effect of aphids on leafhoppers occurred because nabids spent more time on plants harboring aphids, thereby drawing nabids away from plants containing leafhoppers. Finally, we measured the abundance of nabids in a large-scale experiment designed to manipulate the abundances of pea aphids and potato leafhoppers in alfalfa fields. Fields with high aphid density contained more nabids, thereby suggesting that pea aphids will have a negative indirect effect on potato leafhoppers by increasing the density of nabids within fields. Potato leafhoppers had no indirect effects on pea aphids at any scale. This study shows that indirect interactions between prey species may depend upon spatial scale, because the factors affecting a predator's diet choice on a small scale may differ from those factors affecting a predator's distribution at larger scales.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol & Crop Prod Sci, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Ostman, O (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol & Crop Prod Sci, POB 7043, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",orjan.ostman@evp.slu.se,"Ostman, Orjan/ABF-8714-2020; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008","Ostman, Orjan/0000-0002-1930-0148; Ives, Anthony/0000-0001-9375-9523",,,,45,31,32,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2003,102,3,,,,,505,514,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12422.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,715DP,WOS:000184955500006,,,,,2021-09-27,

When body size determines the outcome of competitive interactions between individuals, coexistence depends also on how resource use and the ability to compete for these resources change with body size. Testing coexistence theory in size-structured communities, therefore, requires disentangling the effects of size-dependent competitive abilities and niche shifts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the evolution of species- and size-dependent competitive asymmetries increased the likelihood of coexistence between interacting species. We experimentally estimated the effects of size-dependent competitive interactions on somatic growth rates of two interacting fish species, Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata and killifish Rivulus hartii. We controlled for the effects of size-dependent changes in the niche at two competitive settings representing the early (allopatric) and late (sympatric) evolutionary stages of a killifish-guppy community. We fitted the growth data to a model that incorporates species- and size-dependent competitive asymmetries to test whether changes in the competitive interactions across sizes increased the likelihood of species coexistence from allopatry to sympatry. We found that guppies are competitively superior to killifish but were less so in sympatric populations. The decrease in the effects of interspecific competition on the fitness of killifish and increase in the interspecific effect on guppies' fitness increased the likelihood that sympatric guppies and killifish will coexist. However, while the competitive asymmetries between the species changed consistently between allopatry and sympatry between drainages, the magnitude of the size-dependent competitive asymmetries varied between drainages. These results demonstrate the importance of integrating evolution and trait-based interactions into the research on how species coexist.","[Anaya-Rojas, Jaime M.; Blanchette, Allison; Framstead, Nick; Travis, Joseph] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Anaya-Rojas, Jaime M.] Univ Munster, Inst Evolut & Biodivers, Munster, Germany; [Bassar, Ronald D.] Williams Coll, Dept Biol, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Potter, Tomos] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Callahan, Shay] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Reznick, David] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Anaya-Rojas, JM (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Anaya-Rojas, JM (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Inst Evolut & Biodivers, Munster, Germany.",jaime.anaya-rojas@uni-muenster.de,"Potter, Tomos/AAF-8255-2020","Potter, Tomos/0000-0003-3201-6130; Anaya-Rojas, Jaime Mauricio/0000-0002-0688-3401",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1556884],"NSF, Grant/Award Number: 1556884",,52,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Biogeographical processes that influence speciation and extinction rates determine the size and composition of this regional species pool. Community ecologists are beginning to recognize the importance of these biogeographical processes in influencing diversity patterns among local communities, but the potential for local interactions to influence biogeographical processes, especially speciation, has been little considered. In this paper I discuss one mechanism by which variation in the strengths of local interactions can influence the potential for population differentiation and thus for influencing speciation rates in the allopatric model of speciation. When more than one selective agent acts on the phenotype, the shape of the overall fitness surface depends critically on the relative strengths of the various selective agents. If one selective agent, which imparts strong selection, acts in all populations of a species, population differentiation via adaptation to local ecological conditions or via differentiation of sexual systems is retarded because the overall fitness surface in all populations strongly resembles the shape of the strongest selective agent. Consequently, the potential for speciation is reduced. Alternatively, if selective agents in various populations impart relatively equitable strengths of selection, the potential for differences in the overall fitness surfaces among populations is enhanced, which will enhance the potential for population differentiation and thus speciation. Analogous results obtain when multiple selective agents impact genetically correlated characters. Because the strength of selection generated by a species interaction should increase with the strength of the interaction, and because fewer species can usually coexist when the strengths of interactions are greater, the number of coexisting species and the potential for speciation in component taxa may covary among communities. This analysis indicates that the relative strengths of interactions can be as important to diversification in communities as the number of niche dimensions along which differentiation can occur.",,"McPeek, MA (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Frankliniella occidentalis is significantly larger than F. bispinosa. Frankliniella bispinosa has greater mobility compared with F. occidentalis. When O. insidiosus was offered either F. bispinosa or F. occidentalis as prey in single species trials, there were no significant differences in the number of prey captured. However, O. insidiosus had significantly more encounters with F. bispinosa than with F. occidentalis. In arenas with equal numbers of both species, O. insidiosus encountered and captured F. occidentalis more than F. bispinosa. In large arenas with two pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L.), O. insidiosus preyed on more F. occidentalis than on F. bispinosa. These results indicate that O. insidiosus can prey on both thrips species, but that it preferentially captures F. occidentalis. The greater locomotion and movement of F. bispinosa, perhaps combined with its smaller size, allow it to evade predation by O. insidiosus better than F. occidentalis. Consequently, the observed preference of O. insidiosus for F. occidentalis is not exclusively a function of active selection by the predator but also could arise from inherent differences among prey. We propose this differential predation as a mechanism contributing to observed differences in the temporal dynamics of these species in pepper fields.","USDA ARS, CMAVE, Tallahassee, FL 32308 USA; Univ Florida, N Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Quincy, FL 32351 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Reitz, SR (corresponding author), USDA ARS, CMAVE, 6383 Mahan Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32308 USA.",sreitz@saa.ars.usda.gov,"Reitz, Stuart/B-7667-2008; Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019",,,,,57,35,45,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Here, two well-developed ecosystem models for the California Current on the West Coast of the USA were used to test the impacts on other parts of the ecosystem of harvesting euphausiids, forage fish, mackerel and mesopelagic fish such as myctophids. Depleting individual forage groups to levels that led to maximum sustainable yield of those groups may have both positive and negative effects on other species in the California Current. The most common impacts were on predators of forage groups, some of which showed declines of >20% under the scenarios that involved depletion of forage groups to 40% of unfished levels. Depletion of euphausiids and forage fish, which each comprise >10% of system biomass, had the largest impact on other species. Depleting euphausiids to 40% of unfished levels altered the abundance of 13-30% of the other functional groups by >20%; while depleting forage fish to 40% altered the abundance of 20-50% of the other functional groups by >20%. There are clear trade-offs between the harvest of forage groups and the ability of the California Current to sustain other trophic levels. Though higher trophic level species, such as groundfish, are often managed on the basis of reference points that can reduce biomass to below half of unfished levels, this level of forage species removal is likely to impact the abundance of other target species, protected species and the structure of the ecosystem.","[Kaplan, Isaac C.; Gray, Iris A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Brown, Christopher J.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia; [Fulton, Elizabeth A.; Smith, Anthony D.

The results indicate that intraguild predation by normally earlier-hatching T. sinensis can be an important factor in the early life history of T. angustipennis, but that interspecific competition is not a strong selective factor in developmental asynchrony between these two species.","UNIV DELAWARE,SCH LIFE SCI,ECOL PROGRAM,NEWARK,DE 19716; UNIV DELAWARE,DEPT ENTOMOL & APPL ECOL,NEWARK,DE 19716",,,,"Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102",,,,33,28,29,0,8,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1995,104,4,,,,,496,500,,10.1007/BF00341347,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TJ375,WOS:A1995TJ37500012,28307665,,,,2021-09-27,

Previously, caging small starfish for field experiments has failed because animals can escape through cage meshes and confounding effects may arise as the starfish can feed on organisms growing on the fences themselves, rather than the surface under investigation. Here, we investigated the efficiency of alternative barrier methods, such as antifouling paint and sticky barriers, for shorter-term experimental manipulation of the herbivorous starfish Parvulastra exigua. Laboratory and field manipulations tested the hypotheses that barriers are efficient in retaining starfish within plots and that the chemical repellent of the barriers does not affect the normal functioning of starfish. The results showed that the sticky barrier did not deter P. exigua, but antifouling paint retained greater numbers of individuals within barrier plots than in controls, with no short-term effects on starfish righting response.","[Martinez, Aline S.; Coleman, Ross A.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Coastal & Marine Ecosyst Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Martinez, Aline S.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Lab Ecol & Gestao Costeira, BR-11060001 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Martinez, AS (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Coastal & Marine Ecosyst Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.; Martinez, AS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Lab Ecol & Gestao Costeira, BR-11060001 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",asmartinez.br@gmail.com,"Martinez, Aline Sbizera/P-2964-2016","Martinez, Aline Sbizera/0000-0002-8644-5734",Endeavour (Commonwealth of Australia) [2914_2012]; CNPq (Programa Ciencias sem Fronteiras) [240918/2012-6],"A.

Past studies typically consider only pairwise interactions between preferred and less preferred seed species, whereas rangeland seedings are likely to contain more than 2 seed species, potentially leading to complex interactions. We examined how the relative proportion of seeds in a 3-species polyculture changes rodent seed selectivity (i.e., removal) and indirect interactions among seeds. We presented 2 rodent species, Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mice) and Perognathus perms (pocket mice), in arenas with 3-species seed mixtures that varied in the proportion of a highly preferred, moderately preferred, and least preferred seed species, based on preferences determined in this study. We then conducted a field experiment in a pocket mouse-dominated ecosystem with the same 3-species seed mixtures in both treated (reduced shrub and increased forb cover) and untreated shrubsteppe. In the arena experiment, we found that rodents removed more of the highly preferred seed when the proportions of all 3 seeds were equal. Moderately preferred seeds experienced increased removal when the least preferred seed was in highest proportion. Removal of the least preferred seed increased when the highly preferred seed was in highest proportion. In the field experiment, results were similar to those from the arena experiment and did not differ between treated and untreated shrubsteppe areas. Though our results suggest that 3-species mixtures induce complex interactions among seeds, managers applying these results to restoration efforts should carefully consider the rodent community present and the potential fate of removed seeds.","[Beard, Karen H.; Howe, Frank P.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Beard, Karen H.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Faulhaber, Craig A.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Ocala, FL 34471 USA; [Howe, Frank P.] Utah Div Wildlife Resources, Salt Lake City, UT 84114 USA; [Edwards, Thomas C., Jr.] Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Beard, KH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",karen.beard@usu.edu,"Beard, Karen/B-7177-2011","Beard, Karen/0000-0003-4997-2495",Utah Division of Wildlife Resources; Utah Department of Natural Resources-Endangered Species Mitigation Fund; Natural Resources Conservation Service; Quinney Foundation; United States Geological Service; Utah Division of Wildlife Resources Great Basin Research Center via Pittman-Robertson Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Grant [W-82-R]; BLM; USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Rich County Coordinated Resource Management Group,"Research was funded in part by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, the Utah Department of Natural Resources-Endangered Species Mitigation Fund, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Quinney Foundation, and the United States Geological Service.

Here, the effects of the interaction between American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) and decapod crayfish on native amphibians have been investigated. Introduced American bullfrog populations were studied at two sites in central Italy (Rome, Latium), with their selection based on the presence or absence of the alien Procambarus clarkii. The pattern emerging from the fieldwork was then verified by a worldwide literature review on the trophic niche of the American bullfrog. Both field surveys and global diet analysis showed that the abundance of native amphibians in the American bullfrog diet was reduced when introduced crayfish occurred in both native and non-native ranges. Thus, an alternative invasion model can be proposed in which the occurrence of one invader (P. clarkii) may reduce the negative effect of an alien predator (L. catesbeianus) on native species. The present findings suggest that the removal of invaders may not always be the best solution for protecting native prey, especially when alien species are interspersed with other introduced species. In such cases, multispecies operations, sequenced appropriately or undertaken simultaneously, would be preferable. Moreover, the identification of mechanisms facilitating the coexistence of native species with invaders can offer important management options.","[Bissattini, Alessandra Maria; Buono, Vincenzo; Vignoli, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Sci, Viale Guglielmo Marconi, I-44600146 Rome, Italy","Bissattini, AM (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dept Sci, Viale Guglielmo Marconi, I-44600146 Rome, Italy.",alessandramaria.bissattini@uniroma3.it,"Vignoli, Leonardo/F-2663-2011","Vignoli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1599-092X",,,,103,10,10,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Both predators feed largely on daphnid prey and it was observed that densities of three Daphnia species declined in abundance at the reference station following the Bythotrephes invasion. Circumstantial evidence would suggest that the native predator, Leptodora, was competitively suppressed by Bythotrephes. However, results of laboratory experiments presented here show that Bythotrephes will readily attack and eat Leptodora when the predators are maintained under concentrated densities, even if alternative prey are available for the Bythotrephes. There was no evidence in these experiments that Leptodora attacked or ate Bythotrephes. These results imply that predation by Bythotrephes on Leptodora may alternatively account for the collapse of Leptodora in offshore Lake Michigan. In this note I discuss evidence in support of competition and predation as alternative hypotheses to explain the pattern of species replacement, Bythotrephes for Leptodora, observed in Lake Michigan. The existing data are not definitive and tempt further inquiry.","UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",,,,,,,,32,40,40,0,13,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2200 BONISTEEL BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109-2099",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

We found that the combined predatory effects of the two dragonflies on damselflies were not additive. To determine the underlying cause of non-additive predation rates in the field, we conducted a second experiment in laboratory aquaria to isolate the impact of each predator on the consumption rates of the other. Dragonfly consumption rates of damselflies in single-predator treatments were compared to those in the presence of heterospecifics or conspecifics with their menta (mouthparts) surgically modified so that they could not capture prey. In the laboratory experiment, de-mented Tramea reduced the consumption rates of Erythemis to less than half of that observed when Erythemis foraged alone. Erythemis numbers were also reduced by Tramea predation. Erythemis had neither effect on Tramea. Both of the negative effects of Tramea on Erythemis will have indirect positive effects on damselflies. The ''behavioral'' component (reduced Erythemis foraging rate) should be more important than the ''trophic link'' (reduced Erythemis numbers) indirect effect. Together these indirect positive effects will allay, but not completely compensate for, the direct negative effects of Tramea predation on damselflies. These results illustrate how an asymmetric potential for intraguild predation can lead to asymmetries in interference competition and to non-additive effects on prey mortality. The addition or removal of predators that interact in this manner to or from communities should have only a small net effect on prey because of compensating direct and indirect effects. This may explain why predator manipulations have often had unpredictable or undetectable effects on freshwater benthic communities.",,"WISSINGER, S (corresponding author), ALLEGHENY COLL,DEPT BIOL,MEADVILLE,PA 16335, USA.",,,,,,,117,176,179,0,67,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,207,218,,10.2307/1939515,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500021,,,,,2021-09-27,

In this work, we examined the role of abiotic conditions in shaping the structure of a simple agricultural community that is dominated by two species of predatory mites (i.e., Eusieus stipulatus and Eusieus scutalis) competing for resources. Population and community dynamics experiments were carried out at two abiotic conditions mimicking local climates in a Mediterranean region, to estimate the population cariying capacity (k) and interspecific competition (a) for each predatory mite species. Subsequently, we used this data to parameterize a competition model, thereby predicting species dominance at each abiotic condition. To test our model predictions, we sampled several orchards located in areas influenced by each of the local climates, to determine the abundance of each species of natural enemy. Results showed that the outcome of the competitive interactions between predatory mites was strongly affected by abiotic conditions, leading to temperature-dependent changes in the community structure. Furthermore, the pattern of species dominance found in the field agreed with the model predictions built upon our laboratory experiments. We therefore emphasize that, in a changing climate, if we are to guarantee the successful use of biocontrol agents, we need to account for the effect of temperature upon biotic interactions.

Larval responses to cues from algae, epilithic microbial assemblages and conspecific species are well recognised. Comparatively, little is known about how the threat of predation or of competition influences settlement. We used a manipulative field experiment to test if the presence of a predator or spatial competitor affects settlement patterns of two intertidal mussel species, Perna perna and Mytilus galloprovincialis. By deploying treated artificial units of settlement habitat (larval collectors) in 'no choice' and 'choice' combinations, we determined whether the observed settlement patterns resulted from active larval choices (preference/avoidance). Among treatments where no choice was offered, settlement was generally greater on the predator treatment, lower on treatments with epilithic biofilm or competitor presence, and least on collectors without biofilm. In all but one case, the observed proportions of settlement in the 'choice' tests were significantly different from that expected by random association based on the 'no choice' tests. Choices related primarily to the absence of biofilm and to the threat of predation, with little influence of competitor presence. Although active preferential behaviour was confirmed, patterns of selectivity differed between the two study sites. Settlers of both species preferred the predator treatment at one site, possibly suggesting a predator swamping strategy. In contrast, settlers at the second site avoided the presence of predators. This suggests that settlement behaviour may be contingent on site-specific factors and demonstrates a greater degree of flexibility in settlement behaviour than expected. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As predicted by the Janzen-Connell escape hypothesis and the predator satiation hypothesis, the effects of rodents on tree propagules may be modified by variation in the distribution and abundance of tree propagules. We tested these hypotheses in old-fields using a series of U-shaped enclosures in southeastern New York State. We maintained two densities (high versus low) of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), which are the principal seedling predators and dominant rodent competitors at our sites. High density of voles significantly reduced density of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), which are the primary seed predators. Within enclosures we manipulated the density and spacing of red maple (Acer rubrum) seeds and black birch (Betula lenta) seedlings. We used three densities of red maple seeds (1500, 750, and 150 seeds/2 m(2)) arranged to mimic natural leptokurtic declines in seed density with distance from a hypothetical seed source. The density of black birch seedlings was also manipulated at three levels (50, 20, and 10 seedlings/2 m(2)). Seed predation was uniformly high overall (approx. 99%) in three adjacent plots irrespective of seed density. However, predation was significantly lower in isolated, low-density plots. These results suggest that mice were not satiated by the range of seed densities typical for old fields and instead foraged in a distance-responsive manner consistent with predictions of the escape hypothesis. In contrast, seedlings in high density plots experienced significantly lower predation than those in medium- and low-density plots, suggesting that voles were satiated by plots of high seedling density. These patterns were dearest within enclosures having high vole density, highlighting the importance of competitive interactions in modifying the foraging decisions of rodents in old fields.","Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Manson, RH (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Nelson Biol Labs, Program Ecol & Evolut, POB 1059, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",mansonr@ecostudies.org,"Manson, Robert Hunter/AAD-6443-2021; Manson, Robert H/Q-9015-2018; Canham, Charles D/F-6161-2011","Manson, Robert H/0000-0001-9732-8894; Canham, Charles D/0000-0001-8361-9148; Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301",,,,54,37,41,0,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,1998,5,2,,,,,183,190,,10.1080/11956860.1998.11682466,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,106KQ,WOS:000075128800006,,,,,2021-09-27,

In addition, I review other investigations of old field tree invasion and establishment of the eastern deciduous biome and contrast them with HMF. I identify critical questions concerning tree invasion and establishment, indicate what progress has been made towards answering these questions and propose future experimentation. I also synthesize results into a conceptual model and investigate the relative importance of seed and seedling processes in determining tree dynamics in old fields. The idea of a possibility or ''window'' for tree invasion and establishment and its variation form the basis for this review. For example, the temporal variation of windows is reflected in tree establishment patterns at HMF because wind- and bird-dispersed species invaded one year after cessation of cultivation while mammal-dispersed species were not present until year 12. Although analysis of size classes of individual HMF trees imply that windows close quickly, studies are of too short duration to tell definitely. Spatial variation in invasion and establishment pattern includes exponential decline in seed and stem density with distance from forest edge which deteriorates with time as the old field becomes more structurally complex. Additional spatial heterogeneity occurs when seeds and seedlings of bird-dispersed species clump which conversely becomes more pronounced with time. Many of these HMF patterns are seen in other eastern United States old field sites. When reviewing field experiments from my site and others, I focus on the spatial and temporal variation and the difference between species in the effect of processes on tree seeds and seedlings. I do this because this variation relates directly to the dynamic nature of windows whose quantification is necessary for modeling. Combining my pattern analysis with a survey of variation in seed and seedling mortality caused by different successional processes in old fields, I conclude that seed dispersal, conditions necessary for seed germination and seed and seedling predation are the critical processes controlling and constraining tree invasion and establishment in old fields. Competition and indirect effects of litter and the environment, which modify how these processes affect tree dynamics, are also important. Therefore, processes involving the interaction of species with the environment and with other species form the principal filters on and limitations to tree invasion and establishment and not the non-interactive life-history traits of individual tree species such as growth rate or longevity. The interaction of pattern and process and the affect of many of these processes on old field community structure are also discussed.",,"MYSTER, RW (corresponding author), UNIV PUERTO RICO, DIV TERRESTRIAL ECOL, POB 363682, SAN JUAN, PR 00936 USA.",,,,,,,110,92,104,0,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0006-8101,1874-9372,,BOT REV,Bot.

Mechanisms promoting coexistence are one such class of organizing processes, which allow multiple species to persist in the same trophic level of a given web of species interactions. If some mechanism promotes the coexistence of two or more species, each species must be able to increase when it is rare and the others are at their typical abundances; this invasibility criterion is fundamental evidence for species coexistence regardless of the mechanism. In an attempt to evaluate the level of empirical support for coexistence mechanisms in nature, we surveyed the literature for empirical studies of coexistence at a local scale (i.e., species found living together in one place) to determine whether these studies satisfied the invasibility criterion. In our survey, only seven of 323 studies that drew conclusions about species coexistence evaluated invasibility in some way in either observational or experimental studies. In addition, only three other studies evaluated necessary but not sufficient conditions for invasibility (i.e., negative density dependence and a trade-off in performance that influences population regulation). These results indicate that, while species coexistence is a prevalent assumption for why species are able to live together in one place, critical empirical tests of this fundamental assumption of community structure are rarely performed. These tests are central to developing a more robust understanding of the relative contributions of both deterministic and stochastic processes structuring biological communities.","[Siepielski, Adam M.; McPeek, Mark A.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",mark.mcpeek@dartmouth.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0714782],"We thank P.

It is increasingly recognised that effects of multiple species often cannot be predicted from the effect of each species alone, due to complex interactions, but most investigations of invasion impacts have examined only one non-native species at a time and have not addressed the interactive effects of multiple species. We conducted a field experiment to compare the individual and combined effects of two introduced marine predators, the northern Pacific seastar Asterias amurensis and the European green crab Carcinus maenas, on a soft-sediment invertebrate assemblage in Tasmania. Spatial overlap in the distribution of these invaders is just beginning in Tasmania, and appears imminent as their respective ranges expand, suggesting a strong overlap in food resources will result from the shared proclivity for bivalve prey. A. amurensis and C. maenas provide good models to test the interaction between multiple introduced predators, because they leave clear predator-specific traces of their predatory activity for a number of common prey taxa (bivalves and gastropods). Our experiments demonstrate that both predators had a major effect on the abundance of bivalves, reducing populations of the commercial bivalves Fulvia tenuicostata and Katelysia rhytiphora. The interaction between C. maenas and A. amurensis appears to be one of resource competition, resulting in partitioning of bivalves according to size between predators, with A. amurensis consuming the large and C. maenas the small bivalves. At a large spatial scale, we predict that the combined effect on bivalves may be greater than that due to each predator alone simply because their combined distribution is likely to cover a broader range of habitats. At a smaller scale, in the shallow subtidal, where spatial overlap is expected to be most extensive, our results indicate the individual effects of each predator are likely to be modified in the presence of the other as densities increase. These results further highlight the need to consider the interactive effects of introduced species, especially with continued increases in the number of established invasions.","Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Sandy Bay, Tas 7000, Australia; Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Aquaculture & Fisheries Inst, Sandy Bay, Tas 7000, Australia; CSIRO Marine Res, Ctr Res Introduced Marine Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Ross, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",rossdj@unimelb.edu.au,"Johnson, Craig R/E-1788-2013; Hewitt, Chad L/J-2105-2019; Hewitt, Chad L/C-4460-2008; Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Johnson, Craig R/0000-0002-9511-905X; Hewitt, Chad L/0000-0002-6859-6512; Hewitt, Chad L/0000-0002-6859-6512; Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Ruiz, Gregory/0000-0003-2499-441X",,,,56,56,59,1,52,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Here we address recent developments in foraging and habitat selection, source-sink dynamics, competition (both within and between species), population cycles, predation (including apparent competition), mutualism, and biological invasions. Because mammals are appealing to the public, ecological insight gleaned from the study of mammals has disproportionate potential in educating the public about ecological principles and their application to wise management. Mammals have been central to many computational and statistical developments in recent years, including refinements to traditional approaches and metrics (e.g., capture-recapture) as well as advancements of novel and developing fields (e.g., spatial capture-recapture, occupancy modeling, integrated population models). The study of mammals also poses challenges in terms of fully characterizing dynamics in natural conditions. Ongoing climate change threatens to affect global ecosystems, and mammals provide visible and charismatic subjects for research on local and regional effects of such change as well as predictive modeling of the longterm effects on ecosystem function and stability. Although much remains to be done, the population ecology of mammals continues to be a vibrant and rapidly developing field. We anticipate that the next quarter century will prove as exciting and productive for the study of mammals as has the recent one.","[Kelt, Douglas A.; Sollmann, Rahel] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Heske, Edward J.] Univ New Mexico, Museum Southwestern Biol, MSC03-2020, Albuquerque, NM 97131 USA; [Lambin, Xavier] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Oli, Madan K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Orrock, John L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 73706 USA; [Ozgul, Arpat; Sommer, Stefan] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pauli, Jonathan N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Prugh, Laura R.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Kelt, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",dakelt@ucdavis.edu,"Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011","Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653; Sommer, Stefan/0000-0002-4092-7068","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1456729]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Hatch project) [CA-D-WFB-6126-H]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [31003A_182286]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1439550, DEB-1652420]","The authors wish to thank the editors of this Special Issue, A.

This change in the vegetative cover affected use of these plots by several other rodent species and by foraging birds. The mechanism producing this change probably involves a combination of decreased soil disturbance and reduced predation on large-sized seeds when kangaroo rats are absent. Species diversity of summer annual dicots was greater on plots where kangaroo rats were present, as predicted by keystone predator models. However, it is not clear whether this was caused directly by activities of the kangaroo rats or indirectly as a consequence of the increase in grass cover. No experimental effect on species diversity of winter annual dicots was detected. Our study site was located in a natural transition between desert scrub and grassland, where abiotic conditions and the effects of organisms may be particularly influential in determining the structure and composition of vegetation Under these conditions kangaroo rats have a dramatic effect on plant cover and species composition.","UNIV NEW MEXICO,DEPT BIOL,ALBUQUERQUE,NM 87131",,,"Guo, Qinfeng/A-8034-2009",,,,,34,111,120,1,42,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1993,95,4,,,,,520,524,,10.1007/BF00317436,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MB236,WOS:A1993MB23600010,28313292,,,,2021-09-27,

Apart from increased connectivity between previously separated watersheds, the increasing temperature of the hydrosystems favors the spread of exotic species. The freshwater fauna of Central Europe is still shaped by the cold-adapted animal assemblages resulting from the last glaciation. It is less diverse, and the species are putatively less performant competitors, compared to the warm-adapted, species-rich fauna of the Ponto-Caspian realm, from which many current aquatic invaders are coming. Our study analyses potential mechanisms explaining the coexistence between one of the most impacting aquatic invaders of the past decades, the 'killer shrimp' Dikerogammarus villosus and the previously dominating amphipod Gammarus roeselii in Lake Constance, using laboratory predation experiments and field surveys. Our results indicate two key drivers for coexistence: low winter temperatures and the substrate structure of the alga Chara sp. At temperatures below 6 degrees C, the predation pressure on G. roeselii was strongly reduced; G. roeselii can therefore disperse throughout the littoral in winter, avoiding predation by D. villosus. Artificial heating of a section of the lake shore, however, resulted in local extinction of G. roeselii by D. villosus. The macroalga Chara sp. completely inhibited predation by D. villosus on G. roeselii. Climate change scenarios indicate that global warming might destroy this thermal refuge during winter until 2085. For the survival of G. roeselii it will then be crucial, which part of the Chara population will maintain epigeic plant parts during winter. The complex interplay between thermal and physical refuges for native species in the context of climate change and changing trophic status of freshwater systems, as disentangled by our study, shows that ecosystem management and restoration strategies need to better consider multiple stressors (and their rather complex mitigation strategies).

Location: North western Atlantic. Methods: We examined the interaction between maximum and seasonal elevations in seawater temperature and reproductive phenology of a global invader to forecast the effect of climate warming on traits associated with the spread and establishment (i.e., growth and reproduction) of an invasive species. We then coupled these data with a study of early succession along a temperature gradient to forecast invasion success in species assemblages across a range of latitudes. Results: Elevated seasonal temperature will lead to greater asexual reproduction and to multi-annual sexual reproduction in areas that currently have bi-annual or annual reproduction. The output from our model combined with our field studies of early succession in communities suggest that in colder environments, communities may be more affected by climate-induced shifts in reproductive phenology as they have more free space at the beginning of the growing season and fewer competitively superior species. Main conclusions: Predicted elevated water temperature will eliminate the thermal barriers that limit reproductive success of a cosmopolitan invasive species. Increased reproduction combined with limited biological resistance in regions with cooler water temperatures may lead to a community state change.","[Dijkstra, Jennifer A.] Univ New Hampshire, Sch Marine Sci & Ocean Engn, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Dijkstra, Jennifer A.] Univ New Hampshire, Ctr Coastal & Ocean Mapping, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Westerman, Erica L.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Harris, Larry G.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Biol Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Dijkstra, JA (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Sch Marine Sci & Ocean Engn, Durham, NH 03824 USA.; Dijkstra, JA (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Ctr Coastal & Ocean Mapping, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jdijkstra@ccom.unh.edu,,,"National Estuarine Research Reserve System [NOAA NA06NOS42000033]; New Hampshire Sea Grant, University of New Hampshire [M/D-0903]; Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership (PREP); NERRS Fellowship [NA06NOS42000033]","National Estuarine Research Reserve System, Grant/Award Number: NOAA NA06NOS42000033; New Hampshire Sea Grant, University of New Hampshire, Award Number: M/D-0903; Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership (PREP); NERRS Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: NA06NOS42000033",,56,8,8,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

The number of ovisacs preyed upon was not different between treatments with all three species and those with only L. osakensis or L. nigrinus. Adult predators fed on few predator eggs and when they did no species preference was observed. The numbers of A. tsugae ovisacs fed upon did not differ significantly by groups of congeneric or conspecific Laricobius larvae.

In the field, L. nigrinus and L. rubidus were enclosed in sleeve cages with both high (>120 ovisacs) and low (<90 ovisacs) A. tsugae densities for 1 wk. All branches with caged beetles had significantly greater numbers of ovisacs preyed upon than branches caged without beetles. No differences in predation or egg production were found among the conspecific and congeneric groupings. Predation was uniformly greater on high prey-density branches than on low prey-density branches. Survivorship among predators did not differ significantly at either prey density. Results from both laboratory and field experiments suggest that these species are able to coexist and can be released in the same location for biological control of A. tsugae.","[Story, Heather M.; Vieira, Ligia C.; Salom, Scott M.; Kok, Loke T.] Virginia Tech, Dept Entomol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Story, HM (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Entomol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",derodontidae22@gmail.com,"Cota Vieira, Ligia/F-5239-2013; Kok, Loke/G-9922-2016","Cota Vieira, Ligia/0000-0001-6264-3800; Kok, Loke/0000-0002-5734-3472",,,,45,8,8,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Here, we addressed this challenge in experimental microbial microcosms by employing empirical dynamic modelling tools to: (1) detect causal interactions between prey species in the absence and presence of a predator; (2) quantify the time-varying strength of these interactions and (3) explore stability in the resulting communities. Our findings show that predators boost the number of causal interactions among community members, and lead to reduced dynamic stability, but higher coexistence among prey species. These results correspond to time-varying changes in species interactions, including emergence of morphological characteristics that appeared to reduce predation, and indirectly facilitate growth of predator-susceptible species. Jointly, our findings suggest that careful consideration of both context and time may be necessary to predict and explain outcomes in multi-trophic systems.","[Karakoc, Canan; Chatzinotas, Antonis] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Microbiol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Karakoc, Canan; Clark, Adam Thomas; Chatzinotas, Antonis] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Clark, Adam Thomas] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Physiol Divers, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Clark, Adam Thomas] Synth Ctr Biodivers Sci sDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Chatzinotas, Antonis] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Talstr 33, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Karakoc, C (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Microbiol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.; Karakoc, C (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",canan.karakoc@ufz.de,"Chatzinotas, Antonis/D-6232-2013; Clark, Adam/S-7544-2017","Chatzinotas, Antonis/0000-0002-0387-9802; Karakoc, Canan/0000-0002-3921-3535; Clark, Adam/0000-0002-8843-3278",iDiv [DFG FZT118],"We thank three anonymous reviewers, and our editors at Ecology Letters, for their critical suggestions that helped significantly improve and clarify our manuscript.

The experiment was conducted at different phases of the rodent population cycle in two grassland communities, a remnant of a native grassland and a post agriculture grassland (old field). The amount of seed loss caused by predation was estimated by a bait-removal experiment in foraging stations. We estimated the frequency of foraging stations with consumption, the overall amount of seed predation and the individual rate of seed predation. The total amount of seed removal and the individual rate of seed removal were higher for P. caldenia than for G. triacanthos, in the native grassland than in the old field, and in autumn when rodent density was maximum. Overall, the role of rodents on woody seed removal varied according to the plant species and depending on the local conditions that vary through time and space.","[Busch, Maria; Knight, Carol; Muschetto, Emiliano] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Busch, Maria; Muschetto, Emiliano] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Noemi Mazia, Cristina] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Prod Vegetal, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Hodara, Karina] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos & Sistemas Informac, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Chaneton, Enrique] Univ Buenos Aires, IFEVA CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Busch, M (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 2,Piso 4,CP C1428EHA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mbusch@ege.fcen.uba.ar,,,University of Buenos AiresUniversity of Buenos Aires; National Council for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"We would like to thank the authorities of the Faculty of Agronomy, Buenos Aires University, for the authorization to work at San Claudio and the personnel of San Claudio, especially to Alejandro, Pablo, and Sandra for their collaboration during the fieldwork.

Cats and rats represent the major threat for 40 % of currently endangered island bird species. Direct (predation) and/or indirect (exploitative competition for food resource) trophic interactions are key mechanisms by which invaders cause the decrease or extinction of native populations. Here, we investigated both direct and indirect trophic interactions amongst four predator species (i.e. animals that hunt, kill and feed on other animals), including three introduced mammals (Felis silvestris catus, Rattus rattus and Rattus exulans) and one critically endangered native bird, the Niau kingfisher (Todiramphus gertrudae). All four species' diets and prey availability were assessed from sampling at the six main kingfisher habitats on Niau Island during the breeding season. Diet analyses were conducted on 578 cat scats, 295 rat digestive tracts (218 R. exu/ans and 77 R. rattus) and 186 kingfisher pellets. Despite simultaneous use of morphological and PCR-based methods, no bird remains in cat and rat diet samples could be assigned to the Niau kingfisher, weakening the hypothesis of current intense predation pressure. However, we determined that Niau kingfishers mainly feed on introduced and/or cryptogenic prey and highlighted the potential for exploitative competition between this bird and both introduced rat species (for Dictyoptera, Coleoptera and Scincidae). We recommend removing the cats and both rat species, at least within kingfisher breeding and foraging areas (e.g. mechanical or chemical control, cat sterilisation, biosecurity reinforcement), to simultaneously decrease predation risk, increase key prey availability and boost kingfisher population dynamics.","[Zarzoso-Lacoste, Diane; Dubut, Vincent; De Meringo, Helene; Santelli, Coralie; Meunier, Jean-Yves] Avignon Univ, IMBE, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS,IRD, Marseille, France; [Zarzoso-Lacoste, Diane] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Unite Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises, UMR7058, CNRS, 1 Rue Louvels, F-80037 Amiens 1, France; [Zarzoso-Lacoste, Diane; Bonnaud, Elsa] Univ Paris Sud 11, ESE, Equipe Ecol Populat & Communautes, UMR 8079,UPS,CNRS, AgroParisTech Batiment 362, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Corse, Emmanuel] ARBRE Agence Rech Biodivers Reunion, St Leu, La Reunion, France; [Corse, Emmanuel] Ctr Univ Mayotte, Route Natl 3,BP 53, F-97660 Dembeni, Mayotte, France; [Lorvelec, Olivier] INRA, ESE, UMR 0985, INRA,Agrocampus Ouest,Equipe EPIX, 65 Rue St Brieuc, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Ghestemme, Thomas; Gouni, Anne] Soc Ornithol Polynesie Manu, BP 7023, F-98719 Tahiti, French Polynesi, France; [Vidal, Eric] Avignon Univ, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD,IMBE,Ctr IRD Noumea, BP A5, F-98848 Noumea, Nouvelle Caledo, France; [Vidal, Eric] Univ La Reunion, UMR ENTROPIE IRD, CNRS, Lab Excellence Labex CORAIL,Inst Rech Dev, BP A5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia","Zarzoso-Lacoste, D (corresponding author), Avignon Univ, IMBE, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS,IRD, Marseille, France.; Zarzoso-Lacoste, D (corresponding author), Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Unite Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises, UMR7058, CNRS, 1 Rue Louvels, F-80037 Amiens 1, France.; Zarzoso-Lacoste, D (corresponding author), Univ Paris Sud 11, ESE, Equipe Ecol Populat & Communautes, UMR 8079,UPS,CNRS, AgroParisTech Batiment 362, F-91405 Orsay, France.",diane.zarzoso.lacoste@u-picardie.fr,,,Gouvernement de la Polynesie Francaise [2009/2010-10]; Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite [AAP-IN-2009-024]; Ecole Doctorale des Sciences de l'Environnement (ED 251; Aix Marseille Universite) [2009/2010-10]; Total FranceTotal SA; Conservation des Especes et des Populations Animales; Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund; BirdLife International,"This paper is dedicated to the memory of our deeply missed colleague Michel Pascal, who contributed to the methodological reflection and fieldwork.

In Bolinas Lagoon, in central California, the site of this study, at least 15 species of trematodes infect snail populations. This study investigated patterns of interspecific association and interaction among members of this parasite guild. Seven to 19 host subpopulations were sampled annually at each of two sites in the lagoon from 1981 to 1988. Mixed-species infections constituted only 2.5% of the 5025 infections examined in the study. A Monte Carlo simulation procedure demonstrated that the numbers of such infections were often less than would be expected by chance, especially when the overall prevalence of infection was high. Patterns of association between particular pairs of species depended on whether the species' life histories include redial or only sporocyst larvae. Species that develop as rediae were predominantly negatively associated with other redial species and with most species that develop only as sporocysts. There was weak evidence of positive interspecific association between a few redial and sporocyst-only species, while members of other such pairs were distributed independently. Associations between sporocyst-only species were either weakly positive or neutral. Snails carrying known infections were marked, released, and recaptured at both study sites. During their exposure in the field, some initial infections were invaded by another parasite species that often excluded the first parasite. The vulnerability of a parasite species to invasion and replacement by another differed among the tested species. Infections of the largest redial species, Parorchis acanthus, were especially resistant to replacement, while those of the smallest redial species, Euhaplorchis californiensis, were the most frequently excluded. Four other species were invaded or replaced at intermediate rates. The two largest redial species, P. acanthus and Himasthla rhigedana, were responsible for >90% of the invasions or exclusions. Direct observations showed that the rediae of these species prey on the larval stages of other species, as do the rediae of Echinoparyphium sp. This direct form of interspecific antagonism is probably the primary mechanism by which such species exclude others from host snails, as has been widely demonstrated in similar freshwater snail-trematode systems. While hierarchical, negative interactions prevent the coexistence of species at the level of the individual host, the mark-recapture study showed that rates of exclusion are low for most subordinate species, with the exception of Euhaplorchis californiensis. At the level of the host subpopulation, the assemblage of larval trematodes is diverse, and its composition is temporally and spatially variable. There is no trend toward dominance of the assemblage by large redial species as the level of infection rises within aging cohorts or subpopulations of hosts. These patterns of guild structure within host cohorts and subpopulations are consistent with the hypothesis that recruitment processes rather than interspecific interactions primarily determine the composition and relative abundance of species at this regional level. Several characteristics of snail-trematode systems that may promote regional coexistence of such a large number of potentially interacting parasite species are the isolated and subdivided nature of the host resource, the aggregated distributions of larval stages, and the differential exploitation of different-sized hosts. Many features of this system are consistent with Price's (1980) non-equilibrial view of parasite communities.",,"SOUSA, WP (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,122,115,116,0,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Researchers have tried to understand this relationship by focusing either on how diversity is influenced by the availability of resources, or alternatively, how resource abundance is influenced by species diversity. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox '... is species diversity the cause or the consequence of resources that limit community biomass?' Here we present results of an experiment that show it is possible for species diversity and resource density to exhibit reciprocal causal relationships in the same ecological system. Using a guild of ladybeetle predators and their aphid prey, we manipulated the number of predator species in field enclosures to examine how predator diversity impacts prey population size. At the same time, we manipulated the abundance of aphid prey in discrete habitat patches within each enclosure to determine how smaller-scale spatial variation in resource abundance affects the number of co-occurring predator species. We found that the number of ladybeetle species added to enclosures had a significant impact on aphid population dynamics because interference competition among the predators reduced per capita rates of predation and, in turn, the overall efficiency of the predator guild. At the same time, spatial variation in aphid abundance among smaller habitat patches generated variation in the observed richness of ladybeetles because more species occurred in patches where predators aggregated in response to high aphid density. The results of our experiment demonstrate that it is possible for species diversity to simultaneously be a cause and a consequence of resource density in the same ecological system, and they shed light on how this might occur for groups of mobile consumers that exhibit rapid responses to spatial and temporal variation in their prey.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; S Dakota State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Cardinale, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",cardinale@lifesci.ucsb.edu,"Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008","Ives, Anthony/0000-0001-9375-9523",,,,48,71,72,3,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Although the intrinsic habitat preferences of a species can be considered to be fixed, the realized habitat use depends on the prevailing abiotic and biotic conditions. Often the core habitats are occupied by dense and stable populations, while marginal habitats become occupied only at times of high density. In a community of interacting species, habitat uses of different species become inter-related, for example an increased density of a strong competitor forcing a weaker competitor to use more marginal habitats. 2. We studied the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of three common small mammal species, the bank vole Myodes glareolus; the field vole Microtus agrestis; and the common shrew Sorex araneus, in a 4-year trapping study carried out on six large islands, each containing a mixture of three main habitat types (forest, field and clear-cut). We experimentally released least weasels (Mustela n. nivalis) to some of the islands to see how the focal species respond to increased predation pressure. 3. Both vole species were largely restricted to their core habitats (bank voles to forests and field voles to fields) at times of low population density. With increasing density, the relative habitat use of both species increased in the clear-cut areas. The common shrew was a generalist in its habitat use at all population densities. 4. The release of the weasels changed the habitat use of all study species. 5. The vole species showed a stronger aggregated pattern than the common shrew, especially at low population density. The vole aggregations remained in the same localities between seasons, except in the case of bank voles after the weasels were released. 6. Bank voles and field voles avoided each other at high density. 7. We conclude that intrinsically differential habitat requirements and flexibility to modify habitat use facilitate the coexistence of the two competing vole species in mosaic landscapes consisting of boreal forests and open habitats.","[Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Lammi Biol Stn, FI-16900 Lammi, Finland; [Church, Christina; Ovaskainen, Otso] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biosci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Sundell, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Lammi Biol Stn, Paajarventie 320, FI-16900 Lammi, Finland.",janne.sundell@helsinki.fi,"Ovaskainen, Otso/D-9119-2012","Ovaskainen, Otso/0000-0001-9750-4421","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [52045, 208478, 124242]; European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC)European Commission [205905]","We thank all students and colleagues who have taken part in the field work.

Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo, body mass approximate to 2700 g), Ural Owls (Strix uralensis, 900 g), and Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus, 130 g) coexist in Fennoscandia and feed mainly on small rodents. Predation may play an important role in interactions among these owl species, because Eagle Owls and Ural Owls can kill Tengmalm's Owls but cannot enter the small entrance hale of Tengmalm's Owl nest boxes. We asked (i) whether predation risk and interspecific competition due to Eagle Owls and Ural Owls reduced breeding density and fitness of Tengmalm's Owls, and (ii) whether these interactions increased intraspecific competition for safe nesting sites among Tengmalm's Owls. We manipulated breeding densities of potentially competing owls by erecting nest boxes, the control being boxes in areas where breeding attempts of competing owl species were absent. Control nest boxes in areas with no Eagle Owl and Ural Owl territories, and nest boxes within Eagle Owl territories, were used by breeding Tengmalm's Owls more than nest boxes within Ural Owl territories. Most breeding attempts of Tengmalm's Owls near Ural Owls failed during the courtship period. The observational data revealed that breeding frequency of Tengmalm's Owls was reduced and the mean start of egg laying was delayed by 11 d within 2 km of Ural Owl nests. In addition, male Tengmalm's Owls at these nests were younger and paired more often with short-winged (i.e., young and generally subdominant) females than when farther away from Ural Owl nests. Our results suggest that inexperienced male Tengmalm's Owls are forced to establish their territories in the vicinity of Ural Owls where they often paired with subdominant females. The areas near Ural Owl nests are suboptimal habitats fdr Tengmalm's Owls, whereas those near Eagle Owls are not. We conclude that predatory and competitive interactions from Ural Owls decrease the breeding population size of Tengmalm's Owls by reducing the suitable habitats.

Although A. russatus is diurnally active, it retains the physical activity and body temperature rhythms of nocturnal mammals. We studied the two species in four 1000-m(2) enclosures at Ein Gedi, Israel: two experimental enclosures with A. russatus kept alone, and two controls with individuals of both species kept together. We monitored activity with Sherman traps and by studying foraging microhabitat use and efficiency using giving-up densities (GUDs) in food trays. The trays contained broken sunflower seeds mixed in local soil and placed in three microhabitats: under boulders, between boulders, and in the open. Trapping revealed that, in the absence of A. cahirinus, the usually diurnal A. russatus was active both day and night. However, during the day A. russatus still foraged in significantly more patches and to significantly lower GUDs than during the night. Both species, but in particular A. russatus, preferred to forage in the boulder habitat. Spiny mice foraged in the same number of trays in the under- and between-boulder microhabitats, but to lower GUDs in the under-boulder microhabitat, both during the day (A. russatus) and during the night (both species). The nocturnal A. cahirinus exploited more patches with greater efficiency than did A. russatus either during the day or during the night. This result suggests that foraging trade-offs that give each species a competitive advantage along some portion of the resource axis cannot be a mechanism of nocturnal coexistence between the two species. Perhaps this is why A. russatus resorts to diurnal activity in this hot rocky desert and why the otherwise rare mechanism of temporal partitioning occurs for these species.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Dayan, T (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",dayant@post.tau.ac.il,,"Gutman, Roee/0000-0002-3282-6558",,,,53,72,74,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2005,86,1,,,,,164,173,,10.1890/03-0369,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,894KX,WOS:000226791700017,,,,,2021-09-27,

At One Tree Reef, in the southern Great Barrier Reef, deposit-feeding cerithiid gastropods, Rhinoclavis aspera (Linnaeus, 1758), R. fasciata (Bruguiere, 1792) and R. vertagus (linnaeus, 1758), are most abundant in an atypical environment, the coarse sandy sediments of a back-reef sandflat. Densities in the finer sediments of the lagoon are several orders of magnitude smaller than on the sandflat. In this study, these three species were enclosed al a range of naturally occurring densities in fine and coarse sediments to investigate their competitive interactions and the influence of sediment on their growth. The type of substratum in experimental enclosures influenced the growth of each species. Growth was greatest in the fine sediments from the lagoon, despite the fact that recruitment of each species had been shown to be greatest into the coarse sediments of the sandflat. Adult R. aspera significantly reduced the growth of juveniles of the three species, but adults of R. fasciata and R. vertagus had no significant effect on the growth of juveniles of R. aspera. These results are probably a function of the large disparity in the densities of the three species: R. aspera occur in densities an order of magnitude greater than the other two species and naturally occurring densities were used in the experiments. Competition for food or other expendable resources was distinguished from direct interference competition for space by including in our experiments treatments with dead shells occupying the same volume as live adults, but not utilizing expendable resources. Direct competition for space between adults and juveniles of R. aspera is unlikely to be important as a factor affecting the growth of juvenile R. aspera. Dead shells had no significant effect on the growth of juveniles in coarse or fine sediment. Direct competition for space may be more important for R. fasciata and R. vertagus because, in some cases, the presence of dead shells reduced the growth of juveniles. These experiments demonstrate how complex competitive interactions among Rhinoclavis spp. are modified by the type of sediment and vary with the particular combination of competitors. Research in rocky intertidal systems has similarly shown how the physical environment may modify the nature of biological interactions such as competition and predation. Our results are consistent with findings from temperate systems in that growth of Rhinoclavis spp. was limited by the availability of food or a related resource such as the availability of suitably sized particles of sediment for ingestion. This system differs, however, because deposit-feeding snails occur in their greatest densities in a habitat where they have the slowest rates of growth. Further work is needed to explain these patterns of distribution and abundance and why they differ from those typical of studies in temperate systems in the northern hemisphere.",,"SKILLETER, GA (corresponding author), UNIV SYDNEY,INST MARINE ECOL,ZOOL BLDG AO8,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA.",,"Underwood, A J/B-1299-2008; Skilleter, Greg Alan/F-9250-2010","Skilleter, Greg Alan/0000-0002-4719-0409",,,,70,10,10,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

We analyzed the effects of competition on the biomass of organisms belonging to 93 species in a wide variety of habitats. Competition had a large effect overall, with a great deal of heterogeneity in that effect among organisms. There were large differences among trophic levels in competitive effects, but the relative magnitude of competition at different trophic levels was contrary to the predictions of ecological theory. Primary producers and carnivores displayed small to medium effects. In these two groups, interspecific effects did not differ from intraspecific effects, nor did effects differ in terrestrial versus aquatic habitats. The effects of competition on herbivores ranged from large effects on anurans and lotic arthropods, to medium effects on marine mollusks and echinoderms, to effects that were not statistically distinguishable from zero for terrestrial arthropods. Interspecific competitive effects among these herbivore groups were generally less than intraspecific effects. Among primary producers, the effects of competition were not different in high- and low-productivity habitats. Across all taxa, large organisms did not experience greater competitive effects than small organisms, and competitive effects did not depend on the size attained in the absence of competitors. The effects of competition were weakly density-dependent in cases in which it was possible to examine the effects of the density of neighbors. Experiments conducted on caged organisms resulted in greater competitive effects than those with free-roaming and unenclosed organisms. Experiments with small sample sizes, short durations, and poor experimental design were more variable than experiments that were larger, longer, and better planned.",,"GUREVITCH, J (corresponding author), SUNY STONY BROOK, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA.",,"Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008",,,,,101,639,653,10,365,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

We explored the hypothesis that mineral N can cause both lethal and sublethal toxic effects in amphibian embryos and larvae in a manipulative field experiment. We sampled 12 ponds, fertilizing half with ammonium nitrate fertilizer early in the spring, and measured hatching, survival, development, growth, and the incidence of deformities in native populations of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and eastern tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) embryos and larvae held in in situ enclosures. We found that higher ammonium concentrations negatively affect R. sylvatica more strongly than A. tigrinum. R. sylvatica tended to have lower survival as embryos and young tadpoles, slowed embryonic development, and an increased proportion of hatchlings with deformities at experimentally elevated ammonium. A. tigrinum did not experience significantly reduced survival, but their larval development was slowed in response to elevated ammonium and the abundance of large invertebrate predators. Variable species susceptibility, such as that shown by R sylvatica and A. tigrinum, could have large indirect effects on aquatic community structure through modification of competitive or predator-prey relationships. Ammonium and nitrate + nitrite concentrations were not correlated with other measures that might have affected amphibians, such as pH, pond area, depth, or vegetation. Our results highlight the potential importance of elevated ammonium on the growth, development and survival of amphibians, especially those that breed in surface waters receiving anthropogenic N inputs.","New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Griffis-Kyle, KL (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, POB 30003, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",kerrygk@nmsu.edu,"Griffis-Kyle, Kerry/AAE-6084-2020",,,,,46,28,30,2,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2007,152,4,,,,,633,642,,10.1007/s00442-007-0686-2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,192TO,WOS:000248226100005,17351792,,,,2021-09-27,

We hypothesized that the densities of cicada species were directly correlated with the availability of host plant species. We conducted complete enumeration surveys of exuviae in Hyalessa fuscata, Cryptotympana atrata, Meimuna spp., and Graptopsaltria nigrofuscata in three representative habitats in Republic of Korea: metropolitan, suburban, and country. We measured resource-weighted density of each species based on the area and the number of trees, and used those values to calculate organism-weighted density, which measures the intensity of competition that an individual experiences sharing its host with others of its own species. H. fuscata was the dominant species in all three habitats. H. fuscata and C. atrata comprised a minimum of 75.2% of all cicadas across all habitats and sampling periods. Resource-weighted densities of H. fuscata and C. atrata were much higher in the metropolitan habitat than in the country habitat. Habitat was a significant factor for variations in organism-weighted densities in C. atrata and G. nigrofuscata, but it was not in Meimuna spp. and H. fuscata. Some of the results concerning the percentages of trees without exuviae and preferred plants seemed to support the host availability hypothesis in C. atrata, Meimuna spp. and G. nigrofuscata, but they may not in H. fuscata. The similarity between resource-weighted and organism-weighted densities suggests that factors other than host availability, speculatively abiotic factors and predators, may also account for the patterns of population densities in C. atrata and G. nigrofuscata.","[Kim, Tae Eun] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Life Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Oh, Seung-Yoon] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 151747, South Korea; [Chang, Eunmi] Ziin Consulting Inst, Seoul 110070, South Korea; [Jang, Yikweon] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Life Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Jang, Yikweon] Ewha Womans Univ, Div EcoSci, Seoul 120750, South Korea","Jang, Y (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Life Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",jangy@ewha.ac.kr,"Oh, Seung-Yoon/H-4958-2018","Oh, Seung-Yoon/0000-0002-9745-1849",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)National Research Foundation of Korea [2012R1A2A2A01046977]; Ewha Global Top 5 Project,"We are indebted to Sunghee Kim, Jaeho Woo, and So Young Won for field assistance.

Twelve monthly investigations were carried out along an irrigation system in Ain Soltane's oasis (southwest of Tunisia). Here, we describe the population dynamics of G. truncatula with and without M. tuberculata in two stations: a witness pilot station (S1), in which the snail lives alone, and an experimental station (S2), where two species live together. The abundance of G. truncatula varied according to subsistence or not of M. tuberculata. The number of annual generations is higher in S1 (four generations) than S2 (two generations). In the absence of other molluscs or predators that can influence the density of G. truncatula and assuming that climatic factors are mitigated by the presence of an oasean microclimate, these results show that the mollusc M. tuberculata has a competition with the vector species of fluke.","[Ghouaidia, Najet; Hammami, Hayet] Sfax Univ Sfax, Fac Sci, Dept Life Sci, Sfax 3000, Tunisia; [Hammami, Hayet] Sfax Univ, Fac Med, Fungal & Parasit Mol Biol Lab, Sfax 3029, Tunisia","Hammami, H (corresponding author), Sfax Univ Sfax, Fac Sci, Dept Life Sci, Sfax 3000, Tunisia.",hayetfss@yahoo.fr,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Researches, Tunisia","This study was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Researches, Tunisia.",,19,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-6707,1365-2028,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

Propagule size and number often vary by several orders of magnitude among co-occurring plant species. Explaining the maintenance of this variation and understanding how propagule size contributes to coexistence remain a central challenge for community ecologists. The dominant paradigm is that a competition-colonization trade-off maintains interspecific variation in seed size, but empirical support is limited and other coexistence mechanisms, such as size-dependent seed predation, have not been examined. 2. We examined how seed size, fecundity, and other functional traits of 18 co-occurring perennial forbs trade-off with both vulnerability to rodent seed predation and competitive response to a community-dominant perennial bunchgrass. We added seeds of these species to 1 m(2) plots at 10 sites where we factorially manipulated rodent seed predation and competition from the community dominant, Festuca campestris. For a given plot, seeds of each species were added at densities that reflected the fecundity (i.e., per capita seed production) for each species. Moreover, we varied total seed density among plots by adding seeds at one of five relative densities (0, 0.25. 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 times each species' fecundity) to examine how fecundity affected overall recruitment for each species. 3. There was a trade-off between seed size and fecundity, as expected, but larger seed size was also associated with greater plant height, lower C/N ratios, and lower water use efficiency, suggesting that seed size represented a resource acquisitive trait syndrome (as quantified by trait principal component scores). 4. In the field experiment, the suppressive effects of seed predation on seed recruitment rate increased with increasing seed size. In contrast, smaller seeded species with less resource-acquisitive traits were more negatively affected by competition from F. campestris than were species with more resource acquisitive traits. 5. Synthesis. While the competition-colonization trade-off has been the predominant mechanism thought to maintain coexistence among species that vary in fecundity and seed size, our work suggests that susceptibility to rodent seed predation and competitive response to community dominants represent alternative mechanisms that can differentially influence plant recruitment of species based on their seed size and associated traits.","[Maron, John L.; Hajek, Karyn L.; Hahn, Philip G.; Pearson, Dean E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula, MT USA","Maron, JL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,,Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB-1553518]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518; NSF, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518",,55,9,9,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Both species experienced reduced survivorship and altered growth rates at high density and in the presence of heterospecific larvae, confirming results from previous field pen studies.

The territorial nature of breeding Cactus wren is well-documented and typically involves nest usurping (i.e., destruction) of conspecifics. Due to their similar nesting ecology, breeding Verdin are frequently the target of such behavior and are often forced to move or abandon nests. Using the Verdin/Cactus wren system as a case study, our goal was to evaluate the performance of SDMs that include only environmental predictors with SDMs that also include biotic relationships as predictors. Location: East Foundation's San Antonio Viejo Ranch in south Texas. Methods: We built SDMs (MaxEnt, Boosted Regression Tree [BRT], and Random Forest [RF]) to project Verdin distribution during the early (April through mid-May), peak (mid-May through mid-June), and late (mid-June through mid-July) breeding periods using occurrence data collected during the 2015 and 2016 breeding seasons. We ran parallel analyses using relevant environmental features alone as predictors and then environmental features with observed Cactus wren density. Results: Random Forest (RF) produced the highest predictive performance SDMs for all three breeding periods (AUC = 0.81-0.99; TSS = 0.23-0.73). All models improved in predictive power (Delta AUC = 0.01-0.10) and model sensitivity (Delta TSS = 0.09-0.66) with the inclusion of Cactus wren density as a predictor of Verdin presence. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that SDM performance is improved by the inclusion of biotic relationships as predictors. Incorporating biotic interactions, as well as their temporal trends, is essential in efforts to monitor or conserve bird species with similar nesting ecologies. Further, modeling algorithms that can accommodate complex, non-linear relationships (e.g., Random Forest) should be preferred in SDM development and application.","[Fern, Rachel R.; Morrison, Michael L.; Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan; Grant, William E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Campbell, Tyler A.] East Fdn, San Antonio, TX 78216 USA","Fern, RR (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, WFES Bldg,2258 TAMU,534 John Kimbrough Blvd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",Rachel.Fern@tamu.edu,"Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan/AAE-7933-2020","Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan/0000-0002-7850-0406; Fern, Rachel/0000-0003-2465-5418",East Foundation,"We offer our gratitude to the East Foundation for their generous funding and access to the San Antonio Viejo Ranch, as well as the many field technicians that aided in the ground surveys.

We compared diversity and abundance of rodents and insectivores in habitats covering the widest possible range of forest productivity in Central Europe, from dry coniferous to wet deciduous forests. Small mammals were live-trapped during summer (2004-2006) on 206 circular plots. On the regional scale, the number of small mammal (rodent and shrew) species positively correlated with the proportion of deciduous stands in the woodland's area. In all forests, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) dominated, and their joint proportion in the community increased with share of deciduous forest habitats. On the local scale, the number of species increased significantly with productivity of both capture site and the whole woodland. Variation in rodent abundance was influenced mainly by forest productivity at the capture site, productivity of the whole woodland, and month of capture. Only a minor part of the variation in shrew abundance was explained by habitat productivity. The relationship between forest productivity and small mammal diversity was linear and positive on both local and regional scales. The different responses of rodents and insectivores to increasing productivity could be due to a wider ecological niche of shrews and their competition for space with rodents.","[Niedzialkowska, Magdalena; Konczak, Julia; Czarnomska, Sylwia; Jedrzejewska, Bogumila] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Konczak, Julia] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland","Niedzialkowska, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland.",mniedz@zbs.bialowieza.pl,,"Czarnomska, Sylwia/0000-0002-8081-0956; Jedrzejewska, Bogumila/0000-0002-9652-0953","Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, PolandEuropean Commission [2 P06L 006 29]; Mammal Research Institute PAS","We thank all students, volunteers, Polish State Forest personnel from Bialystok and Olsztyn Regional State Forest Directorates, personnel of Mazury, Knyszyn, and Rominta Landscape Parks, and colleagues from the Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, who helped in the field work.

We aim to clarify the relationship and connections between interacting three-species models and the classic two-species Lotka-Volterra (LV) model that entails predator-prey coexistence with long-lived population oscillations. To this end, we utilize mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations on two-dimensional square lattices to explore the temporal evolution characteristics of two different interacting three-species predator-prey systems, namely: (1) a cyclic rock-paper-scissors (RPS) model with conserved total particle number but strongly asymmetric reaction rates that lets the system evolve towards one corner of configuration space; (2) a hierarchical food chain where an additional intermediate species is inserted between the predator and prey in the LV model. For the asymmetric cyclic model variant (1), we demonstrate that the evolutionary properties of both minority species in the (quasi-)steady state of this stochastic spatial three-species corner RPS model are well approximated by the two-species LV system, with its emerging characteristic features of localized population clustering, persistent oscillatory dynamics, correlated spatio-temporal patterns, and fitness enhancement through quenched spatial disorder in the predation rates. In contrast, we could not identify any regime where the hierarchical three-species model (2) would reduce to the two-species LV system. In the presence of pair exchange processes, the system remains essentially well-mixed, and we generally find the Monte Carlo simulation results for the spatially extended hierarchical model (2) to be consistent with the predictions from the corresponding mean-field rate equations. If spreading occurs only through nearest-neighbor hopping, small population clusters emerge; yet the requirement of an intermediate species cluster obviously disrupts spatio-temporal correlations between predator and prey, and correspondingly eliminates many of the intriguing fluctuation phenomena that characterize the stochastic spatial LV system.","[He, Q.; Taeuber, U.

Invasive crayfish alter invaded habitats causing community and population level impacts due to competition, predation and transmission of diseases. We experimentally evaluated the potential impacts of invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis) on native Piedmont crayfish (Cambarus sp. C) using size-matched pairs. We tested 1) species-specific aggressive behavior with aggression assays, and 2) survival in sympatry with survival analysis. Both invasive crayfish species tended to express higher levels of aggression compared to the native counterpart. However, we failed to detect any statistically significant differences. During survival experiments, the proportional survival of native Cambarus sp. C in sympatry with invasive O. virilis was significantly lower than that of invasive O. virilis. However, we did not find a significant difference in the proportional survival between invasive P. clarkii and native Cambarus sp. C. These experiments demonstrate inconsistent and limited negative impacts of two invasive crayfish species on a native species, when size-matched. Therefore, in order to make novel and effective decisions in managing these invasive species, it is critical to understand species-specific invasion dynamics and size-dependent potential impacts of invasive crayfish on native taxa.","[Hale, Patricia; Wilson, James; Henkanaththegedara, Sujan] Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA; [Loughman, Zachary] West Liberty Univ, Dept Nat Sci & Math, West Liberty, WV USA","Henkanaththegedara, S (corresponding author), Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",Henkanaththegedarasm@longwood.edu,,,Virginia Academy of Science Small Project Research Grant; Longwood University Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences; Longwood University Faculty Research Grant; Longwood University Perspectives on Research In Mathematics & Science (LU-PRISM) Summer Undergraduate Research Program,"We thank Bryan Ditursi and Jackson Wagstaff for helping with preliminary experiments which led to these experiments; Johnny Leder, Eric Salamon, Nicole Sadecky, Zachary Dillard and Samuel Hull for assistance in field sampling, setting up the experiments and crayfish care; Shawn Goodchild, Christoph Chucholl, Kit Magellan and two anonymous reviewers for reviewing an earlier draft of the manuscript; Virginia Academy of Science Small Project Research Grant, the Longwood University Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences, Longwood University Faculty Research Grant and Longwood University Perspectives on Research In Mathematics & Science (LU-PRISM) Summer Undergraduate Research Program for research funding.

Facultative predation is a frequent behaviour in C. albiceps and C. rufifacies that occurs as an alternative food source during the larval stage. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of intraguild predation by C. albiceps on other fly species in order to analyse interspecific and intraspecific survival in C. albiceps, C. megacephala and C macellaria Fabricius. The experimental design of the study allowed us to evaluate how factors such as species, density and abundance of food influenced the survival of the calliphorid species. When C albiceps was confined with C megacephala or C macellaria, only adults of C albiceps survived at different larval densities and abundance of food. In addition, the survival of C albiceps was higher in two-species experiments when compared to single species experiments.

The influence of N. diversicolor on the two Corophium species was studied in field and laboratory experiments. Neither of the experiments corroborated earlier findings of N. diversicolor as an important predator on C. volutator. However, enclosed populations of C. arenarium exhibited enhanced mortality in the presence of N. diversicolor. In short-term laboratory experiments N. diversicolor caused an increased migration rate in both Corophium species. Recruitment patterns of N. diversicolor and Corophium during the field experiment suggest that high densities of juvenile N. diversicolor impair the recruitment of Corophium. Although the actual mechanisms causing these varied effects of Nereis diversicolor on the two Corophium species are largely unknown, some evidence suggest that under field conditions N. diversicolor alters the substratum by its mucuous production, and thereby creates a more silty environment which favors C. volutator but not C. arenarium. Under the present laboratory conditions, where suspension feeding in N. diversicolor was an insufficient method to provide food, disturbance caused by surface active N. diversicolor specimens is a likely explanation of the negative impact of N. diversicolor on both Corophium species. In conclusion, the effects that N. diversicolor might have on co-occurring species is probably dependent on its choice of feeding method, which in turn is supposed to be a result of the availability of food both on the bottom and in the water. Distributional consequences for the Corophium species of these interactions are discussed.","UNIV STOCKHOLM,DEPT ZOOL,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","JENSEN, KT (corresponding author), AARHUS UNIV,INST BIOL SCI,DEPT ECOL & GENET,BLDG 540,NY MUNKEGADE,DK-8000 AARHUS,DENMARK.",,"Andre, Carl/B-4237-2010; Jensen, K.

The necrobiome is a unique microcosm in which various organisms interact and compete for access to an ephemeral resource, such as carrion, that ultimately determines the structure and composition of these assemblages. 2. Blowfly species exhibit different competitive abilities which, when associated with other types of behaviour, such as predation or cannibalism, influence coexistence. Knowledge of the effects of competition between native and invasive species on development and survival is essential to understanding the dynamics of insect communities and to assess biological invasions. 3. Laboratory experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of interspecific competition on the bionomics and survival of a native (Cochliomyia macellaria) and an invasive (Chrysomya rufifacies) blowfly species at different population densities. 4. The deleterious effect of competition on the larval parameters of C. macellaria increased proportionally with increases in the larval density of C. rufifacies. When exposed to increased densities of C. rufifacies, larvae of C. macellaria accelerated their development and, as a trade-off for this strategy, surviving adults were smaller and had reduced wing size, which were likely to reduce dispersal and reproductive capacity. 5. Larval competition-both as species-dependent and density-dependent phenomena-influences morphological and biological traits of surviving individuals. The impact of the invasive species has consequences at the population level, such as displacement or local population depletion of native species, a phenomenon likely to occur in other systems involving insects and ephemeral resources.","[Carmo, Rodrigo F.

At mudflats across north-central Casco Bay, a 517 km(2) embayment in the western Gulf of Maine, USA, intertidal sediments are generally acidic (pore water pH range = 7.09-7.85), which can negatively affect settlement and subsequent recruitment success of infaunal bivalves due directly or indirectly to shell dissolution. In addition, predation on bivalves by invasive green crabs, Carcinus maenas, and native consumers is intense in this region. Two commercially important infaunal bivalve species occupy these sediments (softshell clams, Mya arenaria; hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria). Fisheries managers, legislators, and others have suggested that adding crushed shells of M. arenaria to the surface of mudflats can ameliorate negative effects of acidic sediment pore water through chemical buffering. We investigated the interactive effects of modifying surface sediments using crushed and weathered shells of Mya and predator exclusion on abundance and size of 0-year class individuals of these two bivalve species in large-scale plots (9.3 m(2)) and small-scale experimental units (EU; 182.4 cm(2)). Field experiments were conducted over three years (170-204 days yr(-1); each initiated prior to spawning and continuing well after settlement had ceased). Shell hash in large-scale plots (mean particle size = 19.3 mm) varied across three levels (0, 0.63, and 1.27 kg m(-2)), and between 0 and 1.27 kg m(-2) in EU where shell size varied from 1.9-19.3 mm. Small-scale experiments also used granite chips that, like crushed shells, increased habitat heterogeneity but did not buffer sediments. Density and size of both bivalve species at the end of most field trials were significantly greater in predator-exclusion treatments vs. controls independent of shell treatment. In all trials, neither Mya nor Mercenaria responded positively to the presence of shell additions. Fisheries managers should focus attention on mitigating effects due to predators instead of spreading shell hash to buffer intertidal sediments.","[Beal, Brian F.] Univ Maine Machias, 116 OBrien Ave, Machias, ME 04654 USA; [Beal, Brian F.; Randall, Sara F.; Pepperman, Kyle E.; Ellis, Bennett W.] Downeast Inst, 39 Wildflower Lane,POB 83, Beals, ME 04611 USA; [Coffin, Chad R.; Goodenow, Clint A., Jr.] Maine Clammers Assoc, 26 Litchfield Rd, Freeport, ME 04032 USA","Beal, BF (corresponding author), Univ Maine Machias, 116 OBrien Ave, Machias, ME 04654 USA.",bbeal@maine.edu,,,National Marine Fisheries Service-Saltonstall-Kennedy program [NA14NMF4270033]; Maine Economic Improvement Fund-Small Campus Initiative; University of Maine at Machias; Sea Pact; Downeast Institute,"This work was partly funded by the National Marine Fisheries Service-Saltonstall-Kennedy program (grant: NA14NMF4270033), the Maine Economic Improvement Fund-Small Campus Initiative, Sea Pact, Downeast Institute, and the University of Maine at Machias.

Species flocks evolve in isolated areas where predators and competitors are absent. Since the description of the Chichancanab flock, Oreochromis mossambicus, a species introduced into the lake for which I examined habitat in the 1980's, has become common throughout the basin. I assessed relative abundance of flock species in the lake. examined habitat use and segregation among the three most common flock species and examined the affects of O. mossambicus upon flock species habitat use. Cyprinodon beltrani was the most abundant flock species in 1997, followed by C. maya and C labiosus; C verecundus and C simus were rare. Cyprinodon beltrani was found in shallow water, nearshore, over thick beds of submerged Chara, and little emergent vegetation. Cyprinodon beltrani exhibited diurnal variation in nearshore habitat use. In the field, the habitat use of C beltrani and O. mossambicus broadly overlapped. In aquarium experiments, three flock species exhibited habitat use segregation and C beltrani and C labiosus showed agonistic behaviors that strengthened segregation. Cyprinodon maya differed from C beltrani and C labiosus by its greater dispersion of individuals and use of areas higher in the water column. The presence of O. mossambicus caused a shift in habitat use by C maya and C labiosus that put these species into habitat occupied by C beltrani. The presence of introduced species has caused a significant perturbation of the conditions that fomented speciation of the Chichancanab flock 8000 years ago.","Univ Kansas, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Fuselier, L (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Behav, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",,,,,,,26,19,19,0,9,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,SAN JOSE,"UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA",0034-7744,,,REV BIOL TROP,Rev.

Invasive species may have direct effects on native species, such as predation or competition, as well as indirect effects such as altering habitat or the behaviour of a native species. Indirect effects can be difficult to detect, but whole-system removal of invasive species presents ail excellent opportunity for revealing these more subtle effects. 2. American bullfrogs were introduced to California in the late 1800s and have been implicated in the declines of native ranid species. Invasive American bullfrogs were removed from a series of 12 ponds to test for changes in microhabitat use of federally threatened California red-legged frogs, using a neighbouring field site with six ponds as a control. 3. There was a marked increase in the total number of adult California red-legged frogs seen in all of the ponds after the first year of bullfrog removal, suggesting that these adults were in the ponds, but hiding when invaders were present. Ontogenetic partitioning of habitat in this species was documented, as well as a shift in that partitioning and increased hiding behaviour with adult bullfrog presence. California red-legged frogs used willows significantly more as cover, and were found on bare shores half as often when adult bullfrogs were present. 4. These results support recent Suggestions that behavioural responses of prey to predators can play a Substantial role in total predator effects and suggest that careful management of invasive species may be necessary to accurately evaluate population sizes of this threatened amphibian species.

We establish a pair approximation model to explore the possible invasive results of an exploitative competition food web formed by ecological invasion. Global and local hunting strategies of predators are considered. The influence of initial densities and the initial spatial structure of both native and invasive species for invasive results are analyzed. Generally, better local predation capacity and higher initial density of the invasive species favor successful invasion. Interestingly, the initial spatial structures of both native and invasive species can alter the invasive results. Whether higher aggregation of invasive species promotes invasion depends on the species' predation strategies. Then two kinds of disturbance defined as destructive disturbance and targeted introductory disturbance are introduced. Three characteristics of disturbances are considered: the extent, spatial connectivity and periodicity. All the three characteristic have profound influence on the invasive results especially for the targeted introductory disturbance. Furthermore, the former kind of disturbance cannot eliminate the invasive species thoroughly while the latter not only can eliminate the invasive species but also can promote the coexistence of the native and invasive species depending on its three characteristics. Finally, several invasive events and hypotheses being reported are explained by our model. This study provides new insights into biodiversity conservation and invasion, and the results about disturbance can give us some inspirations on the control of invasion.","[Nie, Shipeng; Li, Weide] Lanzhou Univ, Ctr Data Sci, Sch Math & Stat, Lab Appl Math & Complex Syst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Li, WD (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Ctr Data Sci, Sch Math & Stat, Lab Appl Math & Complex Syst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",weideli@lzu.edu.cn,"Li, Weide/D-6826-2017","Li, Weide/0000-0003-2288-4751","National Natural Sciences Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41775069, 41975076]",This study is supported by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (No. 41775069 and No. 41975076).,,59,1,1,4,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Our model might be interpreted as a certain prey predator system having three trophic layers: (i) the basal species that might be interpreted as nutrients; (ii) normal and tumor cells that consume nutrients, and (iii) therapeutic factors that might kill either nutrient, normal or tumor cells. Using a wide spectrum of parameters we examined survival of our species and tried to identify the corresponding dynamical regimes. It was found that the radiotherapy influences mainly the limit of starvation i.e. the value of an update probability where the tumor cells go extinct as a result of insufficient nutrient supply and competition with normal cells. The other limiting value of this probability, corresponding to the coexistence of the normal and tumor cells in abundance of nutrients, is almost not affected by radiotherapy. We have also found the coexistence of all species on the phase diagrams. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

During the experiment, the seedlings developed natural infestations by Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and powdery mildew. Several weeks after the start of the experiment a condition of diminishing prey availability was created by use of hexythiazox treatments. Without heterospecific competitors, T. pyri attained a higher population level than E. finlandicus or K. aberrans when similar amounts of food (spider mites) were available to each. Population growth of ir: pyri was decisively favoured by the presence of T. urticae. In the single-species systems each predatory species persisted to the end of the experiment in spite of diminishing prey. In two-species systems with T. pyri/E. finlandicus and T. pyri/K. aberrans that were started with the same number of individuals of each species, only T. pyri was left at the end of the experiment. Typhlodromus pyri became more numerous than the other species when prey was abundant (which was in accordance with the results of the single-species groups) and finally displaced E. finlandicus and K. aberrans towards the end of the experiment. The following factors may have contributed to the dominance of T. pyri: (1) the ability of adult females to survive longer without food than those of E. finlandicus and K. aberrans, (2) the ability to complete juvenile development and to sustain reproduction with phytoseiid prey and (3) an advantage in foraging behaviour over K. aberrans and E. finlandicus at low spider mite levels. Euseius finlandicus predominated in the two-species system E. finlandicus/K. aberrans, but both species persisted to the end of the experiment.","Inst Phytomed, Fed Off, A-1226 Vienna, Austria; Inst Phytomed, Agr Res Ctr, A-1226 Vienna, Austria","Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Entomol, 2046 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,"Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198",,,,32,21,23,0,6,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

While range expansions have been documented for a number of species, there is limited information on the ecological impacts of shifts on native species. Recently, abundances of tropically-associated gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) and lane snapper (Lutjanus synagris) have increased in seagrass nurseries in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), concurrent with regional increases in sea surface temperature. We investigated effects of increased abundances of these species on abundance and growth of pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), the dominant native species. Because juvenile pinfish and snappers share common prey, predators, and habitat, the high degree of niche overlap suggests an equally high potential for competition. We used a multiple before-after control impact design to determine whether increased snapper abundances significantly affected abundance or growth of pinfish. Trawl surveys at six locations in the northern GOM in summer and fall 2010 were used to calculate pinfish and snapper abundances. We identified three locations with high snapper abundances and three locations with no snapper and compared pinfish abundance and otolith-determined growth rates in these locations before and after snapper recruitment. Paired t tests and two-way analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in pinfish abundance or growth in the presence of snappers compared to locations and seasons without snappers. We conclude that range expansions of tropically associated snappers have had no significant effect on abundance or growth of native pinfish in northern GOM seagrass habitats.","[Gericke, Rebecca L.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Gericke, Rebecca L.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Fodrie, F.

Arctic foxes have been fully protected in Fennoscandia following their drastic decline in the early 19th century, and their lack of recovery has been hypothesized to result from increased interspecific competition with red foxes that have colonized the arctic fox's range and/or changes in prey dynamics due to increased variation in climatic conditions. We used a large-scale spatiotemporal study combined with an extensive red fox removal intervention to test these two hypotheses by evaluating the relative importance of diverse environmental factors affecting the recolonization of arctic foxes in Northern Norway. Arctic foxes were never observed at sites where just a few daily observations of red foxes were recorded, and the probability of recolonization was zero at sites where no red fox was removed. The probability of recolonization increased when lemming abundance was very high, but the relative importance of this variable was half that of red foxes. Thus, our results lend support to both hypotheses, but they clearly highlight the presence of red foxes as the factor most limiting arctic fox recolonization in this part of its distribution. As the abundance of arctic foxes has remained extremely low even after more than 70 years of full protection, direct conservation actions seem to be needed to promote the recovery of arctic fox populations. Our research therefore highlights that conservation actions targeting a major reduction in red fox numbers are needed because the competitive interaction with red foxes is the most important factor limiting recolonization of this species.

This has led to significant challenges in teasing apart the various mechanisms thought to underpin multispecies groups. One potentially useful approach for gaining an understanding of this process is to identify the rules that best predict the observed distribution of individuals across these groups. In order to gain an insight into the decision-making process that might generate patterns of heterospecific associations, we collected data on the number and distribution of nests in breeding colonies that contained 3 species of weaverbird. We found no evidence of segregation by species, either within or between colonies. Using agent-based simulations of males applying different rules of attraction and repulsion to conspecifics or heterospecifics, we found that the best-fitting rule contained no heterospecific attraction. In this rule, individuals picked colonies based on an optimal distribution of conspecific nests. Given that nests are an important sexual signal in weavers, our findings suggest that this rule is biologically relevant: Males are seeking an optimal trade-off between attracting females via lekking and competing for mates if too many conspecific nests are present.","[Farine, Damien R.; Downing, Philip A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Downing, Charles P.] Uganda Virus Res Inst, Entebbe, Uganda","Downing, PA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",philip.downing@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Downing, Philip/AAZ-7086-2020; Farine, Damien R./Y-2454-2019","Downing, Philip/0000-0002-5286-3153; Farine, Damien R./0000-0003-2208-7613",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [AdG 250164]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [1222007] Funding Source: researchfish,D.R.F. was funded by an European Research Council grant (AdG 250164) awarded to Prof. Ben C.

We consider here a generalization with four species, the minimum number of species allowing other interactions beyond the single loop (one predator, one prey). We show that, contrary to the mean field prediction, on a square lattice the model presents a transition, as the parameter setting the rate at which one species invades another changes, from a coexistence to a state in which one species gets extinct. Such a dependence on the invasion rates shows that the interaction graph structure alone is not enough to predict the outcome of such models.

Thirty colonies of each species collected in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, reproduced sexually during a temporary stay in a 30-m(3) closed system from November 2001-January 2002. Twelve months later, the F1 generation of F. fragum started reproducing and formed an F2 generation. No reproduction of the F1 recruits of A. humilis was observed. Two years after the introduction of the field colonies, sexual recruits of both species were assessed using two different methods: recruits were estimated using quadrats (quadrat sampling method) and the total number of recruits was counted by creating a map of the artificial rock work divided in distinct areas (area census method). Recruitment rates of F. fragum were highest for the F2 generation on horizontal surfaces (area census method: 137.9 +/- 191.7 recruits m(-2); quadrat sampling method: 272.0 +/- 254.8 recruits m(-2); mean +/- SD) and were overall lowest for the 171 generation on overhanging areas of the tank (area census method: 3.8 +/- 4.0 recruits m(-2); quadrat sampling method: 4.0 +/- 6.1 recruits m(-2); mean +/- SD recruits m(-2)). The populations of both species showed similar patterns independent of the applied assessment method with highest densities on horizontal surfaces followed by vertical surfaces and lowest densities on overhanging surfaces; however, both methods showed conflicting results when the influence of the surface orientation on the population densities was statistically analyzed. The maximum density of A. humilis (1.4 +/- 2.7 recruits m(-2) on horizontal surfaces) was much lower than the maximum density of the F1 generation of F. fragum (24.7 +/- 18.3 recruits m(-2)). Colony sizes of recruits within each population (F. fragum F1: 3.12 +/- 0.98 cm, F2: 0.83 +/- 0.41 cm; A. humilis F1: 3.79 +/- 1.35 cm; maximum diameter +/- SD) did not differ between different orientations (horizontal vs. vertical vs. overhanging). Calculated growth rates in the aquarium reflected those observed for F. fragum in the field, whereas A. humilis showed slower growth in the aquarium than in the field. Factors such as competition, sedimentation, and predation, that generally reduce in situ recruitment may be excluded in captivity resulting in far higher recruitment rates. This study confirms that aquarium exhibits can serve as a comparative model to study the ecology of corals under semi-controlled conditions. Zoo Biol 26:75-91, 2007.

The unified neutral theory of biodiversity(5,6) and related theories(7,8) based on these fundamental population processes have successfully recreated general species-abundance patterns without accounting for either the variation among species and individuals or resource-releasing processes such as predation and disturbance, long emphasized in ecological theory(9-14). If ecological communities can be described adequately without estimating variation in species and their interactions(15), our understanding of ecological community organization and the predicted consequences of reduced biodiversity and environmental change would shift markedly. Here, I introduce a strong method to test the neutral theory that combines field parameterization of the underlying population dynamics with a field experiment, and apply it to a rocky intertidal community. Although the observed abundance-frequency distribution of the system follows that predicted by the neutral theory, the neutral theory predicts poorly the field experimental results, indicating an essential role for variation in species interactions.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Wootton, JT (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",twootton@uchicago.edu,"Wootton, J.

We report the population dynamics of two species of treefrogs, the spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) and the chorus frog (P. triseriata), in 37 ponds over 11 years. We examined the relation between larval traits of these species and responses to environmental change (a severe drought) at the local (pond) level, and the consequences to regional dynamics of the species. Consistent with experimental evidence, predators limited abundances of both species, competitive effects were undetectable, and pond hydroperiod and forest canopy cover affected species' presences and population sizes. The drought caused strong reductions in pond hydroperiods and predator densities, which led to increases in colonization probability and decreases in extinction probability for the chorus frog. These habitat dynamics resulted in the colonization of 15 new ponds and exponential growth in regional population size of the chorus frog. Colonization probability was positively related to pond connectivity. Pond occupancy rates for the spring peeper were relatively constant, but important source ponds on the landscape changed with the drought. Ponds with extensive forest canopy cover were sink habitats for both species, and high pond connectivity appeared to be necessary to maintain species' presences in these habitats. Landscape dynamics were responsible for changes in the fundamental spatial structure of species' populations, e. g., the chorus frog transitioned between approximations of a classic metapopulation and a patchy population over the course of the study. Many of these results were driven by the interplay of climate variation and spatial food web structure, indicating the importance of incorporating this interaction into metacommunity theory. Our results further indicate the crucial role of habitat (pond) heterogeneity to species persistence, i.e., moderating the potential Moran effects of spatially correlated weather conditions. Overall this study illustrates: (1) how natural systems constantly transition between metapopulation/metacommunity states typically treated as static in the literature, (2) the extensive interconnection of phenomena at different scales in ecology, and (3) the importance of habitat heterogeneity and landscape context for amphibian conservation strategies.","[Werner, Earl E.; Davis, Christopher J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Relyea, Rick A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Yurewicz, Kerry L.] Plymouth State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Plymouth, NH 03264 USA; [Skelly, David K.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Werner, EE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",eewerner@umich.edu,"Skelly, David/D-3878-2013",,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-9727014, DEB-0454519]","We thank the many individuals who participated in collection of the field data.

At Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we compiled the first food web quantifying trophic interactions between the majority of co-occurring woody plant species and their internally feeding insect seed predators. Our study is based on more than 200 000 fruits representing 478 plant species, associated with 369 insect species. Insect host-specificity was remarkably high: only 20% of seed predator species were associated with more than one plant species, while each tree species experienced seed predation from a median of two insect species. Phylogeny, but not plant traits, explained patterns of seed predator attack. These data suggest that seed predators are unlikely to mediate indirect interactions such as apparent competition between plant species, but are consistent with their proposed contribution to maintaining plant diversity via the Janzen-Connell mechanism.","[Gripenberg, Sofia] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Gripenberg, Sofia; Wright, S.

However, despite the hypothesized importance of niche partitioning, we know relatively little about the underlying mechanisms. For example, differences in resource use may be fixed consequences of organism traits, or they may be achieved via context-dependent behaviors. In this study we investigated mechanisms of microhabitat partitioning using eight species of marine mesograzers inhabiting seagrass and algae habitats, using laboratory trials to measure microhabitat use in the presence and absence of both predators and competitors. We found clear evidence for microhabitat partitioning between the species, which account for over 60% of the mesograzers commonly found in this system and vary in both body size and the ability to build tubes on habitat substrates. Species-specific microhabitat use was poorly predicted by these two traits, but remained remarkably consistent across contexts. Habitat use was not affected by the presence of fish predators common in this system, even though predation pressure is thought to place strong constraints on microhabitat in communities of plant-associated arthropods. The presence of competing species also did not affect the relative separation of microhabitat use. Behavioral responses to potential competitors did cause significant changes in microhabitat use in all of the smallest species, but these changes did not depend on competitor identity and were relatively small compared to among-species patterns of microhabitat partitioning. The consistency of species-specific microhabitat use, regardless of the presence of predators or competitors, should make coexistence most likely among species that differ in these choices. For these species, it appears that the benefits accrued from their selected microhabitats are not affected by species interactions, or that any benefits of alternative microhabitat use are outweighed by risks associated with movement.","[Lurig, Moritz D.; Best, Rebecca J.] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol Eawag, Seestr 79, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Lurig, Moritz D.] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, ACE, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stachowicz, John J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Stachowicz, John J.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Lurig, MD (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol Eawag, Seestr 79, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland.; Lurig, MD (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, ACE, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",moritz.luerig@eawag.ch,"Best, Rebecca/D-2934-2013","Best, Rebecca/0000-0003-2103-064X; Lurig, Moritz/0000-0002-8175-6234","German Academic Exchange ServiceDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 1336741, OCE 1234345]; Division Of Ocean SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1234345] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank Elena Huynh for assistance with field and laboratory work, the Aquatic Resources Group (ARG) at the Bodega Marine Laboratory for fish collections, and Bodega Marine Laboratory staff for technical assistance.

In Ireland, the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) competitively tests the speed and agility of two greyhounds by using a live hare as a lure. Each coursing club is associated with a number of discrete localities, known as preserves, which are managed favourably for hares including predator control, prohibition of other forms of hunting such as shooting and poaching and the maintenance and enhancement of suitable hare habitat. We indirectly tested the efficacy of such management by comparing hare abundance within preserves to that in the wider countryside. In real terms, mean hare density was 18 times higher, and after controlling for variance in habitat remained 3 times higher, within ICC preserves than the wider countryside. Whilst we cannot rule out the role of habitat, our results suggest that hare numbers are maintained at high levels in ICC preserves either because clubs select areas of high hare density and subsequently have a negligible effect on numbers or that active population management positively increases hare abundance. The Irish hare Lepus timidus hibernicus Bell, 1837 is one of the highest priority species for conservation action in Ireland and without concessions for its role in conservation, any change in the legal status Of hare coursing under animal welfare grounds, may necessitate an increase in Government subsidies for conservation on private land together with a strengthened capacity for legislation enforcement.","[Reid, Neil; Montgomery, W.

Freshwater mussels fertilize stream foodwebs through nutrient excretion, and mussel species-specific excretion rates depend on environmental conditions. We asked how differences in mussel diversity in varying environments influence the dynamics between primary producers and consumers. We conducted Weld experiments manipulating mussel richness under summer (low flow, high temperature) and fall (moderate flow and temperature) conditions, measured nutrient limitation, algal biomass and grazing chironomid abundance, and analyzed the data with non-transgressive overyielding and tripartite biodiversity partitioning analyses. Algal biomass and chironomid abundance were best explained by trait-independent complementarity among mussel species, but the relationship between biodiversity effects across trophic levels (algae and grazers) depended on seasonal differences in mussel species' trait expression (nutrient excretion and activity level). Both species identity and overall diversity effects were related to the magnitude of nutrient limitation. Our results demonstrate that biodiversity of a resource-provisioning (nutrients and habitat) group of species influences foodweb dynamics and that understanding species traits and environmental context are important for interpreting biodiversity experiments.","[Spooner, Daniel E.; Vaughn, Caryn C.; Galbraith, Heather S.] Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Spooner, Daniel E.; Vaughn, Caryn C.; Galbraith, Heather S.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Vaughn, Caryn C.] Univ Oklahoma, Grad Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Spooner, DE (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, No Appalachian Res Lab, Wellsboro, PA 16901 USA.",dspooner45@gmail.com,"Vaughn, Caryn C/D-8534-2011",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0211010]; Oklahoma Biological Survey,"We thank T.

For amphipods in the Hyalella azteca species complex, divergence in body size appears to be driven by adaptation to disparate regimes of size-biased mortality experienced in different habitat types. Here I ask how size and size-related traits influence competitive ability of large-bodied and small-bodied species. I examined competitive ability in both species using a factorial experiment in which the performance of each species was assessed in all combinations of the presence and absence of the heterospecific amphipod species crossed with the presence and absence of a snail species. Results demonstrated that the large and small Hyalella species differ substantially in competitive ability, with the large species being the superior general competitor. The competitive effect of the large species on the small species was substantial and caused significant reductions in abundance, body size, and fecundity of the small species. In contrast, performance of the large species was not affected significantly by presence of the small species. This competitive asymmetry was also seen in competitive interactions with snails. The small species appears to trade off competitive ability in order to survive in habitats with predatory fish, whereas the large species. which is able to obtain a size refuge from predation, has traits that confer strong competitive ability. Because of habitat differences in the cost-benefit structure of the trade-off, however, competition-mediated natural selection may be more intense in the large species than in the small species, a condition that may enhance evolutionary divergence in body size.","Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Biol Stn, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Wellborn, GA (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",gwellborn@ou.cdu,,,,,,51,60,62,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2002,83,1,,,,,129,136,,10.2307/2680126,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,508YQ,WOS:000173117700012,,,,,2021-09-27,

By analogy to the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, we would expect species diversity to peak at intermediate predator densities. In a replicated artificial pool experiment, we examined the relationships between density of the backswimmer Notonecta maculata (0, 1, 2, and 4 per 30 l pool) and invertebrate taxon diversity over an 11-week period of predator occupancy. Diversity reached high levels at high predator density sooner than at intermediate density. At the end of the experiment, taxon diversity was greatest at densities of 2 and 4 Notonecta per pool. While the overall predator density-diversity curve was in line with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, the reduction in diversity from intermediate to high predator density was not statistically significant. Density of the preferred prey Daphnia magna decreased with Notonecta density, while densities of the smaller cladocerans Moina brachiata and Ceriodaphnia spp. increased. Suppression of Daphnia at high Notonecta densities may partially explain the increase in Moina and Ceriodaphnia densities. However, most of the relationship between Notonecta and the smaller cladocerans appears to be independent of Daphnia, suggesting complex interactions within the community. Our results suggest that keystone predation plays a strong role in structuring this community. Although diversity did not decrease significantly at the highest predator density as predicted, such a decrease may be more likely for pools with longer durations of predator occupancy or with higher predator densities.","[Eitam, Avi; Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Community Ecol Lab, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Eitam, Avi; Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel","Eitam, A (corresponding author), USDA APHIS PPQ, 8995 E Main St,Bromfield Bldg,Suite 202, Reynoldsburg, OH 43147 USA.",eitam@yahoo.com,,,Vataat Postdoctoral Fellowship; US-Israel Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [98-390],"We thank Jamie Kneitel, two anonymous reviewers and the subject editor for critical comments on the manuscript, Jonathan Chase, Moshe Kiflawi, and Marc Mangel for fruitful discussion, Julia Vider for statistical consultation, and Kay Van Damme and Koen Martens for taxonomic assistance.

Identifying the biological causes of density dependence has, however, proved difficult in many systems. In this study we tested whether adults of three species of reef fish (all gobies) suffered density-dependent mortality, and whether the density-dependent component of mortality was caused by predation. We used field experiments to test for density dependence in each prey species, manipulating the presence of predators and prey density in a factorial design. Prey were stocked on replicate patches of reef constructed of natural materials, with each reef receiving a different density of gobies. Predatory fishes were excluded from half of the reefs using a combination of removals and exclusion cages. Survival of the first species, Lythrypnus dalli, was high and density independent on reefs free of predators, but declined rapidly with increasing density on reefs to which predators had access. Density dependence in L. dalli was thus a result of mortality inflicted by predatory fishes. In the second species, Coryphopterus nicholsii, predators caused a large reduction in the survival in one experiment but had a negligible effect in a second experiment. More importantly, though, survival of C. nicholsii was always independent of its density, regardless of predator presence. In the final species. Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, two separate experiments showed that natural changes in adult abundance (experiment 1) and survival of stocked adults (experiment 2) were density-dependent regardless of predator presence. Both experiments thus indicated that the density-dependent component of loss in C. glaucofraenum was caused, at least in part, by an interaction other than predation. The presence, intensity, and biological cause of density-dependent survival were thus strikingly different for each of these three fishes, despite the fact that they are taxonomically closely related and ecologically similar. These findings suggest a need for further studies aimed at predicting under what circumstances different mechanisms of population regulation will operate.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Organism Biol Ecol & Evolut, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Forrester, GE (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Ctr Biol Sci, Dept Biol Sci, 100 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X",,,,75,58,58,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2000,81,9,,,,,2416,2427,,,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,350GW,WOS:000089093500006,,,,,2021-09-27,

H. helluo can out-compete P. milvina, but its population densities are limited by its colonization ability. However, even after repeated additions in soybean habitats, H. helluo seldom sustains high population densities. Our research focuses on whether emigration might explain this pattern. Relying on mark-recapture techniques, we tested the role of habitat quality and presence of heterospecifies as factors initiating emigration of H. helluo and P. milvina from suitable habitat patches. We assessed emigration by trapping spiders (with pitfall traps) at the outer edge of an unfavorable habitat (tilled soybean field) surrounding either no-till or mulched habitats (i.e., addition of straw), the latter representing an increase in habitat quality. Spiders were added to enclosures with con- or eterospecifies. Experiments were conducted twice, and ran for 4 d, at which time captures of marked spiders were low. Results showed H. helluo emigration was influenced by habitat quality because it was captured leaving no-till habitat significantly more often than exiting mulched habitats. In contrast, P. milvina activity was not driven by changes in habitat, and as such has more habitat versatility than H. helluo. The presence of con- or heterospecifies did not alter the propensity of either species to leave experimental units. H. helluo population densities are therefore limited by both its ability to colonize soybean fields and by its propensity to emigrate if suitable habitat is not available.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Buddle, CN (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21-111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",,,"Buddle, Christopher/0000-0002-7494-9732",,,,44,19,20,0,14,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Interannual variation in seasonal weather patterns causes shifts in the relative timing of phenological events of species within communities, but we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of how these phenological shifts affect species interactions. Identifying these mechanisms is critical to predicting how interannual variation affects populations and communities. 2. Species' phenologies, particularly the timing of offspring arrival, play an important role in the annual cycles of community assembly. We hypothesize that shifts in relative arrival of off-spring can alter interspecific interactions through a mechanism called size-mediated priority effects (SMPE), in which individuals that arrive earlier can grow to achieve a body size advantage over those that arrive later. 3. In this study, we used an experimental approach to isolate and quantify the importance of SMPE for species interactions. Specifically, we simulated shifts in relative arrival of the nymphs of two dragonfly species to determine the consequences for their interactions as intraguild predators. 4. We found that shifts in relative arrival altered not only predation strength but also the nature of predator-prey interactions. When arrival differences were great, SMPE allowed the early arriver to prey intensely upon the late arriver, causing exclusion of the late arriver from nearly all habitats. As arrival differences decreased, the early arriver's size advantage also decreased. When arrival differences were smallest, there was mutual predation, and the two species coexisted in similar abundances across habitats. Importantly, we also found a nonlinear scaling relationship between shifts in relative arrival and predation strength. Specifically, small shifts in relative arrival caused large changes in predation strength while subsequent changes had relatively minor effects. 5. These results demonstrate that SMPE can alter not only the outcome of interactions but also the demographic rates of species and the structure of communities. Elucidating the mechanisms that link phenological shifts to species interactions is crucial for understanding the dynamics of seasonal communities as well as for predicting the effects of climate change on these communities.","[Rasmussen, Nick L.; Van Allen, Benjamin G.; Rudolf, Volker H.

Although it is widely assumed that invasive species impact will increase with density, theory suggests interspecific competition may diminish at high densities due to increased intraspecific interactions. To test this theory, we experimentally examined intra- and interspecific interactions between a globally invasive fish, round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and three native species at different round goby densities in a tributary of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Eighteen 2.25 m(2) enclosures were stocked with native fish species at natural abundances, while round gobies were stocked at three different densities: 0 m(-2), 2.7 m(-2), and 10.7 m(-2). After 52 days, native fish growth rate was significantly reduced in the low density goby treatment, while growth in the high density goby treatment mirrored the goby-free treatment for two of three native species. Invertebrate density and gut content weight of native fishes did not differ among treatments. Conversely, gut content weight and growth of round gobies were lower in the high goby density treatment, suggesting interactions between round gobies and native fishes are mediated by interference competition amongst gobies. Our experiment provides evidence that invasive species effects may diminish at high densities, possibly due to increased intraspecific interactions. This is consistent with some ecological theory, and cautions against the assumption that invasive species at moderate densities have low impact.","[Kornis, Matthew S.; Carlson, Jedchada; Lehrer-Brey, Gabrielle; Vander Zanden, M.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of crab species and site on the pattern of shell use, selection, and preference in the south-western Atlantic hermit crabs Pagurus brevidactylus and Pagurus criniticornis, comparing sympatric and allopatric populations. Differently from the traditional approach to evaluate shell preference by simply determining the shell selection pattern (i.e., the number of shells of each type selected), preference was defined (according to [Liszka, D., Underwood, AJ., 1990. An experimental design to determine preferences for gastropod shells by a hermit-crab. J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol., 137(1), 47-62]) by the comparison of the number of crabs changing for a particular shell type when three options were given (Cerithium atratum, Morula nodulosa, and Tegula viridula) with the number of crabs changing for this same type when only this type was offered. The effect of crab species was tested at Cabelo Gordo Beach, where P. brevidacrylus was found occupying shells of C. atratum, M. nodulosa, and T viridula in similar frequencies, whereas P. criniticornis occupied predominantly shells of C atratum. In laboratory experiments the selection patterns of the two hermit-crab species for these three gastropods were different, with P criniticornis selecting mainly shells of C atratum, and R brevidactylus selecting more shells of M. nodulosa. The shell preference was also dependent on crab species, with P. criniticornis showing a clear preference for shells of C atratum, whereas P. brevidactylus did not show a preference for any of the tested shells. The effect of site was tested for the two species comparing data from Cabelo Gordo to Preta (P brevidactylus) and Araca beaches (P. criniticornis). The pattern of shell use, selection, and preference was demonstrated to be dependent on site only for P. brevidactylus. The results also showed that the shell use pattern of P criniticornis can be explained by its preference at both sites, whereas for P. brevidactylus it occurred only at Cabelo Gordo, where the absence of preference was correlated with the similar use of the three gastropod species studied. Finally, the results showed that the shell selection pattern cannot be considered as a measure of shell preference, since it overestimates crab selectivity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, surprisingly few tests of this idea exist, especially for metazoans feeding on a self-renewing resource. Here we examined the effect of density-independent mortality on the coexistence of four species of pond zooplankton (microcrustacean grazers) in a series of laboratory microcosms. Across the experimental mortality gradient, consumer biomass decreased and resource abundance increased with an increase in mortality. Thus, the treatments resulted in an increase in resource availability per consumer (one measure of reduced competitive intensity). There was no significant effect of mortality treatment on species relative abundances or species evenness, and the zooplankter Diaphanosoma dominated community biomass at all mortality levels. Mortality rate did have a marginally significant effect on species richness (p<0.07), but richness did not increase monotonically with mortality level. Instead, richness tended to be highest in the low- and no-mortality treatments.","Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI USA; Radford Univ, Dept Biol, Radford, VA 24142 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Mittelbach, GG (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",mittelbach@kbs.msu.edu,"Mittelbach, Gary/A-2470-2013; Garcia, Erica/B-4142-2012","Mittelbach, Gary/0000-0001-6971-9273; Garcia, Erica/0000-0002-1186-9700",,,,43,7,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2004,107,2,,,,,415,421,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13182.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,853XE,WOS:000223863100020,,,,,2021-09-27,

Two experiments tested the hypothesis that microhabitat distributions of species change in response to competitors whose distributions are controlled by variation across the landscape at a larger scale. In the first experiment we created replicated seeps (continuously moist patches) 3 m and 15 m from streams. Desmognathus fuscus, a streamside species, be.-an to increase in density at streamside seeps and to colonize distant seeps within 1.5 mo of their construction. Plethodon cinereus, a small terrestrial species, initially responded favorably to distant seeps but was displaced as seeps were colonized by streamside species. The D. fuscus colonists remained on distant plots with seeps 22 mo after water to seeps was turned off and the habitat had returned to pretreatment conditions. On streamside plots P. cinereus occurred at low densities initially and was quickly displaced by D. fuscus from portions of the plots near seeps. Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, a large streamside species, and Plethodon glutinosus, a large terrestrial species, were less abundant but exhibited responses that were similar to those of D. fuscus and P. cinereus, respectively. In the second experiment we created seeps in upland forests > 30 in from the nearest stream or natural seep, more than twice as far front a source of colonists as the distant seeps in the first experiment. The creation of seeps was crossed with the addition of logs and rocks as cover objects in a replicated factorial design. Plethodon cinereus became more abundant and had greater mass adjusted for body size on plots with seeps than on control plots. Abundance of P. cinereus also increased with the addition of cover objects. Plethodon glutinosus was on affected by the seeps. Streamside salamanders were rare or absent on all plots. These experiments demonstrate that the response of a species to an environmental perturbation can depend on the spatial context and presence of competitors or predators, and that the response may persist much longer than the perturbation itself.","Mt Lake Biol Stn, Pembroke, VA 24136 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Grover, MC (corresponding author), Feather River Coll, Dept Nat Resources, 570 Golden Eagle Ave, Quincy, CA 95971 USA.",,,,,,,56,43,46,0,30,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2002,83,8,,,,,2112,2123,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2112:EOEIBS]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,583WP,WOS:000177434200006,,,,,2021-09-27,

(2) does this relation depend on the size of the areas (spatial scale) at which it is measured? (3) what is the relation between parasitoid search rate and host density? and (4) what is the relation between parasitoid distribution and host distribution? To answer these questions a cotton field was artificially infested with various densities of Heliothis virescens (F.). M. croceipes was released uniformly across the field. At the scale of 30 by 60 m plots, the proportion of hosts parasitized by M. croceipes (adjusted for competition with other parasitoid species) increased from 0.41 +/- 0.08 (xBAR +/- SE) to 0.60 +/- 0.06 as host density increased from 6,178 to 16,896 larvae/ha. The calculated search rate (area searched per parasitoid per unit time) of M. croceipes was independent of host density, and the density dependence in parasitism by M. croceipes could be explained completely by density dependence in adult female distribution. Natural populations of Cardiochiles nigriceps Viereck and Cotesia marginiventris (Cresson) parasitized 9 and 7%, respectively, of the hosts collected. At the scale of plots, parasitism by C. nigriceps increased with host density, but parasitism by C. marginiventris was independent of host density. At the scale of 1 by 2 m quadrats, parasitism by all species was independent of host density. We discuss the implications of these results for biological control of Heliothis virescens and Helicoverpa zea and for theories of parasitoid foraging and population regulation.","USDA ARS, SO FIELD CROP INSECT MANAGEMENT LAB, STONEVILLE, MS 38776 USA",,,,,,,,58,19,19,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

The effect of seed predation will depend on how the strength of predation differs across species and environments, and on the degree to which seed loss at one life-cycle phase increases fitness at another phase. Few studies have simultaneously quantified predispersal and postdispersal predation in co-occurring rare and common congeners, despite the value of estimating both for understanding causes of rarity. METHODS: We quantified predispersal seed predation on the rare, herbaceous species Lupinus tidestromii (Fabaceae) and its common, shrubby congener L. chamissonis across multiple years in the same community. We experimentally measured postdispersal seed predation at two seed densities and locations near or far from an exotic grass housing high densities of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), their primary, native seed predator. KEY RESULTS: The common L. chamissonis had the lowest predispersal seed predation of the two lupine species, potentially because of its height: its high racemes received less predation than those low to the ground. By contrast, the same species experienced higher postdispersal seed predation, and at predators traveled long distances away from refuge habitat to consume their seeds. Across both plant species, mice preferentially predated high-density seed sources. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show differences in the magnitude and direction of seed predation between the species across different life-cycle phases. We demonstrated possible roles of proximity to refuge habitat, seed density, and seed size in these patterns. Congeneric comparisons would benefit from a comprehensive framework that considers seed predation across different life-cycle phases and the environmental context of predation.","[Pardini, Eleanor A.] Washington Univ, Environm Studies, 1 Brookings Dr,Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Patten, Melissa V.] San Francisco State Univ, Romberg Tiburon Ctr Environm Studies, 3150 Paradise Dr, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA; [Knight, Tiffany M.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Knight, Tiffany M.] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Research UFZ, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Knight, Tiffany M.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Pardini, EA (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Environm Studies, 1 Brookings Dr,Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",epardini@wustl.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0743731]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Alexander von Humboldt Professorship of T.M.KAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; The Washington University Environmental Studies Program and Washington University Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship","The authors thank L.

A cage experiment was conducted in a macrophyte habitat in the Aland islands located in the northern Baltic Sea. Round gobies (13.5 +/- 0.8 cm) affected macroinvertebrate biodiversity from a taxonomic and a trait-based point of view. Specifically, round goby decreased overall abundance, biomass and taxon richness of epifaunal invertebrates. Additionally, taxonomic and trait-based composition were affected, as the gobies reduced abundances of common bivalve (Cerastoderma spp. and Mytilus sp.) and gastropod species (Hydrobia spp.), and thereby modified the relative trait composition of the invertebrate assemblages. Round gobies consumed mainly larger epifaunal individuals leading to an overall decrease in invertebrate body size. Such alterations in taxonomic and trait-based diversity and composition of invertebrate communities through round goby predation may have implications for native fish species and other trophic levels in the respective food webs through food competition and trophic cascades. Round gobies might therefore affect ecosystem processes in invaded areas, and thus influence ecosystem functioning and services.","[Henseler, Christina; Nordstrom, Marie C.; Snickars, Martin; Toernroos, Anna; Bonsdorff, Erik] Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Artillerigatan 6, Turku 20520, Finland; [Henseler, Christina; Oesterwind, Daniel; Kotterba, Paul] Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany","Henseler, C (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Artillerigatan 6, Turku 20520, Finland.; Henseler, C (corresponding author), Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany.",christina.henseler@thuenen.de,"Nordstrom, Marie C./C-8956-2012","Nordstrom, Marie C./0000-0001-5763-1813",BONUS Bio-C3 project [03F0682B]; Abo Akademi University doctoral network FunMarBio; MARmaED project from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [675997]; profiling area The Sea at Abo Akademi University,"This study has utilized research infrastructure facilities provided by FINMARI (Finnish Marine Research Infrastructure network), and was partly funded by the BONUS Bio-C3 project (Art 185, Grant No. 03F0682B).

The latter two hypotheses are versions of Tilman's R*-hypothesis, which suggests that the species that is able to survive under the lowest resource concentrations will win in competition, but they differ in the role of body size determining R*. We used a laboratory model system of four species of Daphnia commonly occurring in ponds and rock-pools in the northern temperate zone, D. magna, D. pulex, D. obtusa and D. longispina (in order of decreasing adult body size), and the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda as food. Life-table and competition experiments were focused on the factors explaining the good competitive ability of D. obtusa. One-, two-and four-species experiments were run without predation and under different predation profiles mimicking vertebrate and invertebrate predators. Life-history traits of D. obtusa under high food conditions at 20degreesC were measured and compared with previous measurements on the other three species. D. obtusa was the superior species in most situations, except under high invertebrate predation when the large D. magna was superior. The outcomes did not depend on the specific composition of the zooplankton community (two or four species present initially). Mean population sizes of all four species were higher in experiments with fewer species, indicating strong interspecific competition also under predation. D. obtusa had a higher intrinsic rate of increase (r) than the other three species studied. Therefore, our results mainly support the r-max-hypothesis. We suggest that a competitive hierarchy among the four Daphnia species may exist, but the relative positions of the species in the hierarchy may vary with environmental conditions like the type of predator present, food quality and quantity, and temperature. Competitive ability did not seem to be strongly related to body size.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Zool, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Milbrink, G (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Anim Ecol, Norbyvagen 18B, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",Goran.Milbrink@ebc.uu.se,"Bengtsson, Jan/AAF-2325-2021",,,,,52,6,7,0,24,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

The global redistribution of species is a prominent impact of climate change and human-mediated biological invasions and often results in negative impacts to ecosystems. Recently, a species of colonial tunicate not previously present, Clavelina oblonga, has become prominent within the marine fouling community of Beaufort, North Carolina, USA. Fifty years ago, researchers tested theories of ecological succession developed in terrestrial systems and found that this marine community was characterized by a heterogeneous mixture of species that varied inter-annually (i.e., multiple community states) and increased in diversity over time. A recent follow-up study found that the fouling community is dominated by C. oblonga with patterns of community development and structure that led to the loss of alternative community states, domination by C. oblonga, and reduced species diversity. The present study addressed the question: Will patterns of community development identified over 50 yr ago still operate under reduced cover of invasive C. oblonga? This study also quantified the impacts of two large-scale environmental disturbances (extremely cold winter and hurricane) on the abundance of C. oblonga and the resulting fouling community. Clavelina oblonga remains a dominant component of the fouling community due to its rapid growth and strong seasonal recruitment. Under conditions of reduced percent cover of C. oblonga, the local fouling community displayed unique community states that became even more distinct over time, consistent with the pattern of multiple community states identified by researchers over 50 yr ago, and that were dependent upon date of disturbance. Natural disturbances in this study caused by a harsh winter and a hurricane greatly reduced the presence of C. oblonga. This experiment advanced our understanding of marine community ecology by testing whether the concept of multiple community states identified over 50 yr ago is still operable in the absence of invasive C. oblonga, and highlights how natural environment disturbances can potentially moderate the spread of this invasive tunicate.","[Christianson, Kayla A.; Eggleston, David B.] North Carolina State Univ, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Eggleston, DB (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA.",eggleston@ncsu.edu,,"Eggleston, David/0000-0001-7840-2665",North Carolina Sea Grant [R12-HCE-2]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1155609],"We thank members of the NC State University Marine Ecology and Conservation Lab for help and guidance in completing both the fieldwork and data analyses for this project, and Ms. Caroline Rooks for her dedicated assistance with the field sampling.

However, there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of various factors on interspecific competition. In this study, both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches were employed to investigate how various combinations of the initial cell densities of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chlorella vulgaris and copper exposure levels affect interspecific competition between these species. In the simulation results, C. vulgaris appeared to be superior to P. subcapitata in the absence of copper exposure. However, in the copper-exposed groups, the competitive positions of both algal species varied with the initial cell density and the copper exposure level. In particular, at the highest copper concentration (10 mu g/L), C. vulgaris became less competitive than P. subcapitata in most initial cell density combinations, resulting in a shift in competitive dominance. This study clearly showed that the dominant species in the interspecific competition could be altered by the two factors studied herein. The developed model provided a more detailed and intuitive understanding of the effects of the two factors on the interspecific competition by simulating the competition at various combinations of initial algal density and copper exposure levels. In this study, the initial algal density and copper exposure levels were selected as the factors influencing the interspecific competition between P. subcapitata and C. vulgaris, but the proposed model could be used to study the effects of other toxicants on the interspecific competition between other algal species.","[Kim, Yongeun] Korea Univ, OJERI, Inst Environm & Ecol, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Son, Jino; Lee, Yun-Sik] Korea Univ, Ojeong Ecoresilience Inst, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Mo, Hyoung-Ho] Anim & Plant Quarantine Agcy, Jungbu Reg Off, Incheon 22133, South Korea; [Cho, Kijong] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea","Cho, K (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",kjcho@korea.ac.kr,,,Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as The Chemical Accident Prevention Technology Development Project [2016001970003]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2017R1A6A3A11035451],This subject is supported by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as The Chemical Accident Prevention Technology Development Project.

The relative importance of each type of interaction is usually a function of the relative size of the organisms involved. This study used field experiments to assess potential size-dependent interactions among small juvenile killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) and grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and larger adult killifish. Density, species combinations, and predation risk were manipulated within field enclosures on an intertidal salt marsh on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects between small juveniles (larval killifish and postlarval grass shrimp) were examined in the absence and presence of predators (larger adult killifish) to determine interactions and modifications of interactions due to predators. In the absence of predators both negative intraspecific and interspecific effects occurred in the form of reduced growth of juvenile grass shrimp. Survival of juvenile shrimp was the same in the presence or absence of juvenile killifish. However, when larger adult killifish were present, the interspecific competitive effect of reduced growth in juvenile grass shrimp was not significantly different from controls. Growth and survival of juvenile fish were unaffected by increased density of conspecific juveniles and the presence of juvenile grass shrimp and adult fish predators. These results provide field evidence for interspecific competitive interactions between juveniles of two of the most abundant species of nekton utilizing salt marsh habitat along the eastern coast of North America. However, when larger adult killifish predators were present these interspecific competitive effects among similar sized juvenile killifish and grass shrimp disappeared. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The common spiny mouse (A. cahirinus) is nocturnally active whereas the golden spiny mouse (A. russatus) is diurnally active. An early removal study suggested that competition accounts for this pattern of temporal partitioning: the golden spiny mouse is forced into diurnal activity by its congener. Theoretically, temporal segregation should facilitate coexistence if the shared limiting resources differ at different times (primarily among predators whose prey populations have activity rhythms), or if they are renewed within the period of the temporal segregation. We studied food preferences of the two Acomys species in a controlled cafeteria experiment in order to assess resource overlap and the potential for competition for food between the two species. We found no significant difference in food preferences between species. The dietary items preferred by both were arthropods. We also carried out a seasonal study of the percentage and identity of arthropods taken in the field by individuals of the two species. Individuals of both species took on annual; average a high percentage of arthropods in their diets. Seasonal diet shifts reflect seasonal abundance of arthropods at Fin Gedi during day and night. Diurnal activity may also reduce interspecific interference competition between A. russatus and A. cahirinus. However, the strong interspecific dietary overlap in food preference, the heavy reliance on arthropods in spiny mouse diets, and the seasonal and circadian differences in arthropod consumption suggest that prey partitioning may be a viable mechanism of coexistence in this system.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Kronfeld-Schor, N (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",Kronfeld@bu.edu,"Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/AAU-3792-2020","Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/0000-0002-5224-3341",,,,52,81,85,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1999,121,1,,,,,123,128,,10.1007/s004420050913,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245WT,WOS:000083131600014,28307881,,,,2021-09-27,

Field studies of predation included experimentally tethering sea urchins (Predation Index), visual transects of fish to estimate the predator biomass and Line transects of reef substrate rugosity (bottom contour complexity) which allowed for five possible measures of the hypothesized limiting resource refuge from predators. The amount of refuge was used to predict the abundance of individual species of sea urchin, species richness and diversity. It was predicted from pervious manipulative species interaction studies that the top competitor in the guild (Echinometra mathaei (de Blainville)) would be directly and closely controlled by predation because competitive dominance may often reflect an evolutionary and energetic trade-off with predator susceptibility and, therefore, E. mathaei abundance would decrease either linearly or logarithmically with measures of predation. Competitively-subordinate species were predicted to have unimodal (hump-shaped) abundance relationships with refuge because these species should make an evolutionary trade-off between increased predator resistance and decreased competitive ability. Spatial and temporal variation in wet-weight estimates was high for all species except the numerical and competitive dominant, E. mathaei, and for all species combined. Spatial variation in species abundance was highest under conditions of high predation and low species dominance and decreased as the total wet weight of urchins increased and the competitive dominant occupied resources. The most common subordinate species frequently exhibited the predicted unimodal relationships with the best measure of refuge from predation but variation was high and the best-fit second-order polynomials predicted less than 55% of the variation in sea urchin biomass. There was evidence for partitioning of the spatial refuge resource among species particularly for E. mathaei (de Blainville), Tripneustes gratilla Linn. and Diadema setosum Leske at the low to intermediate levels of predation. There was, however, a large overlap in the peak abundance of Diadema savignyi (Michelin), Echinothrix diadema Linn., Toxopneustes pileolus Lam. and Stomopneustes variolaris Lam, at the highest levels of predation. Nonetheless, the partitioning of refuge among many species occurs more at the smaller scale of reef crevices (< 10 m(2)) than at the larger scale of similar to 0.1 hectare sites or whole sections of reef. Diversity and number of species, however, were strongly associated with measures of refuge and exhibited unimodal curves.

Larval predaceous diving beetles are often numerically and taxonomically abundant predators in lentic systems, but the proximate mechanisms that explain their high abundance remain unknown. Field surveys were conducted twice in June in ponds in Alberta, Canada to assess the associations between larvae of two genera (Graphoderus, Rhantus), their spatial locations, and correlations with potential prey. Both larvae were common and positively correlated within wetlands although neither varied with pond depth nor distance from edge. Laboratory trials indicated that Graphoderus consumed more prey (corixids) at the surface, whereas Rhantus killed benthic prey (chironomids) and corixids at an equal rate; damselflies were the least consumed prey. Predation also varied with depth, with both larvae feeding at higher rates in the shallowest environments compared to Graphoderus at an intermediate depth. Predator-prey correlations from ponds were mostly congruent with predation trials; Graphoderus was positively correlated with corixids, Rhantus was positively correlated with corixids and chironomids; beetles were uncorrelated with damselflies. Reliance on different prey in different microhabitats may be an important mechanism for the maintenance of high abundance of dytiscid larvae.","[Yee, Donald A.; O'Regan, Sacha M.; Wohlfahrt, Bianca; Vamosi, Steven M.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Yee, DA (corresponding author), Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.",donald.yee@usm.edu,"Vamosi, Steven/C-8126-2009","Vamosi, Steven/0000-0003-3903-5000",Alberta Ingenuity New Faculty Award [20060362]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGP283114],"We thank S.

We previously demonstrated that Brown-headed Cowbird Molothrus ater brood parasitism of Song Sparrows Melospiza melodia results in a 50% reduction in the proportion of female host offspring by day 6 post-hatch and at fledging, which modelling demonstrated is as significant as nest predation in affecting demography. Many avian brood parasites possess special adaptations to parasitize specific hosts so this sex-ratio effect could be specific to the interaction between these two species. Alternatively, perturbations associated with brood parasitism per se (e.g. the addition of an extra, larger, unrelated nestling), rather than a Cowbird nestling specifically, may be responsible. We experimentally eliminated the effects of Cowbird-specific traits by parasitizing nests with a conspecific nestling rather than a Cowbird, while otherwise emulating the circumstances of Cowbird parasitism by adding an extra, larger (2-day-older), unrelated Song Sparrow nestling to Song Sparrow nests. Our parasitism treatment led to few host offspring deaths and no evidence of male-biased sex ratios by day 6 post-hatch. However, after day 6, female nestling mortality rates increased significantly in experimentally parasitized nests, resulting in a 60% reduction in the proportion of females fledging. Cowbird-specific traits are thus not necessary to cause female-biased host nestling mortality and far more general features associated with Cowbird parasitism instead appear responsible. Our results suggest, however, that Cowbird-specific traits may help accelerate the pace of female host deaths. The conservation implications of our results could be wide reaching. Cowbirds are unrelated to all their hosts, are larger than the great majority, and a Cowbird nestling's presence can mean there is an extra mouth to feed. Thus, sex-biased mortality in parasitized nests could be occurring across a range of host species.","[Decaire, Robert; Zanette, Liana Y.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Clinchy, Michael] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada","Zanette, LY (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",lzanette@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Canadian Foundation for Innovation Award; Society of Canadian Ornithologists,"We thank M.

Studies have demonstrated the influence of localized competition and predation among stream fishes, but researchers have been largely unable to determine to what extent interspecific interactions act to control fish assemblage structure. Recent declines to geographic range and abundance of Plains Topminnow (Fundulus sciadicus (Cope)) have been anecdotally attributed to altered fish assemblages and potential competitive or predatory associations; however, important species interactions have yet to be identified. Variation among fish assemblage structure at 473 locations known to historically support Plains Topminnow was described in Nebraska to demonstrate the role of assemblage dynamics in regulating species occurrence. Nonrandom patterns of fish assemblage composition in terms of Plains Topminnow persistence were apparent statewide, and multiple relationships were recognized as regionally influential (e.g., Niobrara River: Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede)). Strong correlations were described relating Plains Topminnow extirpation to nonnative species establishment (Common Carp Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus), Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis (Baird and Girard)), and several potential predatory (Esocidae, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque)) or competitive interactions (Western Mosquitofish, Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus (Rafinesque), Sand Shiner Notropis stramineus (Cope), Red Shiner Cyprinella lutrensis (Baird and Girard)) were identified. Positive relationships are attributed to similar reliance of particular abiotic conditions (Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides (Rafinesque)) or habitat types (Gasterosteidae, Green Sunfish Lepomis cyanellus (Rafinesque), Iowa Darter Etheostoma exile (Winn)). Other identified species will require research to elucidate potential biotic interactions with Plains Topminnow. Resultant models are hypothesized to reflect biotic processes, and thereby provide analytical insight into the long-term influence of fish assemblage structure on a rare species. Identified relationships provide preliminary recognition of potentially important interspecific interactions involving an unfamiliar species from which further hypotheses can be evaluated to ascertain casual relationships.","[Schumann, D.

However, both the study and management of invasive prey have historically overlooked indirect effects. In southern California estuaries, introduction of the Asian nest mussel Arcuatula senhousia has been linked to profound changes in native bivalve assemblages, but the mechanisms of these interactions remain unclear. We performed three field experiments to assess the mechanisms of competition between Arcuatula and native bivalves, and evaluated the potential for Arcuatula to indirectly mediate native predator-prey dynamics. We found that Arcuatula reduces the diversity, abundance, and size of native bivalve recruits by preemptively exploiting space in surface sediments. When paired with native shallow-dwelling clams (Chione undatella and Laevicardium substriatum), Arcuatula reduces adult survival through overgrowth competition. However, Arcuatula also attracts native predators, causing apparent competition by indirectly increasing predation of native clams, especially for poorly defended species. Therefore, invasive prey can indirectly increase predation rates on native competitors by changing the behavior of shared native predators, but the magnitude of apparent competition strongly depends on the vulnerability of natives to predation. Interestingly, our results indicate that the vulnerability of invasive prey to predation can greatly exacerbate impacts on their native competitors. Our findings suggest that consideration of both direct and indirect effects of invasive prey, as well as native predator-prey relationships, should lead to more effective invasive species management.","[Castorani, Max C.

Two small Cryptomonas species served as food for the ciliates and the rotifers in the experiments. Growth rates of each ciliate species were measured when they grew alone and when they were paired with one of the rotifer species. 3. Both rotifer species reduced the growth rate of U. furcata, probably primarily by direct feeding on the ciliates. Growth rate of B. planctonicum was unaffected by K. cochlearis, but was drastically reduced by grazing and/or mechanical interference of K. quadrata. 4.

Social learning is usually studied as an intraspecific phenomenon (but see [5-7]). However, other species with some overlap in ecology can be more than merely potential competitors: prior settlement and longer residence can render them preferable sources of information [8]. Socially induced acquisition of choices or preferences capitalizes upon the knowledge of presumably better-informed individuals [9] and should be adaptive under many natural circumstances [10, 11]. Here we show with a field experiment that females of two migrant flycatcher species can acquire a novel, arbitrary preference of competing resident tits for a symbol attached to the nest sites. The experiment demonstrates that such blind acquisition of heterospecific traits can occur in the wild. Even though genetic variation for habitat preferences exists in many taxa [12] and overlap between bird species likely induces costs [13], this result shows that interspecific social learning can cause increased overlap in nest-site preferences. Conventional, negative species interactions push ecological niches of species apart, but the use of competing species as a source of information counters that force and may lead to convergence.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Anim Ecol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Seppanen, JT (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",janseppa@jyu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-5132-6268",,,,39,81,81,1,59,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0960-9822,1879-0445,,CURR BIOL,Curr.

Productively (offspring per female) of Ips was adversely affected by high Ips gallery density as well as high Thanasimus density. Thanasimus productivity was enhanced by high Ips gallery density but negatively affected by high Thanasimus density. Ips productivity and Thanasimus developmental rate differed between tree individuals, probably owing to tree-related differences in phloem thickness. Relative predator-caused Ips mortality was ca 20% higher at high gallery density (ca 300 egg galeries per m(2)) than at low gallery density (ca 100 egg galleries per m(2)), indicating that mortality was density dependent. This difference was due to the fact that Thanasimus larval density was positively related to Ips gallery density. Mortality increased by ca 0.4% with each additional Thanasimus larva per m(2), independently of gallery density. Relative population levels of Ips and Thanasimus were monitored with pheromone traps in two regions differing in their Ips typographus outbreak history. Absolute catch as well as the Thanasimus/Ips catch ratio were ten times greater in the outbreak region than in the non-outbreak region. Coupled with the results in the caging experiment, this indicates that T. formicarius responds numerically to changes in I. typographus numbers per unit bark area as well as to Ips population changes at the regional level.

An observed community structure is often shaped by a combination of bottom-top and top-bottom processes, affected by biotic and abiotic factors. These factors affect community structure either directly (each species separately) or indirectly, via other species. Few studies have observed the combined effects of biotic and abiotic factors on primary producers and consumer communities composed of numerous species. 2. This study investigated the combined effects of a predatory hemipteran and water salinity on abundance and species richness of the periphyton and arthropod communities in an artificial pool experiment. 3. The abundance and species richness of both periphyton and arthropod communities were affected by the combination of salinity and predator. 4. It is suggested that the observed consumer community is composed of arthropod species that vary in salinity tolerance and response to the predator. In addition, the abundance of euryhaline species or species that are not consumed by this particular predator increases indirectly in specific treatment combinations that eventually result in reduced interspecific competition. Periphyton variables were strongly correlated to densities of larval Ochlerotatus caspius (Diptera: Culicidae), suggesting that this species may be largely responsible for structuring the producer community. 5. It is suggested that O. caspius distribution is the result of female oviposition habitat selection that is manipulated by chemical signals.

To reveal underlying mechanisms, roach and perch habitat use were analysed on a diel and seasonal scale, and piscivorous fish predation was quantified in one of those lakes, Lake Grosser Vatersee (Brandenburg). For the latter point, piscivorous and non-piscivorous fish population sizes were assessed by multiple mark-recapture experiments and piscivorous consumption was quantified by bioenergetics modelling. Piscivorous fish biomass accounted for about 30% of total fish biomass, and top-down control of third trophic level biomass was intense. Fish habitat shifts closely linked the littoral and pelagic habitat, and were an integral component of the fish species interactions. While pike predation was mainly restricted to the littoral zone, piscivorous perch foraged in the open water during daytime. Roach greater than or equal to age-1 counteracted the pelagic predation risk by diel horizontal migrations. So they could prey on pelagic zooplankton, and at the same time kept their predation risk in the pelagic zone as low as possible. In the littoral zone, roach extensively used non-animal resources not accessible to perch. Non-piscivorous perch were almost exclusively restricted to the littoral habitat; only age-0 perch had an initial pelagic stage. They didn't experience a juvenile competitive bottleneck. Overall, perch were relatively more affected by piscivorous fish predation than roach. This might be decisive for roach dominance under mesotrophic conditions. Additionally, Orconectes limosus, an introduced crayfish species, played a decisive role both as alternative prey for piscivorous fish and as a potential structuring force in the littoral habitat.","Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany; Univ Konstanz, Inst Limnol, Constance, Germany","Haertel, SS (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Baruch Marine Field Lab, POB 1630, Georgetown, SC 29442 USA.",susanne@belle.baruch.sc.edu,,,,,,50,29,29,0,14,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0075-9511,1873-5851,,LIMNOLOGICA,Limnologica,MAY,2002,32,1,,,,,1,13,,10.1016/S0075-9511(02)80011-1,,,13,Limnology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,606JA,WOS:000178729800001,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2021-09-27,

The planktonic copepod community was numerically dominated by three non-indigenous species (NIS), Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Sinocalanus doerrii, and two native species, Eurytemora affinis and Diacyclops thomasi. However, seasonal co-occurrence of non-indigenous and native copepods was highly variable between species-pairs. The native E. affinis and the non-indigenous S. doerrii showed the greatest temporal overlap (March-October), but other species-pairs also showed periods of considerable overlap during some seasons (e.g., E. affinis and P. forbesi in June-September). Spatial co-occurrence of native and non-indigenous species was also examined in temperature and salinity space (rather than geographic space): all six species-pairs (3 non-indigenous species x 2 native species) showed some degree of overlap, with the greatest (proportional) overlap occurring between the native E. affinis and the two non-indigenous species, S. doerrii and P. forbesi. This suggests the potential for competition to occur between native and non-native copepods in the LCRE, although with variation between seasons and species. Future studies are recommended that explicitly test for and distinguish between the relative importance of biological (e.g., competition and predation) and physico-chemical processes (e.g., freshwater runoff, eutrophication) in regulating the population dynamics of native and invasive copepods in the LCRE.","[Bollens, Stephen M.; Breckenridge, Joanne K.; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen; Kalata, Olga] Washington State Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA; [Cordell, Jeffery R.; Kalata, Olga] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","Bollens, SM (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, 14204 NE Salmon Creek Ave, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA.",sbollens@vancouver.wsu.edu; jbreckenridge@vancouver.wsu.edu; jcordell@uwashington.edu; rollboll@vancouver.wsu.edu; Olga@Kalata.net,"Breckenridge, Joanne/ABB-4973-2020; Breckenridge, Joanne/G-6877-2011; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/Q-5520-2017","Breckenridge, Joanne/0000-0002-2474-9521; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/0000-0002-5127-5720",Washington State University; USGSUnited States Geological Survey [G09AC00264],"We thank I.

Several hypotheses address the behavioral mechanisms driving the impacts of this mutualism, but relatively few studies have considered multiple ant species simultaneously as well as interspecific and intraspecific variation in ant behavior. In a series of field experiments that manipulated ant diet, this work examines the role of induced behaviors of forest ant species actively engaged in mutualism with Hemiptera. Based on other work in ant mutualisms, we predicted a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors towards prey and competitors by ants in the presence of honeydew-producing Hemiptera. We specifically compared Camponotus chromaoides and Formica neogagates (Formicidae), two abundant species in temperate forests of the northeastern U.S.A. After manipulating ant diet and interactions with sap-feeders experimentally, we observed 494 one-on-one interactions between ants and competitors, ladybird beetles and caterpillar prey. We found that C. chromaoides, exhibited behavioral dominance over F. neogagates, and C. chromaoides was more likely to attack ladybird beetles, competing ants, and caterpillar prey. However, contrary to other work in ant-Hemipteran mutualisms, we observed no evidence that food rewards provided by sap-feeders induced changes in ant behavior for either ant species examined. These results reveal the importance of considering interspecific differences in behavior as a mechanism underlying the ecological impacts of ant-Hemipteran protection mutualisms.","[Clark, Robert E.; Singer, Michael S.] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA","Clark, RE (corresponding author), Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",rclark@wesleyan.edu,,,NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1404177],"This work was supported by NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant DEB-1404177.

Programs to control invaders are common but gauging the effectiveness of such programs using carefully controlled, large-scale field experiments is rare, especially at higher trophic levels. Experimental manipulations coupled with long-term demographic monitoring can reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of interspecific competition among apex predators and suggest mitigation options for invasive species. We used a large-scale before-after control-impact removal experiment to investigate the effects of an invasive competitor, the barred owl (Strix varia), on the population dynamics of an iconic old-forest native species, the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Removal of barred owls had a strong, positive effect on survival of sympatric spotted owls and a weaker but positive effect on spotted owl dispersal and recruitment. After removals, the estimated mean annual rate of population change for spotted owls stabilized in areas with removals (0.2% decline per year), but continued to decline sharply in areas without removals (12.1% decline per year). The results demonstrated that the most substantial changes in population dynamics of northern spotted owls over the past two decades were associated with the invasion, population expansion, and subsequent removal of barred owls. Our study provides experimental evidence of the demographic consequences of competitive release, where a threatened avian predator was freed from restrictions imposed on its population dynamics with the removal of a competitively dominant invasive species.","[Wiens, J.

Generalist predators are important contributors to reliable conservation biological control. Indirect interactions between prey species that share a common generalist predator can influence both community dynamics and the efficacy of biological control. 2. Laboratory cage experiments investigated the impact of the combined consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predation by adult Hippodamia convergens as a shared predator on the population growth and relative abundance of Acyrthosiphon pisum and Aphis gossypii as prey species. Predation pressure and prey density were varied. 3. At low predation pressure the indirect interaction between aphid species was asymmetrical with a proportionally greater negative impact of predation on A. gossypii than on A. pisum. At intermediate predation pressure, the indirect interaction became symmetrical. At high predation pressure and higher levels of prey density, it was asymmetrical with greater negative impact on A. pisum, often driven to local extinction while A. gossypii populations persisted. 4. A linear mixed-effects model including early population growth of both aphid species and predation pressure explained 96% and 92% of the variation in the population growth of A. pisum and A. gossypii, respectively, over an 8-day period. The overall effect of shared predation on the indirect interaction between the two aphid species is best described as apparent commensalism, where A. pisum benefited from early population growth of A. gossypii, while A. gossypii was unaffected by early population growth of A. pisum. Considering these indirect interactions is important for conservation biological control efforts to be successful.","[Emery, Sara E.; Mills, Nicholas J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Emery, Sara E.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Agr Entomol Unit, Uppsala, Sweden","Emery, SE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sara.emery@slu.se,"Emery, Sara E/Z-1511-2019","Emery, Sara E/0000-0002-0832-0506",GRFP grant from the National Science Foundation,We thank reviewers for their helpful comments.

Core processes operating at local scales, such as species-environment matching and species interactions, shape observed assemblages. Artificial habitats (simplified structure) are useful systems for assessing the main factors affecting community composition and disentangling their assembly rules. Drinking troughs (brickwork tanks for free-ranging cattle watering) are widespread in Italy and represent a suitable aquatic habitat for colonization by various aquatic organisms. Dragonflies larvae are usually found in drinking troughs and often exhibit strong species interactions and striking community assembly patterns. Our primary aim was to search for Odonata communities exhibiting non-random cooccurrence/segregation patterns in drinking troughs. We performed null-model analyses by measuring a co-occurrence index (C-score) on larval Odonata assemblages (13 species from 28 distinct troughs). Overall, we found a non-random structure for the studied dragonfly assemblages, which, given their fast generation time, must have been generated by short-term ecological processes (i.e. interspecific interactions). We thus analyzed potential competition/predation among and within ecological guilds. From the field data, we speculated that interactions within the sprawlers' guild is likely among the main drivers structuring the studied assemblages, especially the effect of intraguild predation between C. erythraea and Sympetrum spp larval stages. We then experimentally tested these interactions in laboratory and demonstrated that intraguild predation among larvae at different development stages may result in an effective exclusion/negative impact on density pattern, representing one of the processes to take into consideration when studying dragonfly assemblages.","[Cerini, Francesco; Bologna, Marco A.; Vignoli, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale G Marconi, Rome, Italy","Vignoli, L (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale G Marconi, Rome, Italy.",leonardo.vignoli@uniroma3.it,"Vignoli, Leonardo/F-2663-2011; Cerini, Francesco/AAO-8613-2020","Vignoli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1599-092X; Cerini, Francesco/0000-0002-1367-1239","Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza) [COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016]","The Grant to the Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza, ARTICOLO 1, COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016) is gratefully acknowledged.",,42,8,8,1,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 21,2019,14,6,,,,,,,e0214127,10.1371/journal.pone.0214127,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,IW3PT,WOS:000484894700003,31226119,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-27,

We assessed spatial niches of four rodent species coexisting in one meadow habitat within the Bialowieza Primeval Forest. Niche characteristics were based on the valorisation of the habitat around live-trapping sites visited by rodents during seven years of the study. The population size of each species was monitored and expressed as an average annual density. The root vole Microtus oeconomus was the most numerous and dominant species, with its density widely fluctuating due to the temporal increases of predation pressure exerted by the weasel Mustela nivalis. During the study period, the spatial niche of the root vole was nearly constant, with only significantly increased tolerance towards shrub covered sites at times of its high population density. However, even a slight niche expansion of the highly abundant root voles displaced accompanying species: the bank vole Myodes (Clethrionomys) glareolus, the yellow necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis and the striped field mouse A. agrarius, from their preferred sites and efficiently decreased rodent species diversity in the studied habitat.

We tested whether a subsidy of allochthonous prey enhanced an asymmetric competition between invasive bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and two native cyprinid fish, that is, stone moroko (Pseudorasbora parva) and tamoroko (Gnathopogon elongatus elongatus). A field experiment was conducted using enclosures wherein the strength of interspecific competition and the presence/absence of allochthonous prey were manipulated. The experiment revealed that allochthonous prey alleviated the limitation of fish growths caused by a severe competition for aquatic prey resources. However, the importance of allochthonous prey differed considerably between invasive bluegill and the two native cyprinids. Individual bluegills grew faster when the allochthonous prey was supplied, whereas no difference in growth was observed in the two cyprinids whether or not allochthonous prey was supplied. Interestingly, the importance of allochthonous prey on the total amount of bluegill growth varied depending on the numerical abundance of native cyprinid competitors, and this importance increased when the native cyprinids were abundant. These findings indicated that allochthonous prey provides an asymmetric growth benefit to invasive bluegills over the two native cyprinids by alleviating asymmetrically the competition strength in a Japanese pond, especially under the conditions of severe interspecific resource competition and a limitation in the utilization of in situ prey resources.","[Yonekura, Ryuji] Gifu Prefectural Res Inst Freshwater Fish & Aquat, Gifu 5016021, Japan; [Yonekura, Ryuji; Yamanaka, Hiroki; Ushimaru, Atushi; Matsui, Kazuaki; Uchii, Kimiko; Maruyama, Atsushi] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Yonekura, R (corresponding author), Gifu Prefectural Res Inst Freshwater Fish & Aquat, Gifu 5016021, Japan.",yonekura@fish.rd.pref.gifu.jp,"Yamanaka, Hiroki/D-4221-2012; Uchii, Kimiko/J-8236-2019; Ushimaru, Atushi/D-7036-2013; Matsui, Kazuaki/S-1473-2019","Uchii, Kimiko/0000-0002-1375-3875; Ushimaru, Atushi/0000-0002-2051-1233; Matsui, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1563-3308",Nippon Life Insurance FoundationNippon Life Insurance Foundation,"We express our thanks to I.

In the Mediterranean region, several species in the generaDicyphus,Macrolophus, andNesidiocoris(Hemiptera: Miridae, Bryocorinae, Dicyphini) colonize protected horticultural crops. In Portugal,Nesidiocoris tenuis(Reuter) is increasingly abundant in the mirid species complex of tomato crops and appears to be displacing the nativeDicyphus cerastiiWagner. In order to know whether intraguild predation (IGP) can explain the decreasing abundance ofD. cerastii, we evaluated predatory interactions between adult females and first instars ofD. cerastiivs.N. tenuisbut alsoD. cerastiivs.Macrolophus pygmaeus(Rambur), as this species is also naturally present in horticultural crops in Portugal. Cannibalistic interactions were also tested for the same three species. All experiments were performed under laboratory conditions, in Petri dish arenas, in the presence or absence ofEphestia kuehniellaZeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs as alternative prey. Predation on both heterospecific and conspecific nymphs occurred only in the absence of alternative food. Intraguild predation was mutual and symmetrical betweenD. cerastiiandM. pygmaeus. However, IGP was asymmetrical betweenD. cerastiiandN. tenuis, favouring the first. Cannibalism was not significantly different among these mirid species. Our results show thatD. cerastiihas a greater capacity to feed on intraguild prey thanN. tenuis. Therefore, IGP on small nymphs does not explain the abundance shift betweenD. cerastiiandN. tenuis.","[Abracos Duarte, Goncalo; Caldas, Filipa; Pechirra, Ariadna; Borges da Silva, Elsa; Figueiredo, Elisabete] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Abracos Duarte, Goncalo; Figueiredo, Elisabete] Linking Landscape Environm Agr & Food, LEAF, Lisbon, Portugal; [Borges da Silva, Elsa] Forest Res Ctr, CEF, Lisbon, Portugal","Duarte, GA (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal.",gduarte@isa.ulisboa.pt,"Figueiredo, Elisabete/AAY-8128-2020; Borges da Silva, Elsa/A-3522-2012","Figueiredo, Elisabete/0000-0002-0795-4216; Abracos Duarte, Goncalo/0000-0002-4652-3240; Borges da Silva, Elsa/0000-0002-7000-3536","Portuguese FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/118834/2016, UID/AGR/04129/2020, UIDB/00239/2020]","The authors would like to thank Andre Garcia, Catarina Mourato, Sofia Coelho, Susana Ramos, and Teresa In<^>es Pereira, from Instituto Superior de Agronomia, for their support in the laboratory mass rearing.

When unequal competitors are involved, the dominant species tends to displace the subordinate one to its less preferred habitat. Here, we use habitat isodars, an approach which reflects evolutionary stable strategies of habitat selection, to evaluate whether interspecific competition between two competing species with distinct habitat preferences, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax and the great bustard Otis tarda, modulates their habitat use. Field data on these endangered species demonstrate that unequal competitors can coexist without completely segregating on their preferred habitats. The negatively sloped isodar of the subordinate little bustard unveils its competition with the dominant great bustard. Interference from great bustards in secondary cereal habitats reinforces use of preferred natural habitat by little bustards. Studies of density-dependent habitat selection by a single-species can thus aid in identifying the effects of competition on community composition, and guide the conservation of at-risk species. Isodars, in particular, represent a promising method to gain clear knowledge on interspecific competition for species in which experimental manipulations are not feasible.","[Tarjuelo, Rocio; Traba, Juan; Morales, Manuel B.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, C Darwin 2, ES-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Tarjuelo, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, C Darwin 2, ES-28049 Madrid, Spain.",rocio.tarjuelo@gmail.com,"Tarjuelo, Rocio/ABG-9983-2020; Traba, Juan/D-9191-2012; Morales, Manuel B./B-1448-2014","Traba, Juan/0000-0001-6326-8942; Tarjuelo Mostajo, Rocio/0000-0002-0638-1911",Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2009-13029/BOS]; network of the Madrid region REMEDINAL2 [S-2009/AMB/1783]; network of the Madrid region REMEDINAL 3CM [S2013/MAE-2719]; Aeropuerto de Ciudad Real S.A.; FPU-grantSpanish Government [AP2009-0762],Funding was provided by the Spanish Ministry of Science (CGL2009-13029/BOS); and the networks of the Madrid region REMEDINAL2 (S-2009/AMB/1783) and REMEDINAL 3CM (S2013/MAE-2719).

However, the difference of recruitment limitation for tree species with varying seed masses, which is a common phenomenon in tropical or subtropical forests, is largely unknown. In this study we conducted a seed sowing experiment for five dominant tree species with varying seed mass (a proxy of dispersal ability) in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest at different successional stages to test the hypothesis that the determinants of species recruitment vary with their seed masses in Heishiding Nature Reserve (Guangdong Province, China). The effects of seed predators, soil pathogens, light conditions, plant litter, seed additions, and the presence of adult conspecific trees on the performance of seeds and seedlings for the five species were examined. We particularly investigated the effects of habitat hazards and seed size on the relative importance of dispersal limitation and establishment limitation. The results show that all five sowing species experienced recruitment limitation at the microsite level, although the causes of the limitation of these species varied between pathogen infection, animal predation, litter covering and shading. Seedling recruitment of the wind-dispersed, small-seeded species was mostly limited by microsite condition, while large-seeded species were mostly limited by dispersal ability.","[Luo, Y.; He, F.; Yu, S.] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Higher Educ Inst, Key Lab Biodivers Dynam & Conservat, Dept Ecol,Sch Life Sci,State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Luo, Y.] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China; [He, F.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada","Yu, S (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Higher Educ Inst, Key Lab Biodivers Dynam & Conservat, Dept Ecol,Sch Life Sci,State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lssysx@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Yu, Shixiao/0000-0003-1943-0185","Key Projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31230013, 30730021]; NSERC of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); GEOIDE of Canada","We are grateful to Weinan Ye, Zongbo Peng, Fangmin Shuai, Xubing Liu, Minxia Liang, Wen Zheng, Zhi Chen, Baoyu Chen, Zhe Lin and N.

Theory predicts that a trade-off between resource competition and IGP should allow local niche partitioning, but such trade-offs are expressed only at intermediate resource productivity and cannot explain observations of stable coexistence at high productivity. Coexistence must therefore involve additional mechanisms beside the trade-off, but very little is known about the operation of such mechanisms in nature. Here I present the first experimental test of multiple coexistence mechanisms in a natural community exhibiting IGP. The results suggest that, when resource productivity constrains the competition-IGP trade-off, a temporal refuge for the intraguild prey can not only promote coexistence, but also change species abundances to a pattern qualitatively different from that expected based on the trade-off or a refuge alone. This is the first empirical study to demonstrate a mechanism for why communities with IGP do not lose species diversity in highly productive environments. These results have implications for diversity maintenance in multi-trophic communities, and the use of multiple natural enemies in biological control.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",amarasek@ucla.edu,,,,,,22,56,57,3,44,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2007,88,11,,,,,2720,2728,,10.1890/06-1515.1,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,233CL,WOS:000251067900007,18051639,,,,2021-09-27,

These rotifer species are similar in shape but show notable differences in body size. Predator and prey species co-occur in brackish waterbodies close to the Mediterranean coast of Spain. First, we characterized differential vulnerability of rotifers to predation. A consistent tendency of higher predation rates on smaller prey (i.e., smaller species and younger individuals) was observed. Analysis of predation showed that predator contact rate did not differ significantly among prey species, but that attack, capture probabilities, and handling time did. Second, we performed population dynamics experiments with two prey species competing for a single resource at different levels of predation. Predation extended coexistence of the competing rotifers, whereas the inferior competitor was excluded in the absence of the predator. In some pairwise experiments, we found that the greater the predation level, the larger the relative increase in density of the inferior competitor. Our results suggest that predation can affect the dynamics of very similar competing species in natural aquatic communities, promoting coexistence.","Univ Valencia, Inst Cavanilles Biodiversitat & Biol Evolut, Valencia 46071, Spain","Ciros-Perez, J (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, FES Iztacala, PILT UIICSE, Trop Limnol Project, AP 314, Tlalnepantla 54090, Edo, Mexico.",ciros@servidor.unam.mx,"Serra, Manuel/H-7817-2015; Ciros, Jorge/G-5958-2018; Carmona, Maria Jose/H-6452-2015; Carmona, Maria Jose/AAM-4340-2020","Serra, Manuel/0000-0003-1731-1529; Ciros, Jorge/0000-0002-4292-7539; Carmona, Maria Jose/0000-0002-4835-6933; Carmona, Maria Jose/0000-0002-4835-6933",,,,55,35,39,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

In addition to direct predator-prey relations, many other interactions (competition, facilitation, inhibition, etc.) may be key to the structure and functioning of communities. Such interactions often occur between species belonging to the same trophic level, and have already been demonstrated between species of bacterial-feeding nematodes, but the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Hence, iris difficult to predict their outcome under changing environmental conditions like pollution. Scientists and policy makers have come up with standardized tests to establish environmentally acceptable levels of pollution. In this experiment, we demonstrate how sublethal levels of contaminants can affect not only the fitness of two nematode species but also the way in which these species interact. We performed monospecific and combined culture experiments with two species of soil bacterivorous nematodes, Acrobeloides nanus and Plectus parvus, under optimal conditions and compared the outcome with trials in which the nematodes were exposed to a series of sublethal cadmium concentrations. By evaluating fitness and outcome of interspecific interactions based on their abundance, our results (a) confirm the considerably higher tolerance of A. nanus than that of P. parvus to Cd: (b) demonstrate mutual facilitation between both species: (c) highlight that differential tolerance to pollution between bacterivorous species may affect the balance and outcome of their interactions leading to counterintuitive results such as a higher population fitness of one species (A. nanus) under increased pollution.

In this study we coupled field observations with experiments to ask if the degree of character displacement reflects the intensity of competition between two closely related spadefoot toads (Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata). Tadpoles of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivorous morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivorous morph, which specializes on and whose phenotype is induced by fairy shrimp. Previously, we found that S. multiplicata are inferior competitors for fairy shrimp and are less likely to develop into carnivores in sympatry with S. bombifrons. We compared four key trophic characters in S. multiplicata across natural ponds where the frequency of S. bombifrons varied. We found that S. multiplicata became increasingly more omnivore-like as the relative abundance of S. bombifrons increased. Moreover, in controlled laboratory populations, S. multiplicata became increasingly more omnivore-like and S. bombifrons became increasingly more carnivore-like as we increased the relative abundance of the other species. Phenotypic plasticity helped mediate this divergence: S. multiplicata became increasingly less likely to cat shrimp and develop into carnivores in the presence of S. bomb frons, a superior predator on shrimp. However, divergence also reflected differences in canalized traits: When reared under common conditions, S. multiplicata tadpoles became increasingly less likely to produce carnivores as their natal pond decreased in elevation. Presumably, this pattern reflected selection against carnivores in lower-elevation ponds, because S. bomb frons became increasingly more common with decreasing elevation. Local genetic adaptation to the presence of S. bombifrons was remarkably fine grained, with differences in carnivore production detected between populations a few kilometers apart. Our results suggest that the degree of character displacement potentially reflects the intensity of competition between interacting species and that both phenotypic plasticity and fine-scale genetic differentiation can mediate this response. Moreover, these results provide causal evidence linking resource competition to species divergence.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA","Pfennig, DW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",dpfennig@email.unc.edu; pjmurphy@siu.edu,,,,,,89,110,111,0,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JUN,2002,56,6,,,,,1217,1228,,,,,12,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,573GL,WOS:000176820900012,12144021,,,,2021-09-27,

Dual-guild herbivory also can muddle plant signals used by specialist natural enemies to locate prey, further complicating the net impact of herbivore-herbivore interactions in naturally diverse settings. While dual-guild herbivore communities are common in nature, consequences for top-down processes are unclear, as chemically mediated tri-trophic interactions are rarely evaluated in field environments. Combining observational and experimental approaches in the open field, we test a prediction that chewing herbivores interfere with top-down suppression of phloem feeders on Brassica oleracea across broad landscapes. In a two-year survey of 52 working farm sites, we found that parasitoid and aphid densities on broccoli plants positively correlated at farms where aphids and caterpillars rarely co-occurred, but this relationship disappeared at farms where caterpillars commonly co-occurred. In a follow-up experiment, we compared single and dual-guild herbivore communities at four local farm sites and found that caterpillars (P.rapae) caused a 30% reduction in aphid parasitism (primarily by Diaeretiella rapae), and increased aphid colony (Brevicoryne brassicae) growth at some sites. Notably, in the absence of predators, caterpillars indirectly suppressed, rather than enhanced, aphid growth. Amid considerable ecological noise, our study reveals a pattern of apparent commensalism: herbivore-herbivore facilitation via relaxed top-down suppression. This work suggests that enemy-mediated apparent commensalism may override constraints to growth induced by competing herbivores in field environments, and emphasizes the value of placing chemically mediated interactions within their broader environmental and community contexts.","[Blubaugh, Carmen K.] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29678 USA; [Blubaugh, Carmen K.; Asplund, Jacob S.; Philips, Christopher R.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.; Morra, Matthew J.; Popova, Inna E.] Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Soil & Entomol Sci, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Reganold, John P.] Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.] Univ Idaho, Dept Entomol Nematol & Plant Pathol, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Morra, Matthew J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Soil & Water Syst, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29678 USA.; Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",cblubau@clemson.edu,"Morra, Matthew/P-1216-2019; Morra, Matthew J/B-1723-2008","Morra, Matthew/0000-0003-3842-1575; Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102; Popova, Inna/0000-0002-2004-1411",USDA NIFA ORG award [2015-09273],"We are grateful to Elizabeth Magill and Sabrina Judson for field and lab assistance, to Olivia Smith for helping with figures, and to Paul Nabity, Ian Kaplan, Adrienne Godschalx, and Robert Schaeffer for comments on previous drafts of this manuscript.

We added seeds of 17 forb species to plots where bunchgrass competition and rodent seed predation were manipulated across sites varying in bunchgrass productivity and thus competitive intensity. Seeds were added at densities mimicking interspecific variation in fecundity among target species. Standardizing for differences in fecundity (i.e. seed input, which enabled us to evaluate inherent interspecific differences in susceptibility to biotic interactions), bunchgrass competition more greatly reduced recruitment and establishment of small- versus large-seeded species, whereas rodent seed predation more greatly reduced the recruitment of large- versus small-seeded species. Plant height and LMA were unrelated to the competition effect size. Small-seeded species abundance decreased across sites increasing in bunchgrass productivity, whereas this was not the case for large-seeded species. For adult plants but not seedlings, community-weighted functional trait means (CWM) for seed size, height and LMA increased in plots with versus without bunchgrass competition and the CWM for seed size and height also increased at sites with greater bunchgrass productivity (for adults only). In contrast, rodent seed predation had no significant effects on CWM seed size. At the end of the experiment, adult abundance positively correlated with plant fecundity in plots lacking bunchgrass, indicating the inherent advantages accrued to high fecundity small-seeded species. However, with bunchgrass competition, abundances were equalized across species due to reduced competitive tolerance of high fecundity small-seeded species. Synthesis. Our results suggest that coexistence among subordinate forb species varying in seed size and fecundity is in-part due to a trade-off involving competitive tolerance and fecundity, mediated by seed size and associated functional traits.","[Maron, John L.; Hajek, Karyn L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hahn, Philip G.] Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT USA","Maron, JL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,"Hahn, Philip/0000-0001-9717-9489",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518],"U.S. National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518",,77,1,1,9,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The invasive amphipod has been particularly successful in some habitats (e.g. on pebbles) where it has become one of the most abundant gammarid species. We studied experimentally if the dominant fish Gasterosteus aculeatus preyed differentially on the exotic G. tigrinus and the native Gammarus salinus, if predation differed among habitats, and if one gammarid species facilitated predation on the other. The experiment demonstrated that (1) fish preyed more on the exotic G. tigrinus than the native G. salinus. (2) Predation did not differ among habitats. (3) Gammarus tigrinus facilitated the predation on G. salinus and this facilitation varied among habitats with significant effects on pebbles. Thus, the combined effect of habitat-specific fish predation and competition between gammarid amphipods is a possible explanation of the current range of G. tigrinus in the northern Baltic Sea. G. tigrinus seems to establish in habitats where it can significantly increase fish predation on the native gammarids. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This hypothesis was tested using two approaches. First, laboratory experiments revealed that the presence of the loach significantly reduced the survival of tree frog eggs and tadpoles. Second, observational studies in rice fields showed that the direct effect of modernization on tadpoles was not significant but the indirect (and thus total) effects were weakly positive due to the reduction in the density of dojo loach. Our study suggests that recent agricultural intensification in rice fields does not negatively impact all aquatic species but that some species may not be affected or can even flourish by having tolerance for the changes and release from potential predators or competitors.","[Katayama, Naoki] Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Biodivers Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Goto, Tetsuo; Narushima, Fumihiro; Kobori, Hiromi] Tokyo City Univ, Fac Environm & Informat Studies, Tsuzuki Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2240015, Japan; [Amano, Tatsuya] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Miyashita, Tadashi] Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biodivers Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Katayama, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Biodivers Div, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan.",katayama6@affrc.go.jp,"Amano, Tatsuya/E-7367-2010; Katayama, Naoki/O-2734-2018","Amano, Tatsuya/0000-0001-6576-3410; Katayama, Naoki/0000-0002-1136-442X","Global Center of Excellence for the Asian Conservation Ecology program; Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22-4246]","We thank N.

For five species of Cladocera (Sida crystallina, Daphnia magna, Simocephalus vetulus, Daphnia longispina, and Diaphanosoma brachyurum), representing a gradient of body size, population characteristics were described as functions of food concentration. Abundance dynamics were simulated in mixed species cultures and invasion experiments under different levels of food supply corresponding to oligo-, meso-, and eutrophic conditions. Separate simulations were also run including and excluding (fish) predation. The competitive ability of each species was estimated as the values of the population equilibrium food concentration. Simulation results showed that for the no-predator scenario, increases in the level of food supply promoted species coexistence while under lower food concentrations only one species remained at the end of the simulation runs. When predation was allowed, the number of species that coexisted at the end of the simulations increased up to four species, indicating that predator pressure facilitated species coexistence because it shortened periods of food depletion. Simulation results were verified in laboratory experiments which suggested that population equilibrium food concentration can be used as an estimate of competitive ability. Finally, species structure and relative abundance in Lake Naroch (Belarus) during the summer of 2004 was found to be consistent with our results from computer simulation and laboratory experiments with regard to competition and predation impacts on zooplankton community.","Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Moscow 119071, Russia; Byelarussian Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Minsk 220072, BELARUS; Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Geog, Moscow, Russia","Feniova, IY (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Leninsky Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia.",Feniova@mail.ru,"Razlutskij, Vladimir I./G-1544-2017","Razlutskij, Vladimir I./0000-0001-8612-6955",,,,29,27,30,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR,2007,579,,,,,,219,231,,10.1007/s10750-006-0411-x,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,135XM,WOS:000244187200018,,,,,2021-09-27,

The supply of colonists from the regional pool has the potential to alter the outcome of local interactions by providing species that fill different ecological roles. I examined the consequences of invasion by fish (juvenile Lepomis macrochirus) and insect (Notonecta undulata) predators on experimental plankton communities that were either connected to or isolated from the regional pool of zooplankton species. The effects of predators on zooplankton composition and diversity depended on dispersal by members of the regional zooplankton species pool. Fish and notonectids reduced the abundance of large zooplankton and thereby facilitated invasion by new species from the surrounding region. Both predators reduced zooplankton species richness in the absence of dispersal, while fish had positive effects and notonectids had no effects with rapid dispersal. Fish facilitated invasion by more species than they excluded, while similar numbers of species invaded with notonectids as were driven extinct. The effects of predators on planktonic trophic structure (zooplankton size structure and biomass. phytoplankton biomass) were independent of the level of dispersal. Both predators reduced zooplankton mean body size, but only fish enhanced phytoplankton density. Invasion by members of the regional species pool slightly increased zooplankton mean body size and reduced phytoplankton biomass however, the effects were small and independent of the predator treatment. Predator-facilitated invasion of new species altered the effects of predators on zooplankton species composition and diversity, but not on plankton trophic structure. The results suggest that spatial heterogeneity in predator abundance promotes regional coexistence among zooplankton. Connection to a diverse regional species pool via dispersal may therefore be important for determining the impact of local interactions such as predation on communities.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Shurin, JB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",shurin@nceas.ucsb.edu,,,,,,77,134,135,2,84,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2001,82,12,,,,,3404,3416,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[3404:IEOPAD]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,503GY,WOS:000172791800011,,,,,2021-09-27,

In a laboratory experiment, we evaluated the relative importance of competition and predation from juvenile and adult brown trout, respectively, on foraging performance of groups of three stone loaches. We observed loach consumption rate, time spent inactive, and aggressive interactions between juvenile trout and loach in artificial stream sections. The controlled experiments were complemented by examining stone loach population densities in natural systems as functions of juvenile and adult trout. In the laboratory experiments, increasing numbers of competitors decreased prey availability, which ultimately led to lower consumption rates for loach. Loach responded to predation risk by increasing time being inactive, thereby decreasing consumption rates. However, there were no effects of juvenile trout competitors on loach consumption rates in treatments with adult trout presence, suggesting no additive effect of predation and competition on loach foraging success. Partial regressions of loach and trout densities in natural streams revealed a positive relationship between juvenile trout and loach, and a negative relationship between adult trout and loach. Our laboratory and field data thus suggest that predation is a limiting factor for loach success, and predator presence could mediate species coexistence at high interspecific densities.","[Nilsson, Erika; Persson, Anders; Nilsson, P.

Theory and empirical research predict that greater habitat structural complexity will generally result in higher abundance, richness, and diversity of epifaunal species. We evaluated the impact of a recently introduced, structurally complex bryozoan, Watersipora subtorquata, by comparing its associated epifaunal communities with those of primary substrate, other habitat modifiers (tunicates and mussels), and structurally similar mimics. Community composition differed between Watersipora and other treatments for both mobile and sessile epifaunal communities, but species richness and diversity were significantly higher on Watersipora for mobile animals only. Differences in mobile community composition and diversity were driven by polychaete worms, which were found in greater abundance and higher diversity in Watersipora. Crustaceans, although equally abundant, were more evenly distributed across treatments. Sessile epifaunal communities differed little in richness or abundance among treatments, suggesting that while Watersipora provides biogenic surfaces for colonization that adequately compensate for the primary substrate it exploits, its high structural complexity does not correspond to an increase in sessile epifaunal abundance relative to less complex habitat modifiers. Our results suggest that neutral or facilitative effects of exotic species may be common; the strength and direction of the impact of a novel habitat-forming species on epifaunal communities will depend on the quality of the resource it provides, the strength of ecological interactions between habitat-forming species and epifauna, epifaunal habitat preferences, and whether habitat is a limiting resource for a particular species or group.","[Sellheim, Kirsten; Stachowicz, John J.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Coates, R.

Carcinus is more abundant than are C. irroratus and C. borealis and yet both Cancer species are more common in the diet of gulls. In this study we used a series of experiments to examine why gulls exhibit disproportionately higher predation on C borealis relative to the two other crab species. We found that gulls do not discriminate among crab species when presented crab tissue patties indicating that gulls do not select crabs based on differences in palatability. At smaller size ranges (<75 mm carapace width). C irroratus had lower dry tissue weight than the other two species, thus gulls should prefer similar-sized C. borealis and Carcinus based on their caloric value. At carapace widths greater than 80 mm, C. irroratus had higher available dry tissue weight than C. borealis. However. C. borealis is generally larger than C irroratus in the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones so this difference is unlikely to contribute to a preference for C irroratus. Our experiments showed that algal species dominating rocky ledges provide a cryptic refuge for Carcinus thereby reducing the likelihood of attack by gulls. We found that the lateral merus display exhibited by C. irroratus appears to deter attacks by gulls; in contrast, C. borealis withdraw their chelae in response to attack, which likely facilitates their capture by gulls. During simulated gull attacks, Carcinus exhibited escape behavior whereas C borealis remained stationary. Lack of escape behavior likely facilitates capture of C borealis by gulls. In sum, our findings suggest that gulls have formed a search image for C. borealis, which is likely a result of the relative ease of capture and profitability of C borealis compared to Carcinus and C irroratus. Gull preference for C. borealis has important consequences for crab distributions and the structure of rocky intertidal and shallow subtidal zones in New England. In particular, gulls create a refuge for Carcinus in the intertidal zone by reducing densities of C borealis, a potential predator and competitor, and by avoiding preying upon Carcinus.

We found two major recruitment patterns among the 11 species. One group (yellow perch, walleye, logperch and tessellated darter) decreased in abundance after the mid-1980s. These species are spring or early summer spawners with benthic juveniles. In the second group, most species increased during the early to mid 1980s (smallmouth bass, trout-perch, white bass, gizzard shad and freshwater drum), while two recruited episodically (white perch and pumpkinseed). These species spawned later than the first group and juvenile habitat use was variable. We investigated three specific mechanisms which could explain these patterns (1) competition with young-of-year (YOY) yellow perch, the dominant fish species in the lake, (2) buffering of predation by walleye by YOY yellow perch, and (3) correlation with water temperature and productivity (indexed through total phosphorus levels, TP). Buffering from predation by walleye was likely important for the species in the first group, as indicated by positive correlations between inter-annual abundance patterns of the four species. Even though species in the second group tended to increase as YOY yellow perch declined, we found little support for the competition hypothesis. Growth and abundance of these species were not significantly correlated with abundance of YOY yellow perch. Temperature was positively correlated with growth of 10 of the 11 species. Decreasing TP levels and associated changes in the lake could be causing a shift in the fish community, but the mechanism is not decreased food production.

This edge habitat facilitates invasion of exotic species into remaining fragments. The ability of native species to resist invasion varies and may depend on intrinsic variables such as dispersal and reproductive rates as well as external factors such as rate of habitat change and the density of populations of introduced species in edge habitat. We examined the distributional and competitive relationships of two members of the class Chilopoda, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus, a centipede native to the eastern US, and Lithobius forficatus, an exotic centipede introduced from Europe. We found that L. forficatus was most abundant in edge habitat and S. sexspinosus was most abundant in the interior habitat at our field sites. Although L. forficatus was present in habitat interiors at 11 of 12 sites, there was no correlation between fragment size and numbers of L. forficatus in interior habitat. The native centipede was rarely found occupying fragment edges. We used laboratory microcosms to examine potential competitive interactions and to indirectly assess prey preferences of the two species. In microcosms both species consumed similar prey, but the native centipede, S. sexspinosus, acted as an intraguild predator on the introduced centipede. Native centipedes were competitively superior in both intraspecific and interspecific pairings. Our results suggest that intraguild predation may aid native centipedes in resisting invasion of introduced centipedes from edge habitat.","Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA","Hickerson, CAM (corresponding author), Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",chickerson2@msn.com,"Hickerson, Cari-Ann/A-8013-2008",,,,,61,25,26,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2005,146,1,,,,,110,119,,10.1007/s00442-005-0197-y,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,977HZ,WOS:000232795400012,16041613,,,,2021-09-27,

We studied this predator-prey community in a forest-dominated area of 470 km(2) in southern Finland in 1987-2005 by controlling goshawk occupancy and habitat changes. Goshawk affected densities of bird predators and hole-nesting species and locations of the nest sites of woodpeckers. Goshawk (+) and great spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos major (-) were significantly associated with density changes and breeding success of three-toed woodpecker. Positive influence of goshawk was correlated with landscape fragmentation that indicates that goshawk could decrease mammalian nest predation on three-toed woodpecker.

We show that resistance to the invasive alga, Sargassum horneri, in a temperate reef system occurs through alternate mechanisms in different ecosystem states. In an old marine protected area (MPA), invasion of S. horneri was suppressed, likely due to competitive pressure from native algae, resulting from protection of urchin predators. In a nearby fished urchin barren, invasion of S. horneri was also suppressed, due to herbivory by urchins whose predators are fished. Within newer MPAs with intermediate levels of interacting species, S. horneri was abundant. Here, neither competition from native algae nor herbivory was sufficient to prevent invasion. We confirm that invasion in marine systems is complex and show that multiple mechanisms in single systems must be considered when investigating biotic resistance hypotheses.","[Caselle, Jennifer E.; Davis, Kathryn] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Marks, Lindsay M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Caselle, JE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",caselle@ucsb.edu,,,California Sea Grant [NA14OAR4170075]; National Marine Sanctuaries Dr. Nancy Foster scholarship [NA13NOS4290006]; PISCO (Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans) - David and Lucille Packard Foundation; CA Department of Fish and Wildlife; CA Ocean Protection Council,"We thank the numerous divers who assisted in the field, but especially A.

Whether such intraguild interactions can also occur between adult females of one species and adult males of another, is not known. Herein, we report on intraguild interactions between adults of the two sexes in cross-pairing experiments involving three related phytoseiid species (Neoseiulus paspalivorus, N. baraki and N. neobaraki) that are potential candidates for controlling the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis, a serious pest of coconut palms in tropical countries. For comparative reasons, the experiments were repeated with larvae instead of males, and with only males or only females of two different species together. In the presence of an ample supply of prey, females of N. neobaraki never fed on individuals of their own species, yet appeared to be very aggressive against males, as well as larvae of the other two phytoseiid species. They also fed on females of N. paspalivorus, but rarely on females of N. baraki. Males of N. neobaraki did not suffer mortality when together with females of either of the two other phytoseiid species. Males of N. baraki did not suffer predation from females of N. paspalivorus, but males of N. paspalivorus suffered some mortality (15 %) from N. baraki females. Larvae of each of the three species were vulnerable to intraguild predation by heterospecific adult females, except for N. neobaraki larvae when together with N. baraki females. The absence or presence of intraguild predation is largely explained by the size ratios of the individuals that were put together: large individuals feed on smaller ones, but never the reverse. For each sex, size declines in the following order: N. neobaraki > N. baraki > N. paspalivorus. Moreover, for each species, females are larger than males and males are larger than larvae. Strikingly, however, females did not kill males and larvae of their own species. We propose that niche competition between related phytoseiid species is not only determined by intraguild predation on heterospecific larvae, but also by imposing great mortality on males from the intraguild prey because phytoseiid females being pseudo-arrhenotokous require insemination to produce offspring of both sexes.","[Sourassou, Nazer Famah; Hanna, Rachid; Negloh, Koffi] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin; [Sourassou, Nazer Famah; Negloh, Koffi; Breeuwer, Johannes A.

In natural communities, however, other antagonists and symbionts moderate competition. Thus, we have to go beyond studying pairwise interactions. Natural enemies may facilitate coexistence if they affect the superior competitor more strongly, or they can hinder coexistence via apparent competition. Less well studied is the role of symbionts, which may influence species coexistence in conjunction with enemies. Eukaryotes commonly harbour microbial endosymbionts that provide protection against natural enemies, but are costly in their absence. Such defensive symbionts could thus mediate coexistence of species competing for the same resource, both in the presence and in the absence of enemies, but as yet there is little evidence for this claim. We addressed this proposed role of defensive symbionts in replicated simple communities consisting of two aphid species sharing the same host plant and the same natural enemy, a parasitoid wasp. Both, one, or neither species were infected with a resistance-conferring symbiont, and they competed in the absence as well as the presence of parasitoids. The symbiont had significant effects in the absence of parasitoids by lowering competitive ability especially in one species, but the effects were more dramatic in the presence of parasitoids. With both species protected by the symbiont, parasitoid densities remained low and both aphid species persisted. When neither species was protected, parasitoids drove both species to extinction. Surprisingly, the same outcome was observed when only one species was protected. The susceptible species supported high densities of parasitoids that also killed the resistant aphids via mechanisms other than parasitism, presumably by disturbing them to the point of starvation. This is an intriguing form of apparent competition. Our results demonstrate an important role of defensive symbionts in insect communities through modifying species interactions. This highlights the need for experimental data when studying species coexistence in competitive networks. Furthermore, the observation that a susceptible host can negatively affect a resistant host via a shared parasitoid is an instructive insight for biological control.","[Hertaeg, Corinne; Vorburger, Christoph] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Hertaeg, Corinne; Vorburger, Christoph] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, D USYS, Zurich, Switzerland","Vorburger, C (corresponding author), Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland.; Vorburger, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, D USYS, Zurich, Switzerland.",christoph.vorburger@eawag.ch,"Vorburger, Christoph/A-1650-2008; Hertaeg, Corinne/ABA-6078-2020","Vorburger, Christoph/0000-0002-3627-0841; Hertaeg, Corinne/0000-0002-2730-4042","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [CRSII3_154396, PP00P3_146341]","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: CRSII3_154396 and PP00P3_146341",,51,5,5,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Species occurrence is influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of other species. Current approaches for multispecies occupancy modelling are practically limited to two interacting species and often require the assumption of asymmetric interactions. We propose amultispecies occupancymodel that can accommodate two ormore interacting species. 2. We generalize the single-species occupancy model to two or more interacting species by assuming the latent occupancy state is a multivariate Bernoulli random variable. We propose modelling the probability of each potential latent occupancy state with both a multinomial logit and a multinomial probit model and present details of aGibbs sampler for the latter. 3. As an example, we model co-occurrence probabilities of bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a function of human disturbance variables throughout 6 Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. We found evidence for pairwise interactions among most species, and the probability of some pairs of species occupying the same site varied along environmental gradients; for example, occupancy probabilities of coyote and grey fox were independent at sites with little human disturbance, but these two species were more likely to occur together at sites with high human disturbance. 4. Ecological communities are composed of multiple interacting species. Our proposed method improves our ability to draw inference from such communities by permitting modelling of detection/non-detection data from an arbitrary number of species, without assuming asymmetric interactions. Additionally, our proposed method permits modelling the probability two or more species occur together as a function of environmental variables. These advancements represent an important improvement in our ability to draw community-level inference from multiple interacting species that are subject to imperfect detection.","[Rota, Christopher T.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Rota, Christopher T.; Millspaugh, Joshua J.] Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlidfe Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Ferreira, Marco A.

We explored density-dependent fitness attributes and carry-over effects in Crawfish Frogs (Rana areolata) using a set of field enclosure experiments and a series of field data. Using field enclosures, we hypothesized that 1) at high densities, intraspecific competition would produce smaller Crawfish Frog juveniles that took longer to metamorphose; 2) at high densities, interspecific competition would also produce smaller Crawfish Frog juveniles that took longer to metamorphose; and 3) vertebrate (ambystomatid salamander) predation on Crawfish Frog larvae would reduce survivorship, but by releasing competition pressure would produce relatively larger tadpoles that metamorphosed earlier. Further, we hypothesized 4) that these enclosure results would apply to field data, and that fitness attributes in newly metamorphosed Crawfish Frogs would carry over to first-time breeding adults. Our results confirmed all four hypotheses. Specifically, in Crawfish Frogs, at high densities, both intra- and interspecific competition reduced size (length and mass) at metamorphosis (hypotheses 1 and 2), and predation reduced survivorship and increased size at metamorphosis (hypothesis 3). Finally, we observed density-dependent fitness effects on newly metamorphosed Crawfish Frog juvenile size (length and mass), and carry-over effects from the larval stage on juvenile survival, adult size, and breeding adult numbers (hypothesis 4). In the absence of predators, high densities of intra- and interspecific competitors had no effect on Crawfish Frog larval survivorship. We also present suggestive evidence for compensatory effects. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the patterns of these interactions, as well as the role of these relationships in informing management guidelines intended to ensure the future of this species of conservation concern.","[Stiles, Rochelle M.] San Francisco Zool Soc, 1 Zoo Rd, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Terrell, Vanessa C.

Terrestrial seminatural habitats, such as hedgerows and grassy field margins, can enhance the abundance and diversity of spiders in adjoining fields, whereas the potential of riparian margins has rarely been studied. We compared the effects of hedgerows and riparian margins on aerial web-building spiders in adjacent cereal fields. While species richness and overall abundance did not significantly respond to distance from or type of field margin, each of the four dominant species responded differently. The abundance of Tetragnatha cf. montana Simon 1874 increased towards both hedgerows and riparian margins. Tetragnatha extensa (Linnaeus 1758) differentiated between field margin types and abundances increased only towards riparian margins. By contrast, Phylloneta impressa (L. Koch 1881) abundances decreased from field centers towards the field margins irrespective of the type. Type of field margin and distance showed an interactive effect on Mangora acalypha (Aralckenaer 1802) abundances, which decreased from field centers towards hedgerows but changed only little towards riparian margins. Increasing spider densities towards field margins can be explained by the preference of spiders for adjoining seminatural habitats (overwintering, food availability, microclimate, vegetation structure), whereas increases towards field centers might be caused by interspecific competition and enhanced predation pressure near seminatural habitats and high prey numbers in crop fields. Overall, our study demonstrates that aerial web-building spider species respond differently to hedgerows and riparian margins.","[Pfister, Sonja C.; Schafer, Ralf B.; Schirmel, Jens; Entling, Martin H.] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany","Pfister, SC (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, Fortstr 7, D-76829 Landau, Germany.",pfister@uni-landau.de,"Schafer, Ralf Bernhard/E-1926-2011; Entling, Martin H/C-6953-2008; Schirmel, Jens/I-3467-2012","Schafer, Ralf Bernhard/0000-0003-3510-1701; Pfister, Sonja C./0000-0001-5362-3330",,,,57,10,13,0,29,AMER ARACHNOLOGICAL SOC,COLLEGE PARK,"UNIV MARYLAND, DEPT ENTOMOLOGY, 4112 PLANT SCIENCES BLDG, COLLEGE PARK, MD 20742-4454 USA",0161-8202,1937-2396,,J ARACHNOL,J.

As a result, monitoring of marine fouling communities is crucial to evaluate the introduction and spread of NIS as well as assess the efficacy of legislation aimed to prevent further introductions. Settlement plates have long been used as a means of studying fouling communities. Many factors such as orientation, movement, and substrate type have been shown to influence the number and type of organisms present in fouling communities, but one key question remains poorly studied: how well do settlement plates represent the established fouling community of a marina, especially regarding NIS? We investigated this question, by examining the sessile invertebrates on both marina structures and settlement plates from three marinas in San Francisco Bay (California, USA). Total species richness, NIS richness, and community composition on settlement plates were found to be similar to those on existing marina floating docks. Our results indicate that settlement plates can provide a sensitive and standardized measure of the NIS richness and composition in fouling communities.","[Marraffini, Michelle L.; Ashton, Gail V.; Chang, Andrew L.; Ruiz, Greg M.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 3150 Paradise Dr Bldg 30, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA; [Brown, Chris W.] Calif State Lands Commiss Marine Invas Species Pr, 100 Howe Ave,Suite 100, South Sacramento, CA 95825 USA","Marraffini, ML (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 3150 Paradise Dr Bldg 30, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA.",marraffinim@si.edu,"Chang, Andrew/J-8058-2016","Chang, Andrew/0000-0002-7870-285X; Ashton, Gail/0000-0001-5884-3383",Californian Department of Fish and Wildlife [PO875036]; Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution,"We would like to thank the invaluable efforts of all of those that worked on this project in the field, laboratory, and analysis stages.

This review aims to determine how consistent the impacts of aquatic invasions are across taxa and habitats. To that end, we present a global meta-analysis from 151 publications (733 cases), covering a wide range of invaders (primary producers, filter collectors, omnivores and predators), resident aquatic community components (macrophytes, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish) and habitats (rivers, lakes and estuaries). Our synthesis suggests a strong negative influence of invasive species on the abundance of aquatic communities, particularly macrophytes, zooplankton and fish. In contrast, there was no general evidence for a decrease in species diversity in invaded habitats, suggesting a time lag between rapid abundance changes and local extinctions. Invaded habitats showed increased water turbidity, nitrogen and organic matter concentration, which are related to the capacity of invaders to transform habitats and increase eutrophication. The expansion of invasive macrophytes caused the largest decrease in fish abundance, the filtering activity of filter collectors depleted planktonic communities, omnivores (including both facultative and obligate herbivores) were responsible for the greatest decline in macrophyte abundance, and benthic invertebrates were most negatively affected by the introduction of new predators. These impacts were relatively consistent across habitats and experimental approaches. Based on our results, we propose a framework of positive and negative links between invasive species at four trophic positions and the five different components of recipient communities. This framework incorporates both direct biotic interactions (predation, competition, grazing) and indirect changes to the water physicochemical conditions mediated by invaders (habitat alteration). Considering the strong trophic links that characterize aquatic ecosystems, this framework is relevant to anticipate the far-reaching consequences of biological invasions on the structure and functionality of aquatic ecosystems.","[Gallardo, Belinda; Clavero, Miguel; Sanchez, Marta I.; Vila, Montserrat] EBD CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Seville 41092, Spain","Gallardo, B (corresponding author), IPE CSIC, Pyrenean Inst Ecol, Appl & Restorat Ecol Grp, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",belinda@ipe.csic.es,"Sanchez, Marta I/E-9723-2010; Vila, Montserrat/D-9339-2013; Gallardo, Belinda/H-9038-2013; Clavero, Miguel/A-9040-2015","Sanchez, Marta I/0000-0002-8349-5410; Vila, Montserrat/0000-0003-3171-8261; Gallardo, Belinda/0000-0002-1552-8233; Clavero, Miguel/0000-0002-5186-0153",Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in R+D+I [SEV-2012-0262],We acknowledge financial support through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in R+D+I (SEV-2012-0262).

This is true for some habitats, including rocky shores. However, experimental studies indicate that marine soft sediment communities do not function like this. In shallow-water sediments, competition is usually symmetric and relatively weak. Asymmetric competition that leads to the elimination of one species by another on time scales shorter than one generation is rare, apart from interactions that involve large-scale modification or disturbance of the sediment. Competition is therefore relatively unimportant as a process structuring communities and the impact of predation is usually to reduce rather than enhance diversity. These results have been largely ignored by the literature on deep-sea diversity. If deep-sea communities function in similar ways, coexistence of many species within small areas on short time scales does not need further explanation. We do, however, need to explain why abundances of all species remain bounded on large spatial scales and time scales of several generations. The model of diversity maintenance proposed by Huston (1979) and applied to the deep sea by Rex (1983) achieves this by implicit intra-specific, density-dependent processes that increase the population growth rate of species that have become locally rare. This would give robust maintenance of diversity, but there is no evidence for density dependence of this type in the deep sea, and nio plausible mechanisms by which it could occur. Alternative models require either spatial heterogeneity on a scale much larger than that envisaged by the grain-matching hypothesis or the placing of a cap on the abundance of common species, perhaps by frequency-dependent predation. Arbitrating between these possibilities will require assessments of the population dynamics and spatial distribution of individual species on spatial and temporal scales much greater than those usually considered in the deep sea.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Grant, A (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",a.grant@uea.ac.uk,"Grant, Alastair/L-7301-2018","Grant, Alastair/0000-0002-1147-2375",,,,97,19,21,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-9565,,,MAR ECOL-P S Z N I,Mar.

We propose optimal transportation theory as a unified view for modeling species interaction networks with different intensities of interactions. We pose the coupling of two distributions as a constrained optimization problem, maximizing both the system's average utility and its global entropy, that is, randomness. Our model follows naturally from applying the MaxEnt principle to this problem setting. This approach allows for simulating changes in species relative densities as well as to disentangle the impact of trait matching and neutral forces. We provide a framework for estimating the pairwise species utilities from data. Experimentally, we show how to use this framework to perform trait matching and predict the coupling in pollination and host-parasite networks.","[Stock, Michiel; De Baets, Bernard] Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal & Math Modelling, Ghent, Belgium; [Poisot, Timothee] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Poisot, Timothee] McGill Univ, Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Stock, M (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal & Math Modelling, Ghent, Belgium.",michiel.stock@ugent.be,"De Baets, Bernard/E-8877-2010","De Baets, Bernard/0000-0002-3876-620X",Fonds Wetenschappelijk OnderzoekFWO [FWO17/PDO/067],"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, Grant/Award Number: FWO17/PDO/067",,61,2,2,8,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Theory and experiments predict that resource partitioning among functionally different predator species can strengthen prey suppression, because as a group they can access more prey types than functionally redundant predators. However, this prediction assumes that competition limits predation by functionally similar predators. Differences in prey density can alter the strength of competition, suggesting that prey abundance may modulate the effect of combining functionally diverse species. The experiment documented here examined the potential for functional differences among predator species to promote suppression of an insect pest, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), at different prey densities. Predation was compared at two prey densities between microcosms that contained one predator species or two functionally distinct species: the lady beetle, Coleomegilla maculata De Geer (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) that kills early L. decemlineata instars, and the soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris Say (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) that kills late instars. The data show that combining these predators increased predation only when prey densities were low. This suggests that multiple predator species may only provide greater biological control than single species in systems where prey is limiting.","[Werling, Ben P.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lowenstein, David M.; Gratton, Claudio] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Straub, Cory S.] Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA","Werling, BP (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",werlingb@msu.edu; dmlowenstein@wisc.edu; cstraub@ursinus.edu; cgratton@wisc.edu,,,"University of Wisconsin; HHMIHoward Hughes Medical Institute; NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0709743]; USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [WIS-4833]","Thanks to J.

The effects of phenology on species interactions are especially pronounced in aquatic systems, but the evidence is largely derived from experimental studies. We examined whether differences in breeding phenology between two pond-breeding salamanders (Ambystoma annulatum and A. maculatum) affected metamorph recruitment and demographic traits within natural populations, with the expectation that the fall-breeding A. annulatum would negatively affect the spring-breeding A. maculatum. We monitored populations of each species at five ponds over 4 years using drift fences. Metamorph abundance and survival of A. annulatum were affected by intra- and interspecific processes, whereas metamorph size and date of emigration were primarily influenced by intraspecific effects. Metamorph abundance, snout-vent length, date of emigration and survival for A. maculatum were all predicted by combinations of intra- and interspecific effects, but often showed negative relationships with A. annulatum metamorph traits and abundance. Size and date of metamorphosis were strongly correlated within each species, but in opposite patterns (negative for A. annulatum and positive for A. maculatum), suggesting that the two species use alternative strategies to enhance terrestrial survival and that these factors may influence their interactions. Our results match predictions from experimental studies that suggest recruitment is influenced by intra- and interspecific processes which are determined by phenological differences between species. Incorporating spatiotemporal variability when modeling population dynamics is necessary to understand the importance of phenology in species interactions, especially as shifts in phenology occur under climate change.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Conner, Christopher A.; Osbourn, Michael S.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Hocking, Daniel J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Earl, Julia E.] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Harper, Elizabeth B.] Paul Smiths Coll, Div Nat Resource Management & Ecol, Paul Smiths, NY 12970 USA; [Peterman, William E.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Rittenhouse, Tracy A.

Very little is known though about the shape of the cost function for species with direct interference competition. Here we report the results of an experiment with two vole species in artificial coexistence in large enclosures, where density of the dominant competitor species (Microtus agrestis) was manipulated. Experimental populations of the subordinate vole species (Clethrionomys glareolus) were composed of same aged individuals to study distribution of costs of coexistence with a dominant species within an age-cohort. Survival and space use decreased gradually with increasing field vole numbers. Thus, responses to interference competition in our system appeared to be similar as expected from resource competition. The total number of breeders was stable. Reproductive characteristics such as the timing of breeding, and the litter size were not affected. In the single species enclosures a proportion of surviving individuals were not able to establish a breeding territory against stronger conspecifics. Under competition with heterospecifics such nonbreeders suffered high mortality, whereas the breeders survived. Combined interference of dominant conspecifics and heterospecifics probably increased the frequency of aggressive interactions, social stress and mortality for the weaker individuals within a homogeneous age cohort of the subordinate competitor population. Our results suggest, that in open systems where bank voles are outcompeted over the breeding season by faster reproducing field voles, animals able to establish a territory may be able to withstand competitor pressure, while nonbreeding bank vole individuals are forced to emigrate to suboptimal forest habitats.","Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",jana.eccard@uni-bielefeld.de,,,,,,42,14,16,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We used three years of live-trapping and measures of the plant community around trap stations to explore the responses of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), and short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) to forest-field edges in upstate New York. We found that capture probabilities of voles were highest in grass- and forb-dominated micro-habitats and in old-field zones distant from the forest edge. In contrast, capture probabilities of white-footed mice were highest in shrub-dominated microhabitats and in zones near the forest edge. Short-tailed shrews did not show strong micro- or macrohabitat associations. The responses by voles, the competitive dominant in our system, to variation along forest-field edges were more consistent across years than were those of the competitively inferior, white-footed mouse. Mice were less likely to use the old-field interiors when vole density was high than when it was low, suggesting competitive displacement of mice by voles. Finally, we found good agreement between the spatial activity patterns of mice and voles in old-fields and their impacts on patterns of survival of tree seeds and seedlings in concurrent studies.

Motivated by a community study on aphids and their fungal pathogens, three hypotheses were tested experimentally to investigate the influence of the fungal pathogen, Erynia neoaphidis Remaudiere and Hennebert, on aphid population and community ecology. 2. Field experiments were performed in 2 years to test whether two susceptible aphid species on different host plants might interact through the shared fungal pathogen. No strong pathogen-mediated indirect interactions (apparent competition) between populations of pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris and nettle aphid Microlophium carnosum Buckton were detected. 3. In the first of the field experiments, pea aphids exposed to the fungus showed a weak tendency to produce more winged dispersal morphs than control populations not exposed to the fungus. In a laboratory test, however, no support was found for the hypothesis that the presence of volatiles from fungus-infected cadavers promotes production of winged offspring. 4. The response of the pea aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi Halliday to colonies containing hosts infected 1 and 3 days previously was assessed.

Sudden Oak Death (SOD), caused by Phytophthora ramorum (Oomycota), is an introduced disease causing large-scale tree mortality. Two additional Phytophthora species, Phytophthora nemorosa and Phytophthora pseudosyringae, cause significantly lower oak mortality, yet they also commonly colonize leaves of Umbellularia californica, the major transmissive host of SOD in California. We combined field surveys and inoculation experiments to understand disease prevalence dynamics and competitive interactions among these pathogen species. Despite the broader geographic distribution of P. nemorosa with respect to that of P. ramorum, our results suggest that P. nemorosa exhibits a narrower ecological amplitude and, in any given region, occupies fewer sites than P. ramorum. Our results additionally suggest that, perhaps due to priority effects, P. nemorosa can persist at levels comparable to those of P. ramorum in ecologically suitable plots when climate favors P. ramorum dormancy. However, P. ramorum prevalence increases to levels higher than those of the competing species when abundant rainfall triggers its sporulation. Understanding the determinants and outcomes of competition between these species has important implications for understanding the epidemiology and possible control strategies for Sudden Oak Death.

Improved sampling methods and the expansion of investigations into a wide variety of habitats have revolutionized our understanding of the deep sea. Local species diversity shows clear geographic variation on spatial scales of 100-1000 km. Recent sampling programs have revealed unexpected complexity in community structure at the landscape level that is associated with large-scale oceanographic processes and their environmental consequences. We review the relationships between variation in local species diversity and the regional-scale phenomena of boundary constraints, gradients of productivity, sediment heterogeneity, oxygen availability, hydrodynamic regimes, and catastrophic physical disturbance. We present a conceptual model of how these interdependent environmental factors shape regional-scale variation in local diversity. Local communities in the deep sea may be composed of species that exist as metapopulations whose regional distribution depends on a balance among global-scale, landscape-scale, and small-scale dynamics. Environmental gradients may form geographic patterns of diversity by influencing local processes such as predation, resource partitioning, competitive exclusion, and facilitation that determine species coexistence. The measurement of deep-sea species diversity remains a vital issue in comparing geographic patterns and evaluating their potential causes. Recent assessments of diversity using species accumulation curves with randomly pooled samples confirm the often-disputed claim that the deep sea supports higher diversity than the continental shelf. However, more intensive quantitative sampling is required to fully characterize the diversity of deep-sea sediments, the most extensive habitat on Earth. Once considered to be constant, spatially uniform, and isolated, deep-sea sediments are now recognized as a dynamic, richly textured environment that is inextricably linked to the global biosphere. Regional studies of the last two decades provide the empirical background necessary to formulate and test specific hypotheses of causality by controlled sampling designs and experimental approaches.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA; Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA","Levin, LA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",llevin@ucsd.edu; ron.etter@umb.edu; michael.rex@umb.edu; ang@soc.soton.ac.uk; csmith@soest.hawaii.edu; jpineda@whoi.edu; carol.stuart@umb.edu; rhessler@ucsd.edu; pawson.david@nmnh.si.edu,"Gooday, Andrew/AAH-8991-2021; PINEDA, JESUS/AAG-7171-2019; Gooday, Andrew/ABB-4267-2020","Gooday, Andrew/0000-0002-5661-7371; Levin, Lisa/0000-0002-2858-8622; Pineda, Jesus/0000-0002-5362-8614",,,,214,496,518,5,176,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4162,,,ANNU REV ECOL SYST,Annu.

Invasive alien predators, for example, can significantly disrupt recipient communities by consuming prey species or acting as an intraguild predator (IGP). Behavioural interactions are key components of interspecific competition between predators, yet these are often overlooked invasion processes. Here, we show how behavioural, non-lethal IGP interactions might facilitate the establishment success of an invading alien species. We experimentally assessed changes in feeding behaviour (prey preference and consumption rate) of native UK coccinellid species (Adalia bipunctata and Coccinella septempunctata), whose populations are, respectively, declining and stable, when exposed to the invasive intraguild predator, Harmonia axyridis. Using a population dynamics model parameterized with these experimental data, we predicted how intraguild predation, accommodating interspecific behavioural interactions, might impact the abundance of the native and invasive alien species over time. When competing for the same aphid resource, the feeding rate of A.bipunctata significantly increased compared to the feeding in isolation, while the feeding rate of H.axyridis significantly decreased. This suggests that despite significant declines in the UK, A.bipunctata is a superior competitor to the intraguild predator H.axyridis. In contrast, the behaviour of non-declining C.septempunctata was unaltered by the presence of H.axyridis. Our experimental data show the differential behavioural plasticity of competing native and invasive alien predators, but do not explain A.bipunctata declines observed in the UK. Using behavioural plasticity as a parameter in a population dynamic model for A.bipunctata and H.axyridis, coexistence is predicted between the native and invasive alien following an initial period of decline in the native species. We demonstrate how empirical and theoretical techniques can be combined to understand better the processes and consequences of alien species invasions for native biodiversity.","[Hentley, William T.; Beckerman, Andrew P.; Brien, Melanie N.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Hentley, William T.; Brien, Melanie N.; Hails, Rosemary S.] CEH, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Hentley, William T.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [Hentley, William T.; Jones, T.

Species assemblages described from these artificial habitats are novel relative to natural reefs, particularly in terms of the abundance of nonindigenous species (NIS). Although these fouling assemblages are clearly distinctive, the ecosystem functioning and species interactions taking place there are little understood. For instance, large predators may influence the fouling community development either directly (feeding on sessile fauna) or indirectly (feeding on small predators associated with these assemblages). In addition, by providing refuges, habitat complexity may modify the outcome of species interactions and the extent of biotic resistance (e.g., by increasing the abundance of niche-specific competitors and predators of NIS). Using experimental settlement panels deployed in the field for 2.5 months, we tested the influence of predation (i.e., caging experiment), artificial structural complexity (i.e., mimics of turf-forming species), and their interactions (i.e., refuge effects) on the development of sessile and mobile fauna in two marinas. In addition, we tested the role of biotic complexity-arising from the habitat-forming species that grew on the panels during the trial-on the richness and abundance of mobile fauna. The effect of predation and artificial habitat complexity was negligible, regardless of assemblage status (i.e., native, cryptogenic, and nonindigenous). Conversely, habitat-forming species and associated epibionts, responsible for biotic complexity, had a significant effect on mobile invertebrates (richness, abundance, and community structure). In particular, the richness and abundance of mobile NIS were positively affected by biotic complexity, with site-dependent relationships. Altogether, our results indicate that biotic complexity prevails over artificial habitat complexity in determining the distribution of mobile species under low predation pressure. Facilitation of native and non -native species thus seems to act upon diversity and community development: This process deserves further consideration in models of biotic resistance to invasion in urban marine habitats.","[Leclerc, Jean-Charles; Viard, Frederique] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Stn Biol Roscoff,UMR 7144,AD2M, Roscoff, France; [Leclerc, Jean-Charles] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, CIBAS, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Concepcion, Chile","Leclerc, JC; Viard, F (corresponding author), UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Stn Biol Roscoff,UMR 7144,AD2M, Roscoff, France.",leclercjc@gmail.com; viard@sb-roscoff.fr,"Leclerc, Jean-Charles/T-1400-2018; Viard, Frederique/O-4360-2018","Leclerc, Jean-Charles/0000-0003-3663-3785; Viard, Frederique/0000-0001-5603-9527",UPMC-Sorbonne University,UPMC-Sorbonne University,,91,16,16,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Although less well studied, turbidity can also have significant effects on trophic interactions and food webs by modifying light penetration and scattering, influencing foraging ability of visual-hunting predators such as fishes. By interfering with visual foragers, turbidity may shift food webs towards predators that forage with other sensory modalities (e.g. chemoreception and mechanoreception), consequently altering food web structure. We analysed turbidity effects on estuarine community composition and biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico by analysing an 18-year fisheries-independent data set and assessing communities inhabiting contemporary oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica). In the long-term data set, elevated turbidity was associated with decreased fish species richness and diversity and higher abundances of benthic species that rely more on chemoreception for foraging and predator avoidance (e.g. crabs). High turbidity may provide a predation refuge for crabs and other benthic organisms that visually oriented fish prey upon. On oyster reefs, crabs readily consume suspension-feeding organisms including newly settled oysters and porcelain crabs (Petrolisthes armatus). Both were significantly less abundant in high turbidity. Human practices that increase turbidity may indirectly influence trophic interactions, species distributions, ecosystem function, and biodiversity.","[Lunt, Jessica; Smee, Delbert L.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Smee, Delbert L.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL USA","Lunt, J (corresponding author), Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA.",jessica.h.lunt@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation-Major Research Instrumentation GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0821215]; Texas Sea Grant; Texas Research Development Fund; Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC) Faculty Enhancement Grant; Harvey Weil Sportsman Conservationist Award; Ruth A.

We evaluated the individual and combined effects of rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) and Chinese mystery snails [Bellamya (=Cipangopaludina) chinensis] on native snail communities (Physa, Helisoma and Lymnaea sp.) and ecosystem attributes (algal chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations). Both invaders are widespread in the USA and commonly co-occur within northern temperate lakes, underscoring the importance of understanding their singular and joint effects. An outdoor mesocosm experiment revealed that while the two invaders had only weakly negative effects upon one another, both negatively affected the abundance and biomass of native snails, and their combined presence drove one native species to extinction and reduced a second by > 95%. Owing to its larger size and thicker shell, adult Bellamya were protected from crayfish attack relative to native species (especially Physa and Lymnaea), suggesting the co-occurrence of these invaders in nature could have elevated consequences for native communities. The per capita impacts of Orconectes (a snail predator) on native snails were substantially greater than those of Bellamya (a snail competitor). Crayfish predation also had a cascading effect by reducing native snail biomass, leading to increased periphyton growth. Bellamya, in contrast, reduced periphyton biomass, likely causing a reduction in growth by native lymnaeid snails. Bellamya also increased water column N:P ratio, possibly because of a low P excretion rate relative to native snail species. Together, these findings highlight the importance of understanding interactions among invasive species, which can have significant community- and ecosystem-level effects.","[Johnson, Pieter T.

Closely related species often differ greatly in the quality and breadth of resources exploited, but the actual mechanisms causing these differences are poorly understood. Because in the laboratory specialized species often survive and perform as well or better on host species that are never utilized in nature, negative ecological interactions restricting host range must exist. Here, we focused on reproductive interference, which has been theoretically predicted to drive niche separation between closely related species with overlapping mating signals. 2. We examined the interspecific sexual interactions in relation to ecological specialization and generalization in two sibling ladybird species, Harmonia yedoensis and Harmonia axyridis. Harmonia yedoensis is a specialist predator that preys only on pine aphids, which are highly elusive prey for ladybird hatchlings, whereas H.similar to axyridis is a generalist predator with a broad prey and habitat range. 3. We experimentally showed that conspecific sperm fertilized the vast majority of eggs regardless of mating order (i.e. conspecific sperm precedence) when a female of H.similar to yedoensis or H.similar to axyridis mated with both a conspecific and a heterospecific male. Moreover, we demonstrated that mating opportunities of H.similar to yedoensis females strongly decreased as heterospecific density increased relative to conspecific density. In contrast, in H.similar to axyridis, female mating success was high regardless of conspecific or heterospecific density. 4. Our results suggest that the generalist H.similar to axyridis should be dominant to the specialist H.similar to yedoensis in terms of reproductive interference. Our results support the hypothesis that asymmetric reproductive interference from the dominant species may force the non-dominant species to become a specialist predator that exclusively utilizes less preferred prey in nature.","[Noriyuki, Suzuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Osawa, Naoya] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Forest Ecol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Nishida, Takayoshi] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Ecosyst Studies, Hikone 5228533, Japan","Noriyuki, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",nsuzuki@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Osawa, Naoya/ABG-1684-2020; Suzuki, Noriyuki/I-4882-2015","Suzuki, Noriyuki/0000-0002-7483-0758; Osawa, Naoya/0000-0002-6355-1948","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [20405047, 20657005]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [20405047] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank Dr Peter Mayhew for valuable discussions and Sarah Seiter for helpful comments on the manuscript.

These species were chosen based on their high abundance and overlapping diets. Juvenile mosquitofish and sailfin mollies, at a range of densities matching field estimates, were maintained in the presence of adult mosquitofish, sailfin mollies, and bluefin killifish to test for effects of competition and predation on juvenile survival and growth. The mesocosms held 1,200 1 of water and all conditions were set to simulate those in Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park (ENP), USA. We placed floating mars of periphyton and bladderwort in each tank in standard volumes that matched field values to provide cover and to introduce invertebrate prey. Of 15 possible intra- and interspecific age-structured interactions, we found 7 to be present at the densities of these fish found in Shark River Slough marshes. Predation by adult mosquitofish on juvenile fish, including conspecifics, was the strongest effect observed. We also observed growth limitation in mosquitofish and sailfin molly juveniles from intra- and interspecific competition. When maintained at high densities, juvenile mosquitofish changed their diets to include more cladocerans and fewer chironomid larvae relative to low densities. We estimated size-specific gape limitation by adult mosquitofish when consuming juvenile mosquitofish and sailfin mollies. At high field densities, intraspecific competition might prolong the time period when juveniles are vulnerable to predation by adult mosquitofish. These results suggest that path analysis, or other techniques used to document food-web interactions, must include age-specific roles of these fishes.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; USGS Biol Resources Div, Everglades Nalt Pk Field Stn, Homestead, FL 33034 USA","Taylor, RC (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, POB 42451, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",,"Trexler, Joel C/I-5265-2012",,,,,47,38,40,1,30,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2001,127,1,,,,,143,152,,10.1007/s004420000575,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,413UA,WOS:000167629200016,28547165,,,,2021-09-27,

K. deyrolli nymphs and the predator Laccotrephes japonensis (Nepidae: Heteroptera) adults coexist in rice paddy fields. It was predicted that the difference in tadpole density may influence the K. deyrolli nymph survival rate. We first compared survival rates of the first instar nymphs of K. deyrolli in June (high tadpole density period) and July (low tadpole density period). Secondly, we investigated the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs at different tadpole densities and under the presence or absence of L. japonensis adults to examine whether higher tadpole density moderates predation pressure from L. japonensis adults to K. deyrolli nymphs, e.g., density-mediated indirect effects. As a result of the comparison, the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs in June was higher than that in July. For the field experiment, the slopes between the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs and tadpole density were positive under both predator presence and absence. However, the slope under the presence of a predator was steeper than that under absence of the predator (predator-by-tadpole density interaction was significant). These results suggest that a higher tadpole density in June provides an abundant food resource for K. deyrolli nymphs and also moderates predation pressure from L. japonensis.","Okayama Univ, Lab Insect Ecol, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Ohba, S (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Lab Insect Ecol, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",oobah8ag@yahoo.co.jp,"Ohba, Shin-ya/M-5406-2019","Ohba, Shin-ya/0000-0003-3854-0902",,,,33,6,8,0,10,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

I performed two experiments in an early-successional site in two consecutive years. In the first experiment I tested the effects of litter and competition, and their interaction, on establishment and growth of tree seedlings. In the second experiment I studied the effect of insecticide application in combination with litter and herb competition on seedling establishment and growth, and on arthropod abundance. In the absence of competition, litter had no significant effect on the biomass of woody seedlings, though it delayed seedling emergence. Herb competition reduced the growth of the woody seedlings, but the addition of leaf litter reduced the density and biomass of the herbs, indirectly improving the growth of the woody seedlings. Litter increased both invertebrate damage to seedling cotyledons and seedling mortality. The application of insecticide increased seedling emergence and reduced seedling mortality, and more so in the presence of litter. The total number of arthropods and the number of plant-chewing arthropods were increased by the addition of litter and reduced by application of insecticide. Thus, litter had, simultaneously, a positive indirect effect on individual biomass through reduced competition, and a negative indirect effect on the number of individuals through increased seed and/or seedling predation, and a negative direct effect on seedling mortality.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,POB 1059,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855; NEW YORK BOT GARDEN,INST ECOSYST STUDIES,MARY FLAGLER CARY ARBORETUM,MILLBROOK,NY 12454",,,,"Facelli, Jose/0000-0002-0408-0082",,,,52,154,167,2,53,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,,,,,1727,1735,,10.2307/1939632,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,WOS:A1994PE26700020,,,,,2021-09-27,

The responses of Moina micrura (Cladocera) to slight salinity increases (up to 6.0) were evaluated through laboratory manipulative experiments and field observations at Cabiunas lagoon (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). From the field data, a positive relationship between M. micrura density and salinity was observed, whereas the opposite was found for other co-occurring microcrustaceans. Life-table observations from laboratory experiments showed better performance of individuals exposed to control conditions (no salt addition) and 1.0 and 2.0 of salinity. The difference between field and laboratory results may be explained considering possible direct and indirect effects of salinity on M. micrura populations. Salinity may have direct negative physiological effects in individuals. However, under natural conditions, M. micrura might benefit from reduced invertebrate predation and interspecific competition. This balance between negative and positive effects of salinity is probably more positive under natural conditions, explaining the success of M. micrura in Cabiunas lagoon under mild salinity conditions. Although salinity negatively affects many species living in freshwater systems, slight increases may be beneficial for some species under natural conditions.","[Santangelo, Jayme M.; Bozelli, Reinaldo L.; Rocha, Adriana de M.; Esteves, Francisco de A.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Esteves, Francisco de A.] Nucleo Pesquisas Ecol & Desenvolvimento Socioambi, BR-28970 Macae, RJ, Brazil","Bozelli, RL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Av Carlos Chagas Filho 373,POB 68020, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",bozelli@biologia.ufrj.br,"Santangelo, Jayme M/B-5922-2011; Bozelli, Reinaldo/S-6414-2019; Bozelli, Reinaldo L/G-1805-2012","Bozelli, Reinaldo L/0000-0001-9916-1629",CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CNPq-PeldConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); PetrobrasFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Amapa (FAPEAP)Petrobras; Pronex; FaperjFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ),"The authors thank the staff of the Laboratorio de Limnologia da UFRJ and NUPEM/UFRJ, especially Joao Marcelo Souza for field assistance.

However, the insight from food web topology into dynamic effects of perturbations on species is potentially hindered because most described topologies represent data integrated across spatial and temporal scales. We conducted a 10-year, whole-lake experiment in which we removed invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) from a 64-ha north-temperate lake and monitored responses of multiple trophic levels. We compared species responses observed in two sub-habitats to the responses predicted from all topologies of an integrated, literature- informed base food web model of 32 potential links. Out of 4.3 billion possible topologies, only 308,833 (0.0072%) predicted responses that qualitatively matched observed species responses in cobble habitat, and only 12,673 (0.0003%) matched observed responses in sand habitat. Furthermore, when constrained to predictions that both matched observed responses and were highly reliable (i. e., predictions were robust to link strength values), only 5040 (0.0001%) and 140 (0.000003%) topologies were identified for cobble and sand habitats, respectively. A small number of linkages were nearly always present in these valid, reliable networks in sand, while a greater variety of possible network configurations were possible in cobble. Direct links involving invasive rusty crayfish were more important in cobble, while indirect effects involving Lepomis spp. were more important in sand. Importantly, the importance of individual species linkages differed dramatically among cobble and sand sub-habitats within a single lake, even though species composition was identical. Although the true topology of food webs is difficult to determine, constraining topologies to include spatial resolution that matches observed experimental outcomes may reduce possibilities to a small number of plausible alternatives.","[Hansen, Gretchen J.

The outcomes of such experiments are often difficult to anticipate solely on the basis of intuition. This is because the effects of a perturbation may pass through a complex network of direct and indirect pathways in a food web, and the outcome may be highly sensitive to the strength of interactions among species. One solution to understanding outcomes of press experiments is to quantify first the community matrix, the matrix of measured direct interactions between all species in a food web, and then obtain the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of the community matrix predicts the effect of all species presses on all other species. I evaluated the utility of the inverse community matrix in predicting the outcomes of press experiments in an old-field food web. I used data from field and laboratory experiments to quantify the interaction strengths between grasshoppers, four old-field plants, and nitrogen supply. These values were used to parameterize the community matrix and obtain its inverse in a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was used to predict the mean and standard error in the outcome of a simultaneous nitrogen and herbivore press on food-web structure and dynamics. The predictions were compared with data from an enclosure experiment in the field in which I manipulated nitrogen supply and herbivore abundance. There was a high degree of uncertainty predicted and observed in the study system. Despite this, I show that the degree and the sources of uncertainty were predictable for each species. This suggests that the inverse community matrix offers a useful theoretical benchmark for understanding the outcome of field press experiments.","YALE UNIV,CTR COMPUTAT ECOL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511","Schmitz, OJ (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH FORESTRY & ENVIRONM STUDIES,370 PROSPECT ST,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511, USA.",,,,,,,54,96,98,1,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1997,78,1,,,,,55,69,,,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WD345,WOS:A1997WD34500004,,,,,2021-09-27,

While this model has largely been applied to competing species, it may also apply to predator-prey systems if predators influence intraspecific aggregation in their prey. Predators may influence intraspecific aggregation in prey communities by affecting prey immigration, emigration, and survival (both directly through predation and indirectly by modifying prey interactions and behavior). We performed a field experiment to determine whether predators influence the composition and aggregation of their macroinvertebrate prey in a marine subtidal food web. We quantified prey colonization of eight treatments that differed in the composition and richness of predators. We found between 50% and 70% of species exhibited positive intraspecific aggregation. We then asked whether the observed patterns in intraspecific aggregation among prey influenced local (alpha) diversity and turnover between local patches (beta diversity). Intraspecific aggregation was positively correlated with both alpha and beta diversity. The positive relationship between intraspecific aggregation and beta diversity was expected, however, the positive relationship between intraspecific aggregation and alpha diversity was not and runs counter to the negative relationship found in competitive communities. We suggest that the positive relationship we observed could occur because aggregation can increase prey survival and can generate a type III functional response. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In intertidal rocky shores over the world, the decrease of keystone macrograzers has resulted in an increase in the dominance of herbivores with smaller body (i.e., mesograzers), which could potentially alter community assembly and structure. Here, we experimentally tested whether mesograzers affect the structure of rocky intertidal communities during the period of early colonization after the occurrence of a disturbance. A manipulative field experiment was conducted to exclude mesograzers (i.e., juvenile chitons, small snails, amphipods, and juvenile limpets) from experimental areas in an ecosystem characterized by the overexploitation of keystone macrograzers and predators. The results of multivariate analyses suggest that mesograzers had significant effects on intertidal community structure through negative and positive effects on species abundances. Mesograzers had negative effects on filamentous algae, but positive effects on opportunistic foliose algae and barnacles. Probably, mesograzers indirectly favored the colonization of barnacles and foliose algae by removing preemptive competitors, as previously shown for other meso- and macrograzer species. These results strongly support the idea that small herbivores exert a firm controlling effect on the assembly process of natural communities. Therefore, changes in functional roles of top-down controllers might have significant implications for the structure of intertidal communities.","[Tejada-Martinez, Daniela; Lopez, Daniela N.] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Ciencias Menc Ecol & Evoluc, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Tejada-Martinez, Daniela; Lopez, Daniela N.; Sepulveda, Roger D.] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Bonta, Cesar C.; Valdivia, Nelson] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Sepulveda, Roger D.] Univ Simon Bolivar, South Amer Res Grp Coastal Ecosyst SARCE, Caracas, Venezuela; [Valdivia, Nelson] Ctr FONDAP Invest Dinam Ecosistemas Marinos Altas, Valdivia, Chile","Valdivia, N (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile.",nelson.valdivia@uach.cl,"Valdivia, Nelson/C-3613-2009","Valdivia, Nelson/0000-0002-5394-2072; Sepulveda, Roger D./0000-0003-0226-5662; Tejada Martinez, Daniela/0000-0001-9531-5280","Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [FONDECYT 1141037]; Programa de Mejoramiento de la Calidad y la Equidad de la Educacion Superior [0805]; Direccion de Investigacion, Universidad Austral de Chile [S-2013-2]","Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, (Grant / Award Number: 'FONDECYT 1141037') Programa de Mejoramiento de la Calidad y la Equidad de la Educacion Superior, (Grant / Award Number: '0805') Direccion de Investigacion, Universidad Austral de Chile, (Grant / Award Number: 'S-2013-2').",,68,9,9,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, the impact of vertebrate predators, particularly waterfowl, has been only infrequently determined in long-term intertidal studies. Using predator exclusion cages and simulated abiotic disturbance, I studied the direct and indirect effects of predation by Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) on an intertidal mussel bed community in Passa-maquoddy Bay, New Brunswick, Canada. Eiders fed heavily on blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), the dominant invertebrate present, reducing their abundance in +duck (exposed to predation) relative to -duck (exclosure) plots by nearly 50% within eight months of initiation of the experiment. Based on counts and estimated consumption rates, eiders appeared to be responsible for most predation observed in this system. Although ducks fed heavily on the dominant intertidal invertebrate, they had little effect on species diversity or richness in the community. However, relative abundance of the most common invertebrates did vary. In particular, exclusion of eiders led to an increase in abundance of dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus) one year into the experiment. Whelks, in turn, fed heavily on mussels under cages and obscured the longer-term effect of ducks in the system. This indirect effect appears to be an example of asymmetric exploitation competition, with ducks influencing the food supply of whelks, but whelks having little effect on ducks. When ducks were excluded, whelks were released from this competition and acted as compensating predators. No other indirect effects developed following duck exclusion, presumably due to the increased whelk effect. Disturbance, in contrast, did lead to an increase in species diversity, which later returned to predisturbance levels as the community recovered. Predation delayed the recovery of disturbed sites, because ducks began feeding in these plots before mussel abundance had completely rebounded. Disturbance, while initially deterring predation somewhat, ultimately allowed the effects of predators to persist longer. This interaction of predation and disturbance resulted from compensatory growth of mussels under exclosures in disturbed sites. Mussels protected from eider predation grew quickly after disturbance and rapidly became larger than the preferred prey for whelks. As a consequence, whelks did not feed as heavily on mussels in disturbed sites as in undisturbed sites, where more mussels were of the preferred size, and the observed effect of ducks on mussel biomass persisted. This experiment demonstrates that eiders were significant, and, probably, keystone predators in this system. Eiders directly reduced abundance of mussels, thereby indirectly increasing whelk density in plots where ducks were excluded. Compensatory predation by whelks following duck exclusion blocked other potential indirect effects, thus preventing eiders from having more widespread effects in the system. Such compensatory predation may act to stabilize communities and evidently can occur in relatively simple systems as well as the more species-rich communities with which it is usually associated.","Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Hamilton, DJ (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, Atlantic Cooperat Wildlife Ecol Res Network, PO Bag Serv 45111, Fredericton, NB E3B 6E1, Canada.",dhamilt2@unbsj.ca,,,,,,102,58,59,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Variation in the mechanisms generating this relationship can alter the slope and variance of the curve, with implications for the optimal management of biodiversity for ecosystem services. In biological control, prevalence of selection effects supports augmentation of the most effective natural enemy, but complementarity effects support augmentation of natural enemy diversity. Optimization of biological control strategies from the results of diversity-function studies is limited because few consider changes in function with relative or absolute changes in abundance, and many confound the relative importance of richness and density through experimental designs ( additive and substitutive). By manipulating species richness across an abundance gradient we show that effects of species richness are density dependent and indicate how this may be incorporated into experimental designs or models predicting resource consumption in diverse communities. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms causing an observed diversity-function response, and its associated variation, changed across the richness-abundance gradient. Finally, species-rich assemblages provided higher levels of minimum function than species-poor assemblages, without any compromise on the maximum function possible.","[Griffiths, Georgianne J.

We conducted three experiments: two involving 6 reefs each, lasting 2 and 5 yr, and one involving 40 reefs, lasting 1 yr. Each experiment included replicate reefs in various combinations of five structural treatments: holeless controls, 12 and 24 small holes, and 12 and 24 large holes. Tagging studies indicated that the reefs were sufficiently isolated from each other to comprise statistically independent replicates, and that resident piscivores occupied home reefs. We observed 97 species on or near the reefs, representing all major foraging guilds, and each holed reef supported hundreds of individuals. We examined four categories of fish: (1) large reef associates (too large for the small holes; most of these fish were both predators on smaller fish and prey for larger transient piscivores), (2) moray eels (piscivores that could fit into the small holes), (3) small reef associates (potential prey that could fit into the small holes), and (4) juvenile grunts (potential prey that sporadically were extremely abundant). We tested five a priori predictions of the general hypothesis that predation is an important process structuring reef-fish assemblages. The first two predictions dealt with the role of prey refuges. First, if reef holes function as prey refuges, then prey fish should be most abundant on reefs providing holes near their body diameters, because such holes would make the prey fish safest from predation. Seven of eight experimental comparisons supported this prediction, and five of them were statistically significant. Second, if refuge availability limits prey abundance, then prey fish should be more abundant on reefs with 12 holes than those with no holes, and should be more abundant on reefs with 24 holes than those with 12 holes. The first part of this prediction was verified by all nine experimental comparisons, seven of which were statistically significant. However, there were no strong differences between 12-hole and 24-hole reefs. Thus, between 0 and 12 holes per reef, holes limited local prey populations; between 12 and 24 holes per reef, the number of holes was not limiting. Several lines of evidence suggested that the latter pattern was due to temporary saturation of the study area with refuges when we added 40 reefs to 12 existing reefs. The remaining three predictions dealt directly with the community-level role of predation. First, predators should affect local prey abundance either chronically, in which case a negative relationship among reefs is predicted between the average abundances of predators and prey, or sporadically, in which case a negative relationship is predicted between the abundance of predators and the maximum number of co-occurring prey ever observed at each predator abundance. The former prediction was falsified, whereas the latter was verified. Observations of extreme type III survivorship of recruit cohorts on reefs with many piscivores and occasional direct observations of piscivory bolstered the conclusion that this relationship was causal. Finally, we predicted that predators should affect the number of prey species on a reef. We observed a significant negative relationship among reefs between predator abundance and maximum prey-species richness. Comparing species' relative abundances on reefs at the extremes of this regression, piscivores appear to have nonselectively reduced and extirpated both common and rare prey species, although this relationship remains purely correlative. In our model system, high local species diversity appears to have been maintained","OREGON STATE UNIV, COLL OCEANOG, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA; DIV FISH & WILDLIFE, ST THOMAS, VI 00802 USA; UNIV VIRGIN ISL, DIV SCI & MATH, MARINE SCI PROGRAM, ST THOMAS, VI 00802 USA","HIXON, MA (corresponding author), OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,83,575,587,3,204,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Synthesiomyia nudiseta is a species that has recently been recorded on human corpses in Europe, and it has been cited in forensic cases in Spain and Italy. The mature larvae are known to be facultative predators on necrophagous fly larvae, but their role as predators is unknown. The aim of this paper is to investigate the predatory behavior of S. nudiseta on the most abundant blowfly larvae in sarcosaprophagous communities in southwestern Europe (i.e., Chrysomya albiceps, Lucilia sericata, and Calliphora vicina). Intraspecific and interspecific competition experiments were carried out to study the effect of this species in the necrophagous diptera community. First-instar larvae were placed in plastic cups with the same amount of pig liver (15g) at different densities (50, 100, 150, and 300 individuals/cup). Mortality in blowflies increased when S. nudiseta larvae were present: up to 98.40% in Ch. albiceps, 89.60% in L. sericata, and 84.93% in C. vicina. Pre-imaginal developmental time and adult wing size were analyzed and compared under each of the intraspecific and interspecific conditions; both variables were affected by competition in all cases. The implications of the presence of S. nudiseta for sarcosaprophagous community dynamics and its effect on the estimation of postmortem interval (PMI) are discussed.","[Ivorra, Tania; Martinez-Sanchez, Anabel; Rojo, Santos] Univ Alicante, Dept Environm Sci & Nat Resources, E-03080 Alicante, Spain","Ivorra, T (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Environm Sci & Nat Resources, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",tania.ivorra@gmail.com,"Rojo, Santos/L-9717-2014; Martinez-Sanchez, Anabel/H-1376-2014","Rojo, Santos/0000-0003-2160-9643; Ivorra, Tania/0000-0002-4656-6347; Martinez-Sanchez, Anabel/0000-0003-1497-8571",Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat ValencianaEuropean Commission [GV/2011/039]; University of Alicante [GRE09-27],"This work belongs to Tania Ivorra PhD and was partially supported by the projects GV/2011/039 (Generalitat Valenciana) and GRE09-27 (University of Alicante).

Both types of animals are assumed to respond similarly to experimental treatments. The goal of this study was to test if this assumption is true, if field-collected and lab-reared animals respond similarly to experimental treatments. In the first experiments, we test how diet (high lipid or protein) affected mating behaviors of male jumping spiders, Phidippus audax. Male spiders had opposite responses to diet based on their rearing condition in both scramble competition and male-male interaction trials. Field-collected spiders fed with high-protein diets and lab-reared spiders fed with high-lipid diets found mates quicker and were more aggressive than their counter parts fed with different diets. Field-collected spiders were also more active in open arenas and courted females more actively than lab-reared spiders. In a second experiment, we tested spiders for preference of flower color, and found that both lab-reared and field-collected spiders selected flowers with color over white flowers. However, field-collected spiders prefer red flowers with UV fluorescence, while lab-reared spiders seem to prefer red without UV. These results suggest that lab-reared and field-collected animals can respond differently to the same experimental treatments. Further work is needed to test if this happens in other animals, and which types of individuals (lab-reared or field collect) best reflect the responses of animals in nature. Significance statement Laboratory studies are commonly used to study animal behavior. Animals used in these studies can be either raised in the laboratory or collected from the field just prior to the study. While lab-reared and field-collected animals can differ sometimes in their behavior (e.g., more or less active in response to a treatment), they are both assumed to respond in qualitatively the same manner. However, this does not appear to be the case in our study of a common species of jumping spider, Phidippus audax. Labreared and field-collected animals responded in opposite directions to identical treatment conditions. These results suggest that the developmental histories of animals can fundamentally affect how they respond to experimental treatments in the laboratory and, hence, the conclusions drawn from such studies.","[Wiggins, Will D.; Bounds, Sarah; Wilder, Shawn M.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Wiggins, WD (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",will.wiggins@okstate.edu,,,Oklahoma State University,Funding was provided by Oklahoma State University.,,34,9,9,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

To investigate the indirect effects of this key ecosystem engineer on coral mortality and growth, we transplanted caged and exposed fragments of four coral species to patch reefs in French Polynesia on which we manipulated the presence of S. nigricans and turf, and to reefs naturally devoid of S. nigricans. Reef access was two to four times higher for herbivorous fishes, and two times higher for corallivorous fishes, when S. nigricans was removed, indicating that reef access is reduced for two important guilds of fishes when S. nigricans is present. Stegastes' territoriality indirectly benefited delicate acroporids (Montipora floweri and Acropora striata), yielding a twofold to fivefold reduction in skeletal loss due to lower predation frequencies in the presence of S. nigricans. Three corals, A. striata, M. floweri, and especially Porites australiensis, suffered mortality due to overgrowth significantly more frequently in the presence of farmed turf, but Pocillopora verrucosa did not. Algal abundance predicted the frequency of overgrowth for only A. striata and P. australiensis. M. floweri were more likely to be overgrown when exposed (uncaged) in the presence of S. nigricans, suggesting an interaction modification, in this case that initial predation increased susceptibility to competition with turf. In this community, the presence of S. nigricans may increase algal overgrowth of massive Porites by facilitating its turf competitors and simultaneously reduce predation of branching corals through territorial exclusion of corallivores. These indirect interactions may underlie previously documented community transitions from disturbance-resistant massive coral to recovering branching corals within S. nigricans territories.","[White, Jada-Simone S.; O'Donnell, James L.] Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [White, Jada-Simone S.] Calif State Univ Chico, Inst Sustainable Dev, Chico, CA 95926 USA; [O'Donnell, James L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","White, JSS (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Box 118525, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jswhite@csuchico.edu,,,UF Alumni Fellowship; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; Gump Station Pearl Internship; AMNH; ASIH,"Mauruuru roa (large thanks) to N.

Recent theory predicts that both competition and predation (which causes apparent competition among prey) can either promote or limit species coexistence. Both mechanisms cause negative interactions between individuals, and each mechanism promotes stable coexistence if it causes negative interactions to be stronger between conspecifics than between heterospecifics. However, the relative importance of competition and predation for coexistence in natural communities is poorly known. Here, we study how competition and apparent competition via pre-dispersal seed predators affect the long-term fecundity of Protea shrubs in the fire-prone Fynbos biome (South Africa). These shrubs store all viable seeds produced since the last fire in fire-proof cones. Competitive effects on cone number and pre-dispersal seed predation reduce their fecundity and can thus limit recruitment after the next fire. In 27 communities comprising 49 990 shrubs of 22 Protea species, we measured cone number and per-cone seed predation rate of 2154 and 1755 focal individuals, respectively. Neighbourhood analyses related these measures to individual-based community maps. We found that conspecific neighbours had stronger competitive effects on cone number than heterospecific neighbours. In contrast, apparent competition via seed predators was comparable between conspecifics and heterospecifics. This indicates that competition stabilizes coexistence of Protea species, whereas pre-dispersal seed predation does not. Larger neighbours had stronger competitive effects and neighbours with large seed crops exerted stronger apparent competition. For 97% of the focal plants, competition reduced fecundity more than apparent competition. Our results show that even in communities of closely related and ecologically similar species, intraspecific competition can be stronger than interspecific competition. On the other hand, apparent competition through seed predators need not have such a stabilizing effect. These findings illustrate the potential of community demography', the demographic study of multiple interacting species, for understanding plant coexistence.","[Nottebrock, Henning; Treurnicht, Martina; Pagel, Joern; Schurr, Frank M.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, August von Hartmann Str 3, DE-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Nottebrock, Henning; Schurr, Frank M.] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, UMR 5554, Montpellier, France; [Schmid, Baptiste; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Schleuning, Matthias] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmid, Baptiste; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Schleuning, Matthias] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Frankfurt, Germany; [Boehning-Gaese, Katrin] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Ecol Evolut & Divers, Frankfurt, Germany; [Nottebrock, Henning; Schmid, Baptiste; Treurnicht, Martina; Esler, Karen J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Biol & Entomol, Matieland, South Africa; [Nottebrock, Henning; Schmid, Baptiste; Treurnicht, Martina; Esler, Karen J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, Matieland, South Africa","Nottebrock, H (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, August von Hartmann Str 3, DE-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",henning@nottebrock.net,"Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015; Schurr, Frank M./O-6575-2016; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019","Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X; Schurr, Frank M./0000-0002-4518-0602; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/0000-0003-0477-5586; Pagel, Jorn/0000-0002-4817-1920; Schmid, Baptiste/0000-0002-7736-7527","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHU2259/3-1, SCHL 1934/1-1]","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation [grant no.

The vehicle of analysis was the construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or interaction chains, since little information was available on other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response, environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong) interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web species richness. Less expected, when these measures were adjusted to a per species basis, positive relationships with species richness were still observed for all measures but the number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity, each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect, including the seven previously identified types. Many of the 76 additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if the original definitions of these ''classic'' types were expanded to include interactions having similar effects but differing in the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference competition and inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect, termed ''apparent predation'' and ''indirect defense'' were also identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these, keystone predation (35%) and apparent competition (25%) were most common and exploitation competition (2.8%) was least common in these webs. Two methods of analysis suggested that indirect effects accounted for approximate to 40% of the change in community structure resulting from manipulations, with a range of 24-61%. The proportion of change due to indirect effects was constant with web species richness, indicating that strong direct interactions and indirect effects produce roughly the same level of alteration of community structure regardless of the lever of web complexity. Several potential artifacts and biases were evaluated. Most importantly, neither variation in level of taxonomic resolution nor intensity of experimentation varied significantly with web size (species richness). Despite a bias toward manipulation of consumers over manipulation of basal species, some predator-initiated indirect effect types were scarce while some basal species-initiated types were common. While the frequency of exploitation competition may have been underestimated, it is unlikely that the frequency of this indirect effect would change dramatically: changes due to this effect should have been detected in many of the studies and reported: and the most intensively studied individual webs did not report frequencies differing much from the average. This analysis suggests investigators effectively identified and first manipulated those species responsible for most indirect effects and that more experiments added decreasing numbers of indirect effects. Moreover, the frequencies and importance of indirect effects may be more predictable than expected on the basis of theory.",,"MENGE, BA (corresponding author), OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA.",,"Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012",,,,,146,576,595,2,279,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

In a set of experimental ponds, bullfrogs were most abundant in ponds containing fish (bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus) and were rare in permanent ponds that lacked fish. In contrast, green frogs were most abundant in ponds that had been drained the previous fall, second most abundant in those that lacked fish, and sparse in ponds containing bluegill. When presence and absence of bluegill were experimentally manipulated in divided ponds, bullfrogs survived well in the presence of bluegill, whereas no individuals survived in the absence of bluegill. Green frogs survived in low numbers under both treatments with a tendency to better survivorship in the absence of bluegill. A series of laboratory choice experiments was conducted with three major predator types: the dragonfly larva Anax junius, the salamander Ambystoma tigrinum, and L. macrochirus. Bullfrog larvae were more vulnerable to Anax and Ambystoma than were green frogs (because of higher activity levels), and green frogs were more vulnerable to bluegill than were bullfrogs (because tadpoles were less noxious). We argue that the high densities of bullfrogs found in the presence of bluegill reflect an indirect facilitation through two pathways: bluegill had strong negative effects on invertebrate and salamander predators of bullfrogs and on the green frog, which is a bullfrog competitor. The direct and indirect effects of these suites of predators appear to explain the differences in species abundances along the environmental gradient. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs at the individual level contributing to these differences in species performance along the gradient.","DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA","WERNER, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT BIOL, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

We measured grasshopper densities and vegetation on 32 464-m2 grassland plots for 1 yr, then enclosed 16 of these plots with bird exclosures and continued data collection for 3 yr. Eight of the 16 experimental plots were further modified in the last 2 yr of the study by installing fine-mesh 1 m high barriers designed to retard grasshopper dispersal. Microclimates of caged plots differed only slightly from open plots. Lizards and rodents increased inside the exclosures, but they were removed and released elsewhere such that their average abundances did not differ among treatments. By the final year of the study, mean annual adult grasshopper density was > 2.2 times higher on plots from which birds were excluded, and where grasshoppers were enclosed by dispersal barriers, than on unmanipulated control plots. Mean nymph density was > 3.0 times higher in the same comparison. Grasshoppers were significantly more abundant in bird exclosures with insect dispersal barriers, indicating that experimental plots were dispersal sources rather than sinks. Seven of 12 common grasshopper species were more abundant inside the bird exclosures, while none was less abundant. Among the more abundant taxa, those responding most positively were grass feeders: Eritettix simplex, Opeia obscura, Paropomala wyomingensis, and Phoetaliotes nebrascensis. We found no evidence that grasshoppers competed with one another under increased densities inside the bird exclosures. Although the amount of insect herbivory was somewhat higher inside the bird exclosures, and was positively correlated with grasshopper density across all 32 plots (r = 0.87), overall vegetation cover and species composition did not differ among treatments by the end of the study. Dactylotum variegatum, an aposematic species apparently immune to avian predation, showed no significant responses to the experiment. Birds clearly limited grasshoppers in this grassland ecosystem, but they failed to qualify as keystone predators, at least in the short term, for two reasons: (1) in their absence, increased grasshopper densities had no appreciable impact on vegetation cover or species composition; and (2) there was no evidence that birds mediated competition among grass hoppers.",,"BOCK, CE (corresponding author), UNIV COLORADO, DEPT ENVIRONM POPULAT & ORGANISM BIOL, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,58,89,99,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1992,73,5,,,,,1706,1717,,10.2307/1940022,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP740,WOS:A1992JP74000019,,,,,2021-09-27,

The experiment examined the effects loaches and fingernail clams have on algae biomass. Fingernail clams reduced microalgae biomass by filter feeding, while loaches increased it by feeding on water fleas. Loach predation on water fleas increased the biomass of microalgae indirectly, which might have led to an increased density of fingernail clams. Filter feeding on microalgae by fingernail clams increased the density of filamentous algae, a potential competitor of microalgae, suggesting that fingernail clams increase the density of chironomids by enhancing their diet, which may then increase the density of the loaches that prey on chironomids. Field research revealed a positive spatial association between loaches and fingernail clams, attributable to their mutual food resource facilitation.","[Takayanagi, Haruki; Yasuda, Hironori] Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, 1-23 Wakaba Machi, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan; [Takayanagi, Haruki; Nishida, Takayoshi] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, 2500 Hassaka Cho, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan","Takayanagi, H (corresponding author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, 1-23 Wakaba Machi, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan.; Takayanagi, H (corresponding author), Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, 2500 Hassaka Cho, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan.",zn56htakayanagi@ec.usp.ac.jp,,"Takayanagi, Haruki/0000-0003-3204-0640",,,,36,0,0,2,4,JAPAN SOC APPL ENTOMOL ZOOL,TOKYO,"1-43-11 KOMAGOME TOSHIMA-KU, TOKYO, 170, JAPAN",0021-4914,1347-6068,,JPN J APPL ENTOMOL Z,Jpn.

Recognition of risks associated with host shifting has increased the emphasis on host specificity of biocontrol agents for invasive weeds. However, recent studies indicate host-specific biocontrol agents can also exhibit substantial nontarget effects through indirect interactions and food-web subsidies. Based on an evaluation of these studies, we conclude that the interaction strength between biocontrol agents and their hosts is at least as important as host specificity for determining the outcome of biocontrol introductions. Host-specific biocontrol agents that establish, but fail to reduce the densities of their hosts can facilitate bottom-up effects that link the target weed to other native organisms through food webs, thereby expanding the impacts of the invasive weed. We believe that indirect nontarget effects of host-specific biocontrol agents arising from food-web subsidies could prove more deleterious to native species than are the direct nontarget effects currently recognized from host shifting.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Pearson, DE (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Box 8089, Missoula, MT 59807 USA.",dpearson@fs.fed.us,,,,,,67,157,168,3,80,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,1872-8383,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

Within a habitat, a gerbil must be able to harvest seeds and escape predators. To test fur the habitat-specific processes governing habitat partitioning by gerbil species, we investigated the roles of escape substrate and foraging substrate in affecting patch use. In an aviary, we manipulated predatory risk using artificial illumination and the presence of Barn Owls (Tyto alba). We manipulated escape substrate and foraging substrate by creating habitat and food patches of sand, rock (a mix of sand and small rocks), and loess substrate. In response to owls, all three gerbil species foraged less and increased their giving-up densities (GUDs) in food patches. In response to foraging substrate, all three species had their lowest GUDs on sand, and their highest GUDs on loess. Gerbillus dasyurus responded less intensively to owls when loess comprised the foraging substrate. Also, each species depended more on its home foraging substrate than did the others for the total amount of seeds harvested. Gerbillus pyramidum in particular harvested a greater proportion from sand than did G. dasyurus. Escape substrate had no direct effects on patch use. However, G. dasyurus exhibited a foraging substrate x escape substrate interaction, as the rocky escape substrate enhanced its use of the rocky foraging substrate. Our experiments show that foraging substrate contributes to habitat use by G. allenbyi and G. pyramidum, and that both foraging substrate and escape substrate contribute to habitat use by G. dasyurus.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci MC 066, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Evolut Systemat & Ecol, Jerusalem, Israel","Kotler, BP (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",kotler@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,48,45,45,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2001,82,6,,,,,1781,1790,,10.2307/2679818,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,446PG,WOS:000169521200023,,,,,2021-09-27,

Birds across terrestrial habitats form mixed-species flocks, where dozens of resident and migratory species forage together throughout the day. The effect of flock participation and group size on the foraging behavior of migratory and resident species is poorly known, particularly in the tropics. Using foraging observations, we examined the effects of flock participation on the foraging ecology of four species of Neotropical migrants and three resident species in shade-grown coffee plantations in the Colombian Andes in 2011. We showed that resident and migrant birds in mixed-species flocks largely increased the number of foraging attempts, expanded their foraging repertoire, and exhibited greater overlap in use of foraging maneuvers compared with solitary individuals. We found an effect of group size on foraging rate, with feeding attempts increasing monotonically or showing a hump-shaped pattern, and also found that movement rates increased with increasing flock diversity. These results support the idea that flock participation enhances foraging success and reduces perceived predation risk, but also show niche convergence among flocking species, along with higher movement rates and more agonistic interactions as group size increases. Finally, our results provide insight into the importance of mixed-species flocks for birds of conservation concern, including Cerulean Warblers (Setophaga cerulea), a Neotropical migrant shown to be highly restricted to foraging in flocks in their wintering areas.","[Jenny, Munoz Z.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Jenny, Munoz Z.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Gabriel, Colorado Z.

While it is recognized that evolution will play a role in determining how environmental changes directly affect species, the interactions among species force us to consider the coevolutionary responses of species to environmental changes. Methodology/Principle Findings: We use simple models of competition, predation, and mutualism to organize and synthesize the ways coevolution modifies species interactions when climatic changes favor one species over another. In cases where species have conflicting interests (i.e., selection for increased interspecific interaction strength on one species is detrimental to the other), we show that coevolution reduces the effects of climate change, leading to smaller changes in abundances and reduced chances of extinction. Conversely, when species have nonconflicting interests (i.e., selection for increased interspecific interaction strength on one species benefits the other), coevolution increases the effects of climate change. Conclusions/Significance: Coevolution sets up feedback loops that either dampen or amplify the effect of environmental change on species abundances depending on whether coevolution has conflicting or nonconflicting effects on species interactions. Thus, gaining a better understanding of the coevolutionary processes between interacting species is critical for understanding how communities respond to a changing climate. We suggest experimental methods to determine which types of coevolution (conflicting or nonconflicting) drive species interactions, which should lead to better understanding of the effects of coevolution on species adaptation. Conducting these experiments across environmental gradients will test our predictions of the effects of environmental change and coevolution on ecological communities.","[Northfield, Tobin D.; Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Northfield, TD (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Ctr Trop Biodivers & Climate Change, Cairns, Qld, Australia.",tobin.northfield@jcu.edu.au,"Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X",USDA Postdoctoral fellowship [WISW-2010-05109],"TDN was supported by a USDA Postdoctoral fellowship (#WISW-2010-05109).

The purpose of this study was to examine this phenomenon. We tested the effects of an abiotic factor (pH) and two biotic factors (intraspecific and interspecific competition) on survival and growth to metamorphosis by larvae of two anurans (Hyla gratiosa and Hyla femoralis) in outdoor tanks. Two levels of pH (4.5 and 6.0) and three levels of density (0, 30, or 60 embryos per 580 L tank) of each species were arranged in a fractional factorial design and replicated three times. Larvae of H. gratiosa exhibited typical patterns of intraspecific density-dependent responses: as density increased, survival and size at metamorphosis decreased and larval period increased. The interactions of the abiotic factor and the biotic factors were complex in this experiment. The addition of H. femoralis at high pH caused decreased survival and increased larval period of H. gratiosa, but at low pH these negative effects were not detected. Variation in pH had no effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa. Interspecific competition from H. femoralis caused decreased size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa only at the high initial densities. Some of the responses of H. femoralis were different than those of H. gratiosa. In this species, intraspecific competition affected only the size at metamorphosis. Low pH increased the survival of H. femoralis, but had no effect by itself on any other trait. Increased conspecific density and pH interacted only in their effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. femoralis. Interspecific competition resulted in decreased size at metamorphosis but only increased larval period at the high initial densities. Interspecific competition at the high density interacted with pH to increase survival and size at metamorphosis at low pH in contrast to those results at high pH. Overall, the larval period was the response most strongly affected in H. gratiosa while for H. femoralis the size at metamorphosis was the most strongly affected. Hyla gratiosa had more negative impact on H. femoralis than vice versa. This may be due to the larger body size of H. gratiosa. Low pH enabled H. femoralis to compete more effectively, because the negative impact of H. gratiosa was lessened. Even in a relatively simple simulation, complex interactions occurred between biotic and abiotic factors. This finding demonstrates the importance of multi-factor analysis in furthering our understanding of the structure of assemblages.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA","WARNER, SC (corresponding author), PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, 208 MUELLER LAB, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,58,70,72,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,183,194,,10.2307/1939513,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500019,,,,,2021-09-27,

The extent of directional environmental change expected in the next century underscores the need to understand density-dependent population regulation. 2. Direct density dependence generated by intraspecific competition and/or predator-prey interactions should buffer environmentally produced changes in density-independent growth rates (r), Density dependence generated by interspecific competition should magnify sensitivity to changes in r. 3, We tested these predictions by assembling protist communities in laboratory microcosms and subjecting the communities to directional environmental change. Two experiments used pairs of competing protists (Colpidium striatum Stein and Tetrahymena thermophila Nanney & McCoy, and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn and Blepharisma americanum Suzuki) along with single-species controls, Two experiments used predator-prey pairs (Didinium nasutum Muller or Euplotes patella Ehrenberg preying on Colpidium) and controls containing only prey. We grew replicates of each species combination in two temperature regimes (constant or slowly increasing temperature). Independent of these experiments, we quantified the temperature dependence of r (intrinsic rate of increase) for each species. 4, Comparison of effects of temperature on r to effects on mean density revealed that intraspecific competition buffered species densities against temperature changes that increased r by over 200%, Interspecific interactions did not affect species responses to environmental change. Temperature change had weak effects on species densities, whether or not other species were present. 5, The results suggest that natural populations, regulated by direct density dependence, may be buffered against directional environmental change. Environmental change will have large effects when populations experience little density dependence, and when environmental change has different effects on the vital rates of different species.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Fox, JW (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",,,,,,,61,38,38,1,99,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Intraguild interactions between predators have significant implications for how multiple predators impact on their prey. Carabid assemblages are not generally thought to be structured by interspecific competitive interactions, species relative abundances instead being determined mainly by abiotic factors. However, several field studies report negative associations between the abundance of certain carabid species and the presence of wood ants. 2. Replicated laboratory experiments were used to monitor the behaviour of individual female Abax parallelepipedus (Piller & Mitterpacher) in the presence of a range of wood ant (Formica rufa L.) densities (including ant-free controls) over 23 h. Carabids did not feed when wood ants were present. Running and defence activities were high at low ant densities but decreased with increasing ant density. At the highest ant density, all carabids were killed within the first 2 h of the experiment, but the ants did not consume the carabids after they had killed them. Carabid diurnal activity increased at the higher wood ant densities. 3. Female A. parallelepipedus and Pterostichus madidus (F.) maintained individually in the presence of five wood ants had significantly lower mean body weights and carried fewer eggs after 21 days compared to control beetles that had been kept without ants. 4. The results help to explain the reduced abundance of these two carabid species under field conditions when wood ants are present. We interpret these findings to mean that the interaction between wood ants and carabids is one of asymmetric aggressive interference competition rather than predation.","[Hawes, Cathy; Evans, Hugh F.] Alice Holt Lodge, Forest Res, Surrey, England; [Hawes, Cathy] James Hutton Inst, Dundee, Scotland; [Evans, Hugh F.] Rhodfa Padarn, Forest Res, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Stewart, Alan J.

To predict the chaotic behavior in an ecological system and its possible control mechanism is interesting. Aziz-Alaoui [1] considered a tri-trophic food-chain model with modified Leslie-Gower type growth rate for top-predator population and established the chaotic dynamics exhibited by the model system for a certain choice of parameter values. We have modified the said model by incorporating density dependent death rate for predator population. Our mathematical findings reveal the fact that there are two coexisting equilibrium points one of which is a source and the other one is a sink. The positive equilibrium point which is sink is actually globally asymptotically stable under certain parametric conditions. Numerical experiment analysis shows that the model system are capable to produce chaotic dynamics when the rate of intra specific completion is very low and chaotic dynamics disappears for a certain value of the rate of intra specific completion for predator species. Our results suggest that the consideration of density dependent death rate for predator species have the ability to control the chaotic dynamics.,"[Bandyopadhyay, M.] Scottish Church Coll, Dept Math, Kolkata 700006, India; [Chatterjee, S.] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Matemat, I-10123 Turin, Italy; [Chakraborty, S.; Chattopadhyay, J.] Indian Stat Inst, Agr & Ecol Res Unit, Kolkata 700108, India","Bandyopadhyay, M (corresponding author), Scottish Church Coll, Dept Math, Kolkata 700006, India.",joydev@isical.ac.in,,,"Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Human Resource Development Group, New DelhiCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India","The research work is supported by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Human Resource Development Group, New Delhi.",,25,5,5,0,1,INST MATHEMATICS & INFORMATICS,VILNIUS,"AKADEMIJOS STR 4, VILNIUS LT-08663, LITHUANIA",1392-5113,,,NONLINEAR ANAL-MODEL,Nonlinear Anal.-Model Control,AUG 28,2008,13,3,,,,,305,324,,10.15388/NA.2008.13.3.14559,,,20,"Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mechanics",Mathematics; Mechanics,V15KP,WOS:000207801200003,,hybrid,,,2021-09-27,

With increasing abundance, the proportion of a particular species in the total aphid population may remain constant, suggesting a density-independent exponential growth, or the proportion can change, suggesting density-dependent constraints on growth. The constraints that affect particular species, and thus their relative abundance, were studied. The proportionality between maximum abundances of the cereal aphids was studied using a 10-year census of the numbers of aphids infesting 268 winter wheat plots. For two species their abundance on leaves and ears was compared. With increasing aphid density the maximum abundance of Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus) remained proportional, but not that of Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), which was constrained by the smaller surface area of ears compared to leaves. There was no evidence of inter-specific competition. Maximum abundance of R. padi and Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) on leaves did not change proportionally as the proportion of M. dirhodum decreased with increasing overall aphid density. This decrease was probably caused by the restricted distribution of M. dirhodum, which is confined to leaves, where space is limiting. No change in proportion between populations was detected when the average densities were below 0.54 aphids per leaf or ear. Non-proportional relationships between aphid populations appeared to be due to spatial constraints, acting upon the more abundant population. Detecting the limitation of population growth can help with the assessment of when density-independent exponential growth is limited by density-dependent factors. This information may help in the development of models of cereal aphid population dynamics.","Res Inst Crop Prod, Prague 16106 6, Czech Republic; Charles Univ, Dept Zool, CR-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Honek, A (corresponding author), Res Inst Crop Prod, Drnovska 507, Prague 16106 6, Czech Republic.",honek@vurv.cz,,,,,,41,13,13,1,19,CABI PUBLISHING,WALLINGFORD,"C/O PUBLISHING DIVISION, NOSWORTHY WAY, WALLINGFORD OX10 8DE, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4853,,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

However, predation also alters prey mortality regimes, where low predation risk often results in higher prey densities and consequently higher intensities of intraspecific resource competition. In addition, predation risk alters the foraging context, as acquiring food can be risky in the presence of predators. Thus, different predation regimes can drive divergent selection on traits associated with resource competition, such as foraging behaviours. Moreover, because sexes often differ in susceptibility to predation and limitations to their reproductive output, the intensity of the tradeoff between predator avoidance and resource competition may depend on sex. We used a laboratory experiment to assess key aspects of foraging performance in a predator-free context in Bahamas mosquitofish Gambusia hubbsi wild-caught from multiple populations that experience either high or low levels of predation risk. When competing for limited food resources at a common density, females from low-predation regimes showed higher foraging and food consumption rates than females from high-predation regimes. Males showed fewer differences between predation regimes, and an opposite pattern from females. We suggest these sex-specific effects result from females facing a greater tradeoff between predation risk and resource competition, combined with males from high-predation environments elevating foraging behaviours in the absence of nearby predators and females. Females of this species are larger than males, bear live young and show higher foraging rates in the wild than males. On the other hand, males spend more time pursuing females in the wild, and may exhibit greater flexibility in foraging behaviours based on the immediate context. Our results show that varying levels of predation risk can lead to differences in behaviours associated with resource competition, but these effects can strongly differ between sexes.","[Parssinen, Varpu; Hulthen, Kaj; Bronmark, Christer; Bjorneras, Caroline; Ekelund Ugge, Gustaf; Gollnisch, Raphael; Hansson, Lars-Anders; Herzog, Simon David; Hu, Nan; Johansson, Emma; Lee, Marcus; Rengefors, Karin; Sha, Yongcui; Skerlep, Martin; Vinterstare, Jerker; Zhang, Huan; Nilsson, P.

Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained(1-3). Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches(4-6); this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity(3,6-8). That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors(9). The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities(10,11). Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare-the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.","[Levine, Jonathan M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [HilleRisLambers, Janneke] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Levine, JM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",levine@lifesci.ucsb.edu; jhrl@u.washington.edu,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0743365, 0743183]; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation","This work was supported by US National Science Foundation grants 0743365 and 0743183, and a fellowship from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.

Support for spatial variation in stressors (often latitudinal gradients) has been found in many species, usually with physiological or correlative occupancy data, but it has rarely been estimated directly with demographic data. We collected demographic data from 23 sites spanning the majority of the Saltmarsh Sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus) breeding range. Using data from 837 nests, we quantified the abiotic and biotic variables most important to nest survival, which is the dominant driver of both fecundity and population growth rate in this species. We separately estimated daily nest failure probability due to nest depredation (biotic stressor) and nest flooding (abiotic stressor), which collectively account for almost all nest failure in the species. Nest depredation decreased with latitude, whereas nest flooding was not related to latitude. Instead, nest flooding was best predicted by a combination of maximum high tide, extremity of rare flooding events, and date. For a single vital rate, we observed predictable variation in competing biotic and abiotic stressors across this species range. We observed that biotic and abiotic stressors were geographically independent, both on a large spatial scale and locally. Our results suggest that stressors on the fecundity of Saltmarsh Sparrow vary systematically across its range, but independently. The observed patterns of biotic and abiotic stress provide information for efforts to conserve the Saltmarsh Sparrow, which is considered threatened. Further, understanding the effects that different stressors, and their interactions, have on demographic rates is necessary to unravel the processes that govern species distributions and to effectively conserve biodiversity in the face of global change.","[Ruskin, Katharine J.; Olsen, Brian J.] Univ Maine, Ecol & Environm Sci Program, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Ruskin, Katharine J.; Olsen, Brian J.] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Etterson, Matthew A.] US EPA, Midcontinent Ecol Div, Duluth, MN USA; [Hodgman, Thomas P.] Maine Dept Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, Bird Grp, Bangor, ME USA; [Borowske, Alyssa C.; Elphick, Chris S.; Field, Christopher R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Borowske, Alyssa C.; Elphick, Chris S.; Field, Christopher R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Conservat & Biodivers, Storrs, CT USA; [Cohen, Jonathan B.; Kocek, Alison R.] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Longenecker, Rebecca A.; Shriver, W.

Empirical methods that measure the per capita strengths of trophic species interactions offer a means to identify keystone species and bridge mathematical models and data to synthesize our knowledge of population dynamics and predator feeding behaviors. Many such methods have been proposed, but few have seen independent validation of their estimates or underlying assumptions. This is particularly so with respect to the nonlinear functional responses by which predators often respond to their prey. Here I describe an empirical test of a recently proposed observational method for estimating the nonlinear strength of predator-prey interactions in the field. By applying the method to two populations of a predatory intertidal whelk, Haustrum scobina, I estimated its per capita attack rates on all nine of its observed prey species. These spanned two orders of magnitude in per capita strength. Concurrent experimental manipulations of the two predator populations provided population time series for the response of a mussel prey species, Xenostrobus pulex. I obtained independent interaction strength estimates for this focal interaction by fitting a sequence of hypothesized predator-prey models to these time series. Overall, site-specific models assuming linear functional responses performed better than all others. A direct comparison of the attack-rate estimates from the observational method with those of the best-performing nonlinear model nevertheless revealed high concordance between the two methods. The results of this study therefore support the use of the observational method in larger and more complex food webs and suggest that trophic interactions in the range of mean prey densities observed in nature are approximately linear.","[Novak, Mark] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Novak, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Long Marine Lab, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 100 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",mnovak1@ucsc.edu,"Novak, Mark/E-2194-2012","Novak, Mark/0000-0002-7881-4253",NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0608178]; U.S. EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); University of ChicagoUniversity of Chicago,"I am grateful for the logistical support provided by Dave Schiel and the Marine Ecology Research Group at the University of Canterbury, and the staff at the Edward Percival Field Station.

The two most common species were Tatera leucogaster (bushveld gerbil) and Rhabdomys pumilo (striped mouse). The mechanisms examined were habitat selection in a mosaic, microhabitat selection, spatial variation in resource abundance, temporal variation in resource abundance, and diet partitioning. The rodents were censused using mark-recapture live trapping, activity measured using sand-tracking, and foraging efficiency measured using giving-up densities (GUDs; the amount of food remaining following patch exploitation) in experimental food patches. There was no support for any of the five mechanisms: T leucogaster tended to be a more efficient and mobile forager than R. pumilio. It is suggested that coexistence maybe based on a sixth mechanism, seasonal variation in resource abundance and a tradeoff of maintenance efficiency versus foraging efficiency. Further, it appears that R. pumilio is more efficient at maintaining harvest potential, not by maintaining high consumer biomass, but rather by having a high intrinsic rate of increase.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Beer Sheva, Israel","Perrin, MR (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",perrin@ukzn.ac.za,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,24,17,17,1,10,ZOOLOGICAL SOC SOUTHERN AFRICA,PRETORIA,"AFRICAN ZOOLOGY CIRCULATION OFFICE, PO BOX 11663,, PRETORIA 0028, SOUTH AFRICA",1562-7020,,,AFR ZOOL,Afr.

Since both species are mainly present along the coast the potential distribution of the species overlapped. Plant distribution was influenced by soil thermal regime (51%) and continentality index (22%), while insect distribution was determined by the continental index (39%) and the soil thermic regimen (38%). The population dynamics of P. mesembryanthemi was examined through a 2-year field study in four localities invaded by Carpobrotus taking into account climatic factors and biotic interactions. In the studied localities, this scale was bivoltine, reaching its highest densities in the warmer and drier months of summer and sharply decreasing in winter. Only in a specially sheltered locality (Mera) did the insect densities stay high throughout the year. Pulvinariella mesembryanthemi infestation increased necromass proportion of its host plant. However, Chalcidoidea parasites and Coccinellidae predators limited P. mesembryanthemi density, and therefore may restrict its efficiency as a biocontrol agent. Chalcidoidea parasitism affected predominately the largest scales (particularly when P. mesembryanthemi reached high densities), slowing down the development of scales in summer. The excretion of honeydew by these scales attracted ants, and exceptionally, led to mould fouling. Carpobrotus plants were also attacked by fruit predators (facilitating seed dissemination and germination), other sap-sucking insects (i.e. aphids, mealybugs, spittlebugs), and viruses. There were no severe consequences. The utilization of the scale-insect as biological control due to complex interactions between both invaders and a set of generalist enemies and mutualists, as well as its implications, are discussed.","[Vieites-Blanco, Cristina; Retuerto, Ruben; Lema, Margarita] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Funct Biol, R Lope Gomez Marzoa S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Lado, Luis Rodriguez] GeoForsk, R Escultor Ferreiro 9-2, Noia 15200, Spain","Lema, M (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Funct Biol, R Lope Gomez Marzoa S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",margarita.lema@usc.es,"Lema, Margarita/M-7604-2015; Retuerto, Ruben/B-4853-2008; Vieites-Blanco, Cristina/AAT-9759-2020; Vieites-Blanco, Cristina/AAO-9587-2020","Lema, Margarita/0000-0001-8402-2677; Retuerto, Ruben/0000-0002-9879-5512; Vieites-Blanco, Cristina/0000-0002-8506-0904; ",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Commission [CGL2013-48885-C2-2-R]; Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission,"We thank Serafin J.

Such populations are typically at high densities and consist primarily of small, relatively slender, and short-lived fish; populations in multispecies assemblages in lakes display opposite traits. Field and laboratory experiments have implicated predation as an important mechanism structuring crucian populations in multispecies assemblages. To investigate the role(s) of density dependence in structuring pond populations, we manipulated densities of crucians stocked into four sections of a subdivided natural pond in Finland. Mortality of stocked fish during the 3-mo experiment was low (0-11%) and unrelated to density. Growth rates of crucians were both size and density dependent. Larger fish did not noticeably grow in either high- or low-density sections, but growth of smaller size classes was 22% greater in low-density sections. Lower densities and smaller sizes of zooplankton, especially of inshore cladocerans that are an important food resource for smaller crucians, indicated that resource limitation caused by exploitation competition was an important density-dependent process restricting growth of small fish in high-density sections. Crucians rely on reserves of glycogen, stored in the liver and muscle, to fuel the over-winter anaerobic metabolism that allows them to maintain populations in ponds where winter hypoxia eliminates other fishes. Liver size was significantly larger and glycogen levels were 82% higher in our low-density pond sections than in high-density sections. At higher, but not lower, densities, relative liver size and glycogen levels decreased with body size; combined with the lack of growth of large fish, this indicates that density-dependent energy limitations contribute to the short life-spans and rarity of large fish that characterize pond populations. An increase in relative body depth can be induced in crucians by the presence of piscivorous fish, reducing vulnerability to predation. It has been proposed that increased body depth incurs a substantial energy cost during swimming and should be restricted to specific size classes in populations sympatric with predators. However, in our experiment, crucians of all sizes became significantly deeper bodied, which contributed to higher condition factors in low-density vs. high-density sections. This morphological change, occurring in the absence of piscivores, suggests that energy benefits (accumulation of overwintering reserves) can override any proposed costs for this sluggish, but metabolically unique, fish. Crucian carp successfully reproduced in all sections during the experiment, but growth and recruitment of 0+ fish (young of year) were strongly and negatively related to the numbers of older fish present. The observed density-dependent recruitment was likely caused by starvation-induced mortality and cannibalism; reduced growth observed in O+ fish would also be expected to cause higher first-winter mortality, reducing further recruitment at higher densities. Density dependence has a variety of regulatory effects on pond populations of crucian carp that contribute to their persistence and resilience.","UNIV JOENSUU, DEPT BIOL, SF-80101 JOENSUU 10, FINLAND","TONN, WM (corresponding author), UNIV ALBERTA, DEPT ZOOL, EDMONTON T6G 2E9, ALBERTA, CANADA.",,"Tonn, William M/A-3765-2014","Tonn, William M/0000-0002-0509-3184",,,,59,56,56,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1994,75,3,,,,,824,834,,10.2307/1941738,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NE029,WOS:A1994NE02900022,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, the detailed mechanisms, especially the role of predator communities, are not well understood. We studied biotic resistance to an invasive freshwater snail, Pomacea canaliculata, at 31 sites in an urban river basin (the Yamatogawa) in western Japan. First, we studied the relationship between the richness of local animal species and the abundance of P. canaliculata, demonstrating a negative relationship, which suggests that the intensity of biotic resistance regulates local snail populations. This pattern was due to the richness of native predator communities rather than that of introduced species or non-predators (mainly competitors of the apple snail). Local snail abundance was also affected by immigration of snails from nearby rice fields (i.e. propagule pressure), where few predators occur. Second, we assessed short-term predation pressure on the snail by means of a tethering experiment. Predation pressure was positively correlated with the number of individual predators and negatively correlated with snail abundance. The introduced crayfish Procambarus clarkii was responsible for the variance in predation pressure. These results indicate that the predator community, composed of both native and introduced species, is responsible for resistance to a novel invader even in a polluted urban river.","[Yamanishi, Yoko; Yusa, Yoichi] Nara Womens Univ, Fac Sci, Nara 6308506, Japan; [Yoshida, Kazuhiro] Natl Agr Res Ctr Kyushu Okinawa Reg, Koshi 8611192, Japan; [Fujimori, Noriomi] Toyohashi Univ Technol, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan","Yusa, Y (corresponding author), Nara Womens Univ, Fac Sci, Kitauoya Nishi, Nara 6308506, Japan.",yusa@cc.nara-wu.ac.jp,,,,,,50,27,30,4,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

In feeding trials where no migration of prey (Baetis bicaudatus, Ephemeroptera) was allowed from flow-through boxes containing natural substrates, Megarcys signata and Kogotus modestus (Perlodidae) significantly depressed prey densities over 14 and 38 h, respectively. However, increasing predator density had no apparent effect on per capita predation rate. In 1984 enclosure experiments allowing prey but not predator migration, Kogotus significantly reduced total prey density and that of two relatively sedentary prey species (Cinygmula mimus, Ephemeroptera, Heptageniidae, and Zapada haysi, Plecoptera, Nemouridae) during three-day trials. After six and nine days, prey colonization swamped the effects of prey resource depression. In contrast, in 1985 three-day enclosure experiments allowing prey but not predator migration, Kogotus did not depress total prey densities nor those of any individual prey taxon at densities of one, two, or four predators per cage; nor did predators affect the size distribution of any prey taxa. These data indicate that local prey resource depression by predatory stoneflies may be unusual in these streams, as long as prey are allowed to migrate into or out of containers (patches) with predators. Densities of mobile prey species are, thus, less depressible than are more sedentary prey species. The observation that very high predator densities had effects on their prey resource no different from those of low predator densities is consistent with the hypothesis that exploitative competition is less important than behavioral interference between stoneflies, documented by other studies as a determinant of the distribution and abundance of predatory stoneflies in streams.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS,CRESTED BUTTE,CO 81224","PECKARSKY, BL (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV,DEPT ENTOMOL,ITHACA,NY 14853, USA.",,,,,,,35,23,23,0,2,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1991,61,1,,,,,3,10,,10.2307/3545401,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR485,WOS:A1991FR48500001,,,,,2021-09-27,

The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus has established in the North American range of the competitively superior resident congener, Aedes albopictus, and the predatory native mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus. We tested predictions for two hypotheses of invasion success and species coexistence: keystone predation and spatial partitioning. We tested competition between A. japonicus japonicus and A. albopictus with or without T. rutilus in laboratory microcosms, and measured abundances of A. japonicus japonicus, A. albopictus, other resident competing mosquito species, and the presence of T. rutilus among tree holes and tires in metropolitan Washington, DC. In laboratory microcosms, A. albopictus was competitively dominant over A. japonicus japonicus, which is consistent with the few prior studies of competition between these two Aedes species. T. rutilus predation severely lowered performances of both Aedes species but more severely lowered A. japonicus japonicus performance than A. albopictus performance when all three species co-occurred, thus yielding no evidence for keystone predation. Consistent with the spatial partitioning hypothesis, A. japonicus japonicus was negatively correlated and independently aggregated with A. albopictus and all combined resident mosquito competitors and was not associated with T. rutilus among field containers. These results suggest that predation from T. rutilus and competition from A. albopictus are barriers to the spread of A. japonicus japonicus, but that A. japonicus japonicus may escape these interspecific effects by utilizing spatially partitioned container habitats.","[Freed, T.

It has been released both for classical and neoclassical biological control programs worldwide. Its presence has led to new ecological associations and it has been associated with the decline of indigenous natural enemies, notably ladybirds. These declines have been attributed to competition for resources and intraguild predation (IGP). H. axyridis was introduced in Argentina in 1986 to control the aphid Myzus persicae, although native coccinellid species are widespread in this area. Eriopis connexa Germar is the most abundant native coccinellid in Argentina. No study has assessed the possible ecological effects of the introduction of H. axyridis on naturally occurring aphid predators in Argentinian agro-ecosystems. This study evaluated IGP between H. axyridis and E. connexa at two different aphid densities under laboratory conditions. IGP occurred in 100 % of the cases when larvae of both species were reared together at low prey density and in 67 % of the cases at high prey density; at both prey levels, H. axyridis usually acted as the IG predator. The more rapid development to second and third larval instars, larger body size, and more voracious behavior of H. axyridis compared to the native coccinellid could explain the IGP direction. This study showed the negative effect of H. axyridis on the native E. connexa under laboratory conditions, corroborated interactions between the species observed in field crops, and highlighted the impacts of this exotic predator on naturally occurring predator species.","[Mirande, Luciana; Haramboure, Marina; Ines Schneider, Marcela] Ctr Estudios Parasitol & Vectores CEPAVE CONICET, RA-1900 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Desneux, Nicolas] French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, ISA UMR1355, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Ines Schneider, Marcela] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Schneider, MI (corresponding author), Ctr Estudios Parasitol & Vectores CEPAVE CONICET, Ave 120 S-N E-61 & 62, RA-1900 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mschneider@cepave.edu.ar,"Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013","Haramboure, Marina/0000-0002-7587-1359; Schneider, Marcela Ines/0000-0001-5666-7742",Argentine National Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology (ANPCyT)ANPCyT [PICT 2011 1752]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"This research was funded by a PICT 2011 1752 grant from the Argentine National Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology (ANPCyT) to M.

We report on data collected from nighttime surveys undertaken in April-May 2014 on Barbados, West Indies, that focused on the distribution and abundance of the endemic Barbados leaf-toed gecko (Phyllodactylus pulcher) and the introduced tropical house gecko (Hemidactylus mabouia) along unlit coastal walls and among boulders in the grounds of a hotel resort. In contrast to patterns of displacement of native species by H. mabouia seen elsewhere, P. pulcher was more abundant than H. mabouia on coastal walls, whereas the latter was found in greater numbers using boulders at this site. Walls and boulders differed with regard to availability of diurnal refugia suitable for geckos, with the walls having high frequency of small crevices with openings <20 mm, and boulders offering very little cover other than the underside of the boulder itself. To investigate whether this niche separation was a result of differences in diurnal refuge use between the species, we conducted experimental trials in which geckos were allowed to select between refugia with different characteristics. Both species selected for narrower and warmer refugia, and refugia that had been previously occupied by the other species. These shared preferences for refugia type suggest that other factors underlie the niche separation observed in the field. In supporting high densities of P. pulcher, coastal walls could offer important secondary habitat by augmenting the natural cliff side habitat of this endemic gecko, a finding that could be exploited for the conservation of this candidate species for Critically Endangered classification.","[Williams, Robert] Univ Brighton, Sch Pharm & Biomol Sci, Ecol & Conservat Res Grp, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Pernetta, Angelo P.] Univ Brighton, Ecol & Conservat Res Grp, Hastings, England; [Horrocks, Julia A.] Univ West Indies, Dept Biol & Chem Sci, Wanstead, Barbados","Williams, R (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Sch Pharm & Biomol Sci, Huxley Bldg,Lewes Rd, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England.",robertjwilliams76@gmail.com,,"Williams, Robert/0000-0003-3706-4510; Pernetta, Angelo/0000-0003-4492-2798",Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund; Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust,"This research was partially supported by grants awarded by The Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund and The Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust, and was undertaken with permission from the Ministry of Environment and Drainage, Government of Barbados.

However, invaders could have important effects on native host-parasite dynamics. Where infectious stages are ubiquitous and native host-pathogen specificity is strong, invasive less-competent hosts may reduce the pool of infectious stages, effectively reducing native host-parasite encounter rate. Alternatively, invasive species could alter transmission via changes in native species abundance. Biotic and abiotic environmental factors can also impact disease dynamics by altering host or parasite condition. However, little is known about potential interactive effects of invasion and environmental context on native species disease dynamics. Moreover, experimental examinations of the mechanisms driving dilution effects are limited, but serve to provide tests of predictions leading to diversity-disease relationships. Using field and laboratory experiments, we tested competing hypotheses that an invasive species reduces the prevalence of a native parasite in its host by removing infectious propagules from the environment or by reducing native host abundance. In addition, we evaluated the role of detritus quantity as a resource base in mediating effects of the invasive species. Native parasite prevalence was reduced when the invasive species was present. Prevalence was also higher in high detritus habitats, although this effect was lost when the invasive species was present. The invasive species significantly reduced infectious propagules from the aquatic habitats. Presence of the invasive species had no effect on the native species abundance; thus, the reduction in parasitism was not due to changes in host density but through a reduction in infectious propagule encounters. We conclude that an invasive species can facilitate a native species by reducing parasite prevalence via a dilution effect and that these effects can be modified by resource level. Reductions in parasitism may have ripple effects throughout the community, altering the strength of competitive interactions, predation rates or coinfection with other pathogens. We advocate considering potential positive effects of invasive species on recipient communities, in addition to effects of invasions on host-parasite interactions to gain a broader understanding of the complex consequences of invasion.","[Westby, Katie M.; Sweetman, Brenden M.; Van Horn, Thomas R.; Biro, Elizabeth G.; Medley, Kim A.] Washington Univ St Louis, Tyson Res Ctr, Eureka, MO 63025 USA","Westby, KM (corresponding author), Washington Univ St Louis, Tyson Res Ctr, Eureka, MO 63025 USA.",katiewestby206@gmail.com,,,Tyson Research Center,Tyson Research Center,,85,7,7,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We analyzed time series of the abundance of ten species of spring foliage feeding Lepidoptera sampled over a 25-year period at 20 sites in the Slovak Republic. Six species were free-feeders and four were leaf-rollers as larvae. Twenty-nine percent of interspecific pairs were significantly synchronous and correlations were highest among species exhibiting similar feeding strategies. Similar patterns of interspecific synchrony have been previously demonstrated in several other taxa, and the synchronizing effects of weather and/or specialist predators have been proposed as mechanisms. As an alternative explanation, we explored a model in which two species within the same feeding guild were synchronized by the functional response of generalist predators. In this model, species remained unsynchronized in the complete absence of predation or when predatory pressures were applied to only one species. Pairs of prey species projecting relatively similar search images to predators were more highly synchronized than species with relatively different search images. Prey handling time only influenced synchrony when it was very high relative to the total time prey was exposed to predators. Our model's prediction of greater synchrony among species that project similar search images to predators was in agreement with our field study that showed greater synchrony among species sharing similar larval feeding strategies and morphologies.","US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA; Fores Res Inst, Res Stn Banska Stiavnica, SK-96923 Banska, Stiavnica, Slovakia; Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia; US Forest Serv, USDA, NE Res Stn, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA","Raimondo, S (corresponding author), US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, 1 Sabine Isl Dr, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA.",raimondo.sandy@epa.gov,"Liebhold, Andrew M/C-1423-2008",,,,,55,33,34,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2004,107,3,,,,,462,470,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13449.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,873FZ,WOS:000225266600002,,,,,2021-09-27,

To evaluate evolution in crayfish invasions, we tested for differences in growth rate, survival, and response to predators between native and invaded range populations of rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus). We hypothesized that low conspecific densities during introductions into lakes would select for increased investment in growth and reproduction in invasive populations. We reared crayfish from both ranges in common garden experiments in lakes and mesocosms, the latter in which we also included treatments of predatory fish presence and food quality. In both lake and mesocosm experiments, O.rusticus from invasive populations had significantly faster growth rates and higher survival than individuals from the native range, especially in mesocosms where fish were present. There was no influence of within-range collection location on growth rate. Egg size was similar between ranges and did not affect crayfish growth. Our results, therefore, suggest that growth rate, which previous work has shown contributes to strong community-level impacts of this invasive species, has diverged since O.rusticus was introduced to the invaded range. This result highlights the need to consider evolutionary dynamics in invasive species mitigation strategies.","[Sargent, Lindsey W.; Lodge, David M.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Lodge, David M.] Univ Notre Dame, Environm Change Initiat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Sargent, LW (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",lsargen1@nd.edu,"Reisinger, Lindsey S/F-8030-2016; Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021","Reisinger, Lindsey S/0000-0001-6685-5958; ",University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center; NSF IGERT grant award [0504495],"We thank Ashley Baldridge and Jill Deines for assistance with crayfish collection.

A key challenge to forecasting the future of ecosystems centers on how to extrapolate results from short-term, single-species studies to community-level responses that are mediated by key mechanisms such as competition, resource availability (bottom-up control), and predation (top-down control) [2]. We used CO2 vents as potential analogs of ocean acidification combined with in situ experiments to test current predictions of fish biodiversity loss and community change due to elevated CO2 [3] and to elucidate the potential mechanisms that drive such change. We show that high risk-taking behavior and competitive strength, combined with resource enrichment and collapse of predator populations, fostered already common species, enabling them to double their populations under acidified conditions. However, the release of these competitive dominants from predator control led to suppression of less common and subordinate competitors that did not benefit from resource enrichment and reduced predation. As a result, local biodiversity was lost and novel fish community compositions were created under elevated CO2. Our study identifies the species interactions most affected by ocean acidification, revealing potential sources of natural selection. We also reveal how diminished predator abundances can have cascading effects on local species diversity, mediated by complex species interactions. Reduced overfishing of predators could therefore act as a key action to stall diversity loss and ecosystem change in a high-CO2 world.","[Nagelkerken, Ivan; Goldenberg, Silvan U.; Ferreira, Camilo M.; Connell, Sean D.] Univ Adelaide, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Sch Biol Sci, DX 650 418, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Nagelkerken, Ivan; Goldenberg, Silvan U.; Ferreira, Camilo M.; Connell, Sean D.] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, DX 650 418, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Russell, Bayden D.] Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Russell, Bayden D.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Nagelkerken, I (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Sch Biol Sci, DX 650 418, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.; Nagelkerken, I (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, DX 650 418, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",ivan.nagelkerken@adelaide.edu.au,"Nagelkerken, Ivan/E-1093-2011; Ferreira, Camilo M/M-9427-2015; Russell, Bayden D./A-9942-2008; Russell, Bayden D./R-9325-2019; Connell, Sean D/A-8874-2008","Nagelkerken, Ivan/0000-0003-4499-3940; Ferreira, Camilo M/0000-0001-9022-1963; Russell, Bayden D./0000-0003-1282-9978; Russell, Bayden D./0000-0003-1282-9978; Connell, Sean D/0000-0002-5350-6852; Goldenberg, Silvan U./0000-0003-2296-2190",ARC future fellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT120100183]; ARC Discovery grantAustralian Research Council [DP150104263]; Environment Institute (The University of Adelaide); Science without Borders through CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel) Brazil [13058134],Financial support was provided by an ARC future fellowship to I.N.

The aim was to examine how variation in the intensity of seedling herbivory interacts with growth-defence trade-offs and herbivore feeding preferences to affect plant community development. Using 14-d-old seedlings of Trifolium pratense and T. repens, relative growth and susceptibility to herbivory by the snail Helix aspersa was quantified to elucidate putative growth-defence trade-offs for these species. Then mixed assemblages of 14-d-old Trifolium seedlings were exposed to herbivory by zero, two, five or ten snails and determined how variation in the intensity of herbivory affected competitive interactions into the mature phase (as measured by total plant biomass at 120 d old). In the absence of herbivory, communities were dominated by T. pratense; a result expected on the basis that it yielded larger and presumably more competitive seedlings. However, when seedlings were exposed to herbivory, the balance of competition shifted. At low levels of herbivory (two snails), both Trifolium species contributed equally to total plant biomass. More intense herbivory (five snails) resulted in almost total mortality of T. pratense and dominance of the mature community by T. repens. The most intense herbivory (ten snails) effectively removed all seedlings from the experimental community. The study illustrates a mechanism whereby spatio-temporal fluctuations in seedling herbivory, when coupled with species-specific variation in competitive ability and sensitivity to herbivore attack, can differentially influence plant recruitment into the mature phase. This mechanism may be a key element in our attempts to understand plant species coexistence, since fluctuations in plant recruitment are fundamental to the many theories that view coexistence as a consequence of a spatio-temporal lottery for dominance over regeneration micro-sites.","[Hanley, M.

The performance of colonies protected from just ground predators was intermediate. We failed to persuade ants to tend A. jacobaeae. Colonies of B. cardui attended by ants performed better than controls and those with ground predators excluded, but not as well as those with all predators excluded.

In the western Canadian boreal forest, restoration of seismic lines-linear corridors cut for oil exploration-has been proposed to mitigate declines in woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) driven by altered predator-prey dynamics in industrialized landscapes. Seismic lines fragment caribou habitat, facilitate predator (wolves Canis lupus and black bears Ursus americanus) movements, and may enhance apparent competition from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces). Here, we tested the assumption that restoration provides immediate wildlife conservation benefits, using a caribou-boreal forest case study. We used camera traps to monitor seismic line use by caribou, their competitors, and predators following restoration in northeastern Alberta. We assessed species responses to four line strata: two restored (active and passive) and two unrestored (human-use and control). Three-to-six years after restoration, white-tailed deer preferred unrestored seismic lines over actively restored lines, while wolves preferred human-use lines but did not avoid restored lines. Caribou preferred lines in lowland habitat and lines surrounded by low linear density regardless of restoration. Species responses to restoration were muted, indicating that restoration alone may not be immediately effective in stabilizing threatened caribou populations. Our results highlight that wildlife responses to restoration must be tested. We recommend rigorous wildlife monitoring following restoration, particularly when the indirect, interspecific effects of habitat change drive species endangerment or recovery.","[Tattersall, Erin R.; Burgar, Joanna M.; Burton, A.

Where competition interacts with anthropogenic habitat modification, this natural ecosystem process can become a threatening process. Understanding the mechanisms behind competition in such cases is essential for the formulation of cost-effective management responses for biodiversity conservation. According to the resource availability hypothesis of competition, interference competition limits access to resources by species vulnerable to such aggression and wastes energy in evasive responses. Studying competition is notoriously difficult, however, empirical evidence of the resource availability theory is limited, and there are few published experimental studies showing such an effect at larger scales. We present the results of a controlled and replicated empirical study of interference competition at a landscape scale. We removed an aggressive, overabundant native bird, Manorina melanocephala (noisy miner), whose interference competition is a threatening process for small woodland birds in the highly modified agricultural landscapes of eastern Australia. We monitored foraging and harassment rates of small woodland birds before and after removal to indicate if levels of interference competition changed. Due to unexpected immediate recolonisation, abundance of M. melanocephala in treatment sites declined by only 34% relative to control sites. Twenty-four bird species displayed aggressive behaviour towards other birds and 41 bird species were victims of aggression. Manorina melanocephala was responsible for 66% of all aggressive interactions. After removal, we recorded a doubling in foraging rate of small woodland birds in treatment compared to control sites. This appears to confirm the resource availability hypothesis of competition. Paradoxically, however, increased foraging was not accompanied by a decline in harassment. Low detection rates of harassment of small woodland birds, combined with the modest reduction in abundance of M. melanocephala, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between rates of harassment and rates of foraging.","[Beggs, Richard; Pierson, Jennifer; Tulloch, Ayesha I.

Therefore, complementary laboratory and field approaches are required for reliable predictions of real-world patterns and processes. Laboratory and field experiments with the red spider mite, Oligonychus ilicis McGregor (Acari: Tetranychidae), and the coffee leaf miner, Leucoptera coffeella GuErin-MEneville (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), on coffee plants, Coffea arabica L. (Rubiaceae), were combined to study the relative importance of biotic interactions, including resource preferences and natural-enemy impact, and habitat factors, such as agroforestry type and management intensity, on coffee pest densities. In the laboratory, leaf discs cut from undamaged coffee plants were significantly preferred by red spider mites over those from plants infested with conspecific mites, leaf rust pathogens [Hemileia vastatrix Berkeley & Broome (Uredinales)], or coffee leaf miners, resulting in higher reproductive success. Similarly, undamaged plants were preferred by coffee leaf miners over red spider mite-infested plants. However, in the field, red spider mite densities were positively correlated with coffee leaf miner and leaf rust densities, thereby contrasting with laboratory predictions. Hence, our study suggests that the importance of resource preferences and fitness expected based on laboratory experiments was suppressed by environmental conditions in the field, though other unassessed biotic interactions could also have played a role. Furthermore, intensified agroforestry was characterized by higher red spider mite densities, whereas densities of its major natural enemy, the predatory mite Amblyseius herbicolus Chant (Acari: Phytoseiidae), were not related to agroforestry management. Densities of coffee leaf miner and its main natural enemy, a eulophid parasitoid (Hymenoptera), were not affected by management practices. In conclusion, patterns found in the laboratory did not hold for the field, emphasizing the difficulties of extrapolating small-scale experiments to larger spatial scales and the need to combine both approaches.","[Teodoro, Adenir V.; Tscharntke, Teja; Klein, Alexandra-Maria] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Teodoro, AV (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Maranhao, Programa Posgrad Agroecol, POB 3004, Sao Luis, MA, Brazil.",ad.teodoro@yahoo.com,"Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014; Klein, Alexandra-Maria/J-5871-2016; Teodoro, Adenir/AAY-1190-2021","Klein, Alexandra-Maria/0000-0003-2139-8575; ","CAPES/Brasilia-BrazilCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, Bioteam program)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)","We are grateful to Free de Koning, Betty Pico, and Roland Olschewski of the project BioSys (Evaluation of biological diversity of land-use systems in a mega-diverse region of Ecuador) for their support and help.

Recent theoretical insights have shown that predator species may help each other to persist by size-selective foraging on a shared prey. By feeding on a certain prey stage, a predator may induce a compensatory response in another stage of the same prey species, thereby favouring other predators; a phenomenon referred to as emergent facilitation. 2. To test whether emergent facilitation may occur in a natural system, we performed an enclosure experiment where we mimicked fish predation by selectively removing large zooplankton and subsequently following the response of the invertebrate predator Bythotrephes longimanus. 3. Positive responses to harvest were observed in the biomass of juvenile individuals of the dominant zooplankton Holopedium gibberum and in Bythotrephes densities. Hence, by removing large prey, we increased the biomass of small prey, i.e. stage-specific biomass overcompensation was present in the juvenile stage of Holopedium. This favoured Bythotrephes, which preferentially feed on small Holopedium. 4. We argue that the stage-specific overcompensation occurred as a result of increased per capita fecundity of adult Holopedium and as a result of competitive release following harvest. If shown to be common, emergent facilitation may be a major mechanism behind observed predator extinctions and patterns of predator invasions.","[Huss, Magnus; Nilsson, Karin A.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Huss, M (corresponding author), Swedish Board Fisheries, Inst Coastal Res, Box 109, SE-74242 Oregrund, Sweden.",magnus.huss@fiskeriverket.se,,,,,,39,16,16,1,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

IGP theory, in particular, predicts that when two competitors interact via IGP, with increasing resource productivity: ( 1) the IG predator will increase in abundance as the IG prey declines, and ( 2) increasing dominance of the IG predator will cause resource density to increase. Here, we provide a first test of these predictions in a field community consisting of a scale insect and its two specialist parasitoids, Aphytis melinus ( the IG predator) and Encarsia perniciosi ( the IG prey). The shared resource, California red scale, is a pest of citrus, and its productivity varies across a threefold range among citrus cultivars. We examined both absolute and relative densities of parasitoids along this natural gradient of scale productivity in three citrus cultivars ( orange, grapefruit and lemon). Although both parasitoid species were found in all three cultivars, their abundances reflected those predicted by IGP theory: the IG prey species dominated at low productivity and the IG predator dominated at high productivity. This relationship was caused by an increase in Aphytis density with productivity. In addition, the density of scale increased with the dominance of the IG predator. These results from a field system demonstrate the important dynamic outcomes for food webs with IGP.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Borer, ET (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,"Briggs, Cheryl/F-7456-2013","Borer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2259-5853",,,,23,63,64,0,33,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

The two predator species are spatially segregated within the plant: T. manihoti dwells on the middle leaves, while T. aripo occurs in the apices of the plant during the day and moves to the first leaves below the apex at night. To monitor the prey densities experienced by the two predator species in their micro-environment, we assessed prey and predator populations in apices and on the leaves of cassava plants in the field. Prey densities peaked from November to January and reached the lowest levels in July. They were higher on leaves than in the apices. To test whether the life histories of the two predator species are tuned to the prey density they experience, we measured age-specific fecundity and survival of the two predators under three prey density regimes (I prey female/72 h, I prey female/24 h and above the predators level of satiation). T. manihoti had a higher growth rate than T. aripo at high prey densities, mainly due to its higher fecundity. T. aripo had a higher growth rate at low prey density regimes, due to its late fecundity and survival. Thus, each of the two species perform better under the prey density that characterizes their micro-habitat within the plant.","Univ Amsterdam, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Amsterdam, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Helsinki, Dept Systemat & Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; USP, ESALQ, Setor Zool Agricola, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil","Magalhaes, S (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, POB 94084, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Brommer, Jon E/C-3613-2008; S., Magalhaes/B-9673-2012; Bakker, F.M./AAF-5380-2019","Brommer, Jon E/0000-0002-2435-2612; S., Magalhaes/0000-0002-8609-7768; Bakker, F.M./0000-0002-1447-3285",,,,42,9,10,0,8,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2003,102,3,,,,,533,542,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12430.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,715DP,WOS:000184955500009,,,,,2021-09-27,

On average 50% of foraging observations were in mixed-species foraging aggregations, but with extensive interspecific variation. The occurrence of mixed-species foraging aggregations was relatively constant from the end of May until early July, with no indication that the appearance of fledglings increased the frequency of aggregations. These mixed-species foraging aggregations consisted of a wide variety of species in terms of foraging niche: typical flycatchers, specialized arboreal insectivores, and generalists were observed foraging together. The titmice species (Parus spp.) seemed to be preferred as foraging companions. The sites where foraging aggregations were observed did not differ from an equal number of randomly chosen sites with respect to forest vegetation structure. The dispersion of individuals in study areas was analysed using a 50 m x 50 m quadrat as the sampling unit. Altogether, 96 quadrats were surveyed. The dispersion of individual birds with respect to individuals of other species was non-random, and significantly clumped within quadrats. We used two playback experiments to test whether the aggregations were due to active search for heterospecific companions. In the first experiment, 20 randomly assigned sites received two 10-min treatments: willow tit (Parus montanus) song and silence as control. In the second experiment, we had two control treatments at 30 playback sites for the willow tit sons, the song of the olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus borealis) and classical music. More species were observed during willow tit song than during any of the controls. This suggests that aggregated dispersion pattern and the existence of mixed-species foraging aggregations were due to active search for heterospecific companions, and also that recognition of neighbouring species was involved. We suggest that birds actively aggregate in mixed-species Foraging groups to gain protection against predators and/or enhance feeding efficiency. The results support the view that positive interactions have an importance in structuring northern breeding bird communities.","FINNISH GAME & FISHERIES RES INST,MELTAUS GAME RES STN,FIN-97340 MELTAUS,FINLAND","Monkkonen, M (corresponding author), UNIV OULU,DEPT BIOL,POB 333,FIN-90571 OULU,FINLAND.",,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012; Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011","Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,50,62,65,0,45,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1996,77,1,,,,,127,136,,10.2307/3545592,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VQ986,WOS:A1996VQ98600014,,,,,2021-09-27,

Interspecific diversity among Pacific salmon species (Oncorhynchus spp.) creates staggered spawning events across space and time, thereby prolonging availability to terrestrial wildlife. We sought to understand how such variation might influence consumption by terrestrial predators compared with resource abundance and intra- and interspecific competition. Using stable isotope analysis, we investigated how the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of male black bears (Ursus americanus; n = 405) varies with species diversity and density of spawning salmon biomass, while also accounting for competition with sympatric black and grizzly bears (U. arctos horribilis), in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We found that the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of black bears was approximate to 40% higher in the absence of grizzly bears, but detected little effect of relative black bear density and salmon biomass density. Rather, salmon diversity had the largest positive effect on consumption. On average, increasing diversity from one salmon species to similar to four (with equal biomass contributions) approximately triples the proportion of salmon in diet. Given the importance of salmon to bear life histories, this work provides early empirical support for how resource waves may increase the productivity of consumers at population and landscape scales. Accordingly, terrestrial wildlife management might consider maintaining not only salmon abundance but also diversity.","[Service, Christina N.; Bateman, Andrew W.; Adams, Megan S.; Artelle, Kyle A.; Paquet, Paul C.; Darimont, Chris T.] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Service, Christina N.; Adams, Megan S.; Artelle, Kyle A.; Darimont, Chris T.] Hakai Inst, Heriot Bay, BC, Canada; [Service, Christina N.; Adams, Megan S.; Artelle, Kyle A.; Paquet, Paul C.; Darimont, Chris T.] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC, Canada; [Service, Christina N.] Spirit Bear Res Fdn, Klemtu, BC, Canada; [Bateman, Andrew W.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Bateman, Andrew W.] Salmon Coast Field Stn, Echo Bay, BC, Canada; [Artelle, Kyle A.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Reimchen, Thomas E.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada","Service, CN (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada.; Service, CN (corresponding author), Hakai Inst, Heriot Bay, BC, Canada.; Service, CN (corresponding author), Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC, Canada.; Service, CN (corresponding author), Spirit Bear Res Fdn, Klemtu, BC, Canada.",christina.service@gmail.com,"Adams, Megan S/AAV-8907-2020","Adams, Megan S/0000-0003-3586-774X; Service, Christina/0000-0001-7448-7251; Artelle, Kyle/0000-0002-8399-5693",Raincoast Conservation Foundation; Spirit Bear Research Foundation; Willow Grove Foundation; Tides Canada; Nature Conservancy; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Vanier FellowshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Mitacs Accelerate Fellowship; NSERC Industrial Postgraduate ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC postdoctoral fellowshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Killam postdoctoral fellowship; NSERC Vanier Fellowship; Tula Foundation; NSERC Operating GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [NRC 2354]; Wilburforce Foundation; Raincoast Research Chair; NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [435683],"We are thankful for collaborations with the Haitzaqv, Kitasoo/Xai'xais, Nuxalk, and Wuikinuxv First Nations.

In the same field experiment, the fragmentation effect on the below-ground plant biomass was evaluated in I year. Additionally, species richness and abundance of plants were recorded. The experimental set-up consisted of 12 blocks with 48 fragments (24 small, 12 medium and 12 large) and 48 corresponding control plots distributed over three study sites. Fragmentation was maintained by frequently mowing the area between the fragments. Three to 5 years after the beginning of the experiment, plant biomass was harvested in all fragments and control plots in late autumn every year. In general, fragments contained more above- and below-ground plant biomass than control plots. The increase in above-ground plant biomass was partly due to an increased density of plants, and partly due to a change in species composition in fragments. In particular, a competitive shift of dominance towards tall grasses and forbs at the expense of smaller forbs was observed. Beside the main fragmentation effect on above-ground plant biomass, interactive effects with year of investigation, study site and plot size were found. This indicates that the observed fragmentation effect is a combined result of various factors acting to a different extent at different sites and plot sizes. The fragmentation-related increase in plant productivity could affect higher trophic levels such as herbivore and predator communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

If so, can the competitive effect mimic predation risk? Hypotheses: A competing species should increase its use of secondary habitat as the density of its competitor in that habitat declines. And it should forage in safe sites more readily when its competitor is abundant than when it is sparse. Organisms: Two co-existing species of northern voles (Myodes gapperi and Microtus pennsylvanicus) known to have distinct habitat preferences. Field site: Two pairs of interconnected rodent-proof enclosures in field and forest habitat at the Lakehead University Habitron near Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. Methods: I predicted density-dependent habitat use from first principles, then measured the density of Myodes in the two habitats as well as its quitting-harvest rate in artificial food patches. I tested the predictions by contrasting treatments where I reduced the density of Microtus in the presence of Myodes, versus controls where I reduced an equal density of Myodes existing alone. Results: Myodes used its preferred forest habitat more at high Microtus density than kit low Microtus density. But Microtus occupied both habitats at all densities. Myodes used safe foraging sites more intensely in the treatment where Microtus was present than in the control where it was absent. Conclusions: Competition between these two vole species is reduced by density-dependent habitat selection. But Myodes also trades off food for safety to avoid competition with larger Microtus. Ecologists must first eliminate competition if they are to accurately estimate the effects of predation risk on species co-existence.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,,"Canada Foundation; Ontario Innovation Trust; Lakehead University; Buchanan Forest Products, Ltd; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","The Lakehead University Habitron was made possible through support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Ontario Innovation Trust, Lakehead University, and Buchanan Forest Products, Ltd.

The rate of successful parasitism for H. axyridis was lower than for C maculata, but the proportion of the population that had immature stages of the parasitoid was similar for both species. We used a population dynamics model to predict interactions between C. maculata, H. axyridis, and D. coccinellae, incorporating the differences in suitability we found between the two hosts. In the model, parasitoid attacks on non-suitable hosts contribute to parasitoid egg depletion without causing host death or parasitoid recruitment. Thus, hosts with low suitability could act as sinks for parasitoid eggs. Simulations of this model suggest that there is a critical value of the growth rate (r) for C maculata below which C maculata goes extinct. The critical r value is an increasing function of the attack rate on C maculata (as expected) and a decreasing function of the attack rate on H. axyridis because the strength of H. axyridis as an egg sink increases with the attack rate on this species. Simulations of the model using experimentally derived parameter values suggest that the presence of H. axyridis leads to an increase in equilibrium densities of C maculata. This outcome is due to the wastage of parasitoid eggs in the relatively unsuitable H. axyridis hosts.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Ctr Community Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Hoogendoorn, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, 219 Hodson Hall,1980 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",,,,,,,29,76,79,0,27,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1049-9644,,,BIOL CONTROL,Biol.

Although different studies report global trends in ecological patterns worldwide, Southeastern Pacific coastal ecosystems have been poorly considered. Given that the SE Pacific coast encompasses diverse coastal ecosystems, consideration of studies conducted along this range can shed light on the heterogeneity of processes regulating coastal communities. We reviewed the biotic interactions and habitat type considered, as well as the complexity in terms of spatial and temporal extent of manipulative field experimental studies conducted along the SE Pacific coast from 0 degrees S to 56 degrees S (Ecuador to Chile). We test the effect of funding reported by different studies as a main factor limiting experimental complexity. From field ecological studies published from 1970 to 2016, we found that 81 studies were truly manipulative, in which one or multiple factors were manipulated. Around 77% of these studies were located between 21 degrees S and 40 degrees S, and conducted in intertidal rocky habitats. An increase in experimental studies was observed between 2010 and 2015, especially focused on herbivore-alga interactions, although we found that both the temporal extent and spatial extent of these studies have shown a decrease in recent decades. Funding grant amount reported had a positive effect on elapsed time of field experiments, but no effect was observed on spatial extent or in the biotic interactions considered. Elapsed time of experiments was different among the main biotic interactions considered, that is, herbivory, predation, and competition. We suggest that to further progress in applied ecological knowledge, it will be necessary to consider pollution and urbanization processes explicitly using a field experimental framework. This information could improve our understanding of how ecosystems present along the SE Pacific coast respond to climate change and increased levels of human interventions.","[Aguilera, Moises A.; Dobringer, Johanne; Petit, Ignacio J.] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Biol Marina, Coquimbo, Chile; [Dobringer, Johanne; Petit, Ignacio J.] Univ La Serena, Univ Catolica Norte, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas CEAZA, Programa Doctorado Biol & Ecol Aplicada BEA, Coquimbo, Chile; [Petit, Ignacio J.] Millennium Nucleus Ecol & Sustainable Management, Coquimbo, Chile","Aguilera, MA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Biol Marina, Coquimbo, Chile.",moises.aguilera@ucn.cl,"Aguilera, Moises/AAC-2981-2020","Aguilera, Moises/0000-0002-3517-6255","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160223]; PAI-CONICYT [79150002]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21170330, 21170169]","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 1160223; PAI-CONICYT, Grant/Award Number: #79150002; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT), Grant/Award Number: 21170330 and 21170169",,87,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Strips of permeable polyester fabric and glue can be folded and glued to construct a strip of compartments that house seeds and identifying information, while allowing contact with soil leachate, water, microorganisms, and ambient temperature. Strips may be constructed with a wide range of compartment numbers and sizes and allow the researcher to house a variety of genotypes within a single species, different species, or seeds that have experienced different treatments. As opposed to individual seed packets, strips are more easily retrieved as a unit. While replicate packets can be included within a strip, different strips can act as blocks or can be retrieved at different times for observation of seed behavior over time. We used a high temperature glue gun to delineate compartments and sealed the strips once the seed and tags identifying block and removal times were inserted. The seed strips were then buried in the field at the desired depth, with the location marked for later removal. Burrowing animal predators were effectively excluded by use of a covering of metal mesh hardware cloth on the soil surface. After the selected time interval for burial, strips were dug up and seeds were assessed for germination, dormancy and mortality. While clearly dead seeds can often be distinguished from ungerminated living ones by eye, dormant seeds were conclusively identified using a standard Tetrazolium chloride colorimetric test for seed viability.","[Pace, Brian A.; Mercer, Kristin L.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Alexander, Helen M.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Emry, D.

However, the effects of invasive preys on native predators have been poorly studied. Here, we first reviewed hypotheses describing potential relationships between native predators and invasive preys. Second, we examined how an invasive prey, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), affected a native terrestrial amphibian community. In the field, we looked at the structure of the amphibian community in invaded versus uninvaded areas and characterized amphibian trophic ecology. The amphibian community sampled seemed to show a species- dependent response in abundance to invasion: adults of the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita), the species demonstrating the highest degree of ant specialization, were less abundant in invaded areas. Although available ant biomass was significantly greater in invaded than in uninvaded areas (only Argentine ants occurred in the former), amphibians consumed relatively fewer ants in invaded areas. In the lab, we quantified amphibian consumption of Argentine ants versus native ants and assessed whether consumption patterns could have been influenced by prior exposure to the invader. The lab experiments corroborated the field results: amphibians preferred native ants over Argentine ants, and prior exposure did not influence consumption. Differences in preference explained why amphibians consumed fewer Argentine ants in spite of their greater relative availability; they might also explain why the most ant-specialized amphibians seemed to avoid invaded areas. Our results suggest the importance to account for predator feeding capacities and dietary ranges to understand the effects of invasive species at higher trophic levels.","[Alvarez-Blanco, Paloma; Caut, Stephane; Cerda, Xim; Angulo, Elena] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Avda Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain","Caut, S (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Avda Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.",stephanecaut@gmail.com,"Angulo, Elena/AAF-8524-2020; Angulo, Elena/A-8107-2013; Cerda, Xim/P-6461-2014","Angulo, Elena/0000-0001-5545-4032; Angulo, Elena/0000-0001-5545-4032; Cerda, Xim/0000-0002-3222-2471","Consolider MONTES project [CSD 2008-00040]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; FEDEREuropean Commission [CGL2012-36181, CGL2013-43660-P]","This study was funded by the Consolider MONTES project (CSD 2008-00040); the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and FEDER (CGL2012-36181, CGL2013-43660-P); and fellowships to P.A.-B.

When spider mites infested plants prior to predator release, predatory mites were not capable of controlling spider mite populations in the absence of other pest species. A laboratory experiment showed that predators were hindered by the webbing of spider mites. In a greenhouse experiment, spider mite leaf damage was lower in the presence of thrips and predators than in the presence of whiteflies and predators, but damage was lowest in the presence of thrips, whiteflies and predators. Whitefly control was also improved in the presence of thrips. The lower levels of spider mite leaf damage probably resulted from (1) a strong numerical response of the predator (up to 50 times higher densities) when a second and third pest species were present in addition to spider mites, and (2) from A. swirskii attacking mobile spider mite stages outside or near the edges of the spider mite webbing. Interactions of spider mites with thrips and whiteflies might also result in suppression of spider mites. However, when predators were released prior to spider mite infestations in the absence of other pest species, but with pollen as food for the predators, we found increased suppression of spider mites with increased numbers of predators released, confirming the role of predators in spider mite control. Thus, our study provides evidence that diversity of pest species can enhance biological control through increased predator densities.","[Messelink, Gerben J.; Van Holstein-Saj, Renata] Wageningen UR Greenhouse Hort, NL-2265 ZG Bleiswijk, Netherlands; [Van Maanen, Roos; Sabelis, Maurice W.; Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Sect Populat Biol, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands","Messelink, GJ (corresponding author), Wageningen UR Greenhouse Hort, POB 20, NL-2265 ZG Bleiswijk, Netherlands.",Gerben.Messelink@wur.nl,"Messelink, Gerben J./AAD-1738-2019; Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Messelink, Gerben J./0000-0002-5196-1229; Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303","Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality; Technology Foundation [7180]","This study was supported by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality.

These top-down effects may interact with anthropogenic impacts, such as climate change, in largely unknown ways. We investigated how changes in densities of large predatory arthropods in forest leaf-litter communities altered lower trophic levels and litter decomposition. We conducted our experiment in soil communities that had experienced different levels of long-term average precipitation. We hypothesized that altering abundances of apex predators would have stronger effects on soil communities inhabiting dry forests, due to lower secondary productivity and greater resource overexploitation by lower trophic levels compared to wet forests. We experimentally manipulated abundances of the largest arthropod predators (apex predators) in field mesocosms replicated in the leaf-litter community of Iberian beech forests that differed in long-term mean annual precipitation by 25% (three dry forests with MAP < 1,250 mm and four wet forests with MAP > 1,400 mm). After one year, we assessed abundances of soil fauna in lower trophic levels and indirect impacts on leaf-litter decomposition using litter of understorey hazel, Corylus avellana. Reducing densities of large predators had a consistently negative effect on final abundances of the different trophic groups and several taxa within each group. Moreover, large predatory arthropods strongly impacted litter decomposition, and their effect interacted with the long-term annual rainfall experienced by the soil community. In the dry forests, a 50% reduction in the densities of apex predators was associated with a 50% reduction in decomposition. In wet forests, the same reduction in densities of apex soil predators did not alter the rate of litter decomposition. Our results suggest that predators may facilitate lower trophic levels by indirectly reducing competition and resource overexploitation, cascading effects that may be more pronounced in drier forests where conditions have selected for greater competitive ability and more rapid resource utilization. These findings thus provide insights into the functioning of soil invertebrate communities and their role in decomposition, as well as potential consequences of soil community responses to climate change.","[Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida; Jimenez-Navarro, Gerardo; De Mas, Eva; Moya-Larano, Jordi] CSIC, Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria, Spain; [Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida; Pato, Joaquina] Oviedo Univ, CSIC, UO, PA,Res Unit Biodivers, Mieres, Spain; [Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida; Jimenez-Navarro, Gerardo] CIBIO InBio Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Evora, Portugal; [Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol Anim Ecol, Gottingen, Germany; [Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, Gottingen, Germany; [Austin, Amy T.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculadas Agr IFEVA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Austin, Amy T.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Wise, David H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60680 USA","Melguizo-Ruiz, N (corresponding author), CSIC, Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria, Spain.; Melguizo-Ruiz, N (corresponding author), Oviedo Univ, CSIC, UO, PA,Res Unit Biodivers, Mieres, Spain.; Melguizo-Ruiz, N (corresponding author), CIBIO InBio Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Evora, Portugal.",nereidamelguizoruiz@gmail.com,"Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida/AAI-2608-2019; De Mas, Eva/H-9172-2015; Austin, Amy/E-7988-2011; MOYA-LARANO, JORDI/K-8596-2014","Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida/0000-0001-5153-5281; De Mas, Eva/0000-0001-8225-5805; Jimenez-Navarro, Gerardo/0000-0002-3613-9333; Pato, Joaquina/0000-0002-1919-5181; Austin, Amy/0000-0002-7468-5861; MOYA-LARANO, JORDI/0000-0001-7141-3206","Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2010-18602, CGL2015-66192-R]; Agencia de Innovacion y Desarrollo de Andalucia [P12-RNM-1521-EEZA]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission [PICT 2016-1780]; FPI fellowshipSpanish Government [BES-2011-043505]","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: CGL2010-18602 and CGL2015-66192-R; Agencia de Innovacion y Desarrollo de Andalucia, Grant/Award Number: P12-RNM-1521-EEZA; European Regional Development Fund, Grant/Award Number: PICT 2016-1780; FPI fellowship, Grant/Award Number: BES-2011-043505",,64,5,5,5,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Lizard introduction caused rapid and devastating effects on spider diversity and abundance: within two years, islands onto which lizards had been introduced became almost identical to islands with natural lizard populations. The proportion of species becoming extinct was 12.6 times higher on 'lizard-introduction' islands than on islands without lizards.

Keystone species and interaction strength are concepts with deep practical and theoretical implications. We studied the strength of predation on mussels (Mytilus trossulus) by the keystone seastar Pisaster ochraceus and the whelks Nucella emarginata and N. canaliculata under different environmental conditions in the Oregon intertidal zone. We attempted to determine: (1) the sensitivity of keystone predation to the presence of other predators in the system; (2) the role of other predators in the presence and absence of a keystone species; and (3) the per capita and population-level variability in interaction strengths of strong (keystone) vs. weak interactors. Predation intensity on mussels was measured by recording the survival of mussels transplanted to areas from which seastars, whelks, or both, had been either manually removed or left undisturbed at natural densities. Whelk experimental units were nested within those for the seastar treatment to account for the much larger body size and greater mobility of seastars. Each combination of seastar and whelk treatment was replicated four times in both wave-exposed and wave-protected habitats of two sites that differed in predator densities, primary productivity, and recruitment and growth rates of prey species. Predation intensity by the keystone predator was strong under all site X wave exposure combinations, and was unaffected by the presence of whelks. Whelks, in contrast, had ecologically important effects on mussel survival in the absence, but not in the presence, of the keystone predator. Population (total) interaction strength between seastars and mussels was 2-10 times stronger than that between whelks and mussels across sites and wave exposures. Per capita interaction strength of seastars was two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of whelks. However, per capita effects of seastars were more variable between sites and wave exposures, probably because simple density values grossly underestimate the ability of mobile predators to localize prey. Such interactive effects and variability in interaction strengths between keystone and weak predators may characterize all keystone predator-dominated systems, but data currently are insufficient to test this proposition. Negative effects of seastars on whelk density were observed <4 mo following initiation of Pisaster removals. Seastars also had a negative effect on whelk sizes, which took longer to appear, after 6 mo of continuous Pisaster removal. Negative effects of seastars on whelks appeared to be stronger in places with higher densities of predators, partially explaining the reduced predation intensity of whelks observed in the presence of seastars. Our results support the idea that in keystone-dominated systems, species other than the keystone species have only minor, if any, effects on the rest of the community, and thus might be cited by some as ''redundant species.'' However, our results also indicate that, after the loss of a keystone species, previously ''redundant'' species can partially compensate for the reduced predation and adopt a major role in the altered system. Such responses are potentially an important force in stabilizing communities. Further, such possible compensatory capabilities of alternative consumers suggests that, at least for predators, the term ''redundant species'' conveys an inaccurate image of the potential importance of weak interactors and should be abandoned.","OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,"Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012; Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013",,,,,101,183,187,1,197,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Most studies have focused on the effect of large invasive fishes such as salmonids, whereas the effect of smaller fish on amphibians has been seldom investigated. We experimentally studied effects of the invasive Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) on pygmy newts (Triturus pygmaeus), a species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We set up outdoor mesocosms in Doana National Park with native aquatic flora and invertebrate fauna, and containing larval newts at two experimental densities. Density of larval newts was also crossed with presence or absence of mosquitofish, either free-swimming or caged, in order to distinguish consumptive and non-consumptive effects. Increased density of coexisting larval newts did not reduce their survival, but reduced their growth and development. Newt survival and size at metamorphosis were dramatically reduced in the presence of free-swimming mosquitofish, whether at low or high fish densities. Caged mosquitofish, however, had no effect on larval newts. In laboratory trials, mosquitofish preyed more efficiently on insect larvae than did larval pygmy newts, highlighting the high competitive potential of mosquitofish. This was confirmed by the depletion of zooplankton that free fish caused in the experimental outdoor mesocosms. Our study suggests that invasive mosquitofish exert a high negative impact on coexisting newt populations. Such effects can be explained by a combination of direct predation, injuries caused by predation attempts, and intense competitive exploitation of common food resources.","[Cabrera-Guzman, Elisa; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Ave Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain; [Cabrera-Guzman, Elisa] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Cabrera-Guzman, E; Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Ave Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain.",elisa.cabrera_guzman@okstate.edu; igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014","Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in RDI [SEV-2012-0262, SO-07]; CONACYT (ConsejoNacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia deMexico)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [204202]","We thank Lola Asencio, Rosa Arribas, Pablo Burraco, Rafael Carmona, Sara Castro, Carmen Fernandez, Pilar Fernandez, Ana Herrero, Maria Leon, Raquel Lopez and Daniel Moen for help in the field or in the laboratory.

We addressed this question in a temporary-pond community where the broken-striped newt Notophthalmus viridescens doralis is known to act as a keystone predator on larval anurans. We independently manipulated the initial density of adult Notophthalmus (two or four) and the presence or absence of one adult Siren intermedia in a set of 20 artificial ponds to determine if this additional predator affected the ability of Notophthalmus to function as a keystone predator. Each pond received a diverse assemblage of larval anuran prey: a spring-breeding assemblage of 275 Rana utricularia, 100 Pseudacris crucifer and 25 Bufo americanus tadpoles, and a summer assemblage of 200 Hyla chrysoscelis and 150 Gastrophryne carolinensis tadpoles. Two additional ponds received neither predator, to assay the outcome of competition among the tadpoles. The effect of the salamander Siren on Notophthalmus survival and fecundity depended on the density of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren had no effect on survival, but at high newt density competition reduced the survival and growth rates of Notophthalmus. The density of Notophthalmus and the presence of Siren interacted to determine the fecundity of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren reduced Notophthalmus reproductive success by preying on larvae. At high newt density Siren indirectly enhanced reproductive success by reducing survival of adults, thus releasing larvae from intraspecific competition and cannibalism. Notophthalmus density had no effect on adult Siren survival or growth rate in this experiment, but other evidence indicates that competition with Notophthalmus reduces the growth rates of Siren. Notophthalmus acted as a keystone predator on the assemblage of spring-breeding anurans; it increased the number of metamorphs of the weak competitor Pseudacris crucifer by releasing them from interspecific competition. Siren preyed on tadpoles in a nonselective manner. An additive model was sufficient to describe the effects of Siren and initial density of Notophthalmus on the structure of the tadpole assemblage. In our system of experimental ponds, the strong interaction between Siren and Notophthalmus density did not extend its effects to lower trophic levels, and the direct and indirect effects of Siren did not alter the role of Notophthalmus as a keystone predator.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,,,,,,49,73,76,0,27,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1991,72,3,,,,,827,838,,10.2307/1940585,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FM084,WOS:A1991FM08400007,,,,,2021-09-27,

We examined species richness of larval amphibian communities in 37 ponds over seven years on the Univ. of Michigan's E. S. George Reserve. Ordination of the community incidence matrix indicated a strong major axis of variation in species associations that was correlated with pond hydroperiod, surface area and forest canopy cover. Communities were significantly nested with those species found in ponds with high canopy cover, small area and short hydroperiod being nested subsets of those found in ponds with contrasting characteristics. Presence of fish had strong negative effects on species richness; relaxation of this effect also was apparent when fish were extirpated from ponds by drought. We employed a model selection analysis to identify the most appropriate statistical model for predicting the long-term average species richness of these ponds from local abiotic and biotic (predator and competitor density) factors. A model including only the abiotic factors was overwhelmingly superior for the anurans; hierarchical partitioning indicated that area and canopy cover alone accounted for over 70% of the independent effects of predictor variables. The global model including both abiotic and biotic factors was the best supported model for the caudates, and correspondingly hierarchical partitioning suggested that area, hydroperiod, invertebrate predators and caudate biomass all accounted for 9-16% of the independent effects. Overall, biotic factors accounted for much less of the variation in species richness than abiotic factors. The patterns in larger, open-canopy ponds provided little evidence of competitive effects on species richness, though there were patterns consistent with competitive effects in small, closed-canopy ponds. The unusual temporal and spatial extent of these data enabled us to critically evaluate ideas regarding patterns in larval amphibian communities, and the effects of area, disturbance (hydroperiod) and productivity (canopy cover) on species richness of these communities. These results have important implications to the conservation of amphibian species richness in freshwater wetlands, which are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide.","Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Plymouth State Univ, Plymouth, NH 03264 USA","Werner, EE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",eewerner@umich.edu,"Skelly, David/D-3878-2013",,,,,58,201,212,0,119,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2007,116,10,,,,,1697,1712,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15935.x,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,210ZC,WOS:000249493100011,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

Predaceous diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) are a model group for testing these potential coexistence mechanisms because they are abundant, interact in finite habitats, and are mobile among habitats. We focused on two morphologically similar species, Laccophilus fasciatus rufus (Aube) and Laccophilus proximus (Say), to determine if mechanisms exist that help to explain patterns of their coexistence. Behavioral observations and feeding trials in the laboratory, a field experiment, and a mesocosm experiment were used to determine if habitat use, prey consumption, or dispersal rates of these two species were inherently different or changed when in the presence of intra- or interspecific competitors. We found no difference between habitat use or prey consumption between species in constant depth aquaria, and no effect of intra- or interspecifics on their behaviors. In variable depth aquaria, L. proximus occupied significantly shallower habitat when compared with L. f. rufus; in the former this difference only occurred between conspecific treatments. Field collections confirmed that L. proximus occupied shallower habitats than L. f. rufus. In field mesocosms, L. proximus displayed higher dispersal rates than L. f. rufus. These species also do not appear food limited in the field, suggesting that adult competition for food is unlikely. L. f. rufus and L. proximus exhibit different habitat use and dispersal responses, but this does not seem to be in response to intra- or interspecific competitive interactions.","[Pitcher, K.

Resource heterogeneity should maintain biodiversity by preventing competitive exclusion because different species are superior competitors in different parts of a heterogeneous environment. In natural systems, however, resource heterogeneity covaries with average resource supply rate, making the effect of heterogeneity difficult to isolate. Using a novel experimental approach, we tested the independent effects of resource heterogeneity and average supply rate on plant species diversity. We show that the average supply rate of the most limiting resource controlled species diversity, whereas heterogeneity of this resource had virtually no effect. These findings also suggest that biodiversity declines with increasing productivity because at high enough levels of productivity one resource may always be driven to sufficiently short supply to exclude many species.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Program Ecol & Evolut, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Stevens, MHH (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Bot, 316 Pearson Hall, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",HStevens@muohio.edu,"Carson, Walter/A-2569-2013",,,,,63,105,112,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

For each field, the surveys provided data on the density of a pest arthropod, the cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar), of an introduced and successfully established natural enemy, the apex-inhabiting predatory mite Typhlodromalus aripo DeLeon, and on occurrence of other predator species that inhabit the leaves and share the same prey. These other predators included one exotic species, Typhlodromalus manihoti Moraes, that is successfully established mainly in swamp areas, and two indigenous species, Euseius fustis (Pritchard and Baker) and Typhlodromalus saltus (Denmark and Matthysse), that are commonly found on cassava in Africa. Our aim was to assess the association between the density of M. tanajoa and that of T. aripo, the most successful predator in terms of establishment and abundance, and subsequently determine how this association was affected by the presence or absence of the other predator species. No obvious density-dependent relationship was found by inspecting the scattergrams of T. aripo versus M. tanajoa densities, but high T. aripo densities did not occur when M. tanajoa densities were low and -during the dry season in February-the densities of M. tanajoa steeply increased when T. aripo numbers were low. Given the establishment of T. aripo in all fields, the presence of other species of predatory mites (T. manihoti, both in swamp and non-swamp areas; T. saltus in absence-as well as presence-of T. manihoti in swamp areas; E. fustis in absence of T. manihoti in non-swamp areas) reduced the density of M. tanajoa by a factor 2-3. Thus in all these cases, the presence of an exotic or indigenous species of predatory mite in addition to T. aripo was associated with lower M. tanajoa density. The density of T. aripo was usually positively affected by the presence of other predator species except for T. saltus in presence of T. manihoti that negatively affected the density of T. aripo in swamp areas, an effect likely mediated by either intraguild predation or competition for food. Path analysis showed that indigenous phytoseiid species were more important in suppression of M. tanajoa populations in cassava fields than previously thought. We suggest that the lack of negative effects of the predator species complex is likely due to differential niche use by the various species which reduces interference among the predators. Manipulative experiments are, however, needed to provide details on the relative importance in M. tanajoa suppression by each species within this acarine predator guild.","Int Inst Trop Agr, Biol Control Ctr Africa, Cotonou, Benin; Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands","Hanna, R (corresponding author), LW Lambourn, IITA Benin, 26 Dingwall Rd, Croydan CR9 3EE, England.",r.hanna@cgiar.org,,,,,,42,17,18,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Despite much recent work incorporating competition, predation, and mutualism into species distribution models (SDMs), the focus has been confined to aboveground macroscopic interactions. Biotic interactions between plants and soil microbial communities are understudied as potentially important drivers of plant distributions. Some soil bacteria promote plant growth by cycling nutrients, while others are pathogenic; thus they have a high potential for influencing plant occurrence. We investigated the influence of soil bacterial clades on the distributions of bryophytes and 12 vascular plant species in a high elevation talus-field ecosystem in the Rocky Mountain Front Range, Colorado, USA. We used an information-theoretic criterion (AICc) modeling approach to compare SDMs with the following different sets of predictors: abiotic variables, abiotic variables and other plant abundances, abiotic variables and soil bacteria clade relative abundances, and a full model with abiotic factors, plant abundances, and bacteria relative abundances. We predicted that bacteria would influence plant distributions both positively and negatively, and that these interactions would improve prediction of plant species distributions. We found that inclusion of either plant or bacteria biotic predictors generally improved the fit, deviance explained, and predictive power of the SDMs, and for the majority of the species, adding information on both other plants and bacteria yielded the best model. Interactions between the modeled species and biotic predictors were both positive and negative, suggesting the presence of competition, parasitism, and facilitation. While our results indicate that plant-plant co-occurrences are a stronger driver of plant distributions than plant-bacteria co-occurrences, they also show that bacteria can explain parts of plant distributions that remain unexplained by abiotic and plant predictors. Our results provide further support for including biotic factors in SDMs, and suggest that belowground factors be considered as well.","[de Mesquita, Clifton P.

Non-native prey may increase native predator populations by providing an additional food source and simultaneously decrease native prey populations by outcompeting them for a limited resource. This pattern of apparent competition may be important for plants and sessile marine invertebrate suspension feeders as they often compete for space and their immobile state make them readily accessible to predators. Reported studies on apparent competition have rarely been examined in biological invasions and no study has linked seasonal patterns of native and non-native prey abundance to increasing native predator populations. Here, we evaluate the effects of non-native colonial ascidians (Diplosoma listerianum and Didemnum vexillum) on population growth of a native predator (bloodstar, Henricia sanguinolenta) and native sponges through long-term surveys of abundance, prey choice and growth experiments. We show non-native species facilitate native predator population growth by providing a novel temporal resource that prevents loss of predator biomass when its native prey species are rare. We expect that by incorporating native and non-native prey seasonal abundance patterns, ecologists will gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of non-native prey species on native predator and prey population dynamics.","[Dijkstra, Jennifer A.; Harris, Larry G.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Biol Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Lambert, Walter J.] Framingham State Univ, Dept Biol, Framingham, MA 01701 USA","Dijkstra, JA (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Ctr Coastal & Ocean Mapping, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jdijkstra@ccom.unh.edu,,,,,,32,20,21,1,84,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

We adopted a functional approach in an assessment of the relationship between three functional plant groups (grasses, broad-leaves and legumes) and the arthropod community in winter wheat fields in a Mediterranean dryland context. We sampled the arthropod community as thoroughly as possible with a combination of suction catching and flight-interception trapping. All specimens were identified to the appropriate taxonomic level (family, genus or species) and classified according to their form of feeding: chewing-herbivores, sucking-herbivores, flower-consumers, omnivores, saprovores, parasitoids or predators. We found, a richer plant community favoured a greater diversity of herbivores and, in turn, a richness of herbivores and saprovores enhanced the communities of their natural enemies, which supports the classical trophic structure hypothesis. Grass cover had a positive effect on sucking-herbivores, saprovores and their natural enemies and is probably due to grasses' ability to provide, either directly or indirectly, alternative resources or simply by offering better environmental conditions.

Despite growing evidence that early mortality of marine reef fishes can be density dependent and can involve predation, the underlying biological mechanisms have not as yet been fully explored in any system. Here we examine the causes of density-dependent juvenile mortality for two tropical damselfishes,. Dascyllus flavicaudus and D. trimaculatus. These species shelter in branching corals or anemones, and they feed on plankton above their microhabitats during the day. Field experiments confirmed that density-dependent juvenile mortality of both Dascyllus species arouse from predation and that most of the density-dependent loss could be attributed to small-bodied, resident piscivores (e.g.,. sandperch, squirrelfish) rather than larger, transient species (e.g., jacks). Over the diel cycle,. mortality was strongly density dependent during the dark when damselfish were sheltering but not during daylight when fish were actively foraging. Infrared video recordings revealed the species of predators responsible for most losses and indicated that most predatory events occurred from late twilight to early night, when damselfishes were in shelters and not feeding. Individuals were most at risk when located near or just outside the perimeter of a shelter. The proportion of a cohort in the riskiest areas of a microhabitat increased with density. The cause of the increased fraction of individuals at risk with increasing density was intraspecific interactions among sheltering fish jostling for space in the safest regions; this resulted in the displacement of less aggressive individuals to riskier locations. Thus, density-dependent mortality in both damselfishes arose from interference competition for refuge space from crepuscular and nocturnal predators.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coastal Res Ctr, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Holbrook, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,60,290,297,5,122,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2002,83,10,,,,,2855,2868,,10.2307/3072021,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,617ER,WOS:000179348800018,,,,,2021-09-27,

The monthly availability of their food resources in the field, and the monthly variation in the feeding relationships between these snakes and their preys, were also studied. Food items of 1245 snakes. i.e. 554 Grayia smythii, and 691 Afronatrix anoscopus, were examined. The mean body length of Grayia smythii was significantly larger than that of Afronatrix anoscopus in any interspecific comparison, i.e. males versus males, females versus females, and females versus males; however, in both species the females attained significantly larger body sizes than the males. 676 prey items were obtained from the stomachs of Afronatrix anoscopus, and 390 from those of Grayia smythii. Both species of snake exhibited an increased activity in the open during the wet months, and this increased activity was positively correlated to the higher abundance of prey during the wet season. In both species the diet consisted of a great variety of different amphibian and fish species. Direct interference competition was not observed. The month-by-month dietary patterns exhibited by the two snake species were similar. Mean prey size was significantly larger in the larger species, and the difference in prey size between the two snake species increased during the dry season, i.e. during the period of reduced prey availability. The monthly availability of the three main food types for these snakes varied, and were significantly more abundant during the wet season (April-September). A positive relationship between prey availability and prey use by snakes strongly suggests that the two snake species are predatory generalists, utilizing prey in relation to their abundance in the field.","FIZV Ecol, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, I-00198 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), FIZV Ecol, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,51,33,35,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4674,1469-7831,,J TROP ECOL,J.

We assessed changes in the distribution of invasive species as factors influencing the distribution of brassy minnow and other native species by comparing historical and current distributions in the lower Fraser River in British Columbia. We tested effects of physical habitat parameters on local distributions of brassy minnow and for evidence of negative interactions between brassy minnow and invasive brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus (Lesueur, 1819)). Comparison of contemporary and historical (1956 and 1959) fish distributions indicated significant declines in native cypriniform (minnows and suckers) species, including brassy minnow, but no change in the number of invasive species, although there was some faunal turnover. Logistic regression suggested that conductivity, turbidity, and water temperature were important predictors of brassy minnow presence. Appearances of adult-sized brown bullhead at one site corresponded with reduced abundance of native fishes. In growth experiments with brassy minnow, brown bullhead, and redside shiner (Richardsonius balteatus (Richardson, 1836)), brassy minnow exhibited mass loss and mortalities, suggesting that they were poor competitors. Our results contribute to a better understanding of abiotic and biotic factors affecting distribution and persistence of brassy minnow.","[Nowosad, Damon M.; Taylor, Eric B.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Nowosad, Damon M.; Taylor, Eric B.] Univ British Columbia, Beaty Biodivers Museum, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Nowosad, DM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Biodivers Res Ctr, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",nowosad@zoology.ubc.ca,,,Peace-Williston Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (PWFWCP); British Columbia Conservation Foundation (BCCF); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We thank B.

We explored these aspects for a coral reef system in Moorea, French Polynesia, involving intraguild predation where the shared damselfish prey (juvenile yellowtail dascyllus Dascyllus flavicaudus) and two species of intraguild (IG) prey (the ambush predators arc-eye hawkfish Paracirrhites arcatus and red-spotted coral crab Trapezia rufopunctata) shelter together in branching Pocilloporid corals for protection from mobile IG predators. Field experiments revealed that both IG prey had strong adverse effects on survivorship of juvenile damselfish, but that the dominant underlying process was competition for enemy-free space and not direct consumption. In this case, the combined effect of hawkfish and crabs did not result in either risk enhancement or risk reduction for the damselfish. Similarly, the combined influence of IG predators and IG prey on the shared prey also was indistinguishable from that expected from their independent effects. Habitat structure weakened the IG-prey-IG-predator interaction; IG prey were much stronger space competitors with damselfish than resource competitors with IG predators. As a consequence, there was not a trophic cascade where damselfish benefited by the adverse effect of IG predators on hawkfish or coral crabs. These results highlight the manner by which habitat structure can mediate species interactions and emphasize the need to understand the underlying mechanisms.","[Schmitt, Russell J.; Holbrook, Sally J.; Lape, Jennifer C.

Habitat segregation seems to be the major factor contributing to the coexistence of these two species: I. baltica is the dominant species among surface drift weed, whereas I. emarginata occurs mainly on the sea bed among accumulations of broken decaying algae. In laboratory cultures with food in excess, there is intense intra- and interspecific competition through direct interference. Single species cultures of both species thrive and rapidly attain an equilibrium population size which is about four times greater in I. emarginata than in I. baltica. In mixed-species cultures, I. baltica lacks a 'realized niche'; independent of starting densities, I. baltica is competitively excluded by I. emarginata within a short period of time. The crucial behavioural mechanism of interference is cannibalism (intraspecific competition) and mutual predation (interspecific competition). Both intra- and interspecific interference occur mainly through density-dependent control of juvenile mortality by cannibalistic /predatory adults. Experiments on the relative strengths of intra- and interspecific interference revealed strong asymmetries in competitive relationships: Intraspecific inhibitory effects in I. baltica are much greater than in I. emarginata; I. emarginata exerts much more inhibition on I. baltica than on itself, whereas I. baltica exerts much more inhibition on itself than on its congener I. emarginata. These asymmetries account for a complete competitive dominance of I. emarginata over I. baltica, and (according to the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition) inevitably result in competitive exclusion of I. baltica by I. emarginata. All types of asymmetry are due to the fact that juveniles of I. emarginata are much better protected from being cannibalized and preyed upon by conspecifics and heterospecifics, respectively, than juveniles of I. baltica. This protection is probably based on an active chemical defense mechanism that becomes ineffective immediately after death. The possibility is discussed that current interference competition is an important factor in maintaining habitat segregation in I. baltica and I. emarginata in the field. Extrapolation of the laboratory results to the field suggests an essentially unidirectional effect, with I. emarginata itself being largely unaffected by I. baltica but competitively excluding the latter from zones of potential overlap.

A more subtle and not recognized effect of invaders on their recipient biota is their potential interference with native parasite-host interactions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that two invasive molluscan filter-feeders of European coastal waters interfere with the transmission of free-living infective trematode larval stages and hereby mitigate the parasite burden of native mussels (Mytilus edulis). In laboratory mesocosm experiments, the presence of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and American slipper limpets (Crepidula fornicata) reduced the parasite load in mussels by 65-77% and 89% in single and mixed species treatments, respectively. Both introduced species acted as decoys for the trematodes thus reducing the risk of hosts to become infected. This dilution effect was density-dependent with higher reductions at higher invader densities. Similar effects in a field experiment with artificial oyster beds suggest the observed dilution effect to be relevant in the field. As parasite infections have detrimental effects on the mussel hosts, the presence of the two invaders may elicit a beneficial effect on mussels. Our experiments indicate that introduced species alter native parasite-hosts systems thus extending the potential impacts of invaders beyond the usually perceived mechanisms.","[Thieltges, David W.; Jensen, K.

However, their relevance for mosquito control under field situations remains widely unclear because important information about habitat preferences and time of occurrence of crustaceans and mosquito larvae are still missing. In order to fill this knowledge gap, a field study was undertaken in different wetland areas of Saxony, Germany, in different habitats (i.e., grassland, forest, and reed-covered wetlands). We found negative interactions between larvae of Ae. vexans and predatory Cyclopoida (Crustacean: Copepoda), which both were dominant during the first two weeks of hydroperiod, at ponds located at grassland habitats. Larvae of Cx. pipiens were spatially associated with competing Cladocera, but they colonized ponds more rapidly. Populations of Cladocera established from the third week of hydroperiod and prevented Cx. pipiens colonization thereafter. Ostracoda were highly abundant during the whole hydroperiod, but their presence was restricted to habitats of reed-covered wetland at one geographical area. Mosquito larvae hardly occurred at those ponds. In general, we found that ponds at the reed-covered wetlands provided better conditions for the initial development of crustaceans and hence, mosquito larval colonization was strongly inhibited. Grassland habitat, in contrast, favored early development of mosquito larvae. This study showed that micro-crustaceans are relevant for mosquito management but their impact on mosquito larvae varies between species and depends on environmental conditions.","[Kroeger, Iris; Liess, Matthias; Duquesne, Sabine] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Kroeger, Iris] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany; [Duquesne, Sabine] Fed Environm Agcy, UBA, Sect Plant Protect Prod, D-06844 Dessau Rosslau, Germany","Liess, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",matthias.liess@ufz.de,"Liess, Matthias/A-8582-2009","Liess, Matthias/0000-0002-3321-8909",Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE),This work was kindly supported by the Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through the Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE).,,35,9,9,0,18,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,CORONA,"1966 COMPTON AVE, CORONA, CA 92881 USA",,1948-7134,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

Mosquitoes colonizing the ponds were predominantly species of the genus Culex. In 2000, most of the dytiscids colonizing the ponds were small (Hydroporus spp.), and these predators had no impact on the size of larval mosquito populations, not even in ponds with added dytiscids. In 2001, larger beetles (Ilybius, Rhantus, and Agabus spp.) were more common, and there were significantly fewer mosquito larvae in ponds with the highest numbers of dytiscids. There was a negative correlation between numbers of diving beetles in the ponds and the mean body length of mosquito larvae. In neither year could dytiscid densities be maintained above a certain level owing to emigration. In laboratory tests, there were marked differences between three common dytiscid species in regard to preferences for Daphnia and Culex species as prey: Colymbetes paykulli Erichson chose mosquito larvae more often, whereas both Ilybius ater (De Geer) and I. fuliginosus (Fabricius) preferred Daphnia spp. All of the tested dytiscids consumed large numbers of prey. Since some dytiscid species can efficiently decrease populations of mosquito larvae, they are probably important in the natural control of these dipterans.","Linkoping Univ, Dept Biol, IFM, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden","Lundkvist, E (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Biol, IFM, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",,,,,,,34,59,67,2,34,C A B I PUBLISHING,WALLINGFORD,"C/O PUBLISHING DIVISION, WALLINGFORD OX10 8DE, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4853,,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

Increasing the numbers of P. tenuis and D. polychroa prior to the reproductive season in spring resulted in a significant decrease in the numbers and body size of G. complanata and H. stagnalis compared with control populations in the summer months, and vice versa. However, increases and decreases were temporary with a readjustment of numbers and body size to control levels in the autumn after reproduction had ceased. It is suggested that increasing the numbers of either group elevated the severity of both intra- and interspecific competition for food. The ''condition'' of prey may, in part, determine the strength of competition, and this was examined in laboratory experiments in which different densities and ratios of P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were offered either live of recently crushed Asellus aquaticus. In monospecific controls, growth rates of P. tenuis were greater when fed on crushed than live Asellus, but there was no significant difference in the growth of H. stagnalis fed either live or crushed prey. In mixed cultures of predators, P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were the superior competitors when fed on crushed and live Asellus, respectively. However, when competitive pressure was low, at low densities of predators, the presence of H. stagnalis in mixed cultures fed on live prey was beneficial to the growth of P. tenuis. These results are explained in terms of the greater ability of triclads to detect damaged prey, leaking body fluids, due to their sophisticated chemosensory system, and the ability of leeches to capture live prey due to the presence of suckers. It is concluded that co-existence of the two groups in British lakes is assisted by the partitioning of food on a live or damaged basis.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,21,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1996,106,4,,,,,544,550,,10.1007/BF00329714,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UT331,WOS:A1996UT33100019,28307456,,,,2021-09-27,

I quantified the effects of predation and competition on the growth and survival of two temperate reef fishes, Lythrypnus dalli and Coryphopterus nicholsii, in field experiments in which I manipulated the densities of the two species and the abundance of predators (using exclosure cages) on small replicate patch reefs. I also evaluated the influence of predators on the behavior of the two species to help interpret the mechanisms of any predatory influences on growth or survival. Predation was much more important than competition (inter- or intraspecific) in Lythrypnus. For Corphopterus, neither competition nor predation were particularly important. Behaviorally, both species responded to predators by reducing foraging rate and hiding. This altered behavior, however, had no repercussions for growth or survival of Coryphopterus!. In contrast, Lrthrypnus grew more slowly and suffered greater mortality when exposed to predators. Interspecific competition did not significantly influence either species. Intraspecific competition did not affect the growth of Coryphopterus, but survival tended to be lower at high densities. Growth of Lythrpnus was depressed by intraspecific competition, but survival was not, except that, in the presence of predators, survival was density dependent. In contrast to the historical emphasis placed on the role of competition, this study indicates that predation can be more important than competition in determining patterns of abundance of some reef fishes. For example, predators not influenced foraging of both Lythrpnus and Coryphopterus us, but they also reduced growth and survival of Lythrpnus and therefore appear to help maintain the marked habitat segregation between the two species. only.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Biol Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Steele, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol, 621 Circle Dr S,Box 951606, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",masteele@ucla.edu,,"Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917",,,,51,39,40,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,222,232,,10.1007/s004420050511,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700028,28308456,,,,2021-09-27,

Because protectors may compete for access to mutualists, concordance between competitive ability and degree of benefit will determine the overall strength of multi-species mutualisms. We compared the abilities of two similarly sized congener ants as competitors for, and mutualists of pine-feeding aphids, and how insectivorous birds affected each ant-aphid mutualism. Formica planipilis and F. podzolica were indistinguishable in forager abundance, but the former was 13-fold more abundant at competition baits and provided 11-fold more benefits to aphids. These results highlight how, in a single environment, a great ecological distance can exist between two congener ants of similar size. Insectivorous birds disrupted the two mutualisms to a similar extent, reducing aphid and ant abundance by 91% and 39% respectively. Nevertheless, birds had an important influence on the relative benefits of the two ants to aphids: where F. planipilis consistently benefited aphids, F. podzolica only did so in the absence of birds. Consequently, the presence of insectivorous birds and ant species identity jointly determined whether ant-aphid mutualisms occurred in pine canopies and the strength of such interactions. Our study highlights the inter-relatedness of competition, predation and mutualism, and how competition can serve to strengthen mutualism by filtering inferior mutualists.","[Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Mandal, Kunal] Colorado Coll, Dept Biol, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA","Mooney, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mooneyk@uci.edu,,,School of Biological Sciences at the Univ. of California at Irvine (Mooney); Howard Hughes Medical Foundation (Mandal),This work was supported by funds from the School of Biological Sciences at the Univ. of California at Irvine (Mooney) and the Howard Hughes Medical Foundation (Mandal).

The identification and characterization of the insect predator community has informed integrated pest management strategies by providing insight on predators that can suppress soybean aphid populations. Hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) are known predators of A. glycines, but more information is needed on their diversity, abundance, and performance to evaluate their importance as biological control agents of A. glycines. In this study, syrphid abundance was evaluated across two growing seasons in four soybean fields in east-central Minnesota. Six methods were used to quantify syrphid abundance at the larval, pupal, and adult life stages; describe species composition and richness for adults; and directly compare larval abundance to aphid abundance. The syrphid community comprised eight species, dominated by Toxomerus marginatus (Say) and Toxomerus geminatus (Say). Syrphid abundance was relatively low in soybean fields. Feeding trials were conducted to compare the performance of the most common syrphid (T. marginatus) on a diet of A. glycines with two native aphids, Aphis nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe and Aphis monardae Oestlund. Despite their low abundance in soybeans, T. marginatus larvae perform well on A. glycines, A. nerii, and A. monardae in laboratory feeding trials, implying that factors other than host suitability are limiting their potential to exert biological control on soybean aphids.","[Eckberg, James O.; Johnson, Gregg A.; Wyse, Donald L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Agron & Plant Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Peterson, Julie A.; Kaser, Joe M.; Luhman, John C.; Heimpel, George E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Borsh, Colin P.] Carleton Coll, Dept Biol, Northfield, MN 55057 USA","Eckberg, JO (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Agron & Plant Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",jeckberg@umn.edu,,"Peterson, Julie/0000-0001-6487-3714",National Science Foundation-Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (NSF IGERT)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0653827]; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-67009-30027],"We are grateful to Briee Mercer, Chris Rezac, Wally Rich, Jay Schwartz, Danielle Spengler, Amanda Stephens, and Anh Tran for their assistance with field collections; Marissa Bendickson, Karen Blaedow, David Rittenhouse, and Jacob Vander Yacht for quantifying arthropods on yellow sticky traps; and Nicholas Heimpel and Matt Kaiser for help and advice on the laboratory performance test.

The results of competition between the two species were asymmetrical. A. hendersoni larvae competed better against conspecifics than they did against A. triseriatus larvae. The reverse was true for A. triseriatus. Infection with Ascogregarina barretti (Vavra), a natural protozoan parasite of A. triseriatus, negatively affected development of A. hendersoni but had no effect on the natural host. Infected A. hendersoni larvae were more likely than uninfected larvae to compete poorly against A. triseriatus. Mortality of infected A. hendersoni was significantly higher than that of their uninfected counterparts, but infected survivors were not released from the effects of competition. Predation by fourth instar Anopheles barberi Coquillett was equal on prey larvae of both Aedes species. Surviving larvae were released from competition.

Temporary ponds are excellent arenas for the study of food webs because they are discrete communities that can be mimicked in containers that approach the realism of natural habitats. Artificial ponds permit repeatable initial conditions and sufficient replication of independent experimental units in complex experiments to test hypotheses about the control of structure and function in natural communities. I used a combination of observations of natural ponds, ''experimental natural history'' of artificial ponds in my study area, and controlled experiments in an array of 144 replicate ponds to develop, then test, hypotheses about how the structures of food webs are regulated. Understanding food webs begins with population biology. Amphibians use the aquatic larval stage of their biphasic life cycle to exploit ephemeral opportunities for growth and development in temporary ponds. The regulation of population density and the fitness of individuals are determined by complex interactions among competition, predation, and uncertainty in the length of the time ponds retain water. Exponential models of density-dependent recruitment relate the number of metamorphs to the input of eggs into ponds without predators. Extensions of these models include interspecific competition and predation. The addition of predation to these systems has three effects. (1) Predators can reduce, even eliminate, prey. There are species-specific differences among co-occurring prey in their risks of predation, and these risks change with relative body sizes of predator and prey. (2) individuals may evoke an inducible defense that reduces their risk by either decreasing active foraging or developing morphological adaptations, such as changes in the coloration and shape of tails. These defenses may entail costs in body size and timing of metamorphosis. (3) Finally, mortality due to predators may reduce competition, thereby benefiting the population of the prey by permitting individuals that escape predation to grow rapidly enough to escape drying ponds. The order of arrival of species at breeding ponds has an impact on their own success as well as having a lasting impact on the success of species that arrive later. Such priority effects may result from size-specific changes in trophic connections or indirect effects between species mediated through the food web. Anurans can have strong effects on the partitioning of the flow of nutrients through the phytoplankton vs. the periphyton. This effect on partitioning of production can then have strong effects on zooplankton and insects. Salamanders can play the role of keystone, or critical, predators by affecting the structure of the assemblages of zooplankton and anurans that determine much of the dynamics of nutrient flows within food webs in temporary ponds.","UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT BIOL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA","Wilbur, HM (corresponding author), UNIV VIRGINIA, MT LAKE BIOL STN, GILMER HALL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA.",,,,,,,172,332,344,7,179,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1997,78,8,,,,,2279,2302,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2279:EEOFWC]2.0.CO;2,,,24,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YK726,WOS:A1997YK72600001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Juvenile Silver Carp can and do occur in great numbers after a successful spawn. These massive schools of small Silver Carp seem to be an obvious prey source for the common predators of the Mississippi River system. The level to which native piscivores are consuming this novel prey item is unclear. Therefore, the goal of this research was to assess the diets of native piscivores collected in Pool 26 and the Open River reach of the Mississippi River. Using diet contents and catch rates of small fishes, selection or avoidance could be determined for predator prey interactions. Then a controlled laboratory experiment was conducted to determine if common predators [White Bass Morone chrysops and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802)] would select for or against this novel prey in the presence of two native prey fish [Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum (Lesueur, 1818) and Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides]. Understanding how predator-prey interactions occur in a controlled laboratory experiment may provide insight to trends observed in the field. The majority of native piscivores appeared to be avoiding Silver Carp in both reaches and selecting native prey fishes. The order in which prey fish were consumed by both predators showed significant avoidance of Silver Carp. It appears that the trends observed in the field were supported by our controlled laboratory experiment. The effectiveness of different native piscivores to consume Silver Carp may have impacts on future management decisions.","[Wolf, Michael C.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Fish & Wildlife Div, 20596 Hwy 7, Hutchinson, MN 55350 USA; [Phelps, Quinton E.] West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, 322 Percival Hall, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Wolf, MC (corresponding author), Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Fish & Wildlife Div, 20596 Hwy 7, Hutchinson, MN 55350 USA.",Michael.wolf@state.mn.us,,,"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program, Long Term Resource Monitoring (LTRM) element","This study was funded as part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program, Long Term Resource Monitoring (LTRM) element.",,18,6,6,2,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

What is known of the diet breadth, habitat preferences, and thermal thresholds for development of these two species indicates considerable niche overlap. The larger H. axyridis has many intrinsic advantages over C. sanguinea, including higher fecundity and fertility, and a lower rate of larval cannibalism. In laboratory tests, adults and larvae of H. axyridis consumed eggs of C. sanguinea more readily than vice versa. All H. axyridis adults provided with either a conspecific or a heterospecific second-instar larva killed and ate it, whereas only 15% of C. sanguinea adults consumed a second-instar larva of H. axyridis over a 24-h period. Larvae of H. axyridis were more aggressive against larvae of C. sanguinea in laboratory tests than vice versa; even when H. axyridis larvae were paired with a C. sanguinea larva 2d older and two to three times as large,they won 67% of contests. In choice tests, larvae of both species preferred to feed on dead C. sanguinea larvae than on dead H. axyridis larvae. Larvae of H. axyridis were capable of completing development exclusively as intraguild predators on C. sanguinea larvae, whereas the reverse was not true. The data suggest that H. axyridis is a highly evolved interspecific competitor, whereas C. sanguinea is adapted more to intraspecific competition and has few defenses against H. axyridis. Competitive displacement of C. sanguinea by H. axyridis appears to be in progress in the citrus ecosystem in Florida.","Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA","Michaud, JP (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Inst Food & Agr Sci, 700 Expt Stn Rd, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",jpmi@lal.ufl.edu,,,,,,45,181,192,2,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

In some cases, ecological interactions among native and invasive species are spatially structured, and spatial segregation can be a key coexistence mechanism for ecologically similar taxa. We evaluated 19-years of spatially explicit crayfish community data from a long-term whole-lake experiment, which includes 8 years of invasive rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus) removal followed by 11 years of post-removal data collection. We quantified the within lake spatiotemporal patterns of virile crayfish (F. virilis) and rusty crayfish, and relate their dynamics to site-level habitat conditions. In response to removal efforts, rusty crayfish catch rates declined by >95%, and native virile crayfish catch rates increased by more than 20-fold. Ten years after ceasing removals, rusty crayfish have stayed at this relatively low abundance, and the virile crayfish population has remained stable. During removal, rusty crayfish abundances decreased non-uniformly throughout the lake. Only after rusty crayfish populations were at their lowest levels did the native virile crayfish population begin to show signs of a recovery. Virile crayfish recovery was highly localized within the lake, and likely influenced by habitat and rusty crayfish abundance. Initially, virile crayfish made the most substantial resurgence in an area of the lake with rocky habitat conditions, but through time their distribution shifted into adjacent suboptimal macrophyte and muck habitats as rusty crayfish became more abundant in nearby areas. In general, when the two species overlapped in space, virile crayfish abundance stayed low, or the population shifted to adjacent areas with fewer competitively dominant rusty crayfish. Our results suggest that habitat heterogeneity allowed virile crayfish to maintain a foothold despite high rusty crayfish densities. Removal efforts led to the recovery of virile crayfish, and spatial segregation facilitated both species coexisting at comparable abundances for a decade. Our results highlight that invasive species control, even in the absence of complete eradication, can benefit native species and that spatially structured interactions can promote coexistence.","[Perales, K.

Here, we combined wetland surveys with a mesocosm experiment to examine the individual and combined effects of nonnative fish predators and nonnative bullfrogs on aquatic communities. Among 139 wetlands, nonnative fish (bass, sunfish, and mosquitofish) negatively influenced the probability of occupancy of Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), but neither invader correlated strongly with occupancy by California newts (Taricha torosa), western toads (Anaxyrus boreas), or California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii). In mesocosms, mosquitofish dramatically reduced the abundance of zooplankton and palatable amphibian larvae (P. regilla and T. torosa), leading to increases in nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton (through loss of zooplankton), and rapid growth of unpalatable toad larvae (through competitive release). Bullfrog larvae reduced the growth of native anurans but had no effect on survival. Despite strong effects on natives, invaders did not negatively influence one another, and their combined effects were additive. Our results highlight how the net effects of multiple nonnative species depend on the trophic level of each invader, the form and magnitude of invader interactions, and the traits of native community members.","[Preston, Daniel L.; Johnson, Pieter T.

Here I report results of a pond mesocosm experiment where consumer (snail) species richness, predation intensity, and nutrient availability were crossed in a full-factorial design. This design allowed a direct comparison of the strength of the different factors on food web properties and ecosystem functioning (i.e., system-level fluxes of energy or matter), and an evaluation of how the factors may interact. Systems with higher snail species richness had greater secondary production, consumer biomass, ecosystem respiration, and macrophyte stern growth, and lower epiphyton and periphyton biomass. However, snail species richness effects on periphyton and epiphyton were context dependent; predators reduced the effect of increasing snail richness on the biomass of attached algae. Species richness effects were most often the result of a biological mechanism (e.g., differential resource use), rather than being solely artifacts of the experimental design (e g., sampling effects). The effects of nutrient enrichment and predation were mostly predictable from simple food chain models; increases in nutrient availability led to increased algal biomass, primary production, and snail biomass, while predators decreased snail biomass and indirectly augmented algae. Snail species richness effects on the biomass of many functional groups were as strong or stronger than those of a substantial nutrient enrichment or of the addition of a voracious predator (Belostoma flumineum). Nutrient enrichment had the most pronounced effects on several system-level processes (e.g., primary production, sedimentation). Species richness had weaker effects on ecosystem properties than on particular functional groups, probably because of compensatory responses among different producer functional groups. In summary, this experiment suggests that the number of consumer species in a system can have large and meaningful effects on the distribution of biomass in a food web, and that these effects can depend on ecological context.","Michigan State Univ, Wk Kellogg Biol Stn, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Wojdak, JM (corresponding author), Radford Univ, Dept Biol, POB 6931, Radford, VA 24142 USA.",jmwojdak@radford.edu,,,,,,64,43,44,2,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

As predators can influence habitat use in rodents, Pearl Island was selected because no mammalian predators of rodents are present. Rats were trapped in two other habitats to clarify rat distribution on the island and to obtain samples for stable isotope investigation of food partitioning within habitats. The experimental removal of ship rats failed, as Pacific rats were found to share forest and shrubland with ship rats. This result contrasted with the restricted distribution of Pacific rats on Stewart Island. Ship rats were ubiquitous, and appear to have been the dominant species in podocarp-broadleaf forest oil Pearl Island. The largest species, the Norway rat, was trapped only oil the foreshore of Pearl Island, but on Stewart Island it is more widespread. Ship rats and Norway rats were partitioning the coastal habitat by exploiting different food sources. Stable isotopic ratios (delta N-15 and delta C-13) in muscle samples from Norway rats revealed a strong marine signature, Suggesting intensive foraging in the intertidal zone. Ship rats trapped in the same habitat exhibited mixed terrestrial and marine sources in their diet. There was little obvious partitioning between ship rats and Pacific rats in forest, except a possible delay in breeding in Pacific rats relative to ship rats. Whether Norway rats select the intertidal zone to forage, or were excluded from forest by ship rats is unknown, but competitive exclusion is likely. Estimated densities of rats were low (2.1 - 5.1 rats ha(-1) in forest, 1.42 rats ha(-1) in shrubland) and similar to other New Zealand sites with low soil fertility. Further research will be required to elucidate the roles of food quality, habitat structure and predation in facilitating habitat selection in these species.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Harper, GA (corresponding author), Dept Conservat, POB 743, Invercargill, New Zealand.",gharper@doc.govt.nz,,,,,,68,25,26,0,24,NEW ZEALAND ECOL SOC,CHRISTCHURCH,"PO BOX 25178, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND",0110-6465,,,NEW ZEAL J ECOL,N.

Although interspecific competition is based on two mechanisms, exploitation of resources and physical interference, trade-off studies largely consider only species' ability to exploit resources. Using a mesocosm experiment, we examined the trade-off between interference competition ability and susceptibility to predation in larvae of two newt species, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris. In the presence of heterospecifics, L.vulgaris larvae slowed somatic growth and developmental rates, and experienced a higher frequency of injuries than in conspecific environments which suggests asymmetrical interspecific interference. During short-term predation trials, L.vulgaris larvae suffered higher mortality than I.alpestris. Larvae of the smaller species, L.vulgaris, had both lower interference and antipredator performance than the larger I.alpestris, which suggests a lack of trade-off between interference competition ability and predator susceptibility. We conclude that interference competition may produce a positive rather than negative relationship with predation susceptibility, which may contribute to the elimination of subordinate species from common habitats.","[Hlouskova, Monika; Krsakova, Veronika] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Brno, Czech Republic; [Balogova, Monika] Safarik Univ, Fac Sci, Inst Biol & Ecol, Kosice, Slovakia; [Gvozdik, Lumir] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno, Czech Republic","Gvozdik, L (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno, Czech Republic.",gvozdik@brno.cas.cz,"Gvozdik, Lumir/G-1178-2014","Gvozdik, Lumir/0000-0002-6495-2233","Grantova Agentura Ceske RepublikyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-07140S, 17-15480S]","Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky, Grant/ Award Number: 15-07140S and 17-15480S",,80,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

During the 1980s ruffe became well established and expanded its range throughout the loch and through the slow-flowing influent and effluent tributaries, only being excluded from tributaries with high flow rates. Recoveries of fish entrained at a pumping station, abstracting water for domestic supply, provide a measure of the rate of population expansion between 1982 and 1996 and the current status of ruffe in Loch Lomond Between 1982 and 1992 the ruffe population grew exponentially. Since 1992 the population appears to have stabilized to some extent but at a very high level. Gill netting surveys conducted throughout Loch Lomond have shown that the high abundance of ruffe recorded at this site is representative of a large population throughout the loch. The diet of ruffe feeding in Loch Lomond differed both spatially and seasonally. Although prey choice was diverse, it was primarily composed of benthic macro-invertebrates, but at times included underyearling fish (including ruffe) and eggs of other fish species. The most important of these is the powan (Coregonus lavaretus), a broadcast spawner of national conservation value. To examine the possibility of dietary overlap with perch (Perca fluviatilis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), the diets of these three species were compared. The data showed very little evidence of overlap in diet, suggesting that feeding resource competition between ruffe and trout and ruffe and perch does not occur between adults of these species. Evidence for the disruption of predator-prey relations by introduced ruffe is reviewed. Ruffe are now the primary prey species for cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo), herons (Ardea cinerea), and northern pike (Esox lucius) feeding in Loch Lomond. Calculations based on predator population sizes and consumption rates suggest that potentially up to 17 metric tons of ruffe, representing over 2 million individuals, may be being consumed annually by these predator species. The effects on native fish of this shift in diet in these predator species is discussed, as is the ability of ecologists to predict the impact of invasions of new species in aquatic communities.","Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Fish Biol Grp, Univ Field Stn, Glasgow G63 0AW, Lanark, Scotland; Fish Conservat Ctr, Edinburgh EH41 4NR, Midlothian, Scotland","Adams, CE (corresponding author), Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Fish Biol Grp, Univ Field Stn, Glasgow G63 0AW, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,45,32,35,0,32,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2200 BONISTEEL BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109-2099 USA",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

However, few studies have quantified how water flow affects the feeding success of such organisms under field conditions and whether the results of short-term feeding assays can predict longer-terrn patterns of growth and reproduction. I examined the influence of natural variation in current speed on the feeding success, colony growth rate and population abundance of an encrusting bryozoan Menibranipora serrilamella using transplant experiments at nearshore reefs along the coast of Santa Barbara, California, USA. Feeding Success was highest at intermediate ambient flow speeds (10 to 12 cm s(-1)) and lowest at low (0 to 5 cm s(-1)) and fast (> 20 cm s(-1)) speeds. Growth rates varied such that the greatest increases in bryozoan colony size occurred at reefs where average temperatures were the coolest and current speeds were intermediate. A test of the hypothesis that high feeding success translates into faster growth rates revealed that colonies with the highest predicted consumption grew the most. Further, spatial variation in M. serrilamella abundance mirrored that of colony growth, as percent cover of the bryozoan was highest at reefs where ambient current speeds were intermediate. These nonlinear functional relationships likely result from reductions in food delivery at low flows and deformation of feeding structures at high flows. The consequences of dynamic flow conditions for both short-term and integrated measures of performance suggest that flow-mediated food acquisition plays an important role in determining the distribution, abundance and morphology of encrusting bryozoans and other sessile, suspension-feeding invertebrates.","[Arkema, Katie K.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Arkema, KK (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",karkema@stanford.edu,,,"National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research Program [OCE-9982105, OCE-0620276]; University of California Marine Council's Coastal Environmental Quality Initiative; UC Santa Barbara Shoreline Preservation Fund","I am grateful to numerous dive buddies who shared the adventures of field work with me, but especially to A, Craig, L.

It is spreading in south-west Iberia where it is the dominant corixid in pennanent, saline wetlands, where it may have excluded halotolerant native corixid species. In the Donana wetland complex in south-west Spain, it is abundant in temporary, brackish ponds but almost absent from temporary fresh ponds where the native S. lateralis is the dominant corixid. We conducted an outdoor experiment to test whether the alien is intolerant of low salinities, or if it can be competitively excluded by the native species S. lateralis. We established single species tanks for each species in semi-natural conditions, as well as mixed species tanks and controls lacking corixids. Trichocorixa verticalis was able to complete its life-cycle at a low salinity of 2 g/l. Compared to S. lateralis, it showed higher daily adult mortality and nymph production, but a shorter generation time. When mixed together, both species had lower adult mortality than in the alone treatment, suggesting they can coexist. Adult abundance at the end of the experiment was highest for T verticalis, which performed better in mixed tanks whereas S. lateralis performed better alone. These results confirm that T. verticalis can tolerate freshwaters and suggest that its rarity in these ponds in nature is due to other ecological factors such as dispersal limitation, poor adaptation to fluctuating water levels, or the effects of ectoparasitic water mites known to prefer the alien as a host.","[Carbonell, Jose Antonio; Cespedes, Vanessa; Green, Andy J.] EBD CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Coccia, Cristina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile; [Coccia, Cristina] Univ Santo Tomas, Santiago, Chile","Carbonell, JA (corresponding author), EBD CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.",jcarbonell@ebd.csic.es; ecovanekimi@gmail.com; crcoccia@uc.cl; ajgreen@ebd.csic.es,"Cespedes, Vanessa/AAF-6316-2019; Green, Andy J/A-5189-2008","Cespedes, Vanessa/0000-0002-9399-8791; Green, Andy J/0000-0002-1268-4951","Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa, Junta de Andalucia project [P10-RNM-6262]; Programa Estatal de Promocion del Talento y su Empleabilidad en I+D+I -Juan de la Cierva-Formacion programme postdoc contract from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO) [FJCI2017-31709]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN)Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [SVP-2013-067595]; Conicyt/Fondecyt Iniciation grant [11180668]","This research was supported by the Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa, Junta de Andalucia project (P10-RNM-6262) to AJG, a Programa Estatal de Promocion del Talento y su Empleabilidad en I+D+I -Juan de la Cierva-Formacion programme postdoc contract (FJCI2017-31709) from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO) to JAC, a Severo Ochoa predoctoral contract (SVP-2013-067595) from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN) to VC, and a Conicyt/Fondecyt Iniciation grant (11180668) to CC.",,39,3,3,0,0,REGIONAL EURO-ASIAN BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS CENTRE-REABIC,HELSINKI,"PL 3, HELSINKI, 00981, FINLAND",1798-6540,1818-5487,,AQUAT INVASIONS,Aquat.

Spatial expansion and demographic growth of large populations of Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus during the last decade in French freshwaters raise the problem of relationships with fish populations, especially with carnivorous species as pike (Esox lucius), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and sander (Stizostedion lucioperca). Interactions between these species have been studied in experimental conditions with mesocosms, enclosures in pond and small ponds. In mesocosm pikes of 16 to 46 cm length eat Procambarus throughout the year. Maximum size of ingested crayfish is correlated to pike size. Pikes from 40 to 50 cm length can swallow crayfish adults above 8 cm. Crayfish consumption is regular even if forage fish are present and if each pike can differ in its choice intensity. The level of predation is correlated to temperature, but catches by pike endure along the winter. In pond enclosures pike youngs of the year (YOY) eat successfully crayfish youngs of the year during the first summer while they have a similar growth. Protection by shelters is inefficient, it's the same in presence of forage fish. Comparative approach in natural ponds gives the same result, even with the presence of macrophytes as refuges. Confrontation between pike and Pacifastacus summerlings directly in a pond induces same results, pike reduces the most part of crayfish population. In all cases the few surviving crayfish give a reduced growth and possibly a delayed sexual maturity. Association of perch YOY and Pacifastacus YOY did not affect survival rate of crayfish at the end of the first summer owing to mouth gape too small in perch. But perch summerlings reduce crayfish YOY density, except when the latters are protected by a net. In this case crayfish growth is reduced only by the vision of perch. Occurrence of sander summerlings did not affect the survival rate of Pacifastacus YOY. Occurrence of two years old sander reduce both the survival and growth of crayfish. In conclusion, observations show the pike as the most performant predator independantly of its size, while the predation effectiveness in perch and sander require a sufficient difference in size between fish and crayfish. These results allow to suppose that carnivrous fishes can reduce alien crayfish wild stocks. However the study of a Procambarus population during three years in a pond with numerous predators (pike, perch) shows a population stability over the time. Despite a pike estimated annual consumption above summer biomass of crayfish adults and a removal of the same biomass by summer trapping. Procambarus stock stability must be correlated to the high productivity and to a fast biomass turnover as it is a species with a short life span.","ENSAR, INRA, UMR Ecobiol & Qual Hydrosyst Continentaux, F-35042 Rennes, France","Neveu, A (corresponding author), ENSAR, INRA, UMR Ecobiol & Qual Hydrosyst Continentaux, 65 Rue St Brieuc,CS 84125, F-35042 Rennes, France.",,,,,,,33,9,10,2,22,CONSEIL SUPERIEUR DE LA PECHE,FONTENAY-SOUS-BIOS,"IMMEUBLE PERICENTRE, 16, AVENUE LOUISON BOBET, 94132 FONTENAY-SOUS-BIOS, FRANCE",0767-2861,,,B FR PECHE PISCIC,Bull.

When both species were analysed together, and for D. longispina alone, there were weak negative relationships between mean population density and population variability. Interspecific competition resulted in lower population densities and higher population variability. Extinct populations had lower densities and were also more variable than persisting ones. There was still an effect of population variability on extinction probability after the effect of density on population variability had been accounted for. Hence, the effects of population density and variability on population persistence were partly independent of each other. The effects of size-selective predation on population persistence were more species-specific and not directly related to density or variability. Since the effects of species interactions on persistence were large, we suggest that it is likely that population vulnerability analyses not incorporating effects of interspecific interactions are often misleading.","UPPSALA UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, S-75236 UPPSALA, SWEDEN; SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI, DEPT ECOL & ENVIRONM RES, S-75007 UPPSALA, SWEDEN","BENGTSSON, J (corresponding author), UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI & TECHNOL, NERC, CTR POPULAT BIOL, SILWOOD PK, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,41,28,28,1,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1995,101,4,,,,,397,406,,10.1007/BF00329418,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QT597,WOS:A1995QT59700001,28306954,,,,2021-09-27,

In Palau and Alaska, flow velocity predicted 55-91% of the variance in species richness in natural communities. In experimental communities in Alaska and Maine, enhanced water flow treatments resulted in higher levels of species density (+56%) and richness (+74%), which were predicted by the abundance of locally rare species. Additionally, the richness of recruitment was higher in experimentally enhanced flows (+46%). Thus, the data suggest that flow drives diversity by mediating the delivery of rare species in multiple biogeographic regions.

Body size differences can be further altered by density-dependent competition, though synergistic effects of density and phenology on species interactions are rarely evaluated. We tested how field-realistic variation in phenology and density affected ringed salamander (Ambystoma annulatum) predation on spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), and whether these altered salamander dynamics resulted in trophic cascades. In outdoor mesocosms, we experimentally manipulated ringed salamander density (low/high) and breeding phenology (early/late) of both species. Ringed salamander body size at metamorphosis, development, and growth were reduced at higher densities, while delayed phenology increased hatchling size and larval development, but reduced relative growth rates. Survival of ringed salamanders was affected by the interactive effects of phenology and density. In contrast, spotted salamander growth, size at metamorphosis, and survival, as well as the biomass of lower trophic levels, were negatively affected primarily by ringed salamander density. In an additional mesocosm experiment, we isolated whether ringed salamanders could deplete shared resources prior to their interactions with spotted salamanders, but instead found direct interactions (e.g., predation) were the more likely mechanism by which ringed salamanders limited spotted salamanders. Overall, our results indicate the effects of phenological variability on fitness-related traits can be modified or superseded by differences in density dependence. Identifying such context dependencies will lead to greater insight into when phenological variation will likely alter species interactions.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Rowland, Freya E.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 105 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 105 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.; Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA.",anderstl@gmail.com,"Rowland, Freya/Q-3572-2019; Rowland, Freya/AAE-4733-2021","Rowland, Freya/0000-0002-1041-5301; ",Department of Defense (SERDP)United States Department of Defense [RC2155]; GAANN fellowshipUS Department of Education,"We thank K.

Intermediate levels of these three factors are predicted to enhance coexistence and diversity. However, no study has examined how these factors may interact to alter community composition. The protozoan and rotifer community that colonized containers set in a forest was used to examine the interactions between these local community processes. We conducted a fully factorial microcosm experiment that manipulated disturbance frequency, predator density, and resource levels to examine protozoan and rotifer richness, community composition, and species abundance. Species richness was significantly altered by disturbances and predators, while predator densities interacted with disturbances and resources. Total abundance was significantly affected by each treatment, as well as a disturbance and predator interaction. We found that community composition was altered by each of the treatments and their interactions, indicating that different groups of species were present depending on the treatments. These results indicate that strong species sorting occurs in this community. Understanding these factors alone and in concert can provide insight to the potential complexities that underlie community structure and species composition.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Tyson Res Ctr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Kneitel, JM (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Biol Sci, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",kneitel@csus.edu,,"Kneitel, Jamie/0000-0002-7841-1198",,,,37,66,68,0,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2004,85,8,,,,,2088,2093,,10.1890/03-3172,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,853JT,WOS:000223824300004,,,,,2021-09-27,

Maternal effects are one source of plasticity in early development, and refer to the role of the maternal phenotype in generating offspring phenotypes. Reproductive investment, often a function of maternal size, is one mechanism for transmitting maternal effects. However, it is unclear how maternal size interacts with other ecological factors, such as predation pressure, to influence female reproductive behavior and offspring phenotype. We investigated how reproduction is influenced by maternal size in the presence of predators by exposing large and small adult mud snails Ilyanassa obsoleta to waterborne cues from the predatory green crab Carcinus maenas and the non-predatory green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and measuring reproductive output (i.e. egg size and number, egg capsule number), egg capsule morphology, and offspring time to and size at hatching. Large snails produced more eggs overall than small snails, but the presence of green crabs did not affect reproductive output for either size class. Unexpectedly, small snails laid fewer capsules in the presence of green sea urchins. In contrast, capsule spine length increased in the presence of green crabs but was unaffected by the presence of sea urchins. Larval size at hatching significantly increased in the presence of both crabs and urchins. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of spines in deterring predatory crabs in the lab, and that snails are distributed in a manner consistent with the avoidance of green crab predators in the field. Maternal effects in I. obsoleta, therefore, appear to be size-and context-dependent, play an important role in defending embryos from predators, and are induced by cues from multiple members of the benthic community, including both crabs and urchins.","[Schwab, D.

The European common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, was recently introduced to the Pacific coast of Canada and provides a case study of an introduction into an area with an important predator guild (sea stars) that is functionally minor in the invader's native habitat. Here, we assess the likelihood of establishment, spread, and negative ecological impact of this introduced gastropod, with an emphasis on the role of native sea stars as agents of biotic resistance. Size frequency distributions and local market availability suggest that L. littorea was most likely introduced via the live seafood trade. Non-native hitchhikers (e.g., the trematode Cryptocotyle lingua) were found on/in both market and field specimens. Laboratory studies and field observations confirmed that L. littorea can survive seasonal low salinity in Vancouver, British Columbia. Periwinkles also readily consumed native Ulva, suggesting that periwinkles could impact native communities via herbivory or resource competition. Unlike native gastropods, however, L. littorea lacked behavioural avoidance responses to Northeast Pacific predatory sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus and Pycnopodia helianthoides), and sea star predation rates on L. littorea were much higher than predation rates on native turban snails (Chlorostoma funebralis) in common garden experiments. We therefore expect periwinkle establishment in British Columbia to be limited to areas with low predator density, as is seen in its field distribution to date. We caution that this conclusion may understate the importance of the L. littorea introduction if it also serves as a vector for additional non-indigenous species such as C. lingua.","[Harley, Christopher D.

We examined the effect of sunfish (Lepomis spp.) predators on two native crayfish, Procambarus alleni and P. fallax, that regionally coexist in an expansive connected wetland in order to test the hypotheses that sunfish predation limits crayfish recruitment (both species) and that it disproportionately affects P. alleni, the species inhabiting temporary wetlands. In replicate vegetated wetlands (18.6 m(2)), we quantified summertime crayfish recruitment and species composition across an experimental gradient of sunfish density. Separately, we quantified effects of sunfish on crayfish growth, conducted a complimentary predation assay in mesocosms, and compared behavior of the two crayfish. Sunfish reduced P. alleni summertime recruitment by > 99% over the full sunfish gradient, and most of the effect was caused by low densities of sunfish (0.22-0.43 m(-2)). P. alleni dominated wetlands with few or no sunfish, but the composition shifted towards P. fallax dominance in wetlands with abundant sunfish. P. fallax survived better than P. alleni over 40 h in smaller mesocosms stocked with warmouth. Sunfish reduced P. fallax recruitment 62% in a second wetland experiment, but growth rates of caged crayfish (both species) were unaffected by sunfish presence, suggesting predatory effects were primarily consumptive. Consistent with life histories of relatively fish-sensitive invertebrates, P. alleni engaged in more risky behaviors in the laboratory. Our results indicate that sunfish predators limit recruitment of both species, but disproportionately remove the more active and competitively dominant P. alleni. Spatially and temporally variable dry-disturbances negatively co-varying with sunfish populations allow for regional coexistence of these two crayfish and may release populations of either species from control by predatory fishes.","[Kellogg, Christopher M.; Dorn, Nathan J.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USA","Dorn, NJ (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3200 Coll Ave, Davie, FL 33314 USA.",ndorn1@fau.edu,,,"South Florida Water Management District; Florida Atlantic University; Southeast Environmental Research Center, Florida International University","We are grateful to the University of Florida Institute for Food and Agricultural Safety for use of their mesocosm facility and help getting the experimental wetlands set up.

Indirect interactions between competition and predation, such as keystone predation, can influence both invasion success and the impact of an invasive species on resident competitors. The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald) has been established within the North American range of the indigenous competitor Aedes triseriatus (Say) and indigenous mosquito predator Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett). The effects of Tx. rutilus predation on competition between Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus were tested in laboratory microcosms. Consistent with a prior study, there was minimal evidence of competitive asymmetry between Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus, with similar effects of intraspecific versus interspecific interactions on both species. Tx. rutilus predation caused high mortality of both Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus, and minimized the effects of density-dependent competition. Ae. japonicus females that survived predation had larger adult body sizes than those in treatments without predators. Ae. triseriatus females that survived Tx. rutilus predation were larger and developed quicker than individuals in treatments without predators. Intraspecific competition and predation negatively affected the finite rate of population increase for Ae. j. japonicus, but only affected individual fitness correlates for Ae. triseriatus, indicating that the overall population performance of the invader ismoresensitive to these interactions than the native species. Based on these results, we predict that predation is likely to be an important barrier to the establishment and spread of Ae. j. japonicus in tree holes in North America.","[Freed, T.

The four criteria were as follows: (1) indices of population abundance were inversely related, (2) two species had shared resources or one species preyed on the other, (3) competition or predation was strong enough to produce a measurable effect, and (4) experimental manipulations produced results consistent with the hypothesis of competition or predation. Using these criteria, we identified which species interact most strongly with walleyes, determined the most likely mechanism for interaction (predation, competition, or both), and characterized the effects of walleye stocking on these species. Largemouth bass wits the only species that strongly interacted with walleyes: (1) indices of largemouth bass and walleye population abundance were inversely related in lakes with self-sustaining walleye populations; (2) the diet of largemouth bass included juvenile walleyes; (3) walleye growth was positively related to indices of largemouth bass abundance; and (4) survival of stocked walleyes was negatively related to indices of largemouth bass abundance, and indices of large mouth bass abundances increased as an index of walleye stocking intensity increased. A bioenergetics analysis of one lake that was stocked with 39,300 juvenile walleyes, but also has some natural reproduction of walleyes, suggested that the largemouth bass population could consume tip to 82,500 juvenile walleyes per year. Our findings suggest that largemouth bass interact strongly with walleyes through predation, that they can limit the survival of stocked walleyes, and that walleye stocking can result in increased largemouth bass populations.

We investigated the short-term behavioral and developmental responses of the strict sit-and-wait antlion predator Myrmeleon hyalinus to sand disturbance (i.e., quantification of the impact of severe sand throwing), and to con- and hetero-specific competition by a larger sit-and-pursue antlion species Lopezus fedtschenkoi. We found that antlions subjected to sand disturbances reduced their pit construction activity and relocated less often. Furthermore, the reduction in pit construction activity was stronger among antlions subjected to disturbances prior to feeding. Almost no death occurred during the sand disturbance experiment, but as expected, disturbances caused reductions in the relative growth rates of antlions. This negative effect was stronger in the group exposed to sand disturbances prior to feeding. The presence of the sit-and-pursue competitor led to reductions both in pit construction and in relocation activities of M. hyalinus. Although the per-capita food supply was identical in both experiments, only 48% of M. hyalinus larvae survived the competition experiment, and this pattern was consistent between the con- and hetero-specific treatments. However, in the presence of hetero-specific competitors, the relative growth rate of surviving larvae was significantly lower than that measured in the presence of con-specific competitors. Our study demonstrates that investigating the different components of complex biotic interactions can markedly improve our understanding of how these different factors interact to influence the behavior and life history of organisms.

Throughout their range, observations have been made of a dominance shift favouring D. r. bugensis where the two species co-occur. Although both dreissenids have been widely studied, the mechanisms driving this dominance shift are not completely understood. Our long-term and short-term field experiments assessed a selection of species traits related to growth and settlement, which may be linked to a competitive benefit for either of both species. We assessed relative population densities in time and space, mortality, and inter- and intraspecific interactions in relation to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, and light intensity, using 14 x 14 cm PVC settlement plates. Dreissenids were identified, counted and measured over 11 years in the waterbody where D. r. bugensis was first discovered in Western Europe. Dreissena polymorpha appeared to have a competitive benefit over D. r. bugensis by being able to settle earlier, i.e. in spring, while other studies indicate the opposite. As salinities in the study region were relatively high in spring, this discrepancy may be explained by a higher salinity tolerance of D. polymorpha, as is known from the literature. In addition, Common Coots predated D. r. bugensis clusters. Dreissena polymorpha were not usually found in such clusters. Regardless of these competitive benefits for D. polymorpha, D. r. bugensis is the dominant species in the region. One possible explanation could be the fact that D. r. bugensis was found in similar densities on both light exposed and shaded fouling plates. Dreissena polymorpha on the other hand, was practically absent on light-exposed plates after 12 months. Therefore, a wider range of habitats seems to be suitable for the settlement of D. r. bugensis. Another driver of the dominance shift can be linked to it having faster growth than D. polymorpha, especially during spring. More generally, D. r. bugensis occurred in higher population densities on plates with D. polymorpha than on plates with only D. r. bugensis. Dreissena polymorpha individuals may thus induce the settlement of additional individuals of D. r. bugensis. A final reason for the dominance of D. r. bugensis concerns its low winter mortality. While the number of D. polymorpha individuals more than halved over the winter 2016-2017, no significant decrease in numbers of D. r. bugensis was recorded.","[D'Hont, Anouk; Gittenberger, Adriaan] GiMaRIS Marine Res Inventory & Strategy Solut, Rijksstr Weg 75, NL-2171 AK Sassenheim, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Nat Biodivers Ctr, Dept Marine Zool, Pesthuislaan 7, NL-2333 BA Leiden, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Leiden Univ, Ctr Environm Studies CML, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol Leiden, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Hendriks, A.

Interactions among predators may influence the total efficiency of a predator complex. The effect of intra- and interspecific interactions of the generalist predators Orthotylus marginalis (Heteroptera: Miridae) and Anthocoris nemorum (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) was investigated in a laboratory experiment. Outcomes of the interactions were determined by comparing predation rates on eggs and larvae of the blue willow beetle Phratora vulgatissima of single individuals with those of two individuals of the same or different species. 2. A non-additive, antagonistic effect on predation rates due to intraspecific interactions was found between individuals of A. nemorum. No such effect was found in O. marginalis. These results are as expected as a consequence of differences in behaviour of the two predator species: A. nemorum is a much more active and mobile predator than O. marginalis. 3. Contrary to expectation, interspecific interactions between A. nemorum and O. marginalis did not affect the total predation rate. 4. An observation from the field corroborated the results obtained in the laboratory study; there was no negative relationship between the densities of the two predator species, indicating that the two species do not interact negatively in the field at their natural densities. 5. It is concluded that the additive effect of multiple predator species is of potential value in biological control.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Bjorkman, C (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, POB 7044, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",christer.bjorkman@entom.slu.se,,,,,,22,13,13,1,21,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Here, we assessed preference and competition for habitat types (cobble vs. sand) for H. sanguineus and two competitor species; the previous invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas, and the native rock crab, Cancer irroratus, in New England. In simple laboratory experiments, we paired similarly sized heterospecifics and conspecifics from each species, and also grouped combinations of C. maenas and H. sanguineus in a series of four-individual sets in order to dissect the outcome of intra- and inter-specific competition at different densities. Individually, all three species preferred cobble substrate. With paired conspecifics, H. sanguineus individuals would cohabitate in cobble, whereas C. maenas and C. irroratus individuals each excluded conspecifics from cobble. In heterospecific pairs, H. sanguineus excluded both C. maenas and C. irroratus from cobble. C. maenas and C. irroratus, were equally likely to exclude the other species, but rarely excluded H. sanguineus. In larger assemblages, H. sanguineus preferentially grouped under cobble, whereas C. maenas were more evenly distributed among habitat types. These observations demonstrate that conspecific tolerance and heterospecific competition can be effective, complementary mechanisms for overcoming invasion resistance. Such mechanisms help explain the well-studied success of H. sanguineus following its introduction into New England coastal habitats, and the resulting exclusion of preexisting crab species.","[Hobbs, Niels-Viggo S.] Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Program Biol & Environm Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Cobb, J.

We hypothesized that warming increases invasion of alpine lakes by low-elevation montane zooplankton by suppressing native competitors and predators. This hypothesis was tested by conducting a two-factor experiment, consisting of a warming treatment (13 vs. 20 degrees C) crossed with three invasion levels (alpine only, alpine+montane, montane only), in growth chambers over a 28-day period. Warming significantly reduced total consumer biomass owing to the decline of large alpine species, resulting in greater autotrophic abundance. Significant temperature-invasion interactions occurred as warming suppressed alpine zooplankton, while stimulating certain imported species. Herbivorous invaders suppressed functionally similar alpine species while larger native omnivores reduced invasion by smaller taxa. Warming did not affect total invader biomass because imported species thrived under ambient and warmed alpine conditions. Our findings suggest that the adaptability of remote alpine lake communities to global warming is limited by species dispersal from lower valleys, or possibly nearby warmer alpine ponds.","Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Freshwater Biodivers Lab, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Vinebrooke, RD (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Freshwater Biodivers Lab, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",rolf@ualberta.ca,"Vinebrooke, Rolf/A-3766-2014","Vinebrooke, Rolf/0000-0003-0497-2520",,,,35,58,59,3,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Increasing habitat heterogeneity can change the diversity (number of species, abundances) and the functional roles of communities. The latter, however, is not well understood as species and individuals may respond very differently and dynamically to a changing environment. Here, we experimentally test how habitat heterogeneity affects generalist arthropod predators, including epigaeic spiders, carabid and staphylinid beetles, under natural conditions by assessing their diversity and directly measuring their trophic interactions (which provide a proxy for their functional roles). The experiment was conducted in spring barley fields in Southern Sweden where habitat heterogeneity was manipulated by increasing within-field plant diversity. Increased habitat heterogeneity triggered rapid changes in the feeding behaviour of generalist predators characterized by lower trophic specialization at both network (H-2', degree of interaction specialization in the entire network) and species level (d', degree of interaction specialization at the species level). We presume that this is because spatial separation resulted in relaxed competition and allowed an increased overlap in resources used among predator species. Predators collected from heterogenous habitats also showed greater individual-level dietary variability which might be ascribed to relaxed intraspecific competition. Our results provide conclusive evidence that habitat heterogeneity can induce rapid behavioural responses independent of changes in diversity, potentially promoting the stability of ecosystem functions.","[Staudacher, Karin; Rubbmark, Oskar Rennstam; Sint, Daniela; Traugott, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, Mt Agr Res Unit, Innsbruck, Austria; [Birkhofer, Klaus] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden; [Birkhofer, Klaus] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Chair Ecol, Cottbus, Germany; [Malsher, Gerard; Jonsson, Mattias] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden","Staudacher, K (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, Mt Agr Res Unit, Innsbruck, Austria.",karin.staudacher@uibk.ac.at,"Birkhofer, Klaus/AAA-2374-2021","Birkhofer, Klaus/0000-0002-9301-2443; Traugott, Michael/0000-0001-9719-5059; Rennstam Rubbmark, Oskar/0000-0003-3628-2348; Sint, Daniela/0000-0003-3387-4284",Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [FWF: I786],"Austrian Science Fund, Grant/Award Number: FWF: I786",,63,19,19,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

A priori I showed through an extensive nest site analysis that there is considerable nesting habitat overlap between the two species and hence potential for interspecific competition for prime nesting habitat, Buzzards had a significantly lower breeding success when presented with a goshawk dummy compared to control broods but there was no effect of buzzard dummies on reproductive success, Buzzards failing with their breeding attempt tended to select another nest site while successful buzzards more frequently used the same nest again. Buzzard pairs were less often attacked by common crows Corrus corone while exposed to goshawk dummies compared to buzzard dummies. The decision to desert a nest seems to be a trade-off between predation risk on the one hand and protection against crows on the other. Goshawks probed far more aggressive against an intraspecific dummy than buzzards. Buzzards adjusted their level of brood defence against both intra- and interspecific dummies according to the age of offspring but not offspring number, with an increasing brood defence level with increasing offspring age. Thus the behaviour of buzzards towards goshawks is a result of a complex system of trade-offs between predation risk. competition for prime nesting habitat and protection from crows on which brood value acts as a temporal modifier.","Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany","Kruger, O (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",ok212@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,72,45,48,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2002,96,3,,,,,441,452,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.960306.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543QG,WOS:000175112200006,,,,,2021-09-27,

At the same time, their diets change to reflect the prey availability and to avoid competition for food resources. We performed this research in a highly transformed field and forest mosaic and in an area with a high abundance of avian predators (owls and birds of prey, similar to 133 breeding pairs in total). We calculated the food niche overlap statistics to show the competition for food resources between coexisting species. We assessed the diet composition on the basis of pellet analyses and the identification of prey remains collected from under nests during the breeding season. The food niches overlapped moderately with only one exception, i.e., the highest niche overlap was recorded for the common buzzard and common kestrel, two species preying in open spaces on field rodents but switching to soricomorphs when the former were scarce. On the contrary, the most separate food niche was that of the white-tailed eagle, which was the only species regularly preying on fish. Our results showed that the food niches of species coexisting in the same area were considerably separate, which is due to the fact that they prey on various prey species or search for them in different habitats. Abstract: Food niche overlap statistics are a common way to show competition for food resources in a group of animals. Niche breadths of various species are very variable and their diet composition changes reflecting prey availability. The aim of this study was to evidence the food niche overlap of the whole assemblage of avian predators (eight raptor and owl species, some of them reaching very high densities) in a field and forest mosaic of central Poland. The diet composition was assessed on the basis of pellet analyses and the identification of prey remains found under the nests in the breeding period. The extent of the niche overlap was calculated using a Pianka formula. The food niche overlap indices ranged from 0.02 to 0.93 (mostly below 0.5). The most separate food niche was that of the white-tailed eagle, who regularly preyed on fish.

In this study, we aimed to determine the likelihood of consumptive biotic resistance within fouling communities in four ports of central Chile. Notably, we examined the influence of micro- (> 1-2 mm, < 1-2 cm) and macro- (> 1-2 cm) predators, with a particular focus on their effects on non-indigenous species (NIS). Experimental and observational approaches were combined. An exclusion experiment was carried out over 4 months to examine predator effect on the early establishment of new assemblages on settlement panels. Later successional stages upon panels were examined over a total of 26 months and supported by rapid assessment surveys in the surrounding habitats. Community structure was significantly influenced by the exclusion treatments. Macropredators reduced the fouling biomass and abundance, although conflicting patterns emerged from the exclusion of both categories of predators. Altogether, predators reduced the abundance of most NIS and cryptogenic species, some of them being only observed when the two categories of predators were excluded-a pattern generally sustained over the long-term dynamics in community development. Our results show an effective consumptive biotic resistance, furthermore possibly dependent on predator size. Further work is however needed to determine the influence of the functional diversity of natural enemies on the efficiency of biotic resistance and its interplay with other biotic interactions (competition or mutualism). A comprehensive understanding of these processes should in turn help defining management strategies in a context of habitat modification and species loss.","[Leclerc, Jean-Charles; Brante, Antonio] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, CIBAS, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Casilla 297, Concepcion, Chile; [Viard, Frederique] Sorbonne Univ, Stn Biol Roscoff, CNRS, UMR 7144,AD2M, Pl Georges Teissier, F-29680 Roscoff, France","Leclerc, JC (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, CIBAS, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Casilla 297, Concepcion, Chile.",leclercjc@gmail.com,"Viard, Frederique/O-4360-2018; Leclerc, Jean-Charles/T-1400-2018","Viard, Frederique/0000-0001-5603-9527; Leclerc, Jean-Charles/0000-0003-3663-3785; Brante, Antonio/0000-0002-2699-9700",,,,46,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Increasing plant productivity may increase herbivore diversity by: increasing the abundance of rare resources (resource rarity hypothesis), increasing herbivore abundance and local persistence (consumer rarity hypothesis) or increasing intraspecific density dependence (density dependence hypothesis). Increasing plant diversity may increase the diversity of herbivores because herbivores specialized on these new plant species can persist locally. Increasing the diversity of herbivores could likewise increase the diversity of predators and parasites, although parasite and predator diversity may also respond directly to changes in vegetation. Here I use data from a well-replicated grassland experiment at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, to analyze the responses of arthropod diversity to independent manipulations of (1) plant productivity and (2) plant diversity and composition. Long-term nitrogen addition (historical treatment) decreased plant diversity and favored C-3 grasses. Short-term nitrogen addition (modern treatment) increased plant productivity without appreciably changing plant diversity or plant composition. Arthropods were sampled using both sweep nets and vacuum samplers. Total arthropod species richness and abundance, as well as species richness and abundance of every trophic group (detritivores, herbivores, parasites, and predators), were significantly greater in plots with higher levels of modern fertilization and greater plant productivity. Path analysis supported the consumer rarity hypothesis, because modern fertilization increased herbivore species richness only indirectly by increasing herbivore abundance. Surprisingly, higher levels of historical fertilization that lowered plant species richness (but did not change plant productivity) significantly increased total arthropod species richness, did not affect detritivore or herbivore species richness, and significantly increased parasite and predator species richness. Direct and indirect effects of historical fertilization on the species richness of trophic groups were separated statistically using block regression chain modeling. Herbivore species richness was decreased through the direct pathway, but this was offset through indirect effects so that there was no overall response to historical fertilization. In plots with low plant diversity, similar numbers of herbivore species supported a greater diversity of parasites and predators. These results suggest that the diversity and composition of plants control the diversity of consumers not only directly by determining available resources, but also indirectly by influencing the interactions between herbivores and their parasites and predators.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Siemann, E (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",,,,,,,92,342,361,9,219,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1998,79,6,,,,,2057,2070,,10.2307/176709,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,116YM,WOS:000075752700017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Coupled with climate change-related increases in storm activity and associated alterations to sediment transport, estuaries and the organisms that live in them may be impacted. Along the eastern seaboard and gulf coast of the United States, Crassostrea virginica is an economically and ecologically important estuarine shellfish species. In an effort to understand potential effects of climate change on intertidal Crassostrea virginica, a novel method for manipulating inundation time of intertidal oysters was developed to examine effects of altering daily inundation time on sedimentation, predation, and competition. Called the oyster ladder, this method consists of suspending oyster shell as recruitment substrate at different elevations within the intertidal zone between mean low and mean high water. A six-week experiment was deployed during the peak of the 2011 oyster recruitment season at two sites within Apalachicola Bay, Florida. Data was collected on oyster recruitment, shell length, presence of sessile competitors, and sedimentation. Mean oyster shell length peaked at 95% time inundated, while recruitment peaked at 80% time inundation. Maximum sedimentation occurred at the highest inundation times (95% time inundation). The oyster ladder proved to be an effective tool for manipulating inundation times for C. virginica and suggests that sea level rise will have an effect on abundance, growth and survival of this of intertidal species.","[Solomon, Joshua A.; Donnelly, Melinda J.; Walters, Linda J.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32817 USA","Solomon, JA (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32817 USA.",Joshua.a.solomon@knights.ucf.edu,,,NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [EESLR-NGOM NA10NOS4780146]; University of Central Florida,"Funding was provided by NOAA (EESLR-NGOM NA10NOS4780146; PI: Scott Hagen) and the University of Central Florida.

However, in amphibians that alternate between an aquatic larval stage and a dispersing terrestrial stage, such understanding is limited due to the difficulty of estimating survival under field conditions. In this study, we obtained precise estimates of daily survival rates of tadpoles under field conditions using capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods and assessed their temporal and spatial variation. Specifically, we assessed the effect of temperature, intra-specific density, and the presence of introduced bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) on the survival rate of Pacific treefrog (Pseudacris regilla) tadpoles in southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Daily survival rates of tadpoles were relatively constant within a season and were also similar between years. Survival rates in different ponds varied from 95.4 to 87.9%.d(-1). Among-pond differences in survival were best explained by the interaction of temperature and tadpole density. At low tadpole densities, survival increased with temperature, but at high densities, survival decreased with increasing temperature. It was not possible to detect the effect of introduced bullfrogs over the variation accounted for by differences in temperature and intra-specific density. As in terrestrial vertebrates, biotic and abiotic factors interacted strongly to determine survival rates in these tadpoles.","Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada","Govindarajulu, PP (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, POB 3020,STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.",purnimap@uvic.ca,,,,,,68,14,15,0,41,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2006,13,3,,,,,413,421,,10.2980/i1195-6860-13-3-413.1,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,090OL,WOS:000240960500015,,,,,2021-09-27,

While temporal resource partitioning has long been hypothesized to reduce the negative effects of interspecific competition, empirical evidence suggests that time may not often be an axis along which animal species routinely subdivide resources. Here, we present evidence to the contrary in the world's most biodiverse group of animals: insect parasites (parasitoids). Specifically, we conducted a meta-analysis of 64 studies from 41 publications to determine if temporal resource partitioning via variation in the timing of a key life-history trait, egg deposition (oviposition), mitigates interspecific competition between species pairs sharing the same insect host. When competing species were manipulated to oviposit at (or near) the same time in or on a single host in the laboratory, competition was common, and one species was typically inherently superior (i.e. survived to adulthood a greater proportion of the time). In most cases, however, the inferior competitor could gain a survivorship advantage by ovipositing earlier (or in a smaller number of cases later) into shared hosts. Moreover, this positive (or in a few cases negative) priority advantage gained by the inferior competitor increased as the interval between oviposition times became greater. The results from manipulative experiments were also correlated with patterns of life-history timing and demography in nature: the more inherently competitively inferior a species was in the laboratory, the greater the interval between oviposition times of taxa in co-occurring populations. Additionally, the larger the interval between oviposition times of competing taxa, the more abundant the inferior species was in populations where competitors were known to coexist. Overall, our findings suggest that temporal resource partitioning via variation in oviposition timing may help to facilitate species coexistence and structures diverse insect communities by altering demographic measures of species success. We argue that the lack of evidence for a more prominent role of temporal resource partitioning in promoting species coexistence may reflect taxonomic differences, with a bias towards larger-sized animals. For smaller species like parasitic insects that are specialized to attack one or a group of closely related hosts, have short adult lifespans and discrete generation times, compete directly for limited resources in small, closed arenas and have life histories constrained by host phenology, temporal resource subdivision via variation in life history may play a critical role in allowing species to coexist by alleviating the negative effects of interspecific competition.","[Hood, Glen Ray; Blankinship, Devin; Doellman, Meredith M.; Feder, Jeffrey L.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Galvin Life Sci Ctr 100, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hood, Glen Ray] Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 5047 Gullen Mall, Detroit, MI 48202 USA","Hood, GR (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Galvin Life Sci Ctr 100, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.; Hood, GR (corresponding author), Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 5047 Gullen Mall, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",glenrayhood@wayne.edu,,,Entomological Society of America; Indiana Academy of Science; Sigma Xi; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF-IGERT GLOBES Fellowship from the University of Notre Dame; NSF-GLOBES REU Fellowship from the University of Notre Dame; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of Agriculture NIFA program,"We thank G.

Indirect interactions between populations of different prey species mediated by a shared predator population are known to affect prey dynamics. 2. Depending on the temporal and spatial scale, these indirect interactions may result in positive (apparent mutualism), neutral or negative effects (apparent competition) of the prey on each other's densities. Although there is ample evidence for the latter, evidence for apparent mutualism is scarce. 3. The effectiveness of using one species of predator for biological control of more than one pest species depends on the occurrence of such positive or negative effects. 4. We used an experimental system consisting of the two prey species Western flower thrips (Franklineilla occidentalis Pergande) and greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood) and a shared predator, the phytoseiid mite Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot. We released all three species on the same plant and studied their dynamics and distribution along rows of plants. 5. We expected that the more mobile prey species (thrips) would escape temporarily in the presence of the other prey species (whitefly) by dispersing from plants with the predator. The predator was expected to disperse slower in the presence of two prey species because of the higher availability of food. 6. Evidence was found for slower dispersal of predators and short-term escape of thrips from predation when whiteflies were present, thus confirming the occurrence of short-term apparent mutualism. 7. The apparent mutualism resulted in a cascade to the first trophic level: a higher proportion of fruits was damaged by thrips in the presence of whiteflies. 8. We conclude that apparent mutualism can be an important phenomenon in population dynamics, and can significantly affect biological control of pest species that share a natural enemy.","[Van Maanen, Roos; Sabelis, Maurice W.; Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Messelink, Gerben J.; Van Holstein-Saj, Renata] Wageningen UR Greenhouse Hort, Bleiswijk, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Arne.Janssen@uva.nl,"Messelink, Gerben J./AAD-1738-2019; Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Messelink, Gerben J./0000-0002-5196-1229; Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",Technology Foundation (STW)Technologiestichting STW [7180],"R.v.M. received a scholarship from the Technology Foundation (STW Project 7180).

Overgrowth is considered to be an important mechanism of competition for space. and species are often ranked in hierarchies based on their abilities to overgrow. In some marine habitats, however, encrusting algae dominate primary substrata despite a dense permanent cover of epiphytes, suggesting that factors other than competition could be important in influencing their distributions. The spatial relationships and competitive interactions between encrusting algae and overgrowing overgrowing filamentous, turf-forming algae were investigated on a subtidal rocky reef (Mediterranean Sea. Italy). Quantitative observations and field experiments were done from 1992 to 1998: (1) to investigate the relative patterns of distribution and abundance of crusts and turf and how they differed across space and time, (2) to test whether spatial relationships between crusts and turf were influenced by various characteristics of the substratum and by disturbance from wave action. (3) to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment and the mechanisms by which crusts colonize space, and (4) to rest whether trusts and turf compete for space. Crusts were always among the first colonizers of available bare rock and were subsequently overgrown by turf. Despite variations in spatial and temporal recruitment of crusts, this pattern was never reversed. Covers of crusts and turf were not significantly affected by disturbance. There was some evidence for competition, but this did not result in the local exclusion of either crusts or turf. Despite extensive and persistent cover of turf, encrusting algae were abundant and were able to live, grow, and reproduce beneath the: turf over lung periods with little adverse effect. Similarly, crusts did not limit the distribution of turf, although they slowed its rate of growth. The capabilities of turf and crusts to overgrow and tolerate overgrowth, respectively, were identified as the major determinants of the structure of this two-layered assemblage and the probable basis of the success of these species in coexisting as the dominant algal forms. Overgrowth was not equivalent to competitive subordination and displacement, emphasizing the need fur caution when interpreting competitive abilities from observed patterns of overgrowth. Overall, results suggested that, in some habitats, tolerance may be more important than competition in maintaining coexistence of species and influencing community structure.","Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, Pisa, Italy; Univ Sydney, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Airoldi, L (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Via Tombesi dallOva 55, I-48100 Ravenna, Italy.",lairoldi@ambra.unibo.it,"Airoldi, Laura/I-3553-2019","Airoldi, Laura/0000-0001-5046-0871",,,,104,100,103,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2000,81,3,,,,,798,814,,10.2307/177378,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,289GD,WOS:000085611400017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Effects on predators and competitors could, however, be a concern as Anopheles gambiae s.l. is preyed upon in all life stages. We overview the literature and assess the strength of the ecological interactions identified. Most predators identified consume many other insect species and there is no evidence that any species preys exclusively on any anopheline mosquito. There is one predatory species with a specialisation on blood-fed mosquitoes including An. gambiae s.l.. Evarcha culicivora is a jumping spider, known as the vampire spider, found around Lake Victoria. There is no evidence that these salticids require Anopheles mosquitoes and will readily consume blood-fed Culex. Interspecific competition studies focus on other mosquitoes of larval habitats. Many of these take place in artificial cosms and give contrasting results to semi-field studies. This may limit their extrapolation regarding the potential impact of reduced An. gambiae numbers. Previous mosquito control interventions are informative and identify competitive release and niche opportunism; so while the identity and relative abundance of the species present may change, the biomass available to predators may not.","[Collins, C.

One patch type is dominated by Cladophora glomerata, a macroalga potentially able to monopolize space, whereas the other type is comprised of a low-growing, epilithic microalgal lawn inhabited by several species of sessile grazers (especially the caddisflies Leucotrichia pictipes and Psychomyia flavida). Cladophora patches are absent from mid-channel sites characterized by current velocities less-than-or-equal-to ca. 50 cm s-1; caging experiments indicate that their absence is due to grazing by crayfish (Orconectes propinquus). Cladophora's presence in sites with velocities > 50 cm s-1 apparently results in part because crayfish foraging activity is impaired in high flow regimes. The presence of Cladophora strongly affects various other invertebrates due to its alteration of abiotic and biotic characteristics of the microhabitat. For example, the abundance of sessile grazers (e.g. Leucotrichia and Psychomyia) that inhabit microalgal patches is negatively correlated to the abundance of Cladophora, whereas the abundance of several other invertebrates (e.g. Stenonema mayflies and Taeniopteryx stoneflies) is positively correlated to Cladophora's abundance. Therefore, in some portions of this system, crayfish act as keystone predators because of their ability to regulate the abundance of Cladophora, which in turn has strong positive and negative effects on other components of the community. Cladophora does not always monopolize space at high velocities in the absence of crayfish, however. If sessile grazers arrive at such sites before Cladophora, they can prevent its establishment. Thus, where crayfish are absent, the likelihood that a site will be dominated by either Cladophora patches or sessile grazer - microalgal lawn patches depends on two sets of stochastic processes: (1) those that create bare space (e.g. disturbance and grazer emergence); and (2) those controlling the timing of recruitment by Cladophora or grazers at these bare sites. These priority effects (i.e. the ability of grazers and Cladophora to inhibit each other's establishment) contribute to the marked spatial heterogeneity of these two patch types. Collectively, these results demonstrate how interactions between competition, predation, and physical factors can generate a complex mixture of community patterns.",,"HART, DD (corresponding author), ACAD NAT SCI PHILADELPHIA,1900 BEN FRANKLIN PKWAY,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19103, USA.",,,,,,,56,134,138,0,47,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1992,91,2,,,,,220,228,,10.1007/BF00317787,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JJ700,WOS:A1992JJ70000011,28313460,,,,2021-09-27,

The purpose of this study was to investigate habitat effects on larval anuran fitness measures in the absence of direct effects of predators and competitors in a central Amazonian rain forest. In this sense, this study tests species-habitat associations established in an earlier study (Gascon 1991). Fifty-three primary forest aquatic sites of four distinct types (stream, streamside, peccary wallows, and terra firme sites) were surveyed for 2 yr for larval anuran species presence. In separate transplant experiments, I monitored growth, survival, and development of four larval anuran species reared in mesh cages as a function of habitat type. Tadpoles of Osteocephalus taurinus occurred in all types of habitats, but had a significantly higher mean number of cohorts in high-lying sites (terra firme and wallows) compared to low-lying sites (streams and streamside pools). Hyla geographica was restricted to streamside sites. Epipedobates femoralis and Phyllomedusa tomopterna occurred only in high-lying natural sites (wallows and terra firme sites). When transplanted, O. taurinus did significantly better in high-lying sites than in low-lying ones. Hyla geographica did not perform significantly better in sites where it naturally occurred. Phyllomedusa tomopterna showed significantly lower survival in low-lying sites compared to high-lying ones. Finally, E. femoralis performed as well in streamside sites (where it never occurred naturally) as in high-lying sites. Occurrence patterns for P. tomopterna and O. taurinus were consistent with the transplant results. This suggests that these species occupy all habitats within their scope of physiological tolerance. Other factors, such as direct predation on larvae or interference competition, do not appear to account for the distribution of these species. For H. geographica and E. femoralis, results of transplants indicate that they do not perform better in their ''preferred'' habitat compared to unoccupied habitats.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT SCI BIOL, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA",,,,,,,,64,17,18,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1995,76,7,,,,,2222,2229,,10.2307/1941695,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RX362,WOS:A1995RX36200021,,,,,2021-09-27,

However these experiences have often lacked a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) experimental design providing evidence strong enough about their efficacy reducing vole abundance or crop damages. Furthermore, little is known about possible indirect effects on non-target species. Here we test the effectiveness of providing nest-boxes to common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and barn owls (Tyto alba) in reducing the abundance of two different vole species using indirect index methods to estimate rodent abundance in late spring (May). We monitored the abundance of both vole species in a treatment (with nest boxes) and control (without nest boxes) areas during three years in alfalfa fields, using a BACI design. We studied also the efficiency of this control method in three different crops (alfalfa, cereal and fruit-trees) during the last year of the experiment. We compare the results obtained in this study area in NE Spain with those obtained simultaneously in other three experimental areas in NW Spain. Finally we explored potential negative effects of this method on the abundance of several passerine birds present in our research area. Our results showed a clear-cut reduction in the abundance of the two vole species, the common vole (Microtus arvalis) and the mediterranean-pine vole (Microtus duodecimcostatus) in the experimental area after applying the treatment (nest box installation) in alfalfa crops. We also found a significant decrease in the presence of both species of voles on fruit-tree plantations and alfalfa crops but we did not find significant effects in the cereal fields, where voles were in general very scarce. These results suggest higher efficacy of biological control in this study area than in some areas of NW Spain, what could be explained by several non-exclusive hypotheses presented in the discussion. For other species, we found a negative effect of nest-boxes on the abundance of a limited number of common bird species, but also positive effects over other species using poles with nest-boxes as perches. In conclusion, under the conditions of our study area, nest-box provisioning seemed to be an effective technique to reduce vole abundance, but also had some undesired side-effects on non-target species. However, these side-effects affected mainly to common bird species and can thus be considered less relevant than those caused by SGARs, often affecting to endangered rodent predators and that could thus have negative effects over any potential future natural control of vole abundance, potentially increasing future needs of SGAR use in a vicious circle.","[Paz Luna, Alfonso] Grp Rehabil Fauna Autoctona & Habitat GREFA, Apdo 11, Madrid 28220, Spain; [Paz Luna, Alfonso] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida UD Ecol, Edificio Ciencias, E-28871 Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Bintanel, Hector] ATHMOS Sustainabil SL, Zaragoza, Spain; [Vinuela, Javier] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, IREC, Ronda Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Villanua, Diego] Gest Ambiental Navarra GAN NIK, 219 Bajo, Navarra 31015, Spain; [Villanua, Diego] Soc Ciencias Aranzadi, Dept Ornitol, Zorroagagaina 11, E-20014 Donostia S, Sebastian, Spain","Luna, AP (corresponding author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida UD Ecol, Edificio Ciencias, E-28871 Alcala De Henares, Spain.",alfonso.paz@edu.uah.es,,,BBVA FoundationBBVA Foundation; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [CGL2015-71255-P],"All nest boxes were erected by the Government of Navarra in the Vole Biological Control Program.

Recent studies indicate that large-scale spatial processes can alter local community structuring mechanisms to determine local and regional assemblages of predators and their prey. In metacommunities, this may occur when the functional diversity represented in the regional predator species pool interacts with the rate of prey dispersal among local communities to affect prey species diversity and trait composition at multiple scales. 2. Here, we test for effects of prey dispersal rate and spatially and temporally heterogeneous predation from functionally dissimilar predators on prey structure in pond mesocosm metacommunities. An experimental metacommunity consisted of three pond mesocosm communities supporting two differentially size-selective invertebrate predators and their zooplankton prey. In each metacommunity, two communities maintained constant predation and supported either Gyrinus sp. (Coleoptera) or Notonecta ungulata (Hemiptera) predators generating a spatial prey refuge while the third community supported alternating predation from Gyrinus sp. and N. ungulata generating a temporal prey refuge. Mesocosm metacommunities were connected at either low (0 center dot 7% day-1) or high (10% day-1) planktonic prey dispersal. The diversity, composition and body size of zooplankton prey were measured at local and regional (metacommunity) scales. 3. Metacommunities experiencing the low prey dispersal rate supported the greatest regional prey species diversity (H') and evenness (J'). Neither dispersal rate nor predation regime affected local prey diversity or evenness. The spatial prey refuge at low dispersal maintained the largest difference in species composition and body size diversity between communities under Gyrinus and Notonecta predation, suggesting that species sorting was operating at the low dispersal rate. There was no effect of dispersal rate on species diversity or body size distribution in the temporal prey refuge. 4. The frequency distribution, but not the range, of prey body sizes within communities depended upon prey dispersal rate and predator identity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that prey dispersal rate can moderate the strength of predation to influence prey species diversity and the local frequency distribution of prey traits in metacommunities supporting ecologically different predators.","[Howeth, Jennifer G.; Leibold, Mathew A.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Howeth, JG (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",jennifer.howeth@yale.edu,,,"NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0235579, 0640302, 0717370, 0508068]","A.

We show that even predators with a broad diet may actively avoid alien prey and selectively feed on native species, despite alien prey being more abundant and easier to consume. This lack of predation pressure combined with the removal of competing native prey offers 2 sources of facilitation of prey invasions.Biotic invasions can result in the displacement of native species. This can alter the availability of native prey and the choices made by native predators. We investigated prey selection by 2 native South African predators, the west coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii and the starfish Marthasterias africana in response to the invasive mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Semimytilus algosus, and native mussels, Aulacomya atra and Choromytilus meridionalis. As the diets of lobsters and starfish are broad and have been suggested to reflect prey availability, we hypothesized that they would consume the most abundant prey, regardless of its native or alien status. Laboratory studies presented predators with varying proportions of native and invasive mussels that represented pre- and post-invasion scenarios. Mussel parameters (shell strength, adductor muscle size, and energy content) that may be of importance in selection by predators were compared among species. Both predators exhibited preference towards the native mussel C. meridionalis, even when it was the least abundant prey. The selection of native species occurred despite mussel parameters suggesting that invasive species would be easier to consume. These findings highlight the potential for facilitation of prey invasions, especially when predators avoid alien prey and select for native comparators that may offer resistance to the invasion through inter-specific competition. It is presently unclear how often such a lack of predator-driven biotic resistance acts in combination with indirect facilitation, but interrogating the behaviors that drive such outcomes will advance our understanding of successful invasions.","[Skein, Lisa; Robinson, Tamara B.] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1,Nat Sci Bldg,Merriman Ave, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Matieland, South Africa; [Alexander, Mhairi E.] Univ West Scotland, Sch Sci & Sport, IBEHR, High St, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland","Robinson, TB (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1,Nat Sci Bldg,Merriman Ave, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Matieland, South Africa.",trobins@sun.ac.za,"Robinson, Tamara B/I-1806-2019","Robinson, Tamara B/0000-0001-5515-1445; Skein, Lisa/0000-0003-2273-3048",DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion BiologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India),This work was supported by the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology.; Andrea Plos and Clova Mabin are gratefully acknowledged for collecting lobsters and starfish in the field.

Ecologists have proposed (re)introducing megaherbivores or their ecological analogues to restore lost ecosystem functions and reinforce extant but declining megaherbivore populations. However, the effects of megaherbivores on smaller herbivores are poorly understood. We used long-term exclusion experiments and multispecies hierarchical models fitted to dung counts to test (a) the effect of megaherbivores (elephant and giraffe) on the occurrence (dung presence) and use intensity (dung pile density) of mesoherbivores (2-1,000 kg), and (b) the extent to which the responses of each mesoherbivore species was predictable based on their traits (diet and shoulder height) and phylogenetic relatedness. Megaherbivores increased the predicted occurrence and use intensity of zebras but reduced the occurrence and use intensity of several other mesoherbivore species. The negative effect of megaherbivores on mesoherbivore occurrence was stronger for shorter species, regardless of diet or relatedness. Megaherbivores substantially reduced the expected total use intensity (i.e. cumulative dung density of all species) of mesoherbivores, but only minimally reduced the expected species richness (i.e. cumulative predicted occurrence probabilities of all species) of mesoherbivores (by <1 species). Simulated extirpation of megaherbivores altered use intensity by mesoherbivores, which should be considered during (re)introductions of megaherbivores or their ecological proxies. Species' traits (in this case shoulder height) may be more reliable predictors of mesoherbivores' responses to megaherbivores than phylogenetic relatedness, and may be useful for predicting responses of data-limited species.","[Wells, Harry B.

Resource availability affects recolonization success and resulting distribution patterns, but top-down processes may also play a role through density-mediated or trait-mediated indirect effects that may exclude a species from otherwise suitable habitat. We predicted that the spatial distribution of recolonizing sea otters, Enhydra lutris, on the Canadian Pacific coastline was explained by resources as well as interspecific interactions - spatial segregation from pinnipeds, the preferred prey of killer whales Orcinus orca. We surveyed the summer occurrence of sea otters and pinnipeds on Vancouver Island, Canada. We quantified coastline density and bathymetry at multiple spatial scales as indices of habitat complexity and foraging habitat availability. We used generalized linear model selection to test hypotheses about sea otters' spatial relationship to resources and heterospecifics. Pinniped presence negatively predicted sea otter presence, even after accounting for complexity and foraging habitat. Sea otters may segregate from pinnipeds due to trait-mediated indirect effects of predation, leading us to hypothesize apparent competition between sea otters and pinnipeds. Research is needed to test this hypothesis; if true, refuge from apparent competitors may be a key component of recolonization habitat for sea otters.

This may reflect shared responses to a common factor, but may also reflect positive interactions among these exotic species. Armand Bayou (Pasadena, TX) is one such ecosystem where multiple species of invasive aquatic plants are common. We used this system to investigate whether presence of one exotic species made subsequent invasions by other exotic species more likely, less likely, or if it had no effect. We performed an experiment in which we selectively removed exotic rooted and/or floating aquatic plant species and tracked subsequent colonization and growth of native and invasive species. This allowed us to quantify how presence or absence of one plant functional group influenced the likelihood of successful invasion by members of the other functional group. We found that presence of alligatorweed (rooted plant) decreased establishment of new water hyacinth (free-floating plant) patches but increased growth of hyacinth in established patches, with an overall net positive effect on success of water hyacinth. Water hyacinth presence had no effect on establishment of alligatorweed but decreased growth of existing alligatorweed patches, with an overall net negative effect on success of alligatorweed. Moreover, observational data showed positive correlations between hyacinth and alligatorweed with hyacinth, on average, more abundant. The negative effect of hyacinth on alligatorweed growth implies competition, not strong mutual facilitation (invasional meltdown), is occurring in this system. Removal of hyacinth may increase alligatorweed invasion through release from competition. However, removal of alligatorweed may have more complex effects on hyacinth patch dynamics because there were strong opposing effects on establishment versus growth. The mix of positive and negative interactions between floating and rooted aquatic plants may influence local population dynamics of each group and thus overall invasion pressure in this watershed.","[Wundrow, Emily J.; Carrillo, Juli; Gabler, Christopher A.; Horn, Katherine C.; Siemann, Evan] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77251 USA","Siemann, E (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",siemann@rice.edu,,"Gabler, Christopher/0000-0001-9311-7248",Brown Teaching Grant; Ford Foundation; Wray-Todd Fellowships; Lodieska Stockbridge Vaughn Fellowship; National Science Foundation pre-doctoral fellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF),"Financial support was provided by a Brown Teaching Grant (ES), the Ford Foundation (JAC), Wray-Todd Fellowships (KCH, CAG), a Lodieska Stockbridge Vaughn Fellowship (CAG), and a National Science Foundation pre-doctoral fellowship (JAC).

Recent studies explicitly considering benthic-pelagic coupling are starting to shed light on,and find regularities in, the causes of such large-scale variation in coastal ecosystems. Here, we evaluate the effects of variation in wind-driven upwelling on community regulation along 900 km of coastline of the southeastern Pacific, between 29 degrees S and 35 degrees S during 72 months. Variability in the intensity of upwelling occurring over tens of km produced predictable variation in recruitment of intertidal mussels, but not barnacles, and did not affect patterns of community structure. In contrast, sharp discontinuities in upwelling regimes produced abrupt and persistent breaks in the dynamics of benthic and pelagic communities over hundreds of km (regional) scales. Rates of mussel and barnacle recruitment changed sharply at approximate to 32 degrees-33 degrees S, determining a geographic break in adult abundance of these competitively dominant species. Analysis of satellite images demonstrates that regional-scale discontinuities in oceanographic regimes can couple benthic and pelagic systems, as evidenced by coincident breaks in dynamics and concentration of offshore surface chlorophyll-a. Field experiments showed that the paradigm of top-down control of intertidal benthic communities holds only south of the discontinuity. To the north, populations seem recruitment-limited, and predators have negligible effects, despite attaining similarly high abundances and potential predation effects across the region. Thus, geographically discontinuous oceanographic regimes set bounds to the strength of species interactions and define distinct regions for the design and implementation of sustainable management and conservation policies.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile","Castilla, JC (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",jcastill@bio.puc.cl,"Broitman, Bernardo R/D-6007-2013; Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013","Broitman, Bernardo R/0000-0001-6582-3188; ",,,,50,193,196,0,48,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

It is known that trawling disturbance has a substantial effect on the larger benthic fauna, with reductions in density and diversity, and changes in community structure, benthic biomass, production, and bioturbation and biogeochemical processes. Largely unknown, however, are the mechanisms by which the trawling impacts on the large benthic macro- and megafauna may influence the smaller meiofauna. To investigate this, a mesocosm experiment was conducted whereby benthic nematode communities from a non-trawled area were exposed to three different densities (absent, low, normal) of 7 large (>10 mm) naturally co-occurring, bioturbating species which are potentially vulnerable to trawling disturbance. The results showed that total abundances of nematodes were lower if these large macrofauna species were present, but no clear nematode abundance effects could be assigned to the macrofauna density differences. Nematode community structure changed in response to macrofauna presence and density, mainly as a result of the reduced abundance of a few dominant nematode species. Any detectable effects seemed similar for nearly all macrofauna species treatments, supporting the idea that there may be a general indirect, macrofauna-mediated trawling impact on nematode communities. Explanations for these results may be, firstly, competition for food resources, resulting in spatial segregation of the meio- and macrobenthic components. Secondly, different densities of large macrofauna organisms may affect the nematode community structure through different intensities of bioturbatory disturbance or resource competition. These results suggest that removal or reduced densities of larger macrofauna species as a result of trawling disturbance may lead to increased nematode abundance and hints at the validity of interference competition between large macrofauna organisms and the smaller meiofauna, and the energy equivalence hypothesis, where a trade-off is observed between groups of organisms that are dependent on a common source of energy.

Even though Scandinavian forest ecosystems are strongly influenced by small mammals' dynamics, the effects of anthropogenic changes on these communities are still debated. We conducted an extensive capture-mark-recapture study to examine the relative abundance and distribution of 11 species of small mammals during the reproductive season with respect to all available landscape-scale habitat types and fine-scale vegetation characteristics. At the landscape scale, the highest abundance and diversity of small mammals was recorded in abandoned meadows. The community was dominated by Myodes glareolus in old abandoned meadows sparsely colonized by trees and bushes, and by Micron's agrestis in younger grass-dominated meadows, likely reflecting inter-specific competition and niche separation. Notwithstanding the remarkably low availability of both types of meadows, these habitats sustained by far the highest abundance of small mammals. Intensively managed forest monocultures at logging age and cultivated fields sustained the lowest abundance of small mammals. However, while the former also supported the lowest species diversity, the latter unexpectedly sustained the highest number of species. Only Apodemus sylvaticus attained highest densities in cultivated fields, but its marked association with forest edges clearly indicates its need for landscape-scale complexity. Contrary to previous theories, clear-cuts and forests overall did not support the highest abundance of M. agrestis and M. glareolus. Both young and mature forests failed to explain a significant amount of variation in community structure when taking into account other habitat types. However, a few old clear-cuts characterized by higher vegetational complexity, and a few stands preserving characteristics typical of late successional stages (moss, berries, woody debris) were able to support relatively high abundance of small mammals. Our study shows that sampling in all available habitats at different spatial scales is essential for a comprehensive understanding of community dynamics in forest-farmland ecosystems, as even habitat types that are under-represented at the landscape scale might play a significant role for the community dynamics. Forest-farmland mosaic landscapes with a high degree of heterogeneity at both large spatial scale (e.g. meadows, shelterbelts) and at fine-scales (e.g. varied and multi-layered ground cover) allow for the conservation of small mammal diversity and abundance in human-dominated areas. Nonetheless, the low number of Myodes rujocanus trapped in this highly fragmented mosaic landscape supports the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation negatively affects the dynamic of this forest specialist.

Species interactions play a central role in the response of ecosystems to climate change, but the role of trophic interactions in facilitating or preventing range expansions is largely unknown. The goal of our study was to understand how predators influence the ability of range-shifting prey to successfully establish in newly available habitat following climate warming. We hypothesized that fish predation facilitates the establishment of colonizing zooplankton populations, because fish preferentially consume larger species that would otherwise competitively exclude smaller-bodied colonists. We conducted a mesocosm experiment with zooplankton communities and their fish predators from lakes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, USA. We tested the effect of fish predation on the establishment and persistence of a zooplankton community when introduced in the presence of higher- and lower-elevation communities at two experimental temperatures in field mesocosms. We found that predators reduce the abundance of larger-bodied residents from the alpine and facilitate the establishment of new lower-elevation species. In addition, fish predation and warming independently reduced the average body size of zooplankton by up to 30%. This reduction in body size offset the direct effect of warming-induced increases in population growth rates, leading to no net change in zooplankton biomass or trophic cascade strength. We found support for a shift to smaller species with climate change through two mechanisms: (a) the direct effects of warming on developmental rates and (b) size-selective predation that altered the identity of species' that could colonize new higher elevation habitat. Our results suggest that predators can amplify the rate of range shifts by consuming larger-bodied residents and facilitating the establishment of new species. However, the effects of climate warming were dampened by reducing the average body size of community members, leading to no net change in ecosystem function, despite higher growth rates. This work suggests that trophic interactions play a role in the reorganization of regional communities under climate warming.","[Jones, Natalie T.; Symons, Celia C.; Cavalheri, Hamanda; Shurin, Jonathan B.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Ecol Behav & Evolut, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Symons, Celia C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol Behav & Evolut, Irvine, CA USA; [Pedroza-Ramos, Adriana] Univ Pedag & Tecnol Colombia, Unidad Ecol Sistemas Acuat UDESA, Tunja, Colombia; [Jones, Natalie T.] Univ Queensland, Dept Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Jones, Natalie T.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Ecol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","Jones, NT (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Ecol Behav & Evolut, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.; Jones, NT (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Dept Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.; Jones, NT (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Ecol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",natalietjones@gmail.com,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1457737],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1457737",,75,0,0,5,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

This species has also been found to have an expanding global distribution leading to questions about its ability to successfully invade into a variety of communities. The goal of the present study was to build on previous knowledge and to examine the possible mechanisms that allow Didemnum to successfully invade fouling communities in eastern Long Island Sound. In separate experiments, we examined whether species richness and spatial resources (i.e. open space) influenced invasion success. Communities at 2 sites, a protected marina and an open coast site, were compared. In the first experiment, small colonies of Didemnum were transplanted into communities that contained different species richness levels (0, 2,4, 6 spp.) and in the second, small colonies of Didemnum were transplanted into communities that varied in the amount of species cover (0, 60, 50, 100%) that was present. The growth of Didemnum, as well as species initially present and any new species from recruitment was measured each week for approximately 10 weeks. Communities with high amounts of initial open space, regardless of species richness, tended to result in increased abundances of Didemnum at the open coast site and initially at the protected marina. At the marina site, growth of recruits and resident species resulted in the rapid loss of space in all treatments in both experiments, which reduced the success of Didemnum. At the open coast site, without increased competition from recruiting species, Didemnum became more abundant and eventually dominated many of the communities in all treatments. Despite being a global invader, Didemnum appears to be a relatively poor competitor for spatial resources. Its dominance seems to depend on the amount of unoccupied space present within communities it's invading. That, coupled with high recruitment from a diverse community, can overwhelm the potential invasion success of this species.

Carya tomentosa seed predation was also reduced by increasing distance from the forest edge. In addition to litter and distance effects, differing starting densities of Acer rubrum seeds significantly affected predation rates but Fraxinus americana rates were not affected. Also, predation was greater under patches of woody vegetation compared to herbaceous patches. All results show spatial variation.

The interactions between calanoid and cyclopoid copepods were examined in a 2. A diminishing ratio of calanoids to cyclopoids was observed. The responses, however, were species specific. While two cyclopoid species responded with increased populations (Cyclops vicinus, Thermocyclops oithonoides), one species exhibited marked declines (C. kolensis). Other species extended the duration of their pelagic phase (Mesocyclops leuckarti, Diacyclops bicuspidatus, T. oithonoides, C. vicinus), leading to higher population overlaps. Eudiaptomus graciloides and E. gracilis, which used to be present throughout the year, were more frequently absent. 3. These changes coincided with a series of mild winters during which prey availability (algae and rotifers) was high. 4. Enhanced prey availability, in conjunction with a flexible diapausing strategy, are hypothesized to underly the increased success of C, vicinus. Predatory losses due to early occurrence and enhanced abundances of C. vicinus, rather than competition for the same food resources, are hypothesized to be responsible for the declines of C. kolensis and Eudiaptomus. 5. Summer species tended to develop higher abundances early in the season, which led to enhanced seasonal means during spring.

In coastal Newfoundland, Canada, capelin Mallotus villosus is the focal forage fish species that many top predators feed on during the summer: however, inshore availability varies throughout the boreal summer when abundant aggregations migrate inshore to spawn. We investigated the interactions and responses of Great Shearwaters Ardenna gravis and Sooty Shearwaters A. grisea during their non-breeding season to supplemental food supply under changing natural prey availability (higher and lower capelin availability) by conducting an at-sea experiment during July-August (2015/2016) in coastal Newfoundland. Supplemental food was offered every 30 s over 10 min (`experimental period'), which was preceded and followed by 10-min control periods (i.e., no food provided). The number of both species increased during the experimental periods, indicating that both species were attracted to the food supplementation experiment. Great Shearwaters were 7.6-13.8 times more likely than Sooty Shearwaters to land near the experimental platform and 95.2 times more likely than Sooty Shearwaters to fight over supplemental food items with individuals of the same or different species. These species-specific tendencies remained consistent as prey availability varied within years, but both species increased in their abundance and interactions with other species (including Herring Gulls Larus argentatus and Northern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialis) during prey capture at lower relative to higher prey availability, as evidenced by lower proportions of flying birds and a greater likelihood of landing on the water. Overall, we suggest that when Great and Sooty shearwaters feed in close association, Great Shearwaters are the more competitively dominant species, which may lead to higher risks of by-catch mortality, especially when the availability of natural prey decreases.","[Carvalho, Paloma C.; Maynard, Laurie D.; Davoren, Gail K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Carvalho, PC (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",ccpaloma@gmail.com,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2014-06290, 470195-2015, 486208-2016]; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program; Manitoba Graduate Fellowship; CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education PersonnelCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001203/2013-04]","This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (2014-06290) to GKD; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Ship Time Grants (470195-2015, 486208-2016) to GKD; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program grants (2015-2016) to GKD; Manitoba Graduate Fellowship to LDM, and CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (001203/2013-04) to PCC.

While in mobile species the outcome of interference at a local scale can usually be determined from differences in body size and behavior, the population-level consequences of such interactions vary depending on rates of settlement and recruitment at a site, which are not directly correlated to local reproductive success. Previous experimental studies in central Chile demonstrated that interference competition for refuges is the primary factor driving microhabitat segregation between the predatory crabs Acanthocyclus gayi and Acanthocyclus hassleri, with the latter species monopolizing galleries inside mussel beds and excluding A. gayi to rock crevices. Between April 2001 and March 2006 we quantified monthly recruitment rates in artificial collectors at 17 sites over 900 km of the central coast of Chile. Results show that recruitment rates of A. hassleri are almost two orders of magnitude lower than those of A. gayi, and that they are tightly and positively correlated among sites across the region, suggesting that at scales of kilometers larval stages of these species are affected by similar oceanographic processes. Total crab densities per site were also positively correlated between species and strongly associated to mussel cover, with overall low crab densities at all sites where mussel cover was lower than about 60%. At all sites with mussel cover > 60%, the ratio of A. gayi to A. hassleri density progressively decreased from recruits (2.6) to juveniles (0.5) to adults (0.04), overcoming initial differences in recruitment rates. The relative success of the inferior competitor at sites with low mussel cover does not appear to provide a potential mechanism favoring regional coexistence through dispersal to other sites (mass effects), because their densities were lower than at sites of high mussel cover. Yet, at many sites of low mussel cover the dominant competitor is virtually absent, allowing A. gayi to attain larger population sizes at the scale of the region. Thus, the factors limiting the dominant competitor from successfully utilizing other microhabitats seem to be the most critical factor in promoting both local and regional coexistence between these species.","[Navarrete, Sergio A.; Parrague, Mirtala; Wieters, Evie A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile; [Navarrete, Sergio A.; Parrague, Mirtala; Wieters, Evie A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile","Navarrete, SA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",snavarrete@bio.puc.cl,"Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013","Parrague, Mirtala/0000-0002-7899-3263",,,,54,10,10,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Larvae of the latter can prey on other maggots, including that of their own species as facultative food. This facultative characteristic of C. rufifacies may enhance its competitive advantage over other maggots and could also change the situation of other coexisting colonies. In this study, these two species were colonized in the laboratory, and the main objective was to try to understand the effect of competition on larval development. According to our results, intraspecific competition mostly occurred as competition for food; when the rearing density was increased, larvae pupated earlier, resulting in a lighter adult dry weight. The tendencies were similar in both species, but C megacephala developed smaller viable adults and had higher survivorship at high densities. Although C. rufifacies could use the food resource of cannibalism, its survivorship was still low. Our results also showed there were significant interactions between intraspecific competition and the density factor. However, with interspecific competition, the first-instar larvae of C. rufifacies invaded maggot masses of C. megacephala to feed together. The third instars of C. rufifacies were able to expel C. megacephala larvae from food by using a fleshy protrusion on their body surface; C. megacephala was usually forced to pupate earlier by shortening its larval stages. The results indicated that a temporary competitive advantage could only be obtained by C. rufifacies under a proper larval density. In addition, the effects on different larval stages, the responses to different competition intensities, and the temperature-dependent effects on interspecific competition are also discussed. In general, under mixed-species rearing at different temperatures and densities, larval duration, adult dry weight, and survivorship, of both species decreased. However, our results did not completely agree with previous studies, and we suspect that the difference was partially caused by different experimental designs and different biological characters of different blow fly colonies. Our results also suggest that both the predation ability and defense or escape activity should be taken into account when evaluating larval competitive advantages. The durations of larval stages of these two species could be decreased by approximate to 54 h when a single species was reared alone and food was limited; the largest reduction in larval duration, approximate to 25 h in C. megacephala and 34 h in C. rufifacies, caused by interspecific competition was under a high larval density. In conclusion, competition decreased the larval duration of these two species by up to 2 d; this also draws attention to justifying the postmortem interval estimation of using larval developmental data when larval competition exists.","[Shiao, Shiuh-Feng; Yeh, Ta-Chuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Shiao, SF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",sfshiao@ntu.edu.tw,,"SHIAO, SHIUH-FENG/0000-0002-4213-0423",,,,33,36,37,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2585,1938-2928,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Because spring peepers are believed to be poor competitors, I hypothesized that competition from green frog larvae limits the distribution of spring peeper larvae. I stocked field enclosures with a constant density of spring peeper larvae, and one of four densities of green frog larvae (a ''target-neighbor'' design). Increased green frog density had a small effect on metamorphic size and no effects on survivorship, larval period or growth rates of spring peepers. In contrast to these small interspecific effects, green frogs had a large effect on their own performance. Intraspecific competition resulted in a 50% decline in growth rate and an 11% decline in metamorphic size. These results suggest that the species are segregated in resource use, or that compared with green frogs, spring peepers are better able to cope with depressed resource densities. In either case, this field experiment provides no evidence that interspecific competition from green frogs limits distributions of spring peepers.

Recent models examining the ways in which spatial pattern in the landscape will influence the outcome of species interactions assume a trade-off between colonization ability and competitive ability in the interacting species. We tested for differential colonization and competitive ability in two interacting species of wolf spider (Hogna helluo and Pardosa milvina) which co-occur in agricultural and early successional habitats in the eastern USA. We conducted our research in replicated experimental soybean plots in which we created islands of enhanced habitat by supplementing natural litter and enhancing weed growth. Our experimental manipulations were repeated once for each of the two spider species: (1) spiders added, (2) prey attractants (composted vegetable waste) added, (3) spiders and prey attractants added, and (4) one control, for a total of eight subplots. We replicated the experiment six times, three times each in conventionally tilled fields and conservation tilled fields. We censused these plots at the end of the summer and found that conspecific addition significantly elevated numbers of one species (H. helluo) but not the other (P. milvina). These findings were consistent with our predictions that H. helluo is limited in colonization ability when compared to P. milvina, The addition of prey attractants significantly elevated numbers of both species, but the effect was far stronger for the superior colonist (P. milvina). This indicates that P. milvina is able to track resource abundance (both habitat structure and prey), a trait correlated with colonization ability. We found no strong evidence for a negative effect of H. helluo addition on numbers of P. milvina, as would be predicted if H. helluo strongly competed with or significantly preyed upon P, milvina. Body condition of P, milvina was lowest in subplots with higher numbers of H. helluo, indicating that H. helluo may have influenced the foraging success of P. milvina. We also found a strong and unexpected effect of the context of the plots (background tillage regime) on numbers of P. milvina, with there being approximately twice the P. milvina in the subplots in conventionally tilled fields.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Marshall, SD (corresponding author), Hiram Coll, Dept Biol, JH Barrow Field Stn, Hiram, OH 44234 USA.",marshallsd@hiram.edu,"Walker, Sean E/A-4722-2008","Walker, Sean/0000-0001-9310-3305",,,,36,56,58,0,37,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2000,81,12,,,,,3341,3349,,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,387QZ,WOS:000166134400008,,,,,2021-09-27,

There is no theoretical limit to the number of levels in a facilitation cascade, yet the existence of more than two has rarely been examined. We manipulated biogenic substrate produced by a primary facilitator (cockle shells) and a secondary facilitator (barnacles and their empty tests) in a space-limited subtidal community to test the hypothesis that solitary ascidians would be the third-level facilitator. In the field, most ascidians were found on barnacles, and most barnacles occupied cockle shells. To produce this pattern, barnacles could nurse ascidians (a longer 'facilitation chain') or outcompete them from cockle shells (a shorter chain). Experimental results clearly supported the nursing hypothesis providing evidence for a facilitation cascade with three hierarchical levels of foundation species. Our findings confirm that like predation and competition, positive interspecific interactions nest into multi-tier hierarchies with numerous levels. While the number of foundation species should increase community stability and resilience as it increases diversity and reduces environmental stress, facilitation chain length may have the opposite effect.","[Yakovis, Eugeniy; Artemieva, Anna] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia","Yakovis, E (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",eugene@yakovis.com,"Artemieva, Anna/AAD-9578-2019; Yakovis, Evgeny/M-8540-2019","Yakovis, Evgeny/0000-0003-3489-3671; Artemieva, Anna/0000-0002-1935-7021","Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [02-04-50020, 05-04-48927, 05-04-63041, 06-04-63077, 07-04-10075, 08-04-01373, 08-04-10109, 09-04-10092, 10-04-10094, 11-04-01248, 11-04-10031, 12-04-10059, 13-04-10178, 14-04-00972, 14-04-10124, 17-04-00651]","We thank Michael Fokin, Michael Smirnov, Vladimir Krapivin,.arina Varfolomeeva, Dmitry Grebelniy, Sergey Grebelniy, Vladislav Dzhurinskiy, Anna Kuritsina, Alexey Filinovitch, Nastasia Arkhipova, Anastasia Koval, Michael Yakovis, Natalia Shunatova and Alexey Grishankov for their assistance in the field.

In its introduced range, it is a predator of lumbricid earthworms. To assess the impact of A. triangulatus on earthworm species, flatworm distributions were manipulated into 'high', control and 'low' densities within a replicated field experiment. Earthworm biomass in the 'high' flatworm density treatment was significantly lower than the control or 'low' treatments. This was due to a reduction in the anecic species Lumbricus terrestris and, to a lesser extent, Aporrectodea longa. There was little evidence of negative effects on other earthworm species, with even a weakly positive relationship between flatworm density and epigeic biomass. Principal components analysis showed a clear separation of anecic species from A. triangulatus, but the epigeic species Lumbricus festivus and Lumbricus rubellus grouped with A. triangulatus, suggesting that they could be benefitting from reduced intraguild competition. Flatworm densities of 0.8 per m(2), comparable to natural infestations in grassland, were predicted to give a reduction in total earthworm biomass of c. 20 %. The bulk of this was comprised of a reduction in anecic species biomass. In particular, it is considered that A. triangulatus poses a serious risk to L. terrestris populations, with implications for soil functioning and indigenous earthworm-feeding wildlife.","[Murchie, Archie K.; Gordon, Alan W.] Agri Food & Biosci Inst, Belfast BT9 5PX, Antrim, North Ireland","Murchie, AK (corresponding author), Agri Food & Biosci Inst, Newforge Lane, Belfast BT9 5PX, Antrim, North Ireland.",archie.murchie@afbini.gov.uk,,,Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (Northern Ireland); Scottish Government Enterprise and Environment Directorate,"This study has been a long time in the completion, not only did the field work take almost 4 years but there were over 25,000 individual earthworms identified and weighed.

This level of risk will be determined by the costs (i.e., lost foraging opportunities) and benefits (i.e.. reduced probability of mortality) associated with predator avoidance. We tested the hypothesis that the optimal trade-off between obtaining additional food and avoiding predators is species specific with four species of Pacific salmon: chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho (O. kisutch), chum (O. keta), and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha). We also tested the relative vulnerability of the salmon to the predator used in our experiments. Our results demonstrated that chinook salmon were significantly more willing to risk exposure to a predator to obtain additional food than were chum and coho salmon. Pink salmon were intermediate between chinook and the other species. Furthermore, this difference exceeded that which could be explained by variation in length and weight between species. Experiments to test vulnerability to the predator indicated that coho salmon were significantly less vulnerable to the predator than were chinook and chum salmon. If these behavioral differences persist throughout their lives, there should also be differences in the population response of these salmon species to fluctuation in predator density.","FISHERIES & OCEANS CANADA,PACIFIC BIOL STN,FISHERIES RES BRANCH,NANAIMO V9R 5K6,BC,CANADA",,,,"Abrahams, Mark/0000-0002-9969-2988",,,,22,29,30,0,7,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,1993,66,3,,,,,439,446,,10.2307/3544938,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KZ326,WOS:A1993KZ32600008,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, consideration of this phenomenon in seed and seedling predation studies has been limited, perhaps explaining some of the variation observed between studies and the difficulty in generalizing about the impacts of herbivores on successional processes. I examined the prevalence and patterns of spatial autocorrelation in seed and seedling survival between neighboring tree propagules in old-fields. All experiments were conducted within enclosures in which I manipulated the density of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Voles, and competitively inferior white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), are the dominant consumers of tree seedlings and seeds in old-fields in the northeastern United States, respectively. An intermediate level of spatial autocorrelation was present in seed and seedling predation trials. Furthermore. the frequency of spatial autocorrelation increased under low-vole density conditions and in study sites with greater heterogeneity in vegetation cover. Survival of neighboring tree propagules was generally positively autocorrelated, suggesting that foraging by mice and voles contributes to a clumped pattern of tree propagule establishment in old-fields. A review of published predation studies found that only 8.3% attempted to test for spatial autocorrelation and that the minimum average spacing used between replicates is well below the average autocorrelation distance of 8.1 +/- 6.3 m observed in the current study. Patterns of autocorrelation appear somewhat predictable based on knowledge of the ecology of mice and voles and to provide insights into the factors influencing their foraging behavior and potential impacts on old-field succession.","Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Manson, RH (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Dept Ecol Vegetal, Antigua Carretera Coutepec Km 2-5,AP 63, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico.",manson@ecologia.edu.mx,"Manson, Robert H/Q-9015-2018; Manson, Robert Hunter/AAD-6443-2021","Manson, Robert H/0000-0001-9732-8894; ",,,,52,11,11,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2000,91,1,,,,,162,174,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910116.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,372ML,WOS:000165237400016,,,,,2021-09-27,

Outcomes of this intersexual competition can vary by species and habitat, but information has been collected for only a small subset of migrant species. We investigated the available food resources, sex ratios, and body condition of territorial Bicknell's Thrushes (Catharus bicknelli) wintering in the Dominican Republic between 1999 and 2008 at two ecologically distinct wet-forest sites, one in high-elevation cloud forest and the other in mid-elevation rainforest. Arthropod abundance was greater in cloud forest habitat, which was occupied by proportionally more males, the larger-bodied sex (74% male). By contrast, both sexes occurred at parity in rainforest habitat (53% male), where soft-bodied fruit was the predominant dietary resource. Body condition of cloud forest males was comparable to that of rainforest males, but cloud forest females were in poorer body condition than rainforest females. Females at the cloud forest site may face a greater likelihood of agonistic interactions with larger-bodied males and the thermoregulatory demands of roosting in colder night temperatures (0-12 degrees C). We suggest that there are sex-specific advantages of wintering in these two habitats and that both are critical to supporting the full demographic structure of Bicknell's Thrush populations. Rainforest habitats, which are highly vulnerable to agricultural development in the Dominican Republic, may be particularly important to female survival during the winter period.

However, empirical studies have often demonstrated enhanced prey suppression despite intraguild predation. A recent theoretical study proposed the hypothesis that, when the intermediate predator is cannibalistic, intraguild predation can reduce cannibalism within the intermediate predator population, leading to little change in intermediate predator mortality and thus enhanced prey suppression. The goal of this study was to examine this hypothesis empirically. Two summer-long field enclosure experiments were conducted in cotton fields. We investigated the effects of adding an intraguild predator, Zelus renardii, on (1) the abundance of a cannibalistic intermediate predator, Geocoris pallens, (2) the abundance of a herbivore, Lygus hesperus, and (3) cotton plant performance. G. pallens adult abundance did not increase, even when food availability was high and natural enemies were absent, suggesting that density-dependent cannibalism imposes an upper limit on its densities. Furthermore, although Z. renardii is an intraguild predator of G. pallens, G. pallens long-term densities were unaffected by Z. renardii. In the presence of the intermediate predator, the addition of the intraguild predator Z. renardii enhanced suppression of L. hesperus, and there were suggestions that Z. renardii and G. pallens partitioned the L. hesperus population. Effects of herbivore suppression cascaded to the plant level, improving plant performance. In conclusion, we provide empirical support for the hypothesis that the addition of an intraguild predator may enhance prey suppression if the intermediate predator expresses density-dependent cannibalism. Intraguild predation and cannibalism co-occur in many communities; thus their joint effects may be broadly important in shaping predator effects on herbivores and plant performance.","[Law, Yao-Hua; Rosenheim, Jay A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Law, YH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ylaw@ucdavis.edu,"Law, Yao Hua/A-9477-2012",,"USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [ARZT-358320-G-30-505, 2006-01761]; California State Support Board of Cotton Incorporated; van den Bosch Memorial Scholarship","Andrew Forbes, Rick Karban, Sharon Lawler, Soroush Parsa, Andy Sih, and Louie Yang provided helpful comments on the manuscript.

A barnacle Balanus crenatus is a native foundation species in the shallow subtidal of the White Sea (65 degrees N), hosting a diverse (250+ species) assemblage of macrobenthic organisms. On mixed sediments live barnacles share primary substrates (shells and gravel) with numerous empty barnacle tests, 7% of which had drill holes of an unidentified origin. We manipulated the densities of (i) adult muricid whelks Boreotrophon clathratus (of previously unknown feeding habits), to check if they prey on barnacles, (ii) other predators to reveal their effect on juvenile Boreotrophon, and (iii) empty tests to assess the community-wide effect of predation on barnacles. The abundance of drilled empty tests in the field correlated with that of Boreotrophon. A year-long caging experiment clearly confirmed predation, showing the highest barnacle mortality and proportion of drilled tests in whelk enclosures, and the lowest-in predator exclosure treatments. Boreotrophon preferred the barnacles attached to conspecifics to those from primary substrates. Because of its scarcity Boreotrophon had a minor direct effect on barnacle abundance in the field. Yet, initially defaunated empty tests and live barnacles developed markedly different macrobenthic assemblages, suggesting a strong indirect effect of the predation. Juvenile Boreotrophon were 5-6 times less abundant in open and partial cages than in exclosures and enclosures, which indicates that the recruitment and, consequently, the abundance of Boreotrophon and its predation on Balanus are top-down controlled by apex predators. In contrast, in tropical and temperate intertidal the predation on barnacles is stronger and primarily limited by environmental stress and prey availability.","[Yakovis, Eugeniy; Artemieva, Anna] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia","Yakovis, E (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",eugene@yakovis.com,"Yakovis, Evgeny/M-8540-2019; Yakovis, Evgeny L./A-9680-2008; Artemieva, Anna/AAD-9578-2019","Yakovis, Evgeny/0000-0003-3489-3671; Yakovis, Evgeny L./0000-0003-3489-3671; Artemieva, Anna/0000-0002-1935-7021","Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [13-04-10178, 14-04-00972, 14-04-10124]","The research was supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research (http://www.rfbr.ru) grant numbers 13-04-10178, 14-04-00972, and 14-04-10124 received by EY.",,55,4,4,0,19,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUL 17,2015,10,7,,,,,,,e0132973,10.1371/journal.pone.0132973,,,24,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CN1RV,WOS:000358198700079,26186648,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-27,

Migrants arrive at their breeding areas later than their main avian predators, European Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). We provide evidence that avian predators are a major factor modifying the breeding bird assemblage of a large field. The distribution of kestrels (hence, predation) was manipulated using nest boxes, which are the only nesting places in open farmland. We counted birds on nine 25-ha plots in which a kestrel pair bred, and on nine control areas situated >1000 m from the nearest kestrel nest in large agricultural fields during early summer 1992. We also counted birds on 15 transect lines (length 1000 m, width 100 m) radiating away from kestrel nests. Observations of the hunting behavior of breeding kestrels showed that kestrels mostly captured their prey items <1000 m from their nest. Breeding bird density was higher on control areas than on areas close to a kestrel nest. In particular, densities of migratory and small birds (body mass <140 g), which are potential prey of kestrels, were lowest near the predator nests. In contrast, the densities of nonmigratory and large-sized birds (body mass >140 g) were independent of the presence of kestrel nests. Skylarks (Alauda arvensis), the most abundant migratory species in the study area, bred less often near kestrel nests than farther away. The results of line transect counts corroborated results of area counts. Our conclusion is that predation risk influences habitat selection of small migratory species in open habitats where scarce vegetative cover gives little protection.","UNIV JYVASKYLA, DEPT BIOL, SF-40351 JYVASKYLA, FINLAND; UNIV HELSINKI, DEPT ZOOL, DIV ECOL, SF-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND; UNIV TURKU, DEPT BIOL, ECOL ZOOL LAB, SF-20500 TURKU, FINLAND",,,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Suhonen, Jukka/0000-0001-8546-8945",,,,65,84,87,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,,,,,1626,1634,,10.2307/1939623,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,WOS:A1994PE26700011,,,,,2021-09-27,

In single species rearing, the number of larvae of both species decreased during the latter developmental stages, mainly due to cannibalism. When prey was abundant, the survival of both species improved; however, in mixed species rearing, the mortality of C. septempunctata brucki due to cannibalism or intraguild predation was higher than in single species rearing, whereas the mortality was lower in H. axyridis. Consequently, the survival of C. septempunctata brucki decreased while that of H. axyridis improved. In addition, in the 18 intraguild predation events observed, H. axyridis was always the intraguild predator and C. septempunctata brucki was its prey. Thus, when these two species co-exist in the field, H. axyridis is likely to be an important intraguild predator of C septempunctata brucki. In addition, when prey is scarce, it is likely that cannibalism and intraguild predation become more important factors in the intra and interspecific relationships of these two species.","[Sato, Satoru; Shinya, Katsuhiro; Yasuda, Hironori] Yamagata Univ, Dept Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan; [Kindlmann, Pavel] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Dixon, Anthony F.

Spatial variability includes short-range neighbour-dependent interactions and small-scale spatial structure, such asclusteringwhere individuals aggregate together, andsegregationwhere individuals are spaced apart from one another. Yet, a large class of mathematical models aimed at representing these processes ignores these factors by making a classical mean-field approximation, where interactions between individuals are assumed to occur in proportion to their average density. Such mean-field approximations amount to ignoring spatial structure. In this work, we consider an individual-based model of a two-species community that is composed ofconsumersandresources. The model describes migration, predation, competition and dispersal of offspring, and explicitly gives rise to varying degrees of spatial structure. We compare simulation results from the individual-based model with the solution of a classical mean-field approximation, and this comparison provides insight into how spatial structure can drive the system away from mean-field dynamics. Our analysis reveals that mechanisms leading to intraspecific clustering and interspecific segregation, such as short-range predation and short-range dispersal, tend to increase the size of the resource species relative to the mean-field prediction. We show that under certain parameter regimes these mechanisms lead to the extinction of consumers whereas the classical mean-field model predicts the coexistence of both species.","[Surendran, Anudeep; Simpson, Matthew J.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Plank, Michael J.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Math & Stat, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Plank, Michael J.] Te Punaha Matatini, Auckland, New Zealand","Simpson, MJ (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",anudeep.surendran@hdr.qut.edu.au; michael.plank@canterbury.ac.nz; matthew.simpson@qut.edu.au,"Surendran, Anudeep/ABF-5218-2020","Surendran, Anudeep/0000-0003-0777-4642",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170100474]; New Zealand Centre of Research Excellence,"This work is supported by the Australian Research Council (DP170100474).

However, other factors also contribute to these patterns. For example, theoretical studies as well as two survey-based studies have all suggested that dispersal may also impact these patterns. While natural communities commonly have nonrandom patterns of negative co-occurrence, understanding how different processes drive these patterns requires further research. We tested the influence of dispersal on co-occurrence patterns using a zooplankton mesocosm experiment with four different dispersal treatments varying in the number of dispersers delivered into mesocosms on regular intervals. Our dispersal treatments were intended to adjust the relative importance of dispersal and competition experienced within mesocosms (i.e., high dispersal results in a relatively low influence of competition on species composition and vice versa). Higher dispersal translated into increased zooplankton species richness and inter-mesocosm compositional similarity, and also changed species occupancy patterns such that species occurrences were more even across mesocosms in higher-dispersal treatments. Dispersal treatments also differed markedly in species co-occurrence patterns. Negative co-occurrence patterns were significant for all but the lowest-dispersal treatment, peaked in the intermediate-dispersal treatments, and declined in the highest-dispersal treatment. Stability analyses illustrate that co-occurrence differences are robust to the exclusion of any single mesocosm in null model analyses. Dispersal treatments did not significantly differ with respect to abiotic variation, which has been recognized as a potential driver of negative co-occurrence patterns. These results suggest that not only can dispersal influence patterns of negative co-occurrence via changes to species richness and distribution (occupancy patterns among mesocosms), but the degree to which they do so varies nonlinearly with the strength of dispersal. Critically, because negative co-occurrence patterns were nonsignificant when the contribution of dispersal was lowest, it is possible that dispersal contributes strongly to many observed patterns of negative co-occurrence. Consequently, great care should be taken prior to interpreting significant co-occurrence tests as a product of species interactions.","[Schamp, Brandon S.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, PQ P6A 2G4, Canada; [Arnott, Shelley E.; Joslin, Katelyn L.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Schamp, BS (corresponding author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, PQ P6A 2G4, Canada.",brandon.schamp@algomau.ca,,"Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We thank D.

Here I present experimental evidence on the response of two species of gerbils (Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum) to the presence of barn owls. I conducted the experiments in a large aviary. Both gerbils responded to the presence of barn owl predators by foraging in fewer resource patches (seed trays) and by quitting foraged resource patches at a higher resource harvest rate (giving-up density of resource; GUD). This reduced the amount of time gerbils were exposed to owl predation, and hence the encounter rate of owls with gerbils, i.e., behavioral resource depression. Thus, the presence of owls imposes a foraging cost on gerbils due to risk of predation, and also on the owls themselves due to resource depression. I then examined how resource depression relaxed over time following exposure to owls. In the days following an encounter with the predator, the reduction in foraging activity for both gerbil species eased. Increasing numbers of trays were foraged each day, and GUDs in seed trays declined. The two gerbils differed in their rate of recovery, with G. pyramidum returning to prepredator levels of foraging after 1 or 2 nights and G. allenbyi taking 5 nights or longer. Interspecific differences in recovery rates may be based on differences between the species in vulnerability to predation and/or ability to detect the presence of predators. The differences in recovery rates may be due to optimal memory windows or decay rates, where differences between species are based on risk of predation or on how perceived risk changes with time since a predator was last encountered. Finally, differences between or among competitors in recovery from resource depression may provide foraging opportunities in time for the species which recover most quickly and may have implications for species coexistence.",,"KOTLER, BP (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,JACOB BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES,MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL,IL-84993 SEDE BOQER,ISRAEL.",,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,41,63,65,0,18,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

We used 140-cm long tanks (gravel substratum), divided into seven compartments. We introduced 25 residents into the outermost compartment, separated with a barrier. After 1 h, we introduced 25 intruders. After the next 1 h, we removed the barrier and the gammarids dispersed in the tank. After 4 or 20 h, we counted the gammarids in the compartments. We tested all pairwise species combinations and single-species controls. Dikerogammarus villosus displaced other species (P. robustoides only after 4 h) and reduced its own motility after 20 h in their presence. Pontogammarus robustoides stimulated the short-time migrations of D. villosus intruders and of D. haemobaphes. As P. robustoides migrated spontaneously much more than Dikerogammarus spp., its impact decreased after longer time. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes stimulated the short-time movement of P. robustoides intruders but reduced the long-time relocation of this species. In general, gammarid dispersal increased in the presence of stronger competitors (D. villosus and P. robustoides, especially residents) and decreased in response to weaker competitors (D. haemobaphes). Thus, competitive interactions may affect dispersal of invasive gammarids and contribute to the fastest spread of the weakest competitor, D. haemobaphes observed in the field, whereas the strongest species, D. villosus was the latest newcomer in many novel areas.","[Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland; [Rachalewski, Michal; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina] Univ Lodz, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Hydrobiol, Lodz, Poland","Kobak, J (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland.",jkob73@umk.pl,"Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina/E-4234-2015","Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina/0000-0003-4498-5107","National Science CentreNational Science Centre, Poland [2011/03/D/NZ8/03012, 2012/05/B/NZ8/00479]",The authors would like to thank Lukasz Jermacz and Kamil Hupalo for help in collecting animals used in the experiments.

Resistance against an introduced fish can be through strong competition and/or predation from resident fishes. Here, the biotic resistance against introduced topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva (a highly invasive fish in Europe) by resident carp Cyprinus carpio was tested in experimental mesocosms. The introduction scenario was six adult P. parva (three male, three female) on a single occasion. Resistance to their establishment was provided by three and six resident C. carpio whose effects on P. parva growth and reproduction were compared to a Control (no resident fish at the time of introduction) and treatments containing three and six P. parva. After 120 days, the growth rates of the introduced P. parva were significantly depressed in C. carpio presence and in mesocosms with three C. carpio present, significantly decreased numbers of 0+P. parva were recorded. Where six C. carpio were present, no 0+P. parva were recorded, indicating resistance strength increased with carp abundance. In contrast, there were no differences in P. parva reproduction and growth rates between the Control and treatments containing conspecifics. Stable isotope analysis (delta N-15, delta C-13) revealed C. carpio were feeding at one trophic level above 0+P. parva, suggesting the process of resistance was predation (facultative piscivory) rather than competition. Thus, if P. parva are to establish and invade following an introduction, they must overcome this biotic resistance from cyprinid fishes such as C. carpio.","Bournemouth Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Ctr Conservat Ecol & Environm Change, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England","Britton, JR (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Ctr Conservat Ecol & Environm Change, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",rbritton@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Britton, Robert/AAO-6673-2020; Britton, Robert/B-5040-2009","Britton, Robert/0000-0003-1853-3086; Britton, Robert/0000-0003-1853-3086",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/H000429/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/H000429/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC research grant reference number NE/H000429/1).

The species has spread rapidly and now dominates many soft-bottom communities, where it dwells in burrows down to 30 cm deep in the sediment. In the Baltic Sea, below 10 m water depth, the macrobenthic community is composed of only a handful of species, among which the amphipod Monoporeia affinis is a key member. This species is highly mobile; it swims actively at night but remains burrowed in the sediment during the day. Due to similarities in feeding mode and sympatric occurrence, the polychaete may compete with the amphipod for both food and space. One plausible outcome of interactions between the 2 species is that the amphipod, the more mobile species, would avoid areas where the more sessile polychaete is present in high numbers. In the laboratory, we tested the hypothesis that, if given the choice, the amphipod avoids burrowing in sediment with high polychaete abundances. The amphipod burrowed in significantly lower numbers in patches with high polychaete abundance compared to those with lower abundance. Also, plastic tubes mimicking polychaete body structure were not avoided by the amphipods, indicating that the physical tube structure of the polychaetes does not explain the amphipod's choice of burrowing site. Furthermore, the amphipod did not increase or prolong swimming activities as a function of higher worm density, indicating that increased swimming activity over dense polychaete patches and subsequent migration away from them is not a likely explaination of why this amphipod burrow less frequently in patches of high polychaete abundance.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Neideman, R (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",rasmus.neideman@zoologi.su.se,"Olafsson, Emil/D-4916-2012",,,,,66,23,26,2,17,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Location We worked throughout the subalpine forest that encircles Mauna Kea Volcano, Hawaii Island, but we focused our studies mainly on the western slope between 2000 and 3000 m elevation, where the gradient of elevation was greatest and palila were most abundant. Methods We determined phenology and productivity patterns of the endemic dry-forest tree species, Sophora chrysophylla (Salisb.) Seem. (Fabaceae), or mamane, which provides Loxioides with most of their food, and another common endemic tree, Myoporum sandwicense A. Gray (Myoporaceae), or naio, which provides some resources, along a 786-m elevation gradient at monthly intervals for 10 years (Sophora only). We also determined the availability each month of moth larvae (Lepidoptera) for that were important in the diet of nestling and adult palila. In addition, we documented the incidence of parasitism on moth larvae by several wasp (Hymenoptera) and fly (Diptera) species, and we determined the distribution of predatory wasps and ants (Hymenoptera), which potentially threaten insect prey of birds. Percentage cover of alien grass species that pose fire threats in palila habitat and other weeds were assessed during one survey. Small mammal abundance and distribution were determined by trapping during three (rodent) or five (carnivore) surveys. Results Sophora flower and seed (pod) availability varied predictably along the elevation gradient, with about 4 months separating peaks in reproduction at high and low elevations. This, together with highly variable production of flowers and pods within elevation strata, resulted in Sophora resources being available to Loxioides throughout the year on the western slope of Mauna Kea. Sophora produced flowers and pods more seasonally where gradients of elevation were short; thus, resources were available less consistently. In contrast, Myoporum produced flowers and fruits with little variation with respect to season or elevation. The availability of important insect prey of Loxioides was also related to elevation, in part because threats to Lepidoptera larvae from parasitic wasps were generally less at higher elevations. Threats to insect prey from predatory ants was also less at higher elevations but the abundance of predatory wasps was not related to elevation. Several weeds that pose the most serious threats to Loxioides habitat were more abundant at mid and low elevations, and alien grass cover was somewhat greater at mid elevation, thereby increasing fire risks in the centre of Loxioides habitat. Predatory mammals, in particular Felis catus Linnaeus, were common throughout the subalpine forest of Mauna Kea. However, Rattus rattus Linnaeus was rare, especially at higher elevations, whereas Mus musculus Linnaeus was more abundant at lower elevations. Main conclusions Loxioides are concentrated in habitat that is distributed along a substantial gradient of elevation at least in part because food is available throughout the year and threats to food resources are less concentrated. To recover Loxioides elsewhere in its former range, habitats must be restored and alien threats reduced along extensive elevation gradients. Conservation along environmental gradients will likely benefit other Hawaiian birds that track the availability of food across landscapes or that have been stranded in the higher portions of their original ranges because of the greater impacts of alien diseases, predators, food competitors, and habitat stressors at lower elevations.","US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Kilauea Field Stn, Hawaii Natl Pk, HI 96718 USA","Banko, PC (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Kilauea Field Stn, POB 44, Hawaii Natl Pk, HI 96718 USA.",paul_banko@usgs.gov,,,,,,80,28,31,0,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

In the field, periphyton abundance on unglazed clay tiles was compared between tiles elevated above the stream bottom to exclude Psilotreta sp. from the grazing community and tiles placed directly on the stream bottom allowing access by all grazers. There was no significant difference in ash free dry mass (AFDM) or chlorophyll a between these two treatments at either site, suggesting that Psilotreta sp. had little affect on the periphyton community. In the laboratory, two sets of experimental stream chambers containing tiles with natural periphyton assemblages were used, and grazer densities within the chambers were varied to reflect the different densities of grazers at the field. After two weeks, neither Psilotreta sp. nor Stenonema sp. showed significant weight changes. However, survivorship of Stenonema sp. was inversely related to grazer density, suggesting that inter-or intra-specific competition may have existed at the highest grazer densities. Both AFDM and chlorophyll a were significantly higher in control chambers than chambers with grazers; also, there were no significant differences in AFDM or chlorophyll a concentration among the different grazer density treatments. Thus, unlike the field exclusion studies which showed no impact of Psilotreta sp. grazing on periphyton, laboratory studies showed pronounced grazing effects. These results suggest that our laboratory stream chambers may have influenced biotic (predation/competition) and/or abiotic (flow regime, etc.) factors allowing grazers to show more dramatic impacts on periphyton than occur in the natural environment. These results suggest that caution should be taken when extrapolating grazing effects observed in the laboratory to a field situation.","Colgate Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA","Fuller, RL (corresponding author), Colgate Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",,,,,,,30,5,5,0,7,OIKOS PUBL INC,LA CROSSE,"PO BOX 2558, LA CROSSE, WI 54601 USA",0270-5060,,,J FRESHWATER ECOL,J.

We tested the hypothesis that Gerbillus henleyi (de Winton 1903), the smallest species (10 g) of a pssamophilic guild in Israel, is scarce on relatively productive dunes of the Israeli desert, due to negative interactions from the common G. allenbyi (Thomas 1918) and G. pyramidum (Geoffroy 1825). 2. The alternative hypothesis was that scarcity on sand resulted from the size of its naked hind feet, that do not allow efficient locomotion on sand. 3. Despite their naked soles the weight-bearing surface of G. henleyi feet carry less mass/area than those of any other species. 4. We measured interaction coefficients with the two common species using field-manipulation experiments in two enclosures. 5. Habitat usage of G. henleyi changed from significantly preferring the stabilized sand, when alone, to significantly using the semistabilized dune, when G. allenbyi was also present. 6. We also estimated the interaction coefficients and calculated the G. henleyi's isoclines competing with the two common gerbil species using a technique we developed elsewhere. 7. The stability analysis of the isoclines of G. henleyi competing with either G. allenbyi or with G. pyramidum suggests that stable coexistence occurs when G. henleyi is relatively scarce while the competitors are common. 8. Interspecific competition from either G. allenbyi or G. pyramidum accounts for 90.3% reduction in G. henleyi density, relative to when it is alone. 9. We concluded that the negative interactions from congeners was the major cause for the scarcity of G. henleyi on the relatively rich sand dunes of the Israeli desert.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Abramsky, Z (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",zvika@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012","Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,31,7,9,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Chemical-insecticide-based mosquito control has been successful in reducing the burden of malaria. However, the emergence of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors and concerns about the effect of the chemicals on the environment, human health, and non-target organisms present a need for new or alternative vector control intervention tools. Biocontrol methods using aquatic invertebrate predators have emerged as a potential alternative and additional tool to control mosquito populations. Ecological control specifically makes use of species insights for improving the physical habitat conditions of competitors and predators of vectors. A first step towards this is to gain knowledge on the predation potential of several typically present macroinvertebrates. Hence, this study aimed at (1) examining the influence of the predation of hemipterans on the number of emerging adult mosquitoes and (2) detecting Anopheles mosquito DNA in the gut of those predators. The prey and predators were collected from a range of water bodies located in the Gilgel Gibe watershed, southwest Ethiopia. A semi-field study was carried out using mesocosms which were constructed using plastic containers mimicking the natural aquatic habitat of immature Anopheles mosquitoes. Adult mosquitoes that emerged from the mesocosms were collected using a mechanical aspirator. At the end of the experiment, predators were withdrawn from the mesocosms and identified to genus level. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was employed to identify sibling species of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and to detect Anopheles mosquito DNA in the gut of the predators. Data were analysed using R software. Giant water bugs (belostomatids) were the most aggressive predators of Anopheles larvae, followed by backswimmers (notonectids) and water boatmen (corixids). All female Anopheles gambiae s.l. emerged from the mesocosms were identified as Anopheles arabiensis. Anopheles arabiensis DNA was detected in the gut content of hemipteran specimens analysed from the three families. The number of the adult mosquitoes emerging from the mesocosms was affected by the presence of predators. The findings of this study provide evidence of the potential use of aquatic macroinvertebrate predators as biocontrol agents against immature Anopheles mosquitoes and their potential to be considered as a component of integrated vector management for insecticide resistance and the combined restoration of aquatic ecosystems via smart ecological engineering.","[Olkeba, Beekam Kebede; Goethals, Peter L.

However, evidence for this is still scarce, although there are several studies establishing a direct causal relationship between declining native species and the presence of the American mink. Thus, it is important to further investigate the responses of native species to the American mink in several habitats and locations to enhance our knowledge about the patterns of the effect of the mink in Spain, as well as to inform conservation actions. A field study of the impact of the American mink on a mountainous vertebrate community in central Spain is presented. We studied six species: two fish, one amphibian, one bird, and two mammals. The general results showed a species-specific sensitivity to mink presence, with the Mediterranean water shrew (Neomys anomalus) and the southern water vole (Arvicola sapidus) being the most affected because their ranges were significantly decreased after the introduction of the mink. Regarding the other species, neither their abundance nor range was apparently affected by the American mink. The predatory behavior of the mink and interactions with other carnivores could account for these results. These data aid in shedding light about the current impact of the mink on invaded areas of the Iberian Peninsula and highlight the variability of its effects, as well as the urgent need to establish a general program of control of the mink to avoid negative effects upon native prey communities. Furthermore, given the different responses of native species, we propose that measures to protect native species should be based on species-specific goals and attributes.","[Garcia-Diaz, Pablo; Arevalo, Valentin; Lizana, Miguel] Univ Salamanca, Dept Anim Biol, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Garcia-Diaz, Pablo] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Garcia-Diaz, Pablo] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Garcia-Diaz, P (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",pablo.garciadiaz@adelaide.edu.au,,"Garcia Diaz, Pablo/0000-0001-5402-0611","Government of the Junta de Castilla y Leon, SpainJunta de Castilla y Leon [18.JCY4 463A.C.03.

As the Earth's climate warms, interactions such as competition, predation, and mutualism are changing due to shifts in per capita interaction strength and the relative abundance of interacting species. Changes in interspecific relationships, in turn, can drive important local-scale changes in community dynamics, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning, and can potentially alter large-scale patterns of distribution and abundance. In many cases, the importance of indirect effects of warming, mediated by changing species interactions, will be greater-albeit less well understood-than direct effects in determining the community-and ecosystem-level outcomes of global climate change. Despite considerable community-specific idiosyncrasy, ecological theory and a growing body of data suggest that certain general trends are emerging at local scales: positive interactions tend to become more prevalent with warming, and top trophic levels are disproportionately vulnerable. In addition, important ecological changes result when the geographic overlap between species changes, and when the seasonal timing of life history events of interacting species falls into or out of synchrony. We assess the degree to which such changes are predictable, and urge advancement on several high priority questions surrounding the relationships between temperature and community ecology. An improved understanding of how assemblages of multiple, interacting species will respond to climate change is imperative if we hope to effectively prepare for and adapt to its effects.

Seven sites of 120 m(2) each with four transects were examined, counting the individuals per holothurian group: in total 1711 of which 1199 H. atra and 512 H. pardalis. The Morisita index of aggregation was applied to identify the spatial arrangement of individuals: random, uniform or clumped. Holothuria atra was found all around the atoll and densities varied between 0.03 to 4.78 ind m(-2). It showed a clumped distribution on the eastern side of the atoll, and random and uniform patterns on the western side. Its broad distribution was attributed to its being a 'habitat generalist species', its tolerance to high temperatures, and its ability reproduce both sexually and asexually. Holothuria pardalis was found in only one site with 4.27 ind m(-2) and a clumped distribution. The correlation of the Morisita index and density values of both species revealed that high densities were associated with a high degree of aggregation. This result led us to hypothesize that the clumped distribution of holothurians might provide protection against predators. Other ecological factors causing aggregations are discussed.","[Sanvicente-Anorve, Laura; Solis-Marin, Francisco A.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Circuito Exterior S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Solis-Weiss, Vivianne] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales, Puerto Morelos 77580, Q Roo, Mexico","Sanvicente-Anorve, L (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Circuito Exterior S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",lesa@unam.mx,,"Sanvicente Anorve, Laura Elena/0000-0002-0951-4564",UPF; AFD; MAEDI; MOM; French Government; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (ICML),"We would like to express our deepest thanks to C.

This reduction in native predators, competitors, and parasites may result in ecological release in the introduced range. However, biological interactions also can limit the establishment and spread of normative populations. The extent to which such biotic resistance occurs is poorly resolved., especially for marine ecosystems. Here we test whether a native predator, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, affects the abundance and geographic range of the introduced European green crab Carcinus maenas in eastern North America. Both crab species occur in shallow, soft-sediment habitats of bays and estuaries, and their ranges overlap in eastern North America. First, we tested for a negative relationship in the abundances of the two species from trap samples across a 640-km (5.78 degrees latitude) coastal transect. Second, we estimated variation in predation pressure on tethered Carcinus maenas across latitude and as a function of Callinectes sapidus abundance. Third, we measured predation rates on Carcinus maenas by Callinectes sapidus in field and laboratory experiments. Our results support the hypothesis that the native predator Callinectes sapidus provides biotic resistance to invasion and prevents the southward spread and establishment of Carcinus maenas. Within and across bays, Carcinus maenas were significantly less abundant at sites and depths with Callinectes sapidus compared with areas lacking Callinectes sapidus. Moreover, no Carcinus maenas were found in Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus were most abundant. Predation of tethered Carcinus maenas increased with Callinectes sapidus abundance. In laboratory and field experiments, Callinectes sapidus preyed readily on Carcinus maenas. Thus, we conclude the predation by Callinectes sapidus, alone or in combination with other factors, limits the abundance and geographic range of an invasive marine species.","Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; Rider Univ, Dept Biol, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA","deRivera, CE (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28,647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",deriverac@si.edu,,"Ruiz, Gregory/0000-0003-2499-441X",,,,65,215,223,5,135,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2005,86,12,,,,,3364,3376,,10.1890/05-0479,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,994YI,WOS:000234066700028,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

We conducted for the first time field experiments that involved exposing natural populations of the mosquito species Culex pipiens to: a) application of the biological insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), b) the introduction of natural competitors (a crustacean community composed mainly of Daphnia spp.), or c) a combined treatment that involved both introduction of a crustacean community and the application of Bti. The treatment that involved only the introduction of crustaceans had no significant effect on mosquito larval populations, while treatment with Bti alone caused only a significant reduction in the abundance of mosquito larvae in the short-term (within 310 days after treatment). In contrast, the combined treatment rapidly reduced the abundance of mosquito larvae, which remained low throughout the entire observation period of 28 days. Growth of the introduced crustacean communities was favored by the immediate reduction in the abundance of mosquito larvae following Bti administration, thus preventing recolonization of ponds by mosquito larvae at the late period (days 1428 after treatment). Both competition and the temporal order of establishment of different species are hence important mechanisms for efficient and sustainable mosquito control.","[Kroeger, Iris; Liess, Matthias; Duquesne, Sabine] UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, Leipzig, Germany; [Dziock, Frank] Univ Appl Sci, HTW Dresden, Dept Agr & Landscape Management, Dresden, Germany; [Duquesne, Sabine] UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Biol Conservat, Leipzig, Germany","Liess, M (corresponding author), UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, Leipzig, Germany.",matthias.liess@ufz.de,"Liess, Matthias/A-8582-2009","Liess, Matthias/0000-0002-3321-8909",Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through the Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE),We are grateful to our colleague Kaarina Foit at the Department of System Ecotoxicology for her indispensable help and support with the statistical analysis.

Antibiosis can occur through the release of plant chemicals from the roots into the soil, which malt adversely affect the host-finding behavior of the infective stage nematode, or the presence of these chemicals in the host insect may negatively affect nematode reproduction. In laboratory studies, intra-specific and inter-specific competition reduces nematode fitness, and inter-specific competition can cause local extinction of a nematode species. For example, after concomitant infection of a host, a steinernematid species usually excludes a heterorhabditid species. The mechanism for the steinernematid superiority has been postulated to be a bacteriocin(s) produced by Xenorhabdus, the symbiotic bacterium of the steinernematid which prevents Photorhabdus, the symbiotic bacterium of the heterorhabditid, from multiplying. Inter-specific competition between two steinernematid species shows that both can co-exist in a host, but one species will eventually prevail in the environment. By having different foraging strategies, however, both steinermatid species may co-exist in the same habitat. An important issue is whether the introduction of an exotic entomopathogenic nematode species will competitively displace an indigenous nematode species. Although the environmental risks are small, the recommended policy is that the introduction of exotic nematodes be regulated With other pathogens, entomopathogenic nematodes can out-compete entomopathogenic fungi, but not Bacillus thuringiensis, for the same host individual when both the nematode and entomopathogen are applied simultaneously. The best studied natural enemy is the nemnrophagous fungus, Hirsutella rhossiliensis, which causes higher mortality in Steinernema glaseri compared with Heterorhabditis bacteriorphora. Differential susceptibility to the fungus may be associated with the retention of the second-stage cuticle by H. bacteriophora. Invertebrate predators including mites and collembolans feed on entomopathogenic nematodes. Although a number of studies have been conducted with antagonists, there is a dearth of field data. We suggest that long-term research plots be established where natural populations of entomopathogenic nematodes occur and include antagonists as a component of such studies.",,"Kaya, HK (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT NEMATOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,101,86,88,3,35,CARFAX PUBL CO,ABINGDON,"PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE",0958-3157,,,BIOCONTROL SCI TECHN,Biocontrol Sci.

Although readily consumed by Oreaster, the conspicuous coral reef sponge species Lissodendoryx colombiensis Zea & van Soest, 1986 has expanded its habitat distribution to include a seagrass (Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Konig, 1805) meadow in Belize, where individuals grow to volumes of nearly 7 l. By simple observation, L. colombiensis appears to be an inferior competitor in this system, because portions of many individuals are overgrown by seagrass sponge species. However, experimentally clustering seagrass sponges around L. colombiensis individuals deterred starfish from feeding on them, suggesting an advantage to being overgrown. Sizes of individual L. colombiensis can fluctuate widely over short time intervals, reflecting both a relatively fast growth rate and the high rate at which starfish consume this species. At the population level these fluctuations are not evident, as losses of L. colombiensis due to Oreaster are balanced by a combination of efficient recruitment, rapid regeneration and growth, and protection of portions of many individuals by the overgrowth of seagrass sponge species that are unpalatable to Oreaster. In turn, the seagrass sponges acquire stable perches on L. colombiensis individuals in this sediment-dominated habitat. Community ecology theory relating to diversity patterns in sessile organisms has focused on competition between space-requiring neighbors as the underlying process that inevitably decreases diversity unless curtailed. Sponges, with their propensity for engaging in beneficial interactions with neighbors, demand expansion of the theory to acknowledge how collaboration can increase abundance and species diversity within a community.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Wulff, JL (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",wulff@bio.fsu.edu,,,,,,49,19,19,0,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-9565,1439-0485,,MAR ECOL-EVOL PERSP,Mar.

NOR increased the relative abundance of Scenedesmus species in the absence of grazers but exerted opposite effects when Daphnia was present in both short- and long-term experiments due to reduced colony size. Meanwhile, increasing NOR concentrations led to quickly increased total algal density in the initial stage, followed by a sharp decline in the long-term experiment in the absence of grazers; when Daphnia was present, population fluctuations were even larger for both prey and predator species (e.g., grazer extinction at the highest concentration). Thus, NOR affected the outcome of species interactions and decreased temporal stability of plankton ecosystems, suggesting that antibiotics have more extensive impacts than presently recognized.","[Pan, Ying; Dong, Jinyan; Wan, Lingling; Chang, Xuexiu] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ying; Dong, Jinyan; Wan, Lingling] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Plateau Mt Ecol & Restorat Degrade, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ying; Sun, Shucun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [MacIsaac, Hugh J.; Drouillard, Ken G.; Chang, Xuexiu] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9 B 3P4, Canada","Chang, XX (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Chang, XX (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9 B 3P4, Canada.",changxx@ynu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31670440]; Yunnan Province Key Research Program for Science and Technology [2018BC002, 32017BC041]; Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of China [S201910673095]","We thank Shiwei Yan, Guangdi Yi, Dan Liu, Jun Luo, Yuhe Wu, Deqin Gao, Han Yang, Guanwen Chen, Jie-xin Tan, and Zi-yong Cao for their help with data collection.

Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). Eotetranychus carpini borealis (Ewing) (Acari: Tetranychidae), and N.fallacis were commonly found in Skagit and Whatcom Counties. E.carpini borealis colonized the fruiting canes earlier in the season than T. urticae. The two phytophages overlapped in midseason, but T. urticae entered diapause earlier than E. carpini borealis an N. fallacis. Densities of N.fallacis increased with increase in spider mite densities. However, the numerical response of the predator was more evident for T. urticae than for E. carpini borealis. Nevertheless, the predator was spatially associated with the two prey species. The spatial and seasonal distribution of N.fallacis in relationship to host plant phenology and prey distribution may influence the effectiveness of this predator as a biological control agent against spider mites in red raspberry. Densities of the predator increased too late to present spider mite damage. The predatory role of N. fallacis could be enhanced by introducing or conserving predators that arc more tolerant to climatic factors that prevail in and around the cane canopy in the beginning of the season.","Washington State Univ, Vancouver Res & Extens Ctr, Dept Entomol, Vancouver, WA 98665 USA","Bounfour, M (corresponding author), DPVCTRF, BP 1308, Rabat, Morocco.",,,,,,,51,0,0,0,10,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0022-0493,,,J ECON ENTOMOL,J.

To evaluate the direct and indirect effects of endemic seaweeds, barnacles, and invertebrate predators on the abundance of B. glandula on the rocky intertidal coast of eastern Hokkaido, we conducted a field experiment from June 2011 to October 2012 in which we manipulated the presence or absence of these factors. Seaweeds showed no significant effect on the abundance of B. glandula. The endemic barnacle Chthamalus dalli and the invertebrate predator Nucella lima reduced the abundance of B. glandula. However, the simultaneous influence of N. lima and C. dalli was compensative rather than additive, probably due to keystone predation. These findings suggest that competition by the endemic barnacle C. dalli and predation by the invertebrate predator N. lima decreased the abundance of B. glandula, but that N. lima predation on C. dalli weakened the negative influence of C. dalli on B. glandula. The implications of these findings are twofold: the endemic competitor and invertebrate predator may have played important roles in decreasing the abundance of B. glandula in natural habitats, and conservation of endemic invertebrate predators may be crucial to impede the establishment and survival of introduced barnacles in rocky intertidal habitats.","[Noda, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, North 10,West 5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Alam, A.

This variation may in turn affect species interactions among members of the attendant community. We describe a habitat-provisioning species that, with variation in a simple trait, produces dichotomous classes of habitat: one that serves as a predation refuge and the other that does not. Subtidal roots of the Caribbean red mangrove Rhizophora mangle are colonized by a diverse epibiont assemblage that includes many species of sponge. We experimentally demonstrated that roots touching the seafloor give benthic sea star predators access to their sponge prey living on the roots. After 6 wk, half of sponges on grounded roots were eaten, whereas sponges on suspended roots were uneaten. Correspondingly, in concomitant field surveys of mangrove root epibiont as semblages, we found very different sponge ensembles on the 2 root types. Even after standardizing for root area, suspended roots harbored 7 sponge species that covered an average of 91.3% of subtidal root length, while grounded roots, where sponges were exposed to sea star predation, had only 4 sponge species that covered 63.2% of root length. There was little overlap in species composition and a single sponge species Chondrilla caribensis, that was never eaten in our experiment, dominated grounded roots. This study suggests that a simple, dynamic trait of mangrove roots-groundedness-controls predator access, with consequences for assemblage composition.","[Schutte, Virginia G.

This is especially true of processes mediated by the sense of olfaction, because wind and water currents control the dispersal of odor signals and act as ancillary cues during odor plume following. In the field, we examined how variations in the physical and chemical properties of odor plumes would alter the foraging behavior of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus a common predator/scavenger in tidal marsh creeks in the southeastern United States. We video-recorded responses of naturally foraging crabs to odor plumes of varying composition and odor release rare (characteristic of clams of differing size). During each trial we presented crabs with an experimental plume that was a mixture of fluorescein-dyed seawater and clam mantle fluid, oyster mantle fluid, or a suite of amino acids, and a control plume which consisted of dyed seawater only. In addition to manipulating the chemical composition and odor release rate of the plume, we allowed flow speed to vary naturally with the tide. We tested for effects of odor composition, odor release rater and flow speed on the success (i.e., finding the target) and efficiency (i.e., search path direction) of blue crab foraging. Mantle fluid solutions and wounded prey items elicited active search and upstream walking, while control and amino acid solutions had no effect on crab behavior. Odors released at a low rate (either low volume flow or low concentration) elicited fewer responses from crabs, and the resulting search was less efficient and less successful than responses to odors released at higher rates. Ambient current speed also affected both starch success and efficiency. There was a decline in search success when current speed in the tidal channel was below 1 cm/s: search success remained constantly high, however, when current speed was above this threshold. Search efficiency was directly proportional to ambient current speeds. Such relationships between hydrodynamic and chemical properties of the environment and foraging success and efficiency suggest that variation in the physicochemical environment can influence the detectability of prey and strategies employed by foragers. These results extend beyond the foraging of marine crustaceans into other olfactory-mediated interactions and habitats.","Univ S Carolina, Mat Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; Univ S Carolina, Belle W Baruch Inst Marine Biol & Coastal Res, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Finelli, CM (corresponding author), LUMCON, 8124 Highway 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA.",,"Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014","Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606; Pentcheff, N.

We conducted an experiment to examine the extent to which the nonconsumptive and overall effect of predatory water bugs on snail and tadpole traits (performance and morphology) depended on whether tadpoles and snails cooccurred. Tadpoles and snails differed in their relative susceptibility to intraspecific and interspecific competition, and predators affected both prey species via consumptive and nonconsumptive mechanisms. Furthermore, the overall effect of predators often depended on whether another prey species was present. The reasoning for why the overall effect of predators depended on whether prey species cooccurred, however, differed for each of the response variables. Predators affected snail body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the change in the overall effect of predators on snail body growth was attributable to how snails responded to competition in the absence of predators, rather than a change in how snails responded to the threat of predation. Predators did not affect tadpole body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater vulnerability of competitively superior prey (snails) to predators increased the strength of consumptive mechanisms (and hence the overall effect) through which predators affected tadpole growth. Predators affected tadpole morphology via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater propensity for predators to kill competitively superior prey (snails) enhanced the ability of tadpoles to alter their morphology in response to the threat of predation by creating an environment where tadpoles had a higher per capita supply of food available to invest in the development of morphological defenses. Our work indicates that the mechanisms through which predators affect prey depends on the other members of the community.","[Ruehl, Clifton B.; Vance-Chalcraft, Heather; Chalcraft, David R.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC USA","Ruehl, CB (corresponding author), Columbus State Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC USA.",ruehl_clifton@columbusstate.edu,,,Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0716558],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/ Award Number: 0716558",,64,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The uptake of phytodetritus by the 3 ostracod species was investigated in 2 separate experiments with special reference to (1) effects of the presence of amphipods and (2) variable density of ostracods. The amphipods had negative effects on the uptake rate of phytodetritus by ostracods. Mechanical disturbance, which may have caused burial of the phytodetritus, is one plausible explanation. There was no evidence of competition for phytodetritus among the ostracod species, i.e. the absence/presence of C. neglecta did not affect the uptake of phytodetritus by P. fennica and H. sorbyana. A density-dependent uptake of phytodetritus was, however, observed in C. neglecta, where the uptake of phytodetritus was stimulated at an intermediate density.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Modig, H (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",helene.modig@zoologi.su.se,"Olafsson, Emil/D-4916-2012","van de Bund, Wouter/0000-0002-2749-0850",,,,48,15,15,0,0,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

After 7 months the experiment ended and reef sites were resurveyed. Gray triggerfish decreased on both treatments, while the mean number of red snapper did not differ between treatments; however, there were significantly more small (<400 mm total length) red snapper on reefs where gray triggerfish were removed. In seven laboratory growth trials (30 to 35 days each), red snapper held with gray triggerfish had significantly lower growth rates and numerous bite marks compared with red snapper alone.

We tested the influence of selective-feeding behaviours by two Mediterranean intertidal crabs, Pachygrapsus marmoratus (Fabricius, 1787) (Grapsidae) and Lophozozymus incisus (H. Milne Edwards, 1834) (Xanthidae), on populations of the mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819 and Mytilaster minimus (Poli, 1795). Two experiments were conducted, one involving the replacement of consumed prey individuals of different shell lengths by conspecifics of the same size, and a second where no such replacement was made. The predatory pressures were tracked through the preferences for the two species as prey, their selective behaviours in relation to prey sizes, and the type of attack behaviours used. Results demonstrated that the competition for space between the two mytilids is more influenced by the feeding behaviour of L. incisus, which showed a preference for Mytilaster minimus. Comparable data obtained for P. marmoratus suggests that the two resident crabs are not in competition for the same resources. The feeding strategy adopted by L. incisus on Mytilaster minimus showed predation on all of the size classes of Mytilaster minimus because their stronger chelae allow them to mechanically handle larger prey. Lophozozymous incisus uses a simple crushing attack, as opposed to overcoming larger prey using a larger variety of methods, which includes marginal breaking, mandibular biting around valve edges, or a combination of these.","[Puljas, Sanja] Univ Split, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Rudera Boskov 33, Split 21000, Peoples R China; [Morton, Brian] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Puljas, S (corresponding author), Univ Split, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Rudera Boskov 33, Split 21000, Peoples R China.",spuljas@pmfst.hr,"Puljas, Sanja/P-5378-2015","Puljas, Sanja/0000-0003-1435-5446",,,,41,0,0,2,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0278-0372,1937-240X,,J CRUSTACEAN BIOL,J.

Although seldom considered, seed harvesting may also depend on the species identities of other individuals in the seed neighbourhood. When the seed harvest of a focal species increases in association with another seed species, the focal species suffers from Associational Susceptibility. In contrast, if seeds of the focal species are harvested less when in association with a second species, the focal species benefits from Associational Resistance. To evaluate density dependence and associational effects among seeds in mixtures, we conducted seed removal experiments using a completely additive design patterned after a two-species competition experiment using seeds of either Achnatherum hymenoides (Indian ricegrass), Leymus cinereus (basin wildrye) or Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch wheatgrass), all native perennial grasses, combined with seeds of Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), a non-native annual grass. The experiment involved placing five fixed quantities of the native seeds mixed with five fixed quantities of B.tectorum seeds in a factorial design, resulting in 35 seed mixture combinations. The seed-eating rodent community at our study sites, in order of abundance, is composed of Peromyscus maniculatus (North American deer mouse), Dipodomys ordii (Ord's kangaroo rat) and Perognathus parvus (Great Basin pocket mouse). Native seed harvesting was density dependent, with a greater proportion of seeds being harvested as density increased. In the mixed density model, the presence of B.tectorum did not affect harvest of any of the native species' seeds when analysed individually. However, when all three native species were analysed together, increasing quantities of B.tectorum resulted in reduced harvest of native seeds, demonstrating weak but significant Associational Resistance. In contrast, harvest of B.tectorum seeds increased when in combination with any of the native seed species individually, indicating relatively strong Associational Susceptibility. These results demonstrate that seed harvest is determined not just by seed density, but also by the local seed neighbourhood and suggest that associational effects between native seeds and B.tectorum can occur in field conditions. The ecological implications of seed selection and associational effects on plant populations in natural and managed systems are also discussed.","[Ostoja, Steven M.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Yosemite Field Stn, Oakhurst, CA 93644 USA; [Schupp, Eugene W.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Schupp, Eugene W.; Durham, Susan] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Klinger, Rob] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Yosemite Field Stn, Bishop, CA 93514 USA","Ostoja, SM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Yosemite Field Stn, Oakhurst, CA 93644 USA.",sostoja@usgs.gov,"Schupp, Eugene W/F-1834-2010","Schupp, Eugene/0000-0002-1258-503X","Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2001-52103-11322]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station (UAES); Utah State University (USU), Logan, UT, USA; USU Ecology Center research fellowship; USU School of Graduate Studies dissertation fellowship","Thanks to R.

In this study, the intra- and interspecific competition between two congeneric sandy beach amphipods Bathyporeia pilosa and B. sarsi was examined by means of a two-way factorial mesocosm experiment. The amount of natural food resources as well as population densities of B. pilosa and B. sarsi were manipulated in order to investigate whether firstly, the species compete for food, and secondly, whether crowding effects, such as damaging encounter competition, are present within and between both Bathyporeia species. The absence of food negatively influenced survival and recruitment and enhanced aggressive behavior in the B. sarsi population, while there was no influence of the absence of food in the B. pilosa population. In the field, B. pilosa is occurring high in the intertidal where food supply is low, while B. sarsi is occurring in the mid-intertidal where food supply is higher. Hence, B. pilosa is more adapted to low food conditions than B. sarsi. Although an increased intraspecific density stimulated encounter competition within the B. sarsi population, no evidence of interspecific competition was found in this study. This first report on encounter competition for the deposit-feeding amphipod Bathyporeia sarsi suggests that zonation patterns of the two amphipods may be the result of the combined influence of species-specific physiological restrictions and biotic interactions within the B. sarsi population, indicating that on dissipative beaches, biotic interactions may be more common than generally considered.

Goal: Test the predictions of CCO with field experiments. Species: The Egyptian sand gerbil (40 g), Gerbillus pyramidum, and Allenby's gerbil (25 g), G. andersoni allenbyi. Site: Ashdod sand dunes in the southern coastal plain of Israel. Three sandy habitats are present: shifting, semi-stabilized, and stabilized sand. Gerbils occupied all three habitats. Methods: We surveyed rodent abundance, activity levels, and foraging behaviour while experimentally removing G. pyramidum. Results: Three predictions of the CCO model were supported. Both species did best in the semi-stabilized habitat. However, they differed in their secondary habitats. Gerbillus pyramidum preferred the shifting sand habitat, whereas G. a. allenbyi preferred the stabilized habitat. Habitat selection by both species depended on density. However, in contrast to CCO, G. pyramidum dominated the core habitat and excluded G. a. allenbyi. We term this variant of CCO, 'asymmetric CCO'. Conclusions: The fundamental feature of CCO appears valid: co-existence may result not because of what each competing species does best, but because of what they do as a back-up. But in contrast to the prediction of the original CCO model, all dynamic traces of interaction can vanish if the system includes interference competition.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Wildlife Ecol, Russell Lab 207, USGS Wisconsin Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Wasserberg, G (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Wildlife Ecol, Russell Lab 207, USGS Wisconsin Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",wasserberg@wisc.edu,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,21,11,11,0,8,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

Environmental heterogeneity may strongly influence the spatial distribution, habitat use and refuge availability for these taxa. Using a series of 24-h mesocosm experiments we examined the predator-prey interactions between an invasive crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and four amphipod taxa, one indigenous (Gammarus pulex) and three non-native species (Crangonyx pseudogracilis, Dikerogammarus villosusandGammarus tigrinus) to Great Britain.The potential mediating effect of physical habitat on predator-prey interactions was examined via the use of different substrate particle sizes; cobbles, gravels and, sand. Survivorship of amphipods in response to crayfish predation varied significantly with the highest rates recorded for the non-native speciesD. villosus, followed byG. tigrinus, andC. pseudogracilis, with the lowest survivorship recorded for the indigenous speciesG. pulexfor all substrates except cobble. However, total biomass consumption of the indigenousG. pulexand the non-nativeD. villosusbyP. leniusculuswere similar suggesting that crayfish may have been satiated by largerD. villosusindividuals. Substrate size had a significant influence on the predation success ofP. leniusculus,with larger substrate clasts typically resulting in increased survivorship rates for all species exceptC. pseudogracilis,which displayed lower predation rates for sand substrates. The findings of this study highlight the risks that naive indigenous taxa may face from new invasive species and the importance of characterising physical habitat (complexity and refugia potential) when considering the potential ecological effects of invaders on predation success.","[Beatty, C.; Mathers, K.

The code goby Gobiosoma robustum Ginsburg and clown goby Microgobius gulosus (Girard) are common, ecologically similar fishes found throughout the Gulf of Mexico and in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean. In Florida Bay, these fishes exhibit habitat partitioning: G. robustum is most abundant in seagrass-dominated areas while M. gulosus is most abundant in sparsely vegetated habitats. In a small-scale field survey, I documented the microhabitat use of these species where their distributions overlap. In a series of laboratory experiments, I presented each species with structured (artificial seagrass) versus nonstructured (bare sand) habitats and measured their frequency of choosing either habitat type. I then examined the use of structured versus nonstructured habitats when the two species were placed together in a mixed group. Finally, I placed a predator (Opsanus beta) in the experimental aquaria to determine how its presence influenced habitat selection. In the field, G. robustum was more abundant in seagrass and M. gulosus was more abundant in bare mud. In the laboratory, both species selected grass over sand in allopatry. However, in sympatry, M gulosus occupied sand more often when paired with G. robustum than when alone. G. robustum appears to directly influence the habitat choice of M gulosus: It seems that M gulosus is pushed out of the structured habitat that is the preferred habitat of G. robustum. Thus, competition appears to modify the habitat selection of these species when they occur in sympatry. Additionally, the presence of the toadfish was a sufficient stimulus to provoke both M. gulosus and G. robustum to increase their selection for sand (compared to single-species treatments). Distribution patterns of M gulosus dand G. robustum likely result from a synthesis of various biotic and abiotic filters, including physiological tolerances to environmental factors, dispersal ability of larvae, and availability of food. Selection for structural complexity, competition, and presence of predators may further define the resulting pattern of distribution observed in the field.

Although many species of voles usually coexist and are in severe competition for food and breeding space, the role of interspecific competition in vole cycles has never been evaluated statistically After studying community effects on the population dynamics of the gray-sided vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in the subarctic birch forest at Kilpisjarvi, Finland, we report statistical results showing that both interspecific and intraspecific effects are important in the direct year-to-year density dependence, However, interspecific effects are-not detectable in the 2-year delayed density dependence that is crucial for generating the characteristic cycles. Furthermore, we show that most of the competition takes place during the winter. The results are evaluated against two models of community dynamics. One assumes that the delayed effects are caused by an interaction with a specialist predator, and the other assumes that they are caused by overgrazing food plants. These statistical results show that vole cycles may be generated by a species-specific trophic interaction. The results also suggest that the gray-sided vole may be the focal species in the birch-forest community, as field voles may be in the taiga and as lemmings may be on the tundra.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Finnish Forest Res Inst, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland","Stenseth, NC (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, POB 1050, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",n.c.stenseth@bio.uio.no,"Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016; Hansen, Thomas F/B-9021-2009","Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; ",,,,46,80,83,0,40,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

It has been suggested that E. willamettei may be beneficial in vineyards because it may have a negative impact: an the more damaging T, pacificus through their shared predator or through some form of interspecific competition, We conducted field and greenhouse experiments to determine the relative effects of these interactions between the two herbivores on the population dynamics of T, pacificus in 'Thompson Seedless' grape vineyards. We also used the field data to generate a functional relationship for the combined impact of E. willamettei and M. occidentalis on T, pacificus. 2, Predation and predator-mediated apparent competition were the only factors affecting T, pacificus densities in the field experiment, The addition of the predatory mite M, occidentalis alone resulted in a significant reduction in T, pacificus densities, while the addition of E, willamettei alone had little impact on T, pacificus densities. The greatest reductions in T. pacificus densities occurred in plots where both the predatory mite M, occidentalis and E, willamettei were added, The predatory mite occurred earliest and increased at the greatest rate in plots where it was released along with E. willamettei. From April to June, M. occidentalis abundance was positively correlated with E. willamettei abundance while T. pacificus abundance in July and August was negatively correlated with M. occidentalis abundance in the period April to June. 3, Under greenhouse conditions, the addition of E. willamettei to T. pacificus vines resulted in a marked decrease in T pacificus population growth rate. In contrast, doubling T. pacificus abundance in the absence E willamettei did not affect T. pacificus population growth rate, indicating that interspecific competition is more important than intraspecific competition in determining T. pacificus abundance, 4, Contrary to the greenhouse data and other studies in 'Zinfandel' vineyards, we found no evidence that E, willamettei competed with T, pacificus in the absence of predation in a Thompson Seedless vineyard. We suggest that the outcome of interactions between E, willamettei and T. pacificus may be affected by grape cultivar, growing region, a combination of cultivar and region-specific differences, or size and timing of vine infestations with E, willamettei. 5, In Thompson Seedless vineyards, ville infestation with E, willamettei would be most useful in increasing the effectiveness of the predatory mite M. occidentalis in controlling T, pacificus, primarily through an elevated predatory mite abundance prior to the development of large T, pacificus populations.",,"Hanna, R (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,"Wilson, Lloyd T/E-9971-2011",,,,,40,28,28,0,14,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Interference competition with wolves Canis lupus is hypothesized to limit the distribution and abundance of coyotes Canis latrans, and the extirpation of wolves is often invoked to explain the expansion in coyote range throughout much of North America. 2. We used spatial, seasonal and temporal heterogeneity in wolf distribution and abundance to test the hypothesis that interference competition with wolves limits the distribution and abundance of coyotes. From August 2001 to August 2004, we gathered data on cause-specific mortality and survival rates of coyotes captured at wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites in Grand Teton National Park (GTNP), Wyoming, USA, to determine whether mortality due to wolves is sufficient to reduce coyote densities. We examined whether spatial segregation limits the local distribution of coyotes by evaluating home-range overlap between resident coyotes and wolves, and by contrasting dispersal rates of transient coyotes captured in wolf-free and wolf-abundant areas. Finally, we analysed data on population densities of both species at three study areas across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) to determine whether an inverse relationship exists between coyote and wolf densities. 3. Although coyotes were the numerically dominant predator, across the GYE, densities varied spatially and temporally in accordance with wolf abundance. Mean coyote densities were 33% lower at wolf-abundant sites in GTNP, and densities declined 39% in Yellowstone National Park following wolf reintroduction. 4. A strong negative relationship between coyote and wolf densities (beta = -3.988, P < 0.005, r(2) = 0.54, n = 16), both within and across study sites, supports the hypothesis that competition with wolves limits coyote populations. 5. Overall mortality of coyotes resulting from wolf predation was low, but wolves were responsible for 56% of transient coyote deaths (n = 5). In addition, dispersal rates of transient coyotes captured at wolf-abundant sites were 117% higher than for transients captured in wolf-free areas. 6. Our results support the hypothesis that coyote abundance is limited by competition with wolves, and suggest that differential effects on survival and dispersal rates of transient coyotes are important mechanisms by which wolves reduce coyote densities.","Teton Field Off, Wildlife Conservat Soc, Victor, ID 83455 USA; Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, USDA,Wildlife Serv, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Berger, KM (corresponding author), Teton Field Off, Wildlife Conservat Soc, POB 985, Victor, ID 83455 USA.",kberger@wcs.org,"Gese, Eric M/B-4578-2011",,,,,62,235,239,1,209,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Whereas Hamilton's broader intent was to explain the evolutionary stability of cooperation, his focus on shared genetic history appears to have limited the application of his theory to populations within a single species rather than across interacting species. The evolutionary mechanisms for cooperation between species require both spatial and temporal correlations among interacting partners for the benefits to be not only predictable but of sufficient duration to be reliably delivered. As a consequence when the benefits returned by mutualistic partners are redirected to individuals other than the original donor, cooperation usually becomes unstable and parasitism may evolve. However, theoretically, such redirection of mutualistic benefits may actually reinforce, rather than undermine, mutualisms between species when the recipients of these redirected benefits are genetically related to the original donor. Here, I review the few mathematical models that have used Hamilton's theory of kin selection to predict the evolution of mutualisms between species. I go on to examine the applicability of these models to the most well-studied case of mutualism, pollinating seed predators, where the role of kin selection may have been previously overlooked. Future detailed studies of the direct, and indirect, benefits of mutualism are likely to reveal additional possibilities for applying Hamilton's theory of kin selection to mutualisms between species.","San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA","Zink, AG (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",zink@sfsu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1258133]; San Francisco State University,"I would like to thank participants in the symposium on 'Cooperation within and between species' at the 2014 International Society of Behavioral Ecology meeting, Hunter College, NY.

Most predators are cannibalistic, and as a consequence, even systems with only one predator and one prey include two prey types: conspecifics and heterospecifics. The effects of the complex direct and indirect interactions that emerge in such cannibalistic systems are still poorly understood. This study examined how the indirect interaction between conspecific and heterospecific prey affects cannibalism and predation rates and how the direct interactions between both species indirectly alter the effect of the cannibalistic predator. I tested for these effects using larvae of the stream salamanders Eurycea cirrigera (prey) and Pseudotriton ruber (cannibalistic predator) by manipulating the relative densities of the conspecific and heterospecific prey in the presence and absence of the predator in experimental streams. The rates of cannibalism and heterospecific predation were proportional to the respective densities and negatively correlated, indicating a positive indirect interaction between conspecific and heterospecific prey, similar to ''apparent mutualism.'' Direct interactions between prey species did not alter the effect of the predator. Although both types of prey showed a similar 30% reduction in night activity and switch in microhabitat use in response to the presence of the predator, cannibalism rates were three times higher than heterospecific predation rates irrespective of the relative densities of the two types of prey. Cumulative predation risks differed even more due to the 48% lower growth rate of conspecific prey. Detailed laboratory experiments suggest that the 3: 1 difference in cannibalism and predation rate was due to the higher efficiency of heterospecific prey in escaping immediate attacks. However, no difference was observed when the predator was a closely related salamander species, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, indicating that this difference is species specific. This demonstrates that cannibalism can result in the coupling of predator and prey mortality rates that strongly determines the dynamics of predator-prey systems.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Rudolf, VHW (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 6100 Main St,MS-170, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",Volker.rudolf@rice.edu,"Rudolf, Volker/B-7913-2009","Rudolf, Volker/0000-0002-9214-2000",,,,67,51,51,1,55,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2008,89,6,,,,,1650,1660,,10.1890/07-0709.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,310OZ,WOS:000256540300018,18589529,,,,2021-09-27,

The initial biomass varied as 0.33 and 0.22 mu g/ml for B. plicatilis and B. rotundiformis respectively. Experiments were performed at (25 +/- 1)degrees C. Population densities were enumerated and the medium was changed daily up to 8 d in the experiment. At the lowest food level tested, B. rotundiformis formed superior competitor than B. plicatilis, regardless of starting inoculation density. Generally when the food concentrations increased, B. plicatilis showed a greater increase in biomass than B. rotundiformis. B. rotundiformis formed the largest in population growth, regardless of increasing food concentrations. When grown alone, B. plicatilis reached peak abundances of (1.311 5 +/- 0.028) and (137.5 +/- 0.014) mu g/ml at low and high food densities respectively. The corresponding values of B. rotundiformis were 0.724 5 +/- 0.016 and 18.15 +/- 0.021. The adverse effects of B. rotundiformis on the peak abundances of B. plicatilis were observed at the lowest food level and higher initial density. The rate of population growth in controls varied from (0.792 +/- 0.162) to (1.482 +/- 0.132) mu m/d for B. plicatilis and (0.445 +/- 0.041) to (0.856 +/- 0.012) mu m/d for B. rotundiformis, depending on food level. When both species were introduced together, low food levels favoured higher abundance of B. rotundiformis than B. plicatilis, suggesting that increased population density of the smaller B. rotundiformis was more successfull than larger B. plicatilis in brackish waters.

The use of tanks enabled the regulation of certain environmental factors, and, hence, the evaluation of specific responses of the corals to these factors. For both species, growth and survival were much better in the field than in the land-based tanks most probably due to unrestricted water circulation. Since the two species were subjected to identical experimental treatments, it was possible to distinguish inherent differences between them in terms of responses to external variables. Porites cylindrica was more susceptible than P. rus to predation by corallivores. Predators, as well as grazers, occurred in significant numbers in the field, but not in the land-based tanks. Porites rus, on the other hand, succumbed more readily to overgrowth by macroalgae which thrived in the culture tanks presumably because of significantly higher nutrient levels and the conspicuous absence of grazers. These results have broader ecological implications because of accelerated environmental changes taking place in present-day reefs due to human impact. Major examples are eutrophication and alterations in water circulation which frequently result in sub-optimal conditions for coral survival and growth. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

If both the IG predator and its prey prefer similar microhabitats in spatially structured environments, avoidance of the predator may relegate IG prey to suboptimal habitats. In southeastern Australia, the broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) is an endangered species sympatric with the small-eyed snake (Cryptophis nigrescens), an abundant and geographically widespread species known to eat other snakes. Both of these nocturnal ectotherms shelter diurnally beneath thermally distinctive hot rocks, which are in limited supply. When selecting shelter sites, broad-headed snakes thus face a trade-off between predation risk and habitat quality. In laboratory experiments, we allowed broad-headed snakes to choose between retreat sites differing in thermal regimes, in scent cues from predators, and in the actual presence of the predator. Broad-headed snakes displayed an aversion to sites with live predators and predator scent, yet nonetheless frequently selected those sites to obtain thermal benefits. In trials with live predators, adult broad-headed snakes shared hot rocks with small-eyed snakes, but most juveniles did not; data from a 16-year field study likewise suggest that broad-headed snakes only cohabit with small-eyed snakes if the two snakes are similar in body size. Our results suggest that thermoregulatory considerations are sufficient to prompt juvenile (but not adult) broad-headed snakes to risk IG predation, emphasizing the importance of microhabitat quality and body size in mediating IG predator-prey interactions.","[Webb, Jonathan K.; Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Pringle, Robert M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Webb, JK (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",jwebb@bio.usyd.edu.au,,"Webb, Jonathan/0000-0003-4822-6829",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Academy of Science Margaret Middleton; University of Sydney SesquiUniversity of Sydney; Sherwood Family Foundation; Phi Beta Kappa [NSF DEB 0709880]; Heinz Family Philanthropies,"Australian Research Council Discovery Grant (to R.

We tested experimentally whether such competition occurs between young-of-year (YOY) largemouth bass and their eventual prey, bluegill. In a divided experimental pond, target densities of YOY bass and juvenile bluegill were subjected to different densities of bass and bluegill neighbors to examine the dependence of juvenile growth on fish density and species composition. After 7 wk, clear differences in growth rates of both species existed across densities, Bass growth was reduced in the presence of both bass and bluegill neighbors, whereas bluegill growth was primarily affected intraspecifically. Bluegill had strong competitive effects on bass despite substantial resource partitioning between the two species. These effects were mediated through changes in the size-structure of important invertebrate prey in both open water and vegetation habitats. Data collected from a set of seven lakes in Michigan indicate that interspecific competition between juvenile bluegill and YOY bass is an important process in natural populations, However, once bass become piscivorous, bluegill become a significant resource for bass. As a result, bass populations are split into two functionally distinct stages that respond differently across a gradient of bluegill density. Because of the competitive stage between predator and prey, dynamics of the interaction differ from predictions based on classical predator-prey or competition theory.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,WK KELLOGG BIOL STN,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060; MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060; UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720","OLSON, MH (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN,CTR LIMNOL,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,"Osenberg, Craig/M-9904-2013; Mittelbach, Gary/A-2470-2013","Mittelbach, Gary/0000-0001-6971-9273; Osenberg, Craig/0000-0003-1918-7904",,,,62,138,142,1,61,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1995,76,6,,,,,1758,1771,,10.2307/1940708,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RQ248,WOS:A1995RQ24800006,,,,,2021-09-27,

We placed paired germinated and ungerminated acorns of Quercus mongolica on 30-cm high platforms to exclude potential interspecific competition of the predominant larder hoarders Apodemus peninsulae and Myodes rufocanus, to investigate seed dispersal by a predominant scatter-hoarder, Tamias sibiricus, in the field in north-eastern China. Our results showed that T. sibiricus ate more acorns in situ in the absence of interspecific competition. In the presence of interspecific competition of A. peninsulae and C. rufocanus, however, more acorns were scatter-hoarded by T. sibiricus. Regardless of interspecific competition, germination of acorns showed no significant effects on seed dispersal patterns, inconsistent with the seed perishability hypothesis that animals avoid hoarding seeds with high perishability. Exclusion of interspecific competition, though relatively increasing the per capita seed abundance, appears to reduce seed dispersal, scatter-hoarding and seedling establishment. Therefore, we propose that moderate interspecific competition rather than competition exclusion may benefit seed scatter-hoarding and seedling establishment.","[Deng, Yinhua; Yi, Xianfeng] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Ju, Mengyao; Yi, Xianfeng] Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qufu, Shandong, Peoples R China","Yi, XF (corresponding author), Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",ympclong@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31760156]; Young Talents Invitation Program of Shandong Provincial Colleges and Universities,Funding for this study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31760156) and the Young Talents Invitation Program of Shandong Provincial Colleges and Universities.

The recruit-adult hypothesis suggests that the density of recruits is a good predictor of adult density when low but not when high. That is, the relative importance of recruitment vs, postrecruitment factors varies inversely with increasing density of recruits. In a rocky intertidal habitat at two Oregon coastal sites, a field experiment was done using two barnacle species to test this hypothesis. The relative impacts of these factors on adult barnacle abundance was determined using a reciprocal transplant design to manipulate both the density of barnacles established by recruitment and the postrecruitment conditions (tidal height, wave exposure) in which they lived. The relative contribution of recruitment to adult densities was strongly context dependent and species specific. While density of recruits clearly influenced density of adults for both species in most combinations of site, zone, and exposure, the effects of physical and biotic factors ranged from strong to weak. For Chthamalus, recruitment generally had a stronger impact on density of adults than did postrecruitment processes, while for Balanus, postrecruitment factors tended to have stronger effects than did recruitment. These differences were an apparent consequence of differential susceptibilities to postrecruitment processes. Chthamalus was more tolerant of both biotic and abiotic forces than was Balanus and usually had high survival during periods of high Balanus mortality. Heat and desiccation were identified as the primary postrecruitment mortality factors in the high zone, whereas biotic interactions (competition and predation) were the most likely postrecruitment mortality processes in the mid-zone. Mortality was generally density dependent at the site with the strongest effects of postrecruitment processes, and generally density independent at the site with the strongest effects of recruitment. To determine whether trends were more consistent with the recruit-adult hypothesis at larger scales, data for each species were pooled across exposures (zone scale) and across exposures and zones (site scale) and also were compared to literature data from sites around the world (global scale). Each analysis led to the conclusion that recruitment can be a strong determinant of density of adults, but that the magnitude of this relationship depends on context, varies with species, and can be strongly modified by postrecruitment processes. Even when density of recruits is low, postrecruitment factors can be important in determining density of adults. Thus recruitment is a necessary but sometimes insufficient determinant of adult population density. These results support earlier suggestions that predictive models must incorporate both recruitment and postrecruitment factors and will thus depend on understanding the coupling between benthic and pelagic processes.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Menge, BA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",mengeb@bcc.orst.edu,"Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012",,,,,85,162,163,0,55,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

According to Elton's biodiversity and invasibility hypothesis, non-native species must be competitively superior to the resident species in order to successfully invade. An invader that is ecologically similar to a native species may cause intense interspecific competition as they both require the same resource. Furthermore, an increase in the density of an invading competitor may enhance the intensity of the competitive interaction, however, this may be reduced if the inferior competitor has a refuge that reduces the amount of time it is in direct contact with the superior competitor. In laboratory-based competition experiments between the non-native caprellid Caprella mutica and two ecologically similar native caprellids Caprella linearis and Pseudoprotella phasma, C. mutica successfully displaced both species from homogeneous artificial habitat patches after 48 hours. Patches that contained a refuge reduced the number of C. linearis being displaced but only when C. mutica was at a low density. Potentially aggressive interactions between C. mutica and the native C. linearis may have caused C. linearis to be displaced from the patches and could have caused significantly higher mortality of C. linearis compared to the controls. This is the first study to show that the non-native C. mutica has the ability to displace ecologically similar native species when the resource space is limited and when the density of C. mutica was significantly (10 times) lower than the density of C. linearis.","[Shucksmith, Richard; Cook, Elizabeth J.; Hughes, David J.; Burrows, Michael T.] Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland","Shucksmith, R (corresponding author), Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.",rshucksmith@gmail.com,"Burrows, Michael/ABF-4844-2020","Burrows, Michael/0000-0003-4620-5899; Cottier-Cook, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1466-6802",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Esmee Fairbarin Foundation Marine Aliens Programme,We would like to thank the anonymous referees for their comments that helped to improve the manuscript.

Laboratory experiments demonstrated competition for burrows between H. sanguineus and the native fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. Results indicate that H. sanguineus is able to displace an established fiddler crab from its burrow. Feeding experiments revealed that the presence of H. sanguineus has a significantly negative impact on the number as well as the biomass of ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) consumed by the green crab, Carcinus maenas, although this only occurred at high predator densities.

Specifically, models predict that the positive effect of habitat area on prey diversity should decline in the presence of predators, and that predators should modify the partitioning of alpha and beta diversity across patchy landscapes. However, experimental tests of the predicted context dependency in top-down control remain limited. Using a factorial field experiment we quantify the effects of a focal predatory fish species (grouper) and habitat characteristics (patch size, fragmentation) on the partitioning of diversity and assembly of coral reef fish communities. We found independent effects of groupers and patch characteristics on prey communities. Groupers reduced prey abundance by 50% and gamma diversity by 45%, with a disproportionate removal of rare species relative to common species (64% and 36% reduction, respectively; an oddity effect). Further, there was a 77% reduction in beta diversity. Null model analysis demonstrated that groupers increased the importance of stochastic community assembly relative to patches without groupers. With regard to patch size, larger patches contained more fishes, but a doubling of patch size led to a modest (36%) increase in prey abundance. Patch size had no effect on prey diversity; however, fragmented patches had 50% higher species richness and modified species composition relative to unfragmented patches. Our findings suggest two different pathways (i.e., habitat or predator shifts) by which natural and/or anthropogenic processes can drive variation in fish biodiversity and community assembly.","[Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hanson, Katharine M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hanson, Katharine M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.; Brooks, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Stier, AC (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 4200-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",adrian.stier@gmail.com,,"Hanson, Katharine/0000-0002-3972-8520","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312, OCE 12-36905]; Killam Trust; W.

We tested for the importance of priority effects on the interactions between immatures of the mosquito, Culiseta longiareolata, and immatures of the green toad, Bufo viridis, the two most abundant species of many temporary pools of the Negev Desert, Israel. Previously, we reported that when these two taxonomically distant species were placed together as early stage larvae, they competed strongly and when Culiseta larvae had the size advantage, they preyed on Bufo hatchlings. Here, we tested the interaction between these two species in artificial pools when Bufo enters first and develops prior to Culiseta entering. 2. We also tested for intra-specific competition and for the impact of both mosquito larva and tadpole on invading species. 3. We assessed these interactions by experimentally manipulating various combinations and densities of Bufo and Culiseta. We introduced early stage Bufo larvae 12 days prior to introducing first instar Culiseta larvae. 4. Bufo exhibited a strong intraspecific density-dependent effect: tadpoles were smaller and reached metamorphosis later at the higher density. We did not demonstrate an intraspecific density-dependent effect in Culiseta. 5. Culiseta larvae affected neither survival nor development rates of the larger Bufo. Early stage Culiseta larvae were vulnerable to predation by the larger Bufo but later instar Culiseta larval were no longer vulnerable. Bufo reduced larval development rate of Culiseta but did not affect pupal size. 6. Bufo tadpoles virtually eliminated, and Culiseta larvae strongly reduced, the number of individuals of an invading ceratopogonid midge species reaching the pupal stage. 7. The work here, combined with our previous work, demonstrates the importance of priority effects with respect to the outcome of competition and intraguild predation.","UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,LAB COMMUNITY ECOL,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,DEPT BIOL,LAB BIOL CONTROL,POB 653,IL-84105 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,48,96,99,2,59,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We experimentally examined interactions between two microparasites (entomopathogenic nematodes) isolated from sandy grassland soils of coastal California: Heterorhabditis marelatus (Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema feltiae (Steinernematidae). Heterorhabditis marelatus drives trophic cascades by attacking root- and stem-boring ghost moth caterpillars (Hepialus californicus, Hepialidae), thereby indirectly protecting bush lupine shrubs (Lupinus arboreus, Fabaceae). Extensive field surveys demonstrated sympatric overlap in microhabitat use under lupine canopies and similar mean prevalence of the two nematode species. Using a response-surface design in the laboratory, we varied relative and absolute microparasite densities to test for competitive outcomes within an evolutionary naive host, larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae), and within the native host Hepialus californicus. Independent of conspecific or interspecific density, S. feltiae dominated as expected over H. marelatus within the naive Galleria, but S. feltiae infected hosts at low frequency and showed lower reproductive fitness than H. marelatus within native Hepialus hosts. Contrary to studies that demonstrate the pairwise dominance of steinernematid over heterorhabditid species in laboratory hosts, host resistance to S. feltiae may provide a mechanism for coexistence of multiple microparasite species. We hypothesize that the ubiquitous field prevalence and rapid life history of S. feltiae imply its use of widespread, abundant but small-bodied hosts and indicate the lack of direct competition with H. marelatus in the Hepialus-Lupinus trophic cascade.","[Gruner, Daniel S.; Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kolekar, Arunima] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [McLaughlin, John P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Gruner, DS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",dsgruner@umd.edu,"Gruner, Daniel S./A-5166-2010","Gruner, Daniel S./0000-0002-3153-4297",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0620475],"We thank Evan Preisser, Karthik Ram, the Gruner lab, and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on the manuscript; Betsy Harbert and Wei-Chen Hsu for technical assistance; and the National Science Foundation for financial support (DEB-0620475).

In this paper we analysed the behavioural relationships between two species of crayfish, the native Astacus leptodactylus and the invasive Orconectes limosus in an ongoing invasion process in the Lower Danube, in Eastern Europe. We tested the species' ability to acquire shelter and food in laboratory experiments in both intra- and interspecific confrontations. The dominant behaviour of the invasive species is obvious even towards its own congeners, while the native species display a more tolerant conspecific behaviour. With respect to interspecific confrontation, the invasive crayfish males and females were inclined to sex-specific dominance regarding shelters. A roughly balanced behaviour was noted for intersexual confrontations. The results of this study also highlight that the occupancy of a shelter is more disputed than food resources, which appear to be opportunistically acquired. In the context of the current invasion process, we hypothesised that the effect caused by interference competition might lead to a decline of the native species. Further investigations may reveal if there is any hope for recovery of the native species.","[Lele, Sandra-Florina; Parvulescu, Lucian] West Univ Timisoara, Dept Biol Chem, Fac Chem Biol Geog, Timisoara 300115, Romania","Lele, SF (corresponding author), West Univ Timisoara, Dept Biol Chem, Fac Chem Biol Geog, Timisoara 300115, Romania.",sandra.lele@e-uvt.ro,"Lele, Sandra/M-1275-2015; Parvulescu, Lucian/A-1278-2012","Parvulescu, Lucian/0000-0002-1528-1429",Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation; CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0785],"This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0785.

The two predators were functionally equivalent, eliminating Bufo and Hyla, while leaving Pseudacris to numerically dominate ponds with salamanders. Effects of both predators also cascaded down to algal primary producers, which became more abundant where predators reduced the abundance of herbivorous tadpoles. Combined impacts of the two predator species on the survival of Pseudacris were less than that predicted by an additive model of the effects of each predator measured in the absence of the other, but greater than predicted by a multiplicative model of joint predator effects. Reduced growth of Ambystoma with Notophthalmus provides one possible mechanism for the observed shift to less than additive per capita predator effects. Initial variation in prey density influenced prey species composition only in ponds without predators. Increased prey density in ponds without predators reduced the survival of Hyla, apparently through increased interspecific competition among tadpoles.",,"MORIN, PJ (corresponding author), RUTGERS STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA.",,,,,,,58,76,85,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1995,76,1,,,,,133,149,,10.2307/1940637,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QC872,WOS:A1995QC87200012,,,,,2021-09-27,

The extent to which microhabitat partitioning occurs depends on a variety of environmental parameters and biotic interactions. In the present study, we manipulated factors (animal density, presence of heterospecifics, and presence of predator cues) that potentially influence the differential use of microhabitats by 2 hemi-sessile congeners that coexist on small spatial scales at very high densities: the amphipod crustaceans Jassa marmorata and J. herdmani. In both species, the presence of heterospecifics had a clear effect on which part of an offered macroalga was preferably colonized, suggesting that the extent of microhabitat partitioning depends on the presence/absence of heterospecifics. Furthermore, 'predatory fish cues' in the seawater induced an avoidance behaviour, which should reduce the extent of habitat partitioning and inevitably increase competition between the species. The results clearly show some flexibility of habitat selection in, and thus habitat segregation between, the studied species, allowing for a trade-off between interspecific competition and predation pressure.","[Beermann, Jan] Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany; [Boos, Karin] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Beermann, J (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, POB 180, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany.",jan.beermann@awi.de,,"Beermann, Jan/0000-0001-5894-6817",Free University of Berlin (Elsa- Neumann-Stipendium of the Federal State of Berlin),"We thank the crew of the RV 'Aade' for their help in the field and colleagues Heinz- Dieter Franke (Helgoland, Germany), Martin Thiel (Coquimbo, Chile) and Roger Mundry (Leipzig, Germany) for valuable comments and suggestions.

Seasonality and synchrony of the reproductive cycle is especially important for marine species that breed in high latitudes with seasonal booms in ocean productivity. Laysan and black-footed albatrosses breeding in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands have a dual reliance on both seasonally productive waters of high latitudes and on nutrient-poor waters of low latitudes, because their foraging ranges contract during the short but critical brood-guard stage. Therefore, these species face an additional constraint of having to negotiate nutrient-poor waters during the most energeticallydemanding stage of the breeding cycle. This constriction of foraging range likely results in a higher density of foraging competitors. Thus, our aim was to understand how Hawaiian albatross partition resources both between and within species in this highly constrained breeding stage while foraging in less productive waters and simultaneously experiencing increased competition. High-precision GPS dataloggers were deployed on black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes, n= 20) and Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis, n= 18) albatrosses during the brood-guard stage of the breeding season in 2006 (n= 8), 2009 (n= 13), 2010 (n= 16) and 2012 (n= 1). We used GPS data and movement analyses to identify six different behavioral states in foraging albatrosses that we then used to characterize foraging trips across individuals and species. We examined whether variations in behavior were correlated with both intrinsic factors (sex, body size, body condition) and extrinsic factors (lunar phase, wind speed, year). Results: Behavioral partitioning was revealed both between and within species in Hawaiian albatrosses. Both species were highly active during chick-brooding trips and foraged across day and night; however, Laysan albatrosses relied on foraging at night to a greater extent than black-footed albatrosses and exhibited different foraging patterns at night. For both species, foraging along direct flight paths and foraging on the water in a  sit-and-wait strategy were just as prevalent as foraging in a searching flight mode, indicating flexibility in foraging strategies in Hawaiian albatross. Both species strongly increased drift forage at night when the lunar phase was the darkest, suggesting Hawaiian albatross feed on diel vertically-migrating prey to some extent. Black-footed albatrosses showed greater variation in foraging behavior between individuals which suggests a higher level of intra-specific competition. This behavioral variability in black-footed albatrosses was not correlated with sex or body size, but differences in body condition suggested varying efficiencies among foraging patterns. Behavioral variability in Laysan albatrosses was correlated with sex, such that females exhibited greater flight foraging than drift foraging, had longer trip durations and flew farther maximum distances from the breeding colony, but with no difference in body condition. Conclusion: Fine-scale movement data and an analysis of multiple behavioral states identified behavioral mechanisms that facilitate coexistence within a community of albatross during a critical life-history period when energetic demands are high, resources are limited, and competition for food is greatest.","[Conners, Melinda G.; Costa, Daniel P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, 100 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Hazen, Elliott L.] NOAA Fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm Res Div, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Hazen, Elliott L.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Costa, Daniel P.; Shaffer, Scott A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Shaffer, Scott A.] San Jose State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, San Jose, CA 95192 USA","Conners, MG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, 100 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",mgconner@ucsc.edu,"Hazen, Elliott L/G-4149-2014; Shaffer, Scott A/D-5015-2009; Costa, Daniel/E-2616-2013","Hazen, Elliott L/0000-0002-0412-7178; Shaffer, Scott A/0000-0002-7751-5059; Conners, Melinda/0000-0003-0572-0026; Costa, Daniel/0000-0002-0233-5782",Tagging of Pacific Predators program (TOPP); Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative (PICCC); USFWSUS Fish & Wildlife Service; UCSC Regents fellowship; NOAA's Dr. Nancy Foster,"We are indebted to our field team: S.

Multivariate (co-inertia) analysis was used to analyse relationships of habitat and landscape descriptive variables with rodent records. Two main ecological gradients were recognized according to statistical analysis. Relationships of species occurrence with environmental factors were interpreted according to their main life traits. The first ecological gradient clearly differentiated communities from hedges to those of grass-dominated linear banks. This first gradient was associated with the prevalence of forest versus grassland rodent species. This partitioning seems to reflect rather ecological requirements of species than competitive interactions. Small rodents diversity and abundance were inversely evolving along this gradient. The second factor influencing species assemblages was associated to landscape heterogeneity surrounding the permanent habitats. According to this second gradient, species seemed to be selected in relation to their ability to disperse and to use cultivated fields. Maximum diversity was generally observed in heterogeneous permanent habitats with mixed vegetation structure but hedges are important to produce biomass for predators.","Univ Rennes 1, CAREN, UMR CNRS 6553, F-35042 Rennes, France","Alain, B (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, CAREN, UMR CNRS 6553, Av Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France.",alain.butet@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,70,29,32,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

It is abundant and occupies the same habitat as the native orchid, Bletia patula. The two are hosts to the same native weevil, Stethobaris polita, a specialist on orchid flowers. We ask whether the weevils mediate apparent competition between the two orchids. We monitored weevil populations, floral damage and fruit set in B. patula in the presence and absence of S. plicata. We also experimentally tested whether weevils preferred one species over the other. Finally, we modeled the distribution of both orchid species to predict the extent by which the two species may interact in Puerto Rico. We found a significantly lower number of weevils and a higher fruit set for B. patula where S. plicata is absent, indicative that apparent competition is occurring. The choice experiments show that weevils prefer flowers of S. plicata over those of B. patula, but B. patula still sustained considerable damage. The current distribution of the native B. patula is nearly limited to the northern karst region of Puerto Rico. The naturalized S. plicata has a broader range and the models predict that its distribution will strongly overlap with that of B. patula. We expect the S. plicata invasion to continue and affect native orchids through apparent competition as long as the presence of S. plicata maintains elevated weevil populations. Thus, even seemingly harmless invasive orchids can have subtle but significant negative consequences.","[Recart, Wilnelia; Ackerman, James D.; Cuevas, Ana A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Recart, Wilnelia; Ackerman, James D.; Cuevas, Ana A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Ctr Appl Trop Ecol & Conservat, Fac Nat Sci, San Juan, PR 00936 USA","Recart, W (corresponding author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, POB 70377, San Juan, PR 00936 USA.",wilnelia.recart@gmail.com,"Ackerman, James D/AAD-3978-2019","Ackerman, James D/0000-0002-8928-4374; Recart, Wilnelia/0000-0002-5437-9736",NSF-UMEBNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-0602642]; NSF-CRESTNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [HRD-0734826]; Ecological Society of America SEEDs program; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"We thank Curt Daehler, Daniel Diaz, Nadia Flores, Wilfredo Falcon and Raymond Tremblay for helping with the species distribution modeling, GIS techniques and statistics.

We develop a model that draws on elements of metapopulation models of competitors and food chains by allowing competitors to coexist locally in the presence of predators but not in their absence. The model predicts that predators promote regional coexistence by greatly expanding the range of conditions under which two competitors persist at equilibrium. Predators could have positive or negative effects on mean local diversity within the region depending on their dispersal rates, those of the prey, and their effects on prey extinction rates. The presence of predators increased the abundance of inferior competitors, thereby expanding the conditions for positive relationships between local and regional diversity. The model also predicted positive correlations between local diversity of predators and prey. These predictions were supported by patterns of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish species richness among lakes. The model may help to resolve the apparent contrast between linear patterns of local and regional richness and experimental evidence for strong invasion resistance and rapid dispersal in zooplankton.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Shurin, JB (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",shurin@nceas.ucsb.edu; egallen@uchicago.edu,,,,,,73,157,160,0,112,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

We conducted a field experiment in western Finland to evaluate the relative roles of these mechanisms in inducing spatial synchrony among cyclic populations of field voles Microtus agrestis. The study was conducted during the increase and peak phases of a vole population cycle on four agricultural field sites situated 1.5-7.0 km apart. Each field contained two 0.5-ha fenced enclosures and one 1-ha unfenced control area. One enclosure per field allowed access by small mustelid predators and the other by avian predators; all enclosures prevented the dispersal of voles. The unfenced control areas allowed access by all predators as well as dispersal by voles. Enclosed vole populations were in a treatment-wise asynchronous phase before the predator access treatments were applied. The growth rates of all enclosed populations were tightly synchronized during the course of the experiment. Conversely, synchrony both among the unfenced populations and between the fenced and unfenced populations was practically non-existent. During winter, in the increase phase of the cycle, vole populations in all treatments declined to low densities due to a seasonal effect of winter food depletion. During summer, in the peak year of the vole cycle, all populations fluctuated in synchrony. At this time, both small mustelids and birds of prey appeared to be abundant enough to induce synchrony. Dispersal was identified as a potential contributor to synchronization, but the magnitude of its effects could not be reliably discerned. Our results indicate that no single mechanism can account for the observed patterns of spatial synchrony among cyclic northern vole populations. Rather, spatial synchronization is induced by different mechanisms, namely seasonality and predation, acting successively during different seasons and phases of the vole cycle.","Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Huitu, O (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",ohuitu@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,83,25,26,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2005,109,3,,,,,583,593,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13476.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,907MO,WOS:000227722400017,,,,,2021-09-27,

In natural plant communities, the dominant species determine most of the productivity-related processes but what is the function of minor species? A recent hypothesis suggests that after disturbance, minor species facilitate the recruitment and abundance of dominants during re-colonization, thus indirectly determining ecosystem function. We tested this hypothesis using a long-term dataset of annual plant communities in a semiarid shrubland by comparing plant density and biomass from plots in which all vegetation had been removed; plots from which only the dominant (the annual grass Stipa capensis) had been removed, and control plots. In the absence of vegetation, the dominant failed to re-establish during the following growing season. After being removed the dominant re-established similarly to the controls. An ant exclosure experiment excluded the possibility that this was due to seed predation. In an experiment with individual dispersal units of S. capensis, we demonstrated the mechanism by which minor species can control the dominant's abundance. Minor species indirectly govern ecosystem processes by providing structures facilitating seed soil penetration and thus recruitment of the dominant.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Wyler Dept Dryland Agr, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel","Boeken, B (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Wyler Dept Dryland Agr, Sede Boker Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",bboeken@bgu.ac.il,,,,,,36,24,25,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,FEB,2006,9,1,,,,,119,127,,10.1007/s10021-004-0079-x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,017DE,WOS:000235673500009,,,,,2021-09-27,

Such uncertainty hampers prudent decision making about where and when to invest most intensively in species conservation programmes. Demystifying ecosystem responses to biodiversity alterations may he best achieved through the study of the interactions allowing biotic communities to compensate internally for population changes in terms of contributing to ecosystem function, or their intrinsic functional redundancy. Because individual organisms are the biologically discrete working components of ecosystems and because environmental changes are perceived at the scale of the individual, a mechanistic understanding of functional redundancy will hinge upon understanding how individuals' behaviours influence population dynamics in the complex community setting. Here, I use analytical and graphical modelling to construct a conceptual framework for predicting the conditions under which varying degrees of interspecific functional redundancy can be found in dynamic ecosystems. The framework is founded on principles related to food web successional theory, which provides some evolutionary insights for mechanistically linking functional roles of discrete, interacting organisms with the dynamics of ecosystems because energy is the currency both for ecological fitness and for food web commerce. Net productivity is considered the most contextually relevant ecosystem process variable because of its socioeconomic significance and because it ultimately subsumes all biological processes and interactions. Redundancy relative to productivity is suggested to manifest most directly as compensatory niche shifts among adaptive foragers in exploitation ecosystems, facilitating coexistence and enhancing ecosystem recovery after disturbances which alter species' relative abundances, such as extinctions. The framework further explicates how resource scarcity and environmental stochasticity ma!: constitute 'ecosystem legacies' influencing the emergence of redundancy by shaping the background conditions for foraging behaviour evolution and, consequently, the prevalence of compensator!: interactions. Because it generates experimentally testable predictions for a priori hypothesis testing about when and where varying degrees of functional redundancy ale likely to be found in food webs, the framework may be useful for advancing toward the reliable knowledge of biodiversity and ecosystem function relations necessary for prudent prioritization of conservation programmes. The theory presented here introduces explanation of how increasing diversity can have a negative influence on ecosystem sustainability by altering the environment for biotic inter actions and thereby changing functional compensability among biota - under particular conditions.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Johnson, KH (corresponding author), Univ Toledo, Dept Biol, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",khjohnson@netscape.net,,,,,,149,31,31,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

A major challenge for scientists addressing this question is that natural systems are complex. This makes it difficult to test multiple properties of species and features of the resident community simultaneously to determine what factors are most important for establishment success of a species into a novel community. We used the model aquatic system inside the leaves of the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea to test whether properties predicted to be important for establishment success of a species (initial density, competitive ability, body size) are generalizable across communities varying in resource availability and the presence of a top predator. For intermediate trophic-level species, we found that both competitive dominance and initial density were important for establishment success. Although a less competitive species was also able to successfully establish in the communities, high resource availability and high initial density were important for its establishment success. Body size of the introduced species, although correlated with competitive ability, was not an important characteristic for establishment success. The presence of a top predator significantly decreased the densities of the introduced species when resources were low, but did not completely inhibit establishment success. The relative importance of each of these factors, and interactions among them, could not have been discerned through single hypothesis testing. The results from this work show the need for detailed experiments that focus on combinations of factors to understand if mechanisms determining community assembly and species establishment can be generalized across systems.","[Gray, Sarah M.; Dykhuizen, Daniel E.; Padilla, Dianna K.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Gray, SM (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, Ch Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",sarahmarie.gray@unifr.ch,,"Gray, Sarah/0000-0002-4025-6487",National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0909830]; Stony Brook University Slobodkin Award,"Statement of authorship: SMG designed and conducted the experiments, analyzed the results of the project, and wrote the manuscript.

Previous studies have shown that interspecific hybridisation is common among taxa from the Daphnia galeata/hyalina/cucullata species complex. We investigated the influence of predator kairomones on the morphology and life histories of nine clones belonging to three taxa (pure D. galeata, F-1 hybrids between D. galeata and D. hyalina, and backcrossed D. hyalina) of this species complex. Predators exerting positive (fish) and negative (Chaoborus larvae) size-selective predation were tested. 2. The most responsive traits were size at maturity and size of neonates. Despite large between-clone variation, discriminant analysis revealed that the three taxa were distinct from each other in key life-history traits. F-1 hybrids did not react in an intermediate way compared to the other taxa: the multivariate distances between F-1 hybrids and either taxon were larger than between pure D. galeata and backcrossed D. hyalina. 3. The average plasticity (calculated across all traits) was similar for all three taxa. With regard to the size at maturity and neonate body size, the strength of the response was a function of the intrinsic values of these traits expressed in the control. For example, for size at maturity, smaller individuals showed a significantly stronger reaction to Chaoborus kairomones than larger ones. 4. Finally, we monitored seasonal changes in body size, egg number and population density of pure D. galeata and F-1 hybrids in Greifensee (Switzerland). The two taxa experienced similar seasonal changes in body size but, on some sampling dates, they differed in mean egg number. The observed seasonal changes in Daphnia body size were consistent with what would be expected if the predator assemblage shifted from fish to Chaoborus over the course of the summer. The fluctuations in the frequencies of Daphnia taxa, however, were not related to seasonal variation in Daphnia body size. 5. Experimental data suggest that temporally heterogeneous predation regimes might be an important condition stabilising the co-occurrence of Daphnia hybrids with parental taxa. Predation regimes, however, cannot solely explain dynamic changes in taxon frequency in Greifensee.","Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, D-7750 Constance, Germany","Spaak, P (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jwolinsk@indiana.edu,"Wolinska, Justyna/N-6455-2014; Wolinska, Jaroszynska-Wolinska/A-5268-2013","Wolinska, Justyna/0000-0003-2913-2923",,,,56,19,20,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

We asked whether biotic interactions, i.e. competition, facilitation and predation, could explain patterns of coexistence of the 2 species in an estuarine habitat. We also examined whether the effects of such interactions were dependent upon the environmental context. We manipulated predator access to synthetic aggregations of juvenile mussels at different sites using monospecific aggregations of X. securis and M. galloprovincialis and mixed aggregations at high and low densities. Performance of the species was measured as survivorship, growth and condition index. Predation played an important role in determining abundances of both species, especially in the case of the invader, although the effects on survivorship were context dependent. We did not find evidence of intra-or inter-specific competition. Growth rates of the invader were affected by environmental variability (i.e. significant site effect). Condition index of M. galloprovincialis improved in high density aggregations (monospecific and mixed), but only towards the sea (i.e. the outermost site). Results suggest that facilitative rather than competitive interactions contribute to the abundance patterns of the 2 species, at least during the juvenile stage. The environmental context was an important driver of such patterns. We emphasise the need to address the role of positive interactions regarding marine non-indigenous species.","[Gestoso, Ignacio; Olabarria, Celia] Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Arenas, Francisco] Ctr Interdisciplinar Invest Marinha & Ambiental, CIIMAR, Lab Coastal Biodivers, P-4050123 Oporto, Portugal","Gestoso, I (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain.",ignaciogestoso@uvigo.es,"Olabarria, Celia/R-8555-2018; Arenas, Francisco/M-7095-2015; Olabarria, Celia/ABB-5554-2020; Arenas, Francisco/M-6367-2013; Gestoso, Ignacio/E-8742-2015","Olabarria, Celia/0000-0001-8332-5924; Arenas, Francisco/0000-0001-6925-3805; Olabarria, Celia/0000-0001-8332-5924; Arenas, Francisco/0000-0001-6925-3805; Gestoso, Ignacio/0000-0001-5521-3255",Spanish Government through the Ministry of Science and Innovation-FEDER (CLINVA) [CGL2009-07205]; University of Vigo; FCT project CLEF [PTDC/AAC-AMB/102866/2008]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the 'Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade' (POFC-COMPETE) within the 'Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional' (QREN);  [PEst-C/MAR/LA0015/2011],"The research was supported by the Spanish Government through the Ministry of Science and Innovation-FEDER (CLINVA PROJECT CGL2009-07205).

To date, these outcomes have been clear in aquatic ecosystems but not on land. We explicate this discrepancy using a meta-analysis of experimental results from 123 native animal exclusions in natural terrestrial ecosystems (623 pairwise comparisons). Consistent with top-down predictions, we found that herbivores significantly reduced plant abundance, biomass, survival, and reproduction (all P < 0.01) and increased species evenness but not richness (P = 0.06 and P = 0.59, respectively). However, when examining patterns in the strength of top-down effects, with few exceptions, we were unable to detect significantly different effect sizes among biomes, based on local site characteristics (climate or productivity) or study characteristics (study duration or exclosure size). The positive effects on diversity were only significant in studies excluding large animals or located in temperate grasslands. The results demonstrate that top-down regulation by herbivores is a pervasive process shaping terrestrial plant communities at the global scale, but its strength is highly site specific and not predicted by basic site conditions. We suggest that including herbivore densities as a covariate in future exclosure studies will facilitate the discovery of unresolved macroecology trends in the strength of herbivore-plant interactions.","[Jia, Shihong; Wang, Xugao; Yuan, Zuoqiang; Lin, Fei; Ye, Ji; Hao, Zhanqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Jia, Shihong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Luskin, Matthew Scott] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Smithsonian Inst Global Earth Observ, Ctr Trop Forest Sci, Washington, DC 20012 USA; [Luskin, Matthew Scott] Nanyang Technol Univ, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Wang, XG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.; Luskin, MS (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Smithsonian Inst Global Earth Observ, Ctr Trop Forest Sci, Washington, DC 20012 USA.; Luskin, MS (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",wangxg@iae.ac.cn; mattluskin@gmail.com,"wang, xugao/B-1111-2015; JIA, SHIHONG/E-3362-2014","wang, xugao/0000-0003-1207-8852; Luskin, Matthew/0000-0002-5236-7096; JIA, SHIHONG/0000-0002-4895-9881","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDPB0203]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31722010, 31730015]","S.J. and M.S.L. thank the Smithsonian Institute's Center for Tropical Forest Science and the 2016 and 2017 summer workshops for providing funding and space to conduct this work.

There has been much recent interest in determining factors that influence the growth of bluegill so that management remedies can be designed to alleviate stunting. Bluegill population size structure is unlikely controlled by any one factor. Instead, multiple variables likely interact to regulate adult size. We used Akaike's information criterion to determine how various environmental variables influence the size-specific growth of bluegill at 50, 100, and 150 mm total length (TL) in 16 lakes. Eight models related to prey availability, lake productivity, lake habitat, predation pressure, intraspecific competition, angling pressure, gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) density, and population social structure were constructed. Population social structure had the greatest effect on the size-specific growth rates of fish at 50 mm TL. At this size we found a significant negative relationship between size-specific growth rates and the mean age of maturation of males in the population. Size-specific growth rates at 100 and 150 mm TL were negatively related to gizzard shad density. These results suggest that management actions that help to increase the numbers of large males and reduce gizzard shad density would help alleviate stunting in bluegill populations.","[Oplinger, Randall W.; Diana, Matthew J.; Wahl, David H.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA","Oplinger, RW (corresponding author), Utah Div Wildlife Resources, Fisheries Expt Stn, 1465 West 200 North, Logan, UT 84321 USA.",randy_oplinger@hotmail.com,,,Federal Aid in Sportfish Restoration Project [F-128-R]; Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Project [F-69-R],"We thank the staff of the Kaskaskia Biological Station, Illinois Natural History Survey, for their assistance in the field and laboratory.

These five species were selected from a large tree flora on several criteria. All possess large (3-10 cm) well-protected seeds that might plausibly be attractive to mammalian seed predators. The reproductive biology of three of the species, or close congeners, had been studied elsewhere in the Neotropics (Astrocaryum, Dipteryx, Hymenaea); one is important to the economy of southeastern Peru (Bertholletia); and one, despite large and apparently edible seeds, appeared to suffer no pre-germination loss to predators (Calatola). We conducted the research in mature forests in the Manu National Park of southeastern Peru where mammal densities are unperturbed by human activities. Densities of adult trees of the five species in our area range from very high (> 30 per ha: Astrocaryum) to very low (much less than 1 per ha: Hymenaea). Loss of seeds to all causes, and to mammalian seed predators in particular, was determined for seeds placed in 2-square meter mammal exclosures and in open controls located at 10 m (near) and 50 m (far) from a large mature individual of the target species (with minor variations in the design for Astrocaryum and Calatola). The exclosures were of two types: impermeable - designed to exclude all mammals, but not invertebrate seed predators, and semipermeable - designed to admit small (< 500 g), but not large mammals. Experimental and control plots were stocked with apparently viable seeds during the dry-wet transition period (October-November) and scored one year later. A significant distance effect (higher predation near vs far from a large conspecific adult) was found in only one of the species (Astrocaryum), the only one to be attacked with high frequency by invertebrate seed predators. The absence of any detectable distance effect attributable to mammals suggests that mammals, over the course of a year, thoroughly search the forest floor for seeds. Invertebrates may thus be responsible for most pre-germination distance (density) effects. With respect to the treatments, we found three qualitatively distinct results: seeds of three species (Astrocaryum, Bertholletia, Dipteryx) were significantly protected by the impermeable, but not semipermeable exclosures, implicating small mammals in seed loss; the seeds of one species (Hymenaea) were significantly protected by exclosures of both types, implicating large mammals; and the seeds of one species (Calatola) exhibited 100% survival, whether or not protected by exclosures. The importance of large mammals as seed predators is generally underestimated in these experiments because semipermeable exclosures may serve as foraging reserves for small mammals. Finally, we noted no relationship between the intensity of mammalian seed predation (as suggested by the survival of unprotected seeds) and the abundance of adults of the five species in the environment. The diversity of results obtained for the five species reveals that large-seeded tropical trees may display a wide range of demographic patterns, and points to the likely importance of post-germination bottlenecks in the population biology of many species, even those that may experience severe pre-germination seed loss.","PRINCETON UNIV, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT, PRINCETON, NJ 08544 USA","TERBORGH, J (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV, CTR TROP CONSERVAT, 3705 ERWIN RD, DURHAM, NC 27705 USA.",,,,,,,37,68,71,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0042-3106,,,VEGETATIO,Vegetatio,JUN,1993,108,,,,,,375,386,,,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,LR397,WOS:A1993LR39700031,,,,,2021-09-27,

We performed field-cage experiments to detect the presence of both intra- and interspecific competition among adults of two common, grass-feeding grasshoppers, Ageneotettix deorum (Scudder) and Amphitornus coloradus (Thomas). Based on increased mortality and lowered fecundity at higher densities, strong evidence for intraspecific competition exists for both species. Interspecific competition was weaker than intraspecific competition in this study. When interspecific competition existed, it was asymmetric in its effect, with the larger species (A. coloradus) negatively impacting the smaller one (A. deorum). Although there was little evidence for interspecific effects on mortality, egg production was impacted in a size-dependent, asymmetric manner between the two species. Significant density-dependent depression of available food was observed for A. coloradus, the larger species. Experiments were run at high densities (10-30 individuals per square meter), levels only irregularly reached under natural conditions (either in sporadic patches or overall about every 10-12 yr). Because naturally occurring densities are typically below the competitive threshold, interspecific competition between these two species may occur only intermittently.

Breeding site selection may be based on previous experience, or on social information from the density and success of competitors with an earlier phenology. Variation in animal breeding phenology is often correlated with variation in habitat quality. Generally, animals breed earlier in high-quality habitats that allow them to reach a nutritional threshold required for breeding earlier or avoid nest predation. In addition, habitat quality may affect phenological overlap between species and thereby interspecific competition. Therefore, we hypothesized that competitor breeding phenology can be used as social cue by settling migrants to locate high-quality breeding sites. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally advanced and delayed hatching phenology of two resident tit species on the level of study plots and studied male and female settlement patterns of migratory pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca. The manipulations were assigned at random in two consecutive years, and treatments were swapped between years in sites that were used in both years. In both years, males settled in equal numbers across treatments, but later arriving females avoided pairing with males in delayed phenology plots. Moreover, male pairing probability declined strongly with arrival date on the breeding grounds. Our results demonstrate that competitor phenology may be used to assess habitat quality by settling migrants, but we cannot pinpoint the exact mechanism (e.g. resource quality, predation pressure or competition) that has given rise to this pattern. In addition, we show that opposing selection pressures for arrival timing may give rise to different social information availabilities between sexes. We discuss our findings in the context of climate warming, social information use and the evolution of protandry in migratory animals.","[Samplonius, Jelmer M.; Both, Christiaan] Univ Groningen, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","Samplonius, JM (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands.",jelmersamplonius@gmail.com,"Both, Christiaan/E-6459-2011; Samplonius, Jelmer M./H-6689-2019","Both, Christiaan/0000-0001-7099-9831; Samplonius, Jelmer Menno/0000-0002-8700-4041",University of Groningen,"This project was supported by the University of Groningen.

Additional control plots without soyabean were also established. The two objectives were to determine (1) whether predispersal seed predation occurs in A. retroflexus or C. album , and (2) whether disturbance (soil tillage) or microclimate (planting pattern) influence predation level. Mean rates of seed predation were 26% and 4% in A. retroflexus and C. album , respectively. Although these levels were low at the population level, individual plants of both species had predation levels ranging from 0% to 80%, however, very few individuals of C. album had levels of predation above 10%. Differences among tillage and row width treatments occurred for A. retroflexus , but not for C. album . Amaranthus retroflexus and C. album growing within the soyabean crop received less light than those in the no-crop plots, and produced less above-ground biomass, smaller terminal inflorescences, and fewer seeds per inflorescence.

Appropriate agroecosystems management may favour this type of indirect interaction. In that context, our aim was to test the effect of rose bush [Rosa rugosa (Thunb.)] strips on the building up of aphid populations and of their natural enemies in adjacent cereal habitats. Several aphid species are currently found on Rosa sp. including Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) for which it is a primary host. Aphid predators and parasitoids may build their populations on the aphid population present on Rosa sp. and later on migrate to wheat field during the cereal aphid infestation. Moreover, the flowers of the rose bushes may provide a source of nectar and pollen to these natural enemies. Our experiment was conducted in three rose margin wheat plots with a strip of rose bushes of R. rugosa and three control plots. Plots were compared during 2 years (2003 and 2004). Aphid, parasitoid and predator densities were recorded from May to the harvest of wheat on rose bushes and in wheat. In 2003, the aphid densities were moderate but in 2004, the population of aphid was very high. Even if predator and parasitoids arrived earlier in rose margin field than in control ones, the presence of rose bushes did not influence the aphid population within the field. Metopolophium dirhodum did not seem to migrate from the rose bushes to wheat. The level of parasitism was weak in rose bushes and the natural enemy population was not different in rose margin wheat and in control plots. The causes of the lack of efficiency of this type of management are discussed as well as the high aphid population in wheat in 2004.","Univ Catholique Louvain, Unite Ecol & Biogeog, Biodivers Res Ctr, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium","Frere, I (corresponding author), Univ Catholique Louvain, Unite Ecol & Biogeog, Biodivers Res Ctr, Pl Croix Sud 4-5, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",frere@ecol.ucl.ac.be,,,,,,29,20,22,0,26,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0931-2048,,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

Under conditions of abundant fruit, A. spatulata was the dominant exploiter at the population level, as shown by its ability to infest the largest number of fruits of the three herbivores and substantially displace its moth competitors. In a separate experiment, when resource-partitioning species were excluded, A. spatulata infested twice as many fruits as the two moth species (44.3%).

According to our data, the Comoro islands are inhabited by two amphibian species and at least 28 species of reptiles although ongoing genetic studies and unconfirmed historical records suggest an even higher species diversity. 14 of the 28 currently recognized species of terrestrial reptiles (50%) and the two amphibians are endemic to a single island or to the Comoro archipelago. The majority of species are most abundant at low elevation. However, a few endemic species, like the gekkonid lizards Paroedura sanctijohannis and Phelsuma nigristriata, are more common in or even confined to higher altitudes. We created habitat maps from remotely sensed data in combination with detailed species distribution maps produced using comprehensive data from field surveys between 2000 and 2010, literature, and historical locality records based on specimens in zoological collections. Using these data, we assessed the conservation status of the endemic terrestrial reptiles and amphibians according to the IUCN Red List criteria. Our results show that although little area of natural forest remains on the Comoros, many species are abundant in degraded forest or plantations. Competition and predation by invasive species appears to be the most important threat factor for the endemic herpetofauna, together with habitat degradation and destruction, which further favours invasive species. We propose the status Endangered for three species, Vulnerable for one species, Near Threatened for six species, Least Concern for four and Data Deficient for two species. The endemic subspecies Oplurus cuvieri comorensis is proposed for the status Critically Endangered. Based on the results of this study, seven areas of importance for reptile and amphibian conservation on the Comoros are identified. This study shows how remote sensing data can contribute to increasing accuracy and objectiveness of conservation assessments.","[Hawlitschek, Oliver; Brueckmann, Boris; Berger, Johannes; Glaw, Frank] Zool Staatssammlung Munchen Bavarian State Collec, D-81247 Munich, Germany; [Green, Katie] Bristol Conservat & Sci Fdn, Comoros Project Off, Anjouan, Comoros","Hawlitschek, O (corresponding author), Zool Staatssammlung Munchen Bavarian State Collec, Munchhausenstr 21, D-81247 Munich, Germany.",oliver.hawlitschek@gmx.de,,,Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund [0925157]; DAADDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)European Commission [D/09/49634]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [GL 314/1]; Society of the University of Munich; EES of the University of Munich; Synthesys grant [FR-TAF-2988],"The research was financially supported by the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (project 0925157), by DAAD grant D/09/49634 to O.

In a fully replicated, landscape scale experiment, we manipulated densities of domestic sheep in mountain pastures in Norway. We then determined population growth and densities of rodents by live trapping in each of the areas with different sheep densities. We found that the (summer) population growth rate and autumn density of the field vole (Microtus agrestis) was lower at high sheep density. This provides the first experimental evidence of negative interactions between an ungulate and small rodent species. There was no effect on the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), whose diet differs from sheep. Sheep density, therefore, potentially alters the pattern of inter-specific population synchrony amongst voles. Our study shows that negative interactions between large ungulates and small rodents may be species-specific and negative population consequences for the rodent population appear above threshold ungulate densities.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Program Expt Behav & Ecol Res, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Mysterud, A (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, POB 1066 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",atle.mysterud@bio.uio.no,"Mysterud, Atle/AAQ-2864-2020; Steen, Harald/A-3198-2012","Mysterud, Atle/0000-0001-8993-7382; ",,,,61,66,75,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2005,143,3,,,,,357,364,,10.1007/s00442-004-1792-z,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,918CT,WOS:000228517300003,15726430,,,,2021-09-27,

The influence of body size on coexistence is well studied under the exclusive resources framework, but has received less attention under the shared-resources framework. We investigate body-size-dependent allometric extensions of a classical MacArthur-type model where two consumers compete for two shared resources. The equilibrium coexistence criteria are compared against the general predictions of the alternative framework over exclusive resources. From the asymmetry in body size allometry of resource encounter versus demand our model shows, counterintuitively, and contrary to the exclusive resource framework, that a smaller consumer should be competitively superior across a wide range of supplies of the two resource types. Experimental studies are reviewed to resolve this difference among the two frameworks that arise from their respective assumptions over resource distribution. Another prediction is that the smaller consumer may have relatively stronger control over equilibrium resource abundance, and the loss of smaller consumers from a community may induce relatively stronger trophic cascades. Finally, from satiating consumers' functional response, our model predicts that greater difference among resource sizes can allow a broader range of consumer body sizes to coexist, and this is consistent with the predictions of the alternative framework over exclusive resources. Overall, this analysis provides an objective comparison of the two alternative approaches to understand species coexistence that have heretofore developed in relative isolation. It advances classical consumer-resource theory to show how body size can be an important factor in resource competition and coexistence.","[Bagchi, Sumanta] Texas A&M Univ, Deparment Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Bagchi, Sumanta; Ritchie, Mark E.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Bagchi, Sumanta] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore 570002, Karnataka, India","Bagchi, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Deparment Ecosyst Sci & Management, 325 Anim Ind Bldg, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",sumanta@ncf-india.org,,,"National Science Foundation (DDIG)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0608287, DEB-0543398]; National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; Wildlife Conservation Society; Rufford Maurice Laing Foundation","Support was received from National Science Foundation (DDIG DEB-0608287 to SB and DEB-0543398 to MER) and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (to MER) while preparing this manuscript.

Most demonstrations of the impacts of size variation in trophic systems have focused on size variation in predator species, and the consequences of size variation in prey species are less well understood. We investigated how prey size structure shapes intra- and interspecific interactions in experiments with a gape-limited predator (larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus) and its heterospecific prey (frog tadpoles, Rana pirica). We found that large and small tadpole size groups each increased mortality in the other group by intensifying salamander predation; this type of indirect interactions is called apparent competition. The antagonistic impacts on the prey size groups were caused by different size-specific mechanisms. By consuming small tadpoles, the salamanders grew large enough to consume large tadpoles. The activity of large tadpoles, by increasing the activity of the small tadpoles, may increase the number of encounters with the predator and thus small tadpole mortality. These results suggest that the magnitude of a predator's ecological role, such as whether a top-down trophic cascade is initiated, depends on size variation in its heterospecific prey.","[Yamaguchi, Aya] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Aya; Kishida, Osamu] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan","Yamaguchi, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan.; Yamaguchi, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan.",cryamaguchi.514@gmail.com,"Kishida, Osamu/B-7970-2011",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24370004]","We are very grateful to Noboru Katayama, Kunio Takatsu, Megumi Nosaka, Tomoko Sato and Natsuko Sakai for outstanding support during our experiments.

We analysed nest-site characteristics, breeding success and competitive interactions between two apex predator populations. Whereas the Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus has nested in the Judean Foothills (Israel) for a long time, the Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus has only invaded the nesting habitat of the Short-toed Eagle during their breeding season in the last two decades. These two recently sympatric species have similar nesting ecology and frequently use the same nests. They are therefore expected to compete over nesting sites and territories. We analysed interspecific interactions between these two species by combining information from comprehensive observational, experimental, GIS analysis and remote sensing data, deriving 65 variables to characterize the nest- sites used and the breeding success in 381 breeding attempts over four consecutive breeding seasons. To assess interspecific and intraspecific territorial behaviour and aggressiveness, stuffed Long-legged Buzzards and Short-toed Eagles were presented close to nests. Nestsite characteristics overlapped substantially between species, and Long-legged Buzzards occupied 21% of all Short-toed Eagle nests. Intraspecific aggression rates among Long-legged Buzzards were higher than their interspecific aggression rates with Short-toed Eagles and also higher than intraspecific aggression among Short-toed Eagles. Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle breeding densities (1.59 +/- 0.11 and 2.96 +/- 0.11 pairs per 10 km(2), respectively) are likely to be the highest across their respective breeding distributions, with a maximum productivity of 0.96 +/- 0.01 and 0.56 +/- 0.05 (young fledged/breeding pair) for Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle, respectively. Intraspecific interactions among both species play an important role in determining their breeding success and the spatial distribution of nesting sites. Our results suggest that interspecific competition over nesting sites and territories between both species, and the potential dominance of Long-legged Buzzard, has both direct and indirect impacts on the spatial and demographic distribution of Short-toed Eagles due to the recent establishment of Long-legged Buzzard territories in the Judean breeding area.","[Friedemann, Guilad; Leshem, Yossi; Kerem, Lior] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Bar-Massada, Avi] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, Qiryat Tivon, Israel; [Izhaki, Ido] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Fac Nat Sci, Haifa, Israel","Friedemann, G (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.",gilad.fridman@gmail.com,"Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019","Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683",Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF); Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel); Smaller-Winnikow Foundation; Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA); Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI); Rieger Foundation (USA); Raptor Research Foundation (RFF); International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel); Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel),"This research was supported by the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel), Smaller-Winnikow Foundation, Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI), Rieger Foundation (USA), Raptor Research Foundation (RFF), The International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel) and Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel).

Both growth rate and survival are enhanced when heterospecific sponges adhere to each other, as demonstrated by experiments in which sponges of the same size and genotype were grown (1) in intimate association with conspecific vs. heterospecific sponges, (2) alone vs. in intimate association with conspecific sponges, and (3) alone on the primary substratum vs. attached to an intact branch of a conspecific or heterospecific sponge. Natural development and long-term dynamics of these associations were observed in unmanipulated individuals and also modelled by an experiment in which branches were exchanged between neighboring sponges. The three species studied (lotrochota birotulata, Amphimedon rubens, and Aplysina fulva) share an erect branching growth form but differ in tissue and skeletal characteristics sufficiently that they are in different orders of the Class Demospongiae. Reflecting these differences, the species are demonstrated to differ from each other in their susceptibility to a variety of environmental hazards, including predation by angelfishes and trunkfishes, predation by starfish, smothering by sediment, breakage by storm waves, pulverization by storm waves, toppling by storm waves, fragment mortality, and pathogens. Although the mechanisms by which growth rate is enhanced by adhering to a heterospecific sponge are unknown, these sponges appear to be able to decrease their loss rate by adhering tightly to sponges of species that differ from them in chemistry, tissue density, and skeletal construction, thereby increasing survival of hazards to which they would succumb when growing alone.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST,BALBOA,PANAMA",,,,,,,,52,61,64,0,35,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1997,78,1,,,,,146,159,,,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WD345,WOS:A1997WD34500011,,,,,2021-09-27,

In particular, competition with older and larger conspecifics and heterospecifics may influence the number and characteristics of individuals successfully making the transition. We investigated whether the availability of enemy-free space mediated the interaction between adult goldspot gobies (Gnatholepis thompsoni), a common tropical reef fish, and juvenile conspecifics that had recently settled from the plankton. We added rocks, which provide refuge from predators, to one-half of each of five entire coral reefs in the Bahamas and measured the survival and growth of recent settlers in relation to adult goby densities. We also evaluated whether mortality was selective with respect to three larval traits (age at settlement, size at settlement, and presettlement growth rate) and measured the influence of refuge availability and adult goby density on selection intensity. Selective mortality was measured by comparing larval traits of newly settled gobies (<= 5 d postsettlement) with those of survivors (2-3 week postsettlement juveniles). We detected a negative relationship between juvenile survival and adult goby density in both low- and high-refuge habitats, though experimental refuge addition reduced the intensity of this density dependence. Juvenile growth also declined with increasing adult goby density, but this effect was similar in both low- and high-refuge habitats. Refuge availability had no consistent effect on selective mortality, but adult goby density was significantly related to the intensity of size-selective mortality: bigger juveniles were favored where adults were abundant, and smaller juveniles were favored where adults were rare. Given the typically large difference in sizes of juveniles and adults, similar stage-structured interactions may be common but underappreciated in many marine species.","[Samhouri, Jameal F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Steele, Mark A.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Forrester, Graham E.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Samhouri, JF (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",jameal.samhouri@noaa.gov,,"Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917; Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 0222087]; American Museum of Natural History; American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists; International Women's Fishing Association; Sigma Xi; UC Regents; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; NOAA-NURPNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [CMRC-05-PRRV-01-05A, CMRC-01-NRME-010-3C, CMRC-03-NRME-01-04A, CMRC-03-NRME-01-05C]","Many thanks to those who helped us with field work, including R.

If so, what are the causative mechanisms and their implications? We conducted an eight-year multigeneration study of population dynamics of bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) inhabiting four large coral reefs in the Bahamas. After a four-year baseline period, it was clear that two populations naturally received very few settlement-stage larvae, so recruitment of recently settled fish was artificially enhanced at one low-settlement reef and reduced at one high-settlement reef to ensure a broad range of population sizes over which to test for regulation. Over all eight years, populations on the two naturally high-settlement reefs experienced temporal density dependence in multiple per capita demographic rates: mortality, survival to adulthood, and fecundity. These local populations also displayed components of regulation: persistence, boundedness, and return tendency. Reefs supporting regulated populations were structurally complex, providing sufficient prey refuges that ensured high survival at low densities. In contrast, populations at low-settlement reefs experienced either density-independent or slightly inversely density-dependent demographic rates, even though recruitment was artificially augmented to high levels at one reef. There was no evidence of regulation at these reefs, and indeed, one local population suffered temporary extirpation. Here, habitat complexity was relatively low, increasing the risk of predation, especially at low population densities when fish would have to travel longer distances when finding mates or home sites inhabited by conspecifics. Among all demographic parameters, density dependence in individual growth (an indicator of within-species competition for food) was least correlated with the presence or absence of local population regulation. We conclude that, for systems like these, the environmental context of a local population, especially predation risk and the distribution and abundance of spatial refuges, is more important than the magnitude of larval supply alone in determining the existence of regulating density dependence. At the broader metapopulation scale, density dependence in both survival and fecundity exogenously caused by predation may provide regulation for the entire stock, even when endogenous within-species competition (assumed to be important in most fisheries models) is weak.","[Hixon, Mark A.; Anderson, Todd W.; Johnson, Darren W.; McLeod, J.

Over the past century and a half, blue crabs have been exposed to an expanding set of exotic species, a few of which are potential competitors. To test for interactions with invasive crabs, juvenile C. sapidus males were placed in competition experiments for a food item with two common non-indigenous crabs, the green crab Carcinus maenas (L.) and the Japanese shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus (De Haan). Agonistic interactions were evaluated when they occurred. In addition, each species' potential to resist predators was examined by testing carapace strength. Results showed that C. maenas was a superior competitor to both C. sapidus and H. sanguineus for obtaining food, while the latter two species were evenly matched against each other. Regarding agonism, C. sapidus, was the loser a disproportionate number of times. C. sapidus carapaces also had a significantly lower breaking strength. These experiments suggest that both as a competitor, and as potential prey, juvenile blue crabs have some disadvantages compared with these common sympatric exotic crab species, and in areas where these exotics are common, juvenile native blue crabs may be forced to expend more energy in conflict that could be spent foraging, and may be forced away from prime food items toward less optimum prey.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Grad Program Ecol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Bloomfield Coll, Div Social & Behav Sci, Bloomfield, NJ 07003 USA","MacDonald, JA (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 195 Univ Ave, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",macdja@eden.rutgers.edu,,,,,,27,57,59,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Although it is well recognized that the size and configuration of secondary foundation species' patches are critical features modulating the ecological effects of facilitation cascades [2], the mechanisms governing their spatial distribution are often challenging to discern given that they operate across multiple spatial and temporal scales [1, 3]. We therefore combined regional surveys of southeastern US salt marsh geomorphology and invertebrate communities with a predator exclusion experiment to elucidate the drivers, both geomorphic and biotic, controlling the establishment, persistence, and ecosystem functioning impacts of a regionally abundant facilitation cascade involving habitat-forming marsh cordgrass and aggregations of ribbed mussels. We discovered a hierarchy of physical and biological factors predictably controlling the strength and self-organization of this facilitation cascade across creekshed, landscape, and patch scales. These results significantly enhance our capacity to spatially predict coastal ecosystem function across scales based on easily identifiable metrics of geomorphology that are mechanistically linked to ecological processes. Replication of this approach across vegetated coastal ecosystems has the potential to support management efforts by elucidating the multi-scale linkages between geomorphology and ecology that, in turn, define spatially explicit patterns in community assembly and ecosystem functioning.","[Crotty, Sinead M.; Angelini, Christine] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, Environm Engn Sci, POB 116580, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Crotty, Sinead M.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Environm, Carbon Containment Lab, Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Crotty, SM (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, Environm Engn Sci, POB 116580, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Crotty, SM (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Yale Sch Environm, Carbon Containment Lab, Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",sinead.crotty@yale.edu,,,"NSF CAREERNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1652628]; NSF EAGERNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1546638]; NSF GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1315138, 1842473]",We thank A.

The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a damaging pest and tospovirus vector that has invaded most of the world, and competitive superiority is considered one of the main reasons for this species' success. 3. However, a recent study demonstrated that competition between larval F. occidentalis and a native thrips species may be limiting F. occidentalis abundance in much of the eastern United States. Frankliniella occidentalis also has a limited abundance in central and southern Florida, which is dominated by the endemic F. bispinosa (Morgan). The potential for interspecific competition to limit F. occidentalis abundance in Florida was assessed. 4. The effects of competition between F. occidentalis and F. bispinosa on adult reproduction on a common host (Capsicum annuum L.) were quantified, using a response surface experimental design and a combination of linear and non-linear competition models. 5. Evidence of symmetric competition between these thrips species was found, but contrary to expectations, F. occidentalis reproduced more in dense interspecific populations than F. bispinosa. These results suggest that, unlike most of the eastern US, interspecific competition is not important in limiting F. occidentalis abundance in central and southern Florida.","[Northfield, Tobin D.; Funderburk, Joe E.] Univ Florida, N Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Quincy, FL USA; [Paini, Dean R.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Acton Act, Australia; [Reitz, Stuart R.] USDA ARS CMAVE, Tallahassee, FL USA","Northfield, TD (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99163 USA.",tnorthfield@wsu.edu,"Paini, Dean R/C-2341-2009; Reitz, Stuart/B-7667-2008; Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019; Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X",University of FloridaUniversity of Florida; USDA-ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service,"Brian Inouye and Ben Bolker assisted greatly with R code.

We investigate changes in partitioning of the temporal niche in a mammalian community in response to both the rapid decline in abundance of a top predator and its rapid increase, produced by two concurrent natural experiments: 1) the severe decline of the Tasmanian devil due to a transmissible cancer, and 2) the introduction of Tasmanian devils to an island, with subsequent population increase. We focus on devils, two mesopredators and three prey species, allowing us to examine niche partitioning in the context of intra- and inter-specific competition, and predator-prey interactions. The most consistent shift in temporal activity occurred in devils themselves, which were active earlier in the night at high densities, presumably because of heightened intraspecific competition. When devils were rare, their closest competitor, the spotted-tailed quoll, increased activity in the early part of the night, resulting in increased overlap with the devil's temporal niche and suggesting release from interference competition. The invasive feral cat, another mesopredator, did not shift its temporal activity in response to either decreasing or increasing devil densities. Shifts in temporal activity of the major prey species of devils were stronger in response to rising than to falling devil densities. We infer that the costs associated with not avoiding predators when their density is rising (i.e. death) are higher than the costs of continuing to adopt avoidance behaviours as predator densities fall (i.e. loss of foraging opportunity), so rising predator densities may trigger more rapid shifts. The rapid changes in devil abundance provide a unique framework to test how the non-lethal effects of top predators affect community-wide partitioning of temporal niches, revealing that this top predator has an important but varied influence on the diel activity of other species.","[Cunningham, Calum X.; Scoleri, Vince; Johnson, Christopher N.; Barmuta, Leon A.; Jones, Menna E.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Johnson, Christopher N.] Univ Tasmania, Australian Res Council, Ctr Australian Biodivers & Heritage, Hobart, Tas, Australia","Cunningham, CX (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",calum.cunningham@utas.edu.au,"Cunningham, Calum X/O-9638-2015; Johnson, Christopher N/J-7894-2014; Barmuta, Leon/J-2413-2013; CABAH, ARC/T-6419-2019","Cunningham, Calum X/0000-0003-1640-2533; Johnson, Christopher N/0000-0002-9719-3771; Barmuta, Leon/0000-0002-8946-3727; Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022; Scoleri, Vince/0000-0002-8112-6689","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP110103069, FT100100250]; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Save the Tasmanian Devil Appeal","Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council (DP110103069 and FT100100250), Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment and the Save the Tasmanian Devil Appeal.",,60,13,13,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,DEC,2019,42,12,,,SI,,2157,2168,,10.1111/ecog.04485,,SEP 2019,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JU0HZ,WOS:000487950700001,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-27,

The general importance of metacommunity and metapopulation theories is poorly understood because few studies have examined responses of the suite of species that occupy the same fragmented landscape. In this study, we examined the importance of spatial ecological theories using a large-scale, naturally fragmented landscape. 2. We measured the occurrence and abundance of 44 common beetle species in 31 natural rainforest fragments in Tasmania, Australia. We tested for an effect on beetle distribution of geographic variables (patch area, patch isolation and amount of surrounding habitat) and of environmental variables based on plant species, after first accounting for spatial autocorrelation using principal coordinates of neighbour matrices. The environmental variables described a productivity gradient and a post-fire succession from eucalypt-dominated forest to late-successional rainforest. 3. Few species had distributions consistent with a metapopulation. However, the amount of surrounding habitat and patch isolation influenced the occurrence or abundance of 30% of beetle species, implying that dispersal into or out of patches was an important process. 4. Three species showed a distribution that could arise by interactions with dominant competitors or predators with higher occurrence in small patches. 5. Environmental effects were more commonly observed than spatial effects. Twenty-three per cent of species showed evidence of habitat-driven, deterministic metapopulations. Furthermore, almost half of the species were influenced by the plant succession or productivity gradient, including effects at the within-patch, patch and regional scales. The beetle succession involved an increase in the frequency of many species, and the addition of new species, with little evidence of species turnover. Niche-related ecological theory such as the species-sorting metacommunity theory was therefore the most broadly applicable concept. 6. We conclude that classic and source-sink metapopulations are probably rare in this large-scale, naturally fragmented system, although dispersal processes like those occurring in metapopulations may have a substantial influence on community composition. However, deterministic processes (niche specialisation, species-sorting metacommunities and deterministic metapopulations) drive the occurrence or frequency of the majority of species. We urge further research into the prevalence of spatial ecological processes in large-scale natural ecosystems to expand our understanding of the processes that may be important in nature.","[Driscoll, Don A.; Kirkpatrick, Jamie B.; McQuillan, Peter B.; Bonham, Kevin J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Driscoll, Don A.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Driscoll, DA (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",don.driscoll@anu.edu.au,"McQuillan, Peter B/C-2373-2014; Driscoll, Don/I-1703-2013","Driscoll, Don/0000-0002-1560-5235; Kirkpatrick, James/0000-0003-2763-2692; McQuillan, Peter/0000-0001-6334-372X",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"We thank Madelaine Hanson for assistance in the field, Amelia Koch for her feedback on an earlier draft and Simon Grove for access to Forestry Tasmania's beetle collections.

A tractable experimental design to determine such effects and their interactions for demersal (seafloor oriented) fishes and similar sedentary species is cross-factoring multiple densities of new recruits with the presence and absence of predators. This design allows one to distinguish between density-dependent mortality due to competition alone, predation alone, or an interaction between the two, especially when supplemental field observations are available. To date, 14 species of marine fish have been examined with some variant of this design, and for 12 species predation was demonstrated to be the sole or major cause of density dependence. However, as competition may be slow acting relative to predation, the importance of competition can be underestimated in short-term experiments. On the Great Barrier Reef, we conducted a long-term field experiment in which multiple densities of new recruits of a planktivorous damselfish were cross-factored with the presence or absence of resident piscivorous fish on patch reefs. During the first 10,months, no density-dependent mortality was detected, regardless of whether resident predators were present or absent. By the end of the experiment at 17 months, per capita mortality was strongly density dependent and highly compensatory in both predator treatments; all reefs ultimately supported nearly the same adult density regardless of experimental treatment. Examination of treatment effect sizes suggested that competition was the main source of density-dependent mortality, with predation being merely a proximate agent of death. We hypothesize that predators were ineffective in this system compared with similar studies elsewhere because prey density was low relative to ample prey refuges provided by highly complex corals. Combined with previous studies, these findings indicate that density-dependent mortality in demersal marine fishes is often caused by interplay of predation and competition, whose roles may be altered by variation in habitat complexity and larval supply. These conclusions are relevant to marine fisheries models, which typically assume that density dependence is due solely to intraspecific competition.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Hixon, MA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",hixonm@science.oregonstate.edu,"Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010","Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245",,,,73,193,198,0,87,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2005,86,11,,,,,2847,2859,,10.1890/04-1455,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,986AB,WOS:000233419600001,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-27,

Some prey species can shift their daily activity patterns to reduce the risk of encountering predators, and, in turn, predators develop strategies to increase their chances of meeting prey. European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a key species in Iberian Mediterranean ecosystems. It is the main prey for many vertebrate predators. It is also a game species and is often the target of management measures such as translocations. Aims. To test whether rabbits adjust their activity patterns in response to differing predation regimes in a management context. Methods. Rabbits were translocated from a donor area, with a high rabbit density, to a release area in central Spain, with a semi-permeable fenced plot and an unfenced plot, which had no rabbits before the translocation. We estimated daily activity patterns and relative abundance index (RAI) for mesocarnivores and rabbits by using camera-traps, and calculated Jacobs selection index (JSI) to classify each species in a diel period. Additionally, we calculated the activity overlap between prey and mesocarnivores in the different areas. Key results. Rabbits were nocturnal in the donor area, where only two mesocarnivore species were detected, red fox (Vulpes vulpes, with a high RAI) and Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon, with a low RAI). However, in the unfenced area, where five mesocarnivore species were present, rabbits showed a crepuscular trend with two activity peaks, around sunrise and around sunset. In contrast, rabbits showed a nocturnal activity in the fenced plot, where four mesocarnivore species were detected but where only the Egyptian mongoose (strictly diurnal) had a high RAI value. Conclusions and implications. The results suggest that rabbits in the fenced plot adapted their activity to avoid the diurnal mongooses. Conversely, rabbits in unfenced areas showed a trend towards day/twilight activity patterns as an adaptation to a diverse community of mesocarnivores. Rabbits can adapt their daily activity patterns to reduce predation risk depending on the pressure exerted by different predator species, with conservation and management implications. These adaptations would allow higher success of rabbit translocations despite the risk of predation by carnivores and could help in the management design of future translocations of this key species.","[Descalzo, Esther; Tobajas, Jorge; Mateo, Rafael; Ferreras, Pablo] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Villafuerte, Rafael] Inst Studios Sociales Avanzados IESA CSIC, C Campo Santo de los Martires 7, Cordoba 14004, Spain","Descalzo, E (corresponding author), CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.",Esther.Descalzo@uclm.es,,"Descalzo, Esther/0000-0002-0809-4422; Tobajas, Jorge/0000-0002-8329-8265","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2013-40975-R, CGL2013-43197-R, BES-2014-068987]; regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha [SBPLY/17/180501/000184]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Commission","This study is a result of CGL2013-40975-R and CGL2013-43197-R projects, from I+D+I National Plan funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, and of project SBPLY/17/180501/000184, funded by the regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

We analysed data collected during a 3-year predator reduction experiment to find out the effects of predators on population structure, reproductive parameters, and individual quality of Microtus voles (the field vole M. agrestis and the sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis) in western Finland. Voles were collected by snap trapping in April, June, August, and October during 1997-1999. The yearly reduction of predators from April to October had a clear positive effect on the abundance of sibling voles but did not significantly affect the densities of field voles. Predator reduction apparently also affected the age ratio and mean body size in late summer, as well as pancreatic weights of voles. However, all observed differences between predator reduction and control areas, except those in abundance, were small and may mainly reflect a generally higher survival leading to higher densities of voles in predator reduction areas. Our results also indicated a relative lack of high quality food at population peaks but not because of reduced foraging activity in the presence of predators. We conclude that the indirect effects of vole-eating predators on the population growth of main prey are small compared to the detrimental direct effects on prey survival. In the case of less preferred prey, indirect effects of predation through reduced interspecific competition may play a role at high densities.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Norrdahl, K (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",kainor@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X",,,,63,20,20,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2004,105,2,,,,,312,324,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12684.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,805RJ,WOS:000220383100011,,,,,2021-09-27,

We conducted field experiments to explore indirect interactions in the biological control of the alfalfa weevil (Hypera postica) in northern Utah. Honeydew produced by pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in alfalfa fields may be important as a source of nutrition for adults of the wasp Bathyplectes curculionis and may thereby enhance parasitism of the wasp's host, the alfalfa weevil. The presence of aphids may also promote aggregation of lady beetles, which consume weevil larvae in alfalfa. But by feeding heavily on pea aphids as well, these predators could indirectly enhance weevil survivorship by undercutting the wasp's capacity to parasitize its host. In one field experiment, we added pea aphids and/or adults of the lady beetle Coccinella septempunctata to caged field plots of alfalfa during the first (spring) hay crop. Adding aphids increased levels of parasitism among late-maturing alfalfa weevil larvae. Adding lady beetles decreased numbers of late-maturing weevil larvae, but also decreased levels of parasitism among these larvae. In another experiment, repeated application of artificial honeydew to caged alfalfa plots during the first crop increased levels of parasitism among weevil larvae. In a third experiment, a single application of artificial honeydew to open (uncaged) alfalfa plots in mid-May also had a direct positive effect on rates of parasitism among larvae. However, this application had an indirect negative effect on parasitism as well: the presence of artificial honeydew caused aggregation of lady beetles and thus led to decreased aphid abundance. Consequently, provision of artificial honeydew as a food source for parasitoid adults was neutralized by a subsequent reduction in naturally occurring honeydew. These field experiments illustrate the complexity with which indirect interactions can affect exploiter-victim relationships in biological control. They also raise questions concerning the long-term consequences that may result from the purposeful introduction of the Old World lady beetle C. septempunctata to alfalfa and other crops in North America. Artificial honeydew may prove useful in enhancing parasitism of the alfalfa weevil, but frequent applications may be required to compensate for associated reductions in availability of naturally occurring aphid honeydew. The effects of honeydew producers on other herbivores through natural enemies fall under the general concepts of short-term apparent competition and related ecological relationships among species, and highlight the importance of temporal and spatial factors in indirect interactions.",,"Evans, EW (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,85,79,86,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Many theories of how consumers mediate diversity invoke a tradeoff between species' competitive ability and their ability to withstand predation. Under this constraint, the best competitors are also most susceptible to consumers, preventing them from excluding other species. However, empirical evidence for competition-defense tradeoffs is limited and, as such, the mechanisms by which consumers regulate diversity remain uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of 36 studies to evaluate the prevalence of the competition-defense tradeoff and its role in maintaining diversity in plant communities. We quantified species' responses to experimental resource addition and consumer removal as estimates of competitive ability and resistance to consumers, respectively. With this analysis, we found mixed empirical evidence for a competition-defense tradeoff; in fact, competitive ability tended to be weakly positively correlated with defense overall. However, when present, negative relationships between competitive ability and defense influenced species diversity in the manner predicted by theory. In the minority of communities for which a tradeoff was detected, species evenness was higher, and resource addition and consumer removal reduced diversity. Our analysis reframes the commonly held notion that consumers structure plant communities through a competition-defense tradeoff. Such a tradeoff can maintain diversity when present, but negative correlations between competitive ability and defense were less common than is often assumed. In this respect, this study supports an emerging theoretical paradigm in which predation interacts with competition to both enhance and reduce species diversity.","[Viola, David V.; Mordecai, Erin A.; Jaramillo, Alejandra G.; Sistla, Seeta A.; Albertson, Lindsey K.; Gosnell, J.

The two specialist predators are part of a biological control program for A. tsugae, and the potential for competition among these species and previously established generalist predators in the field is unknown. 2 Adult predators were evaluated in branch cages during spring and summer at two field sites infested with A. tsugae. Using females only in 2003 and sexual pairs in 2004, predator survival and net reproduction were examined, as well as their feeding and impact on A. tsugae when present alone and in conspecific and heterospecific groupings. 3 Predator survival was not affected by the presence of additional predators. Total feeding was greater for all species when placed in predator groupings, suggesting that interactions do not significantly interfere with feeding activity. Net reproduction per predator was negatively affected by conspecifics, but unaffected by heterospecifics, indicating that direct or indirect intraspecific interference may occur. In spring, L. nigrinus showed the greatest impact on A. tsugae, and H. axyridis had the greatest impact during summer. 4 These results suggest that it would be beneficial to utilize multiple predator species combinations over single species when implementing biological control for A. tsugae. Low-density releases are also recommended to reduce intraspecific interference.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Entomol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Flowers, RW (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Entomol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",roflower@vt.edu,"Kok, Loke/G-9922-2016","Kok, Loke/0000-0002-5734-3472",,,,60,15,15,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-9555,1461-9563,,AGR FOREST ENTOMOL,Agric.

There are few direct experimental studies of how recruitment variation between single species influences the composition and assembly of whole communities in many of these systems. We manipulated recruitment of a variety of single taxa and followed their effects on the subsequent development of hard-substrate communities of sessile animals living in temperate marine waters. The effects of recruitment on communities were complex. Patterns of recruitment of individual species influenced community structure, but these effects varied greatly depending on the identity of species recruits, the time of community development, and location across three different sites. Variable recruitment of arborescent bryozoans and didemnid ascidians had little effect on community structure. At one site, recruitment of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri had short-lived effects on community structure, while barnacles had more persistent effects. At another site, recruitment of B. schlosseri and the bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata had strong persistent effects on community structure, dominating space where they recruited and influencing the abundances of a variety of different taxa. Differences in the effects of species recruitment on communities appear to be caused by differences between the ecology and life history of recruiting species as well as differences in background processes between sites. These results demonstrate that discrete recruitment events that vary between single species can be important drivers of community composition but are likely to be heavily influenced by the local environment, even within a single species.","[Sams, Michael A.; Keough, Michael J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Sams, MA (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",msams@unimelb.edu.au,,,Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; ARCAustralian Research Council,"We thank Paul Carnell and Alexis Howard for their assistance with field work and sampling, Pete Raimondi for facilitating experiments in Santa Cruz, Parks Victoria and Santa Cruz Harbor for providing access to study sites, and Richard Osman and John Witman for helpful comments on the Ph.D. thesis chapter that generated this manuscript.

However, quantifying these processes using mark recapture or manipulative experiments can be time consuming and costly. A different approach is to study density changes across a broader landscape, and take advantage of naturally existing replicate locations that are imperfect, but plentiful. We documented sites of recent colonization and measured density changes in the invasive gecko Hemidactylus mabouia and the prior resident gecko Hemidactylus garnotii in Florida. We surveyed geckos at 398 locations from 19 regional sites distributed across central and southern Florida. We documented changes in abundance through repeated censuses of 56 locations in areas of sympatry between 2001 and 2009. Complete displacement occurred in <7 years at several locations, and overall there was a >10% increase in H. mabouia per year. There was evidence that H. mabouia reaches a higher carrying capacity than H. garnotii, which likely contributes to its competitive dominance. Changes in relative abundance within patches were consistent with a density dependent mechanism of displacement, suggesting the decline of H. garnotii is functionally linked to increases in H. mabouia abundance, which allows us to rule out coincidental factors not directly associated with H. mabouia. However, simulations showed that even highly asymmetric differences in carrying capacity and competitive ability were not sufficient to account for the rapid displacement we observed. We conclude that mechanisms other than resource competition must be at work to drive species displacement in this system.","[Short, Kristen Harfmann; Petren, Kenneth] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Biol Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA","Short, KH (corresponding author), Manchester Coll, N Manchester, IN USA.",khshort@manchester.edu,,"Petren, Kenneth/0000-0002-7936-6042",University Research Council; Weiman Wendel Benedict Fund,"The authors wish to thank Liz Dame, Ashley Allemang, John Niedzwiecki, Ninnia Lescano, Andrew Clack, Jeff Olberding, and Phoebe Richgels for help with field censuses in Florida.

However, we lack understanding of how single-species and multispecies associations are affected by interactions between multiple environmental stressors. We address this gap by examining how environmental degradation interacts with daily stochastic temperature variation to affect individual life history and population dynamics in a host-parasitoid trophic interaction, using the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, and its parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens. We carried out a single-generation individual life-history experiment and a multigeneration microcosm experiment during which individuals and microcosms were maintained at a mean temperature of 26 degrees C that was either kept constant or varied stochastically, at four levels of host resource degradation, in the presence or absence of parasitoids. At the individual level, resource degradation increased juvenile development time and decreased adult body size in both species. Parasitoids were more sensitive to temperature variation than their hosts, with a shorter juvenile stage duration than in constant temperatures and a longer adult life span in moderately degraded environments. Resource degradation also altered the host's response to temperature variation, leading to a longer juvenile development time at high resource degradation. At the population level, moderate resource degradation amplified the effects of temperature variation on host and parasitoid populations compared with no or high resource degradation and parasitoid overall abundance was lower in fluctuating temperatures. Top-down regulation by the parasitoid and bottom-up regulation driven by resource degradation contributed to more than 50% of host and parasitoid population responses to temperature variation. Our results demonstrate that environmental degradation can strongly affect how species in a trophic interaction respond to short-term temperature fluctuations through direct and indirect trait-mediated effects. These effects are driven by species differences in sensitivity to environmental conditions and modulate top-down (parasitism) and bottom-up (resource) regulation. This study highlights the need to account for differences in the sensitivity of species' traits to environmental stressors to understand how interacting species will respond to simultaneous anthropogenic changes.","[Mugabo, Marianne; Petteway, Laura; Sait, Steven M.] Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Sch Biol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Gilljam, David; Fowler, Mike S.] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biosci, Dynam Ecol Grp, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Yuan, Chenggui] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Maths Dept, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Gilljam, David] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, Oregrund, Sweden","Mugabo, M (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Sch Biol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",m.mugabo@leeds.ac.uk,"Fowler, Mike/H-5092-2013","Fowler, Mike/0000-0003-1544-0407; Sait, Steven/0000-0002-7208-8617","Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/N00213X/1, NE/N002849/1]","Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/N00213X/1 and NE/N002849/1",,60,1,1,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Global environmental change fosters both processes, further altering predator biodiversity. Thus, there has been growing interest in how predator species richness impacts ecosystem functioning. Manipulative experiments have revealed that complementarity and sampling effects, two mechanisms commonly found to underlie diversity effects at other trophic levels, also commonly impact the relationship between predator diversity and prey suppression. Intraguild predation and non-consumptive (behaviorally-mediated) effects on prey, two mechanisms without direct analogs among plants, also strongly impact predator-diversity effects. Predator diversity studies are particularly relevant to conservation because they focus on the trophic group that is most prone to extinction, and because they nearly always measure diversity effects that span several trophic levels. Predator invasions may partly offset species-richness losses to extinction, but because invasive predators typically reach much higher densities and exert stronger impacts on prey than do native species, and because they also displace ecologically-similar native predators, invasion is likely to disrupt natural predator function. A framework for predicting which predator-diversity mechanisms are likely to operate in a given community, and experiments that span more realistic spatiotemporal scales and include large vertebrate predators, are needed to improve the relevance of predator-diversity experiments to conservation decision-making in the future.

Chemical signals can act as repellents or attractants and may therefore have applications for wildlife management. We devised a field experiment to investigate whether dominant predator (ferret Mustela furo) body odor would alter the behavior of three common mesopredators: stoats (Mustelaerminea), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), and ship rats (Rattus rattus). We predicted that apex predator odor would lead to increased detections, and our results support this hypothesis as predator kairomones (interspecific olfactory messages that benefit the receiver) provoked eavesdropping behavior by mesopredators. Stoats exhibited the most pronounced responses, with kairomones significantly increasing the number of observations and the time spent at a site, so that their occupancy estimates changed from rare to widespread. Behavioral responses to predator odors can therefore be exploited for conservation and this avenue of research has not yet been extensively explored. A long-life lure derived from apex predator kairomones could have practical value, especially when there are plentiful resources that reduce the efficiency of food-based lures. Our results have application for pest management in New Zealand and the technique of using kairomones to monitor predators could have applications for conservation efforts worldwide.","[Garvey, Patrick M.; Clout, Mick N.; Wyse, Sarah V.] Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Garvey, Patrick M.; Glen, Alistair S.] Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Wyse, Sarah V.] Royal Bot Gardens Kew, Wakehurst Pl, Haywards Heath RH17 6TN, W Sussex, England; [Nichols, Margaret] Lincoln Univ, Ctr Wildlife Management & Conservat, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Pech, Roger P.] Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand","Garvey, PM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.; Garvey, PM (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",pgar874@aucklanduni.ac.nz,,"Wyse, Sarah/0000-0002-7015-8685; Glen, Al/0000-0002-7777-7630; Wyse, Sarah/0000-0002-0442-9950",,,,84,15,15,1,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Pond area had a significant effect: on the multivariate response of P. triseriata larval period, survival, and metamorphic mass. P. triseriata survived better relative to B. americanus in larger ponds. However, increasing pond area led to greater incidence of predacious beetle larvae (Dytiscus, Coleoptera: Dytiscidae).

Predicting the combined effects of multiple predators can be complex. Many experiments evaluating the effects of multiple predators on prey confound either variation in predator density with predator identity or variation in relative predator frequency with overall predation rates. We develop a new experimental design of factorial predator combinations that maintains a constant expected predation rate, under the null hypothesis of additive predator effects. We implement this design to evaluate the combined effects of three predator species (bass, aeshnid and libellulid odonate naiads) on mortality rate of a prey species, Hyla cinerea (Schneider, 1799) tadpoles, that occurs across a range of aquatic habitats. Two predator treatments (libellulid and aeshnid + libellulid) resulted in lower tadpole mortality than any of the other predator treatments. Variation in tadpole mortality across treatments was not related to coarse variation in microhabitat use, but was likely due to intraguild predation, which occurred in all predator treatments. Hyla cinerea tadpoles have constant, low survival values when exposed to many different combinations of predator species, and predation rate probably increases linearly with predator density.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Gunzburger, MS (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Florida Integrated Sci Ctr, 7920 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA.",margaret_gunzburger@usgs.gov,"Aresco, Margaret/AAB-4601-2021",,,,,23,13,14,1,10,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Management strategies to enhance ecosystem services in agroecosystems often seek to increase predator biodiversity. Invaders commonly dominate predator communities in agricultural landscapes, however, and the impacts of exotic predators on native predators and ecosystem services are largely unknown. Exotic predators may complement native predator diversity and enhance herbivore suppression, or they may disrupt herbivore suppression through predator interference. 2. We examined the impacts of a dominant exotic predator within the diverse predator community of a California vineyard. Interactions between the exotic wandering spider Cheiracanthium mildei, its closest native ecological homologue (the wandering spider Anyphaena pacifica) and a native spider displaying a different hunting mode (the cobweb-weaving spider Theridion melanurum) were tested in a manipulative field experiment, with the grape leafhopper Erythroneura elegantula acting as a shared herbivore prey source. 3. We found that the exotic wandering spider suppressed both grape leafhoppers and other unmanipulated leafhopper species that were present in cages. Native spiders had little or no impacts on leafhopper suppression. Thus, C. mildei appears to drive predatory impacts in this system, although evidence also indicated that it is limited by intraspecific interactions. The superior predatory ability displayed by this spider may be shared by other invasive predators that dominate agroecosystems. 4. Despite its effects on leafhoppers, C. mildei negatively impacted a range of spider species, including A. pacifica, T. melanurum, and other unmanipulated native spiders. These impacts are likely to have been mediated through intraguild predation. The wandering hunting mode of C. mildei may have facilitated its role as an intraguild predator. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the sometimes conflicting aims of biological control and conservation. Here, a dominant invasive predator increased ecosystem services but also caused declines in numbers of native predators. As disturbed conditions in agroecosystems are likely to put invasive predators at an adaptive advantage, efforts to conserve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes should focus on shifting the outcomes of species interactions to favour native species.","[Hogg, Brian N.; Daane, Kent M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Hogg, BN (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hoggbrian@yahoo.com,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0710434]; van den Bosch Memorial Scholarship; California Table Grape Commission; American Vineyard Foundation,"This work was supported with grants from the National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant DEB 0710434, the van den Bosch Memorial Scholarship, and the California Table Grape Commission and American Vineyard Foundation.

Using previously published mechanisms as a starting point we suggest that common mechanisms can be provided for this relationship by using the concepts of niche and trophic-level dynamics. The reasoning is the following: if remaining species within a trophic level can modify their niches as other species disappear, production within the level remains unchanged, whereas in the absence of niche modification production decreases. Decreased production within a trophic level affects biomass and production at other levels as predicted by trophic-dynamic models. Changes in biomass and production finally bring about changes in ecosystem functioning. In the redundant species hypothesis remaining species can modify their niches, and so functioning remains unchanged. In the predictable change hypothesis (our counterpart for the rivet hypothesis), and in the idiosyncratic response hypothesis, remaining species cannot modify their niches, leading to predictable and unpredictable changes in functioning, respectively. Unpredictable changes are due to differences in the characteristics of species and indirect interactions between populations. We tested the hypotheses and the suggested mechanisms using a soil food web with three trophic levels: microbes, microbivorous nematodes and a predatory nematode. We established one diverse (3 bacterivores and 3 fungivores) and three simple (1 bacterivore and 1 fungivore) food webs and found that differences in trophic-level biomasses between the diverse and simple food webs were idiosyncratic. Unpredictability resulted from differences in microbivore characteristics - their efficiency in resource utilisation and vulnerability to predation and competition. Changes in microbial respiration and total mineralisation of C and N, i.e., system functioning, were also idiosyncratic rather than redundant or predictable when diversity was reduced, although idiosyncracy was not as clear as in the case of trophic-level biomasses. We conclude that predicting the influence of declining species diversity on trophic-level dynamics and ecosystem processes is difficult, at least in food webs with a small initial number of species, unless the characteristics of species and the nature of their interactions are known.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Mikola, J (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",jmikola@jyu.fi,"Mikola, Juha/A-1630-2015; Setala, Heikki M/P-7354-2015","Mikola, Juha/0000-0002-4336-2648; ",,,,89,111,119,0,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1998,83,1,,,,,180,194,,10.2307/3546560,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,119BX,WOS:000075876400021,,,,,2021-09-27,

Traditional intraguild predation (IGP) models have only relatively small regions of stable coexistence of all species. Here, we investigate potential additional mechanisms that extend these regions of stable coexistence. We used a 3-species Lotka-Volterra system to which we added an interaction term to model a unidirectional facilitative relationship between the two predators in the IGP. In this modelling study the IG predator was able to precondition a part of the common resource by an instantaneous manipulation, which resulted in the immobilization of the resource species. This mechanism of immobilization facilitated the resource uptake by the IG prey and thus increased its growth rates even in the presence of the common predator. The facilitative relationship of the IG prey by the IG predator produced a stable coexistence of both predators even though the IG prey was an inferior competitor for a common resource, which cannot be attained with the traditional IGP models. Furthermore, our model predicted a 3-species stable coexistence even at high enrichment where no coexistence was found in the basic IGP model. Thus, we showed that diversity of resource traits could significantly alter emergent community patterns via shifts in exploitative competition of IGP-related predators. The described mechanism could potentially lead to a higher efficiency in exploitation of common resources and thus promote higher diversity in a real community. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The initial density of each of the cladoceran species in the population growth studies was 0.4 ind ml(-1) while that of the worms 1.0 ind ml(-1). Following inoculation, we estimated daily the number of cladocerans and the worms for duration of 21 days.

Additionally, particle size manipulations were used with predation assays to assess habitat-specific interactions since the average particle size increased from deep pools to shallow pools to riffles. Large crayfish had the highest densities in deep pools and were associated with increased water depth, whereas small and medium crayfish had the highest densities in shallow pools and were strongly associated with increased particle size and decreased water depth. Regardless of size, crayfish in deep pools had significantly lower survival than in shallow pools and riffles. However, only small crayfish showed consistent differences in predation risk by habitat type and were significantly more vulnerable to predation than larger crayfish. Additionally, large rocky refugia resulted in significantly higher survival of small crayfish in the combined particle manipulation/tethering experiment.

As human populations expand and the demand for land increases, the traditional idiom of setting aside protected areas for conservation is insufficient and assessment and protection of diversity outside these areas is needed. We assessed the impact of land use on lizard assemblages in communal rangelands in South Africa by comparing abundance, species richness and species diversity between degraded communal lands with a protected area. We first quantified vegetation differences between the study areas and found marked differences. Communal lands had significantly fewer large trees and less ground cover. Contrary to prediction, we found no evidence that any species of lizard was negatively affected by habitat disturbance. Some species were more common in communal lands, and species richness and diversity were also higher using certain sampling techniques. Terrestrial diversity was likely enhanced due to the preference of many terrestrial lizards for open, sparsely grassed areas. We discuss other reasons for increased diversity such as the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and/or reduced numbers of predators and competitors. We also conducted surveys of households and traditional healers to investigate the relationship between human uses of reptiles and abundance. The predominant users of reptiles were traditional healers. The most commonly used species were not encountered in our field surveys, and respondents indicated that they appeared to be declining. Our results emphasise the importance of integrating local knowledge into biodiversity assessment and conservation planning. Although we did not identify a negative impact of disturbance on lizard communities, community structure was different and this likely influenced ecosystem integrity and function in some way.

The impact of these processes on the competition and coexistence of the two copepod species was examined with a small strategic model which could be solved analytically, and a detailed numerical simulation model integrating comprehensive experimental evidence with theoretical concepts about species coexistence. In the strategic model considering the major interactions between the two populations, no stable coexistence was achieved within a reasonable parameter range under steady state conditions. However, in the numerical simulation model, which included in addition to many biological details the spatial heterogeneity of the biotope, both species coexisted for a wide and sensible parameter range. Model results suggest that in the present case study, competition is mainly caused by common predators (i.e. carnivorous zooplankton), but not by utilization of common resources. Competition for common resources is weak and diffuse, because of numerous other herbivores. Predation of A. tonsa on nauplii of both species enhances intra-specific and interspecific competition at high abundances but despite being species-specific it does not support coexistence within a reasonable parameter range. Non-selective predation by carnivorous zooplankton depending on the combined abundance of the two prey species appears as the main factor promoting competition between copepod species. At the same time, it is - at least in the model - the most important mechanism of coexistence if the prey species are spatially heterogeneously distributed and the predation pressure relies on the local prey density. Revealing this mechanism of coexistence allows a better explanation for the observed spatial distribution of estuarine copepod species.","UNIV OLDENBURG, FACHBEREICH ECOL MODELLING 6, W-2900 OLDENBURG, GERMANY",,,,,,,,46,3,4,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Separating causality from simple correlation requires distinguishing among experimental treatments, experimental responses, and the many processes and properties that are correlated with either the treatments or the responses, or both. When an experimental manipulation has multiple components, but only one of them is identified as the experimental treatment. erroneous conclusions about cause and effect relationships are likely because the actual cause of any observed response may be ignored in the interpretation of the experimental results. This unrecognized cause of an observed response can be considered a ''hidden treatment.'' Three types of hidden treatments are potential problems in biodiversity experiments: (1) abiotic conditions, such as resource levels, or biotic conditions, such as predation, which are intentionally or unintentionally altered in order to create differences in species numbers for ''diversity'' treatments; (2) non-random selection of species with particular attributes that produce treatment differences that exceed those due to ''diversity'' alone; and (3) the increased statistical probability of including a species with a dominant negative or positive effect (e.g., dense shade, or nitrogen fixation) in randomly selected groups of species of increasing number or ''diversity.'' In each of these cases, treatment responses that are actually the result of the ''hidden treatment'' may be inadvertently attributed to variation in species diversity. Case studies re-evaluating three different types of biodiversity experiments demonstrate that the increases found in such ecosystem properties as productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and stability (all of which were attributed to higher levels of species diversity) were actually caused by ''hidden trearments'' that altered plant biomass and productivity.",,"Huston, MA (corresponding author), OAK RIDGE NATL LAB, DIV ENVIRONM SCI, POB 2008, OAK RIDGE, TN 37831 USA.",,"Huston, Michael A./B-1434-2009","Huston, Michael A./0000-0001-9513-1166",,,,93,1214,1313,6,479,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1997,110,4,,,,,449,460,,10.1007/s004420050180,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XD210,WOS:A1997XD21000001,28307235,,,,2021-09-27,

The species-area relationship is an important tool for investigating differences among communities, and may be also influenced by habitat isolation and dominant predator presence. In this two-year study, we evaluated the influences of habitat area, isolation and predation on community composition of dytiscids in two geographical regions dominated by different top predators (large predaceous dragonfly larvae or fish). Contrary to expectations, surface area, isolation and predator presence/absence alone did not significantly influence dytiscid species richness and total abundance, but in association with other environmental variables, such as submerged macrophyte growth forms. Components of habitat heterogeneity likely outweighed effects of area and predation regime on prey species diversity. However, differences in the set of abundant species were best explained by habitat surface area. Thus, in contrast to species diversity, gradients in community composition were not outweighed by components of heterogeneity. In this study, predator presence was not correlated with habitat isolation. Instead, our results revealed that the effect of predator presence/absence on prey community composition and the resulting set of coexisting species may depend on habitat isolation. Within regions, the effect of large predaceous dragonfly larvae on species composition may depend on pond surface area, whereas the presence of fish influenced species composition alone and in association with area. We advocate that regional differences in environmental gradients be considered when community composition is evaluated.","[Wohlfahrt, B.; Vamosi, S.

Invasive lionfish are reaching densities much higher than those reported from their native range, and they have a strong negative effect on the recruitment and abundance of a broad diversity of native coral-reef fishes. Otherwise, little is known about how lionfish affect native coral-reef communities, especially compared to ecologically similar native predators. A controlled field experiment conducted on small patch-reefs in the Bahamas over an 8-week-period demonstrated that (1) lionfish caused a reduction in the abundance of small native coral-reef fishes that was 2.5 +/- A 0.5 times (mean +/- A SEM) greater than that caused by a similarly sized native piscivore, the coney grouper Cephalopholis fulva (93.7 vs. 36.3 % reduction); (2) lionfish caused a reduction in the species richness of small coral-reef fishes (loss of 4.6 +/- A 1.6 species), whereas the native piscivore did not have a significant effect on prey richness; (3) the greatest effects on the reef-fish community, in terms of both abundance and richness, occurred when both native and invasive predators were present; and (4) lionfish grew significantly faster (> 6 times) than the native predator under the same field conditions. These results suggest that invasive lionfish have stronger ecological effects than similarly sized native piscivores, and may pose a substantial threat to native coral-reef fish communities.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Albins, MA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, 3029 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",albinsm@science.oregonstate.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [05-50709, 08-51162]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Division Of Ocean SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1233027] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants to M.

We present results from experimental studies of behavioral mechanisms underlying these patterns and provide a test of foraging theory applied to urban bird communities. We measured foraging decisions at artificial food patches to assess how urban habitats differ from wildlands in predation risk, missed-opportunity cost, competition, and metabolic cost. By manipulating seed trays, we compared leftover seed (giving-up density) in urban and desert habitats in Arizona. Deserts exhibited higher predation risk than urban habitats. Only desert birds quit patches earlier when increasing the missed-opportunity cost. House finches and house sparrows coexist by trading off travel cost against foraging efficiency. In exclusion experiments, urban doves were more efficient foragers than passerines. Providing water decreased digestive costs only in the desert. At the population level, reduced predation and higher resource abundance drive the increased densities in cities. At the community level, the decline in diversity may involve exclusion of native species by highly efficient urban specialists. Competitive interactions play significant roles in structuring urban bird communities. Our results indicate the importance and potential of mechanistic approaches for future urban bird community studies.","Arizona State Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Shochat, E (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Sutton Avian Res Ctr, POB 2007, Bartlesville, OK 74005 USA.",shochat@ou.edu; susannah_lerman@antiochne.edu; mkatti@csufresno.edu; david.lewis@asu.edu,"Lewis, David/B-6313-2009; Katti, Madhusudan/F-1741-2010","Lewis, David/0000-0002-8094-1577; Katti, Madhusudan/0000-0003-3076-3562; Shochat, Eyal/0000-0003-0991-9366",,,,38,112,124,0,130,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Little is known about the interactions between Bythotrephes longimanus and native predatory macroinvertebrates (e.g., Mysis, Chaoborus), which potentially limit the establishment and spread of the invader. An 80-lake survey was conducted in the summer of 2007 to obtain macroinvertebrate abundances across invaded and non-invaded lakes. A subset (15) of these lakes was surveyed more intensively to obtain stratified daytime and night-time distributions of the organisms. Overall co-occurrence of Bythotrephes with native macroinvertebrate predators was widespread across lakes indicating that the presence of native macroinvertebrates alone is unlikely to limit the establishment of Bythotrephes. However, we did find an effect of native macroinvertebrate predators on the vertical distribution of Bythotrephes: as native macroinvertebrate abundances increased, the relative abundance of Bythotrephes in the epilimnion increased. Furthermore, the relative abundance of some zooplankton prey (e.g., Daphnia) was lower in the epilimnion when Bythotrephes abundance was high. Although we cannot rule out consumptive effects, some evidence suggests an avoidance behavioural response in the prey. While the underlying mechanisms of these distributional shifts remain unclear, our results suggest that interactions between Bythotrephes, native macroinvertebrates and zooplankton prey are complex, highlighting the need to further examine these interactions.","[Jokela, Anneli; Arnott, Shelley E.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Beisner, Beatrix E.] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Jokela, A (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Biol, 116 Barrie St, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",anneli.jokela@queensu.ca,"Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020","Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X",Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN); Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada; Queen's University SWEP; NSERC USRANatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"Funding for this project was provided by the Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN) and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

As a result, we have very limited knowledge on species' behaviour and interactions in these communities and how they in turn influence community dynamics. Interactions such as competition or predation significantly affect community structure in vent communities, and video time-series have successfully been used to gain insights in biological interactions and species behaviour, including responses to short-term changes in temperature or feeding strategies. In this study, we combined in situ and ex situ approaches to characterise the behaviour and interactions among two key species encountered along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR): the shrimp Mirocaris fortunata and the crab Segonzacia mesatlantica. In situ, species small-scale distribution, interactions and behaviour were studied using the TEMPO observatory module deployed on the seafloor at the base of the active Eiffel Tower edifice in the Lucky Strike vent field as part of the EMSO-Acores MoMAR observatory. TEMPO sampled 2 min of video four times a day from July 2011 to April 2012. One week of observations per month was used for 'long-term' variations, and a full video data set was analysed for January 2012. In addition, observations of crab and shrimp individuals maintained for the first time under controlled conditions in atmospheric pressure (classic tank) and pressurised (AbyssBox) aquaria allowed better characterisation and description of the different types of behaviour and interactions observed in nature. While the identified in situ spatial distribution pattern was stable over the nine months, both species displayed a significant preference for mussel bed and anhydrite substrata, and preferentially occupied the area located directly in the fluid flow axis. The aggregation behaviour of M. fortunata resulted in the occurrence of numerous intraspecific interactions mainly involving the use of two pairs of sensory organs (antenna/antennule) and fleeing behaviours when in contact or close to individuals of S. mesatiantica. The higher level of passiveness observed in the ex situ artificial environment compared to the in situ environment was attributed to the lack of stimulation related to low densities of congeners and/or of sympatric species compared to the natural environment and the absence of continuous food supply, as both species displayed a significant higher level of activity during feeding time. This result emphasises the role of food supply as a driver of species distribution and behaviour. Direct in situ observations using cameras deployed on deep-sea observatories, combined with experimental set-up in pressurised aquaria, will help investigators understand the factors influencing community dynamics and species biology at vents as well as their underlying mechanisms.

Large carnivores can have a key role in the maintenance of biodiversity through direct and indirect effects at lower trophic levels, which are the result of predation and competition. In this sense, it is expected that changes in abundance of large predators driven by humans will affect the abundance of smaller carnivores. We explore the effects of varying degree of human intervention on the structure of a felid community of five sympatric species in Ecuador's Amazon region. We used camera traps to survey carnivore populations in seven different areas between 2007 and 2016 and estimated density with spatial explicit capture-recapture models. The density of margays, jaguarundis, ocelots and jaguars showed a positive relationship with the conservation status of study sites, while no significant relationship was observed for pumas. We found that the anthropogenic impacts had asymmetric effects on the density of the different taxa. Jaguar and margays, the species with more stringent ecological requirements, presented higher reductions on density. Our findings support of the mesopredator release hypothesis in this tropical ecosystem. Maximum densities of pumas were detected in areas of low jaguar density, while there was a negative relationship between density of pumas and margays, jaguarundis, and ocelots. Our results show how human disturbance can have important ecological effects on the carnivore community. As felids are top predators, we can predict that changes in this trophic level can lead to changes in ecosystem function and structure. Therefore, conservation efforts should be addressed to maintain the structure of these communities.","[Maria Gil-Sanchez, Jose; Salvador, Julia; Espinosa, Santiago] Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Ave 12 Octubre 1076, Quito, Ecuador; [Maria Gil-Sanchez, Jose] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain; [Jimenez, Jose] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda Toledo 0, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; [Salvador, Julia] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Mariana Jesus E7-248 & Pradera, Quito, Ecuador; [Sanchez-Cerda, Mariola] Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, Conservat & EvolutionaryGeneticsGrp, Avda Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Espinosa, Santiago] Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Fac Ciencias, Av Chapultepec 1570, San Luis Potosi 78295, San Luis Potosi, Mexico","Gil-Sanchez, JM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Ave 12 Octubre 1076, Quito, Ecuador.; Gil-Sanchez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain.",jmgilsanchez@yahoo.es,"Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/AAW-1016-2021; Jimenez, Jose/I-9840-2019","Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/0000-0002-7052-8332; Jimenez, Jose/0000-0003-0607-6973",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador,"This research was part of the project: Conflictos entre gente y grandes carnivoros: evaluacion de posibles soluciones en la Amazonia del Ecuador supported by Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador.

Passerine birds represent an intriguing case because differing theories yield the possibility of an antagonistic interaction between nest predation risk and food delivery rates on evolution of growth rates. We test this possibility among 64 Passerine species studied on three continents, including tropical and north and south temperate latitudes. Growth rates increased strongly with nestling predation rates within, but not between, sites. The importance of nest predation was further emphasized by revealing hidden allometric scaling effects. Nestling predation risk also was associated with reduced total feeding rates and per-nestling feeding rates within each site. Consequently, faster growth rates were associated with decreased per-nestling food delivery rates across species, both within and among regions. These relationships suggest that Passerines can evolve growth strategies in response to predation risk whereby food resources are not the primary limit on growth rate differences among species. In contrast, reaction norms of growth rate relative to brood size suggest that food may limit growth rates within species in temperate, but not tropical, regions. Results here provide new insight into evolution of growth strategies relative to predation risk and food within and among species.","[Martin, Thomas E.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Lloyd, Penn] Univ Cape Town, Percy Fitzpatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Bosque, Carlos] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Biol Organismos, Caracas, Venezuela","Martin, TE (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",tom.martin@umontana.edu; penn.lloyd@gmail.com; carlosb@usb.ve; daniel.barton@umontana.edu; luis.biancucci@gmail.com; yirucheng@gmail.com; zvoneb@libero.it,"Bosque, Carlos/AAX-6038-2020; Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [INT-9906030, DEB-9981527, DEB-0543178, DEB-0841764]; United States Geological Survey Climate Change Research ProgramUnited States Geological Survey; National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-02817]; FONACIT [DM/0000237]; INPARQUES [PA-INP-005-2004]; Ministerio del Ambiente [01-03-03-1147]","We thank R.

These abundant predators were clearly distinguished by differences in foraging behaviour. In feeding experiments involving multi-prey assemblages, predation and ingestion rates of Mysis stenolepis were greater than for Neomysis americana, except for small prey. M stenolepis showed highest predation rates on and preference for Eurytemora affinis nauplii and copepodites, and did not feed on the most abundant prey, the veliger stage of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. In contrast, N. americana showed highest predation rates on and preference for small prey species such as rotifers, nauplii and veligers. When densities of preferred prey declined in the second half of the experiment, both mysid species showed a shift in predation towards the less preferred prey. M stenolepis switched to filter feeding, with higher predation rates on veligers, whereas N. americana increased predation on small E. affinis copepodites. Stable isotope analysis and feeding experiments suggested 3 trophic levels in the food web, with a high degree of omnivory. The delta C-13 values for the 2 mysid species were similar and supported by the same carbon source, mostly of autochthonous origin. However, their delta N-15 differed significantly by 2.2 parts per thousand, indicating that the composition of their diet differed in terms of ingested and assimilated food items. These results suggest that co-existence of the sympatric mysid populations is achieved by reduced competition due to food-niche partitioning. Flexibility in their foraging behaviour allowed mysids to exploit multiple prey groups that undergo temporal and spatial fluctuations in the highly dynamic estuarine transition zone of the St. Lawrence Middle Estuary.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec Ocean, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Winkler, G (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec Ocean, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",gesche.winkler@giroq.ulaval.ca,"Vincent, Warwick F/C-9522-2009; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019","Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Winkler, Gesche/0000-0002-9865-4576",,,,57,22,23,1,17,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The lycosid Pardosa pseudoannulata (Bosenberg & Strand) and the linyphiid Atypena formosana (Oi) are the early dominant predators in irrigated rice. Later, predatory bugs, including the mirid Cyrtorhinus lividipennis Reuter, become dominant. In unsprayed rice, BPH numbers normally remain low. While P. pseudoannulata is known to be a key natural enemy of BPH, the contribution to BPH reduction by the smaller A. formosana is less well known. Due to the size difference, A. formosana may also be an intraguild prey of P. pseudoannulata. To investigate predation on BPH by the two spider species alone, together and in combination with C. lividipennis, two cage experiments were conducted, the first with adult spiders, the second with immature/unmated spiders. In the latter, spiders were introduced with a delay to allow a better establishment of C. lividipennis. In both experiments, BPH numbers were lowest in treatments with more than one predator species present. Intermediate BPH reduction was obtained with P. pseudoannulata followed by A. formosana and C. lividipennis. While P. pseudoannulata can prey upon large nymphs and adult BPH, A. formosana favour early instar BPH, leading to a more even control across instars in treatments with both spider species. Pardosa pseudoannulata numbers increased more with A. formosana or A. formosana and C. lividipennis present. In contrast, P. pseudoannulata reduced A. formosana and C. lividipennis numbers. The presence of C. lividipennis apparently lessened intraguild predation on A. formosana and may be an intraguild prey of A. formosana. Competition for prey may have added to the antagonistic interactions found. From a biological control perspective, the presence of both spiders in early rice is an advantage for the biological control of BPH in rice. In early rice, results show that A. formosana is an important predator of BPH and, like C. lividipennis, can complement control by P. pseudoannulata and serve as intraguild prey for the latter species.","Royal Vet & Agr Univ, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark","Sigsgaard, L (corresponding author), Royal Vet & Agr Univ, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",les@kvl.dk,"Sigsgaard, Lene/F-7182-2014; Sigsgaard, Lene/AAC-5624-2020","Sigsgaard, Lene/0000-0001-6478-5079; Sigsgaard, Lene/0000-0001-6478-5079",,,,45,35,37,0,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0007-4853,1475-2670,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

To examine trophic niche shifts of recent colonists, we focused on three ecologically and phylogenetically divergent lizard species that inhabit both the geologically distinctive depauperate habitat of White Sands and the surrounding Chihuahuan 'dark soil' desert in New Mexico. In White Sands the three species comprise the entire lizard community, whereas in the dark soils habitat, they constitute less than half of the lizard community abundance. As a result, we hypothesized that the three focal species would collectively represent a greater variety of trophic positions in the White Sands habitat than in the dark soils habitat. We hypothesized that the extent of shifts in each species' trophic position would parallel diet and ecomorphology differences between habitats. To test these hypotheses, we combined analysis of lizard stomach contents with carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in the context of previously published ecomorphology measurements. Stable isotope data indicated that as predicted, species were more different from one another in White Sands than in dark soils, suggesting community-wide ecological release. Overall, all species were lower on the White Sands food chain; however, only one species decreased trophic level significantly, one increased trophic level variance, and one did not change significantly. Furthermore, stomach content data paralleled both stable isotope and ecomorphological data, showing different degrees of dietary overlap between habitats, depending on the species. That species' differences in trophic ecology also correspond with ecomorphological differences suggests that these factors are either causally linked or collectively responding to similar ecological pressures, such as competition. By examining diet, trophic position, and ecomorphology of three colonist species, we demonstrate both species-specific and community-wide trophic differences in adjacent, but distinct habitats.","[Des Roches, Simone; Rosenblum, Erica B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Harmon, Luke J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Des Roches, SD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",simone.desroches@berkeley.edu,,"Harmon, Luke/0000-0002-4985-5750",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1054062]; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists Gaige grant; University of Idaho Student Grant Program,"We thank White Sands National Monument, White Sands Missile Range, Jornada Long-term Ecological Research Station and New Mexico Dept of Game and Fish for providing field permits.

This study aims to confirm predator dispersal from an alfalfa field to a neighboring peach orchard with a DNA mark-capture procedure based on a topical application of a solution of grinded brine shrimp cysts, Artemia spp. (Anostraca: Artemiidae), followed by a conventional PCR. To optimize the marking procedure, a well-known predator present in orchards as well as in arable crops, Orius laevigatus (Fieber) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), was used as a model in this study. In greenhouse trials, the acquisition and the retention time of the Artemia markings were determined, either directly by spraying them with the Artemia solution or indirectly via residual contact on caged plants after the spray. The topical mark remained detectable on O. laevigatus after 6 days, and 50% of the tested predators were positive 3 days after walking on the sprayed plants. After that, a 25m2 strip of an alfalfa crop neighboring to a peach orchard was sprayed with the Artemia solution just after the alfalfa cuts, and several common predator species were collected using sticky traps placed between both crops. After PCR analysis with the Artemia specific primers, 32% of the analyzed predators (coccinellids, anthocorids, chrysopids, and mirids) showed the mark. The results of this study confirm the usefulness of this marking method to monitor dispersal of biological control agents between neighboring crops, in this case alfalfa and peach.","[Batuecas, Ivan; Agusti, Nuria; Castane, Cristina; Alomar, Oscar] IRTA, Ctra Cabrils Km 2, E-08348 Barcelona, Spain","Alomar, O (corresponding author), IRTA, Ctra Cabrils Km 2, E-08348 Barcelona, Spain.",ivan.batuecas@irta.cat; nuria.agusti@irta.cat; cristina.castane@irta.cat; oscar.alomar@irta.cat,"Agusti, Nuria/C-8318-2011; Alomar, Oscar/A-1520-2009","Agusti, Nuria/0000-0002-5908-4873; Alomar, Oscar/0000-0002-8756-871X","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [AGL2014-53970-C2-2-R, AGL2016-77373-C2-1-R]; CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya; Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [BES-2015-075700]","This work was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) (grant numbers AGL2014-53970-C2-2-R and AGL2016-77373-C2-1-R).

In common-garden experiments, we exposed populations of two desert rodents to two different viper species, testing their ability to adjust to novel predators that use different hunting strategies. We aimed to understand whether both predators and prey with constraint-breaking adaptations actually manifest comparative advantage over their counterparts. We used convergent species from desert dunes in the Mojave Desert in North America, Merriam's kangaroo rat Dipodomys merriami and the sidewinder rattlesnake Crotalus cerastes, and from the Negev Desert in the Middle East, the greater Egyptian gerbil Gerbillus pyramidum and the Saharan horned viper Cerastes cerastes. Both Mojave species hold constraint-breaking adaptations in relation to their counterparts from the Negev. The rattlesnakes have heat sensing organs (pits) and the kangaroo rats have fur-lined cheek pouches that allow for greater foraging efficiency and food preservation. Using patch-use theory, we evaluated the rodents' risk-assessment from each snake-separately, together and in combination with barn owls. Initially each rodent species foraged less in the presence of its familiar snake, but within a month both foraged less in the presence of the pit-viper (sidewinder). Our findings indicate a level of learning, and behavioural plasticity, in both rodents and ability to assess the risk from novel predators. The kangaroo rats were capable of harvesting far greater amounts of resources under the same conditions of elevated risk. However, the reason for their advantage may lie in bi-pedal agility and not only their ability collect food more efficiently.","[Bleicher, Sonny S.] Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.] George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.; Kotler, Burt P.; Downs, Cynthia J.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer, Israel; [Downs, Cynthia J.] SUNY ESF, Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY USA; [Brown, Joel S.] Moffitt Canc Res Ctr, Math Oncol, Tampa, FL USA","Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer, Israel.",sbleicher@wlu.edu,"Kotler, Burt/F-1381-2012; Downs, Cynthia/K-3758-2012","Kotler, Burt/0000-0003-2693-8788; Bleicher, Sonny S/0000-0001-8727-5901; Downs, Cynthia/0000-0001-9435-0623",United States-Israel Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [BSF-2008163],"United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: BSF-2008163",,76,1,1,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Theory predicts that prey sharing a predator, such as a biological control agent, can indirectly reduce each other's density at equilibrium (apparent competition). From this premise, we (i) discuss the complexity of indirect interactions among pests in agroecosystems and highlight the importance of natural enemy-mediated indirect interactions other than apparent competition, (ii) outline factors that affect the nature of enemy-mediated indirect interactions in the field and (iii) identify the way to manipulate enemy-mediated interactions for biological control. We argue that there is a need to increase the link between community ecology theory and biological control to develop better agroecological methods of crop protection via conservation biological control. In conclusion, we identify (i) interventions to be chosen depending on agroecosystem characteristics and (ii) several lines of research that will improve the potential for enemy-mediated indirect interactions to be applied to biological control.

Although these species sometimes co-occur, A. remigis typically lives in small streams with few or no fish, whereas A. conformis are typically in medium- or large-sized streams with large populations of potentially predatory fish. We tested in separate experiments in seminatural streams: 1) the effect of fish on behaviors of A. conformis, 2) the effect of A. remigis on A. conformis, and 3) the habitat use of A. conformis when given a choice between pools with A. remigis or fish. The first experiment showed no effect of fish on either mating behaviors or microhabitat use of A. conformis. This is in surprising contrast to the strong effects of fish already documented in A. remigis. The second experiment showed that the mating activity of A. conformis was reduced when A. remigis were present; hence, A. conformis should avoid A. remigis. Finally, when A. conformis were presented with a choice between two pools, one containing A. remigis and the other containing fish, both single males and pairs of A. conformis chose the pools with fish. In contrast, the habitat use of single female A. conformis was not affected by either fish or A. remigis.

In this study we investigated the effects of increased deer browsing (0.4-1.5 deer/ha) on a temperate woodland ecosystem by comparing small mammal communities and vegetation characteristics in 4 deer-free exclosures with adjacent woodland transects subjected to deer grazing. Jolly-Seber analyses of Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) results revealed that the significant reduction of bushes and shrubs in deer-grazed woodland was associated with significantly lower rodent densities than in deer-free exclosures at all times. However, whereas bankvoles (Myodes glareolus) outnumbered woodmice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in exclosures by 4:1, on average there were 1.6 times as many woodmice in the open woodland than bankvoles. Population structure did not differ between animals caught in exclosures vs. open woodland in terms of body weight, reproductive status, age structure nor sex ratio in either species. Our results highlight the need of bankvoles for denser understorey as protection from predators, compared with the woodmouse's greater agility and resulting ability to escape predators in open woodland as well as the ability to exploit arboreal habitats. The study emphasises the necessity for effective and informed deer management in order to conserve forest ecosystems.","[Buesching, C. D.; Newman, C.; Jones, J. T.; Macdonald, D.

However, competition is not the sole constraint on resource partitioning, and its effects are mediated by factors including the environmental context in which species coexist. Colonial seabirds provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the importance of competition in shaping realized niche widths because their life histories lead to variation in intra- and interspecific competition across the annual cycle. Dense breeding aggregations result in intense competition for prey in surrounding waters, whereas non-breeding dispersal to larger geographical areas produces lower densities of competitors. Bayesian hierarchical models of the isotopic niche, closely aligned to the trophic niche, reveal the degree of segregation between species and functional groups during both time periods. Surprisingly, species explained far more of the variance in the isotopic niche during the non-breeding than the breeding period. Our results underline the key role of non-breeding dynamics in alleviating competition and promoting distinctions between species through the facilitation of resource partitioning. Such situations may be common in a diverse range of communities sustained by ephemeral but abundant food items. This highlights how consideration of the hierarchical grouping of competitive interactions alongside consideration of abiotic constraints across the complete annual cycle allows a full understanding of the role of competition in driving patterns of character displacement.","[Bodey, Thomas W.; Bearhop, Stuart] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, England; [Ward, Eric J.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Phillips, Richard A.] British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [McGill, Rona A.

The potential of native Neotropical piscivores to provide biotic resistance to alien fish invaders and its interaction with water turbidity was investigated through mesocosm experiments. Three invasive and two native fish species were offered as prey to three native piscivores of the Parana river in 1000 L tanks. After 48 h, prey survival was compared among trials with and without the piscivores and in turbid (similar to more preserved systems) versus clear water (similar to disturbed systems by damming) treatments. Prey survival, particularly of the invasive species, was significantly lower in turbid water in the presence of predators (similar to 45.9% versus similar to 53.7% in clear water). Piscivores preyed more on smaller individuals in clear water and on larger preys in turbid water. Although vulnerability to predation was prey-specific, our results support the potential of native piscivores to provide biotic resistance against alien freshwater species. Water turbidity mediated the predator-prey interactions and our results confirm the hypothesis that decreased turbidity caused by dams' construction can affect predation efficiency of native piscivores and increase the abundance of alien fish.","[Santos, Alejandra F.

The urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii has recently undergone a southerly range expansion to the east coast of Tasmania, Australia. We manipulated densities of C. rodgersii and algal regrowth in urchin barrens habitat to test effects of the urchin on biotic interactions between two native herbivores, black-lip abalone (Haliotis rubra) and another urchin (Heliocidaris erythrogramma), and their benthic habitat. After 13 months, removals of only C. rodgersii resulted in overgrowth of barrens habitat by algae and sessile invertebrates. Densities of abalone increased (+92 %) only in patches from which C. rodgersii was removed and algal regrowth allowed. In contrast, densities of H. erythrogramma increased in all treatments (+45, +28, +25 %) in which C. rodgersii was removed, irrespective of the algal regrowth manipulations. These results suggest that C. rodgersii has a negative influence on the densities of abalone through competition for food and on densities of H. erythrogramma through competition for preferred habitat. Densities of abalone (+65 %) but not H. erythrogramma (+25 %), were lower in the patches from which C. rodgersii and canopy algae regrowth were removed relative to patches from which only C. rodgersii was removed (+92 and +28 %, respectively). These results suggest that C. rodgersii overgrazing of canopy-algae results in loss of structural complexity which could increase abalone susceptibility to predation, cause abalone to seek shelter in cryptic microhabitats and/or prevent their return to patches where canopy algae are absent. The ongoing spread of C. rodgersii and expansion of barrens habitat in eastern Tasmania will continue to negatively affect populations of these two native herbivores and their associated fisheries at a range of spatial scales. This example shows that habitat modifying species which become highly invasive can have disproportionate negative impacts on the structure and dynamics of the recipient community.","[Strain, Elisabeth M.

We investigated the recent successful invasion of the Pacific crabs Hemigrapsus takanoi and H. sanguineus to the southeastern North Sea coast with respect to their recruitment patterns, as well as interactions of juvenile with sub-adult individuals among the Pacific crabs and with native shore crabs Carcinus maenas. A field survey of juvenile native and introduced crab abundances (carapace width 1.4-10 mm) was conducted in the northern Wadden Sea, spanning 24 months from 2014 to 2016. The survey revealed different seasonal recruitment patterns of native C maenas and both introduced Hemigrapsus species. Native shore crabs showed a single recruitment peak from June to July, while Hemigrapsus spp. mainly recruited from August to early September, but recruits occurred in low densities throughout the winter until the end of the following spring season. Field experiments on the effects of larger crabs on the recruitment intensity showed that recruitment of H. takanoi was enhanced by the presence of larger congeners, but remained unaffected by larger C. maenas. Recruitment of juvenile C maenas, by contrast, was reduced by the presence of larger Hemigrapsus spp. Additional laboratory experiments revealed high rates of cannibalism on newly recruited C. maenas by subadult conspecifics as well as strong predation by larger Hemigrapsus spp. In contrast, newly recruited Hemigrapsus spp. had a much lower risk of being preyed on by subadult conspecifics and native shore crabs. Our results suggest that the timing of recruitment in combination with low intraspecific competition and reduced predation pressure by native shore crabs are crucial for the rapid and ongoing establishment of Hemigrapsus spp. in the Wadden Sea.

The present study manipulated density in three ponds; each pond was divided into one low density section and one high density section. The experiment was run for eight years, switching density treatments within ponds among years. This experimental design cannot definitively separate the experimental density effects from certain lag effects. This problem is discussed. Nonetheless, in all ponds tadpole survival was affected by the density manipulation. The reduced survival of larvae at high density was most pronounced in the pond with the overall highest density. In this pond, the density-dependent mortality almost offset the original, experimental, density difference between sections. Effects on tadpole and metamorph size and development rate were found in those cases in which density-dependent mortality was weak and treatment effects on density persisted to the later stages of tadpole development. However, even if significant, these were generally of small magnitude compared to the variation among ponds and years. 1 suggest that different modes and degrees of regulation among populations of one species of frog are to be expected, not only due to variation in pond quality but also due to variation in the surrounding terrestrial habitat. This may determine the balance between tadpole and adult population regulation.","Lund Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Loman, J (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",jon.loman@zooekol.lu.se,,,,,,31,39,43,0,35,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2004,85,6,,,,,1611,1618,,10.1890/03-0179,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,838QH,WOS:000222727500020,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

This review is an attempt to link ecological conceptual models with results from field research. A verification of different theoretically developed mechanisms shows that niche differentiation plays a major role in the Antarctic. This is particularly true if a broad niche definition is applied that includes alternating phases of competitive strength and weakness that allow populations to persist in a community. Such specific adaptation to the environment also seems to be an important mechanism among animals, which, to date, have been assumed to have broadly overlapping ecological demands. Nevertheless, disturbances due to glaciation history, ice impact, and predation, as well as a high dispersal capacity and low resource limitation contribute to the coexistence or, locally, to the reduction of potential competitors. Chance, reflecting extremely complex or otherwise indecipherable processes, also shapes diversity, e.g., during recolonization after habitat devastation due to iceberg scouring. The slow rates of ecological processes in the Antarctic benthos are shown not necessarily to reduce, but perhaps, to increase the potential for evolutionary radiation in some systematic groups. The fundamental question of how ecosystems continue to develop in the presence or absence of anthropogenic impacts can only be answered if such system-specific ecological and evolutionary mechanisms can be better identified and verified. Studies of the Antarctic benthos can contribute to a corresponding global approach if more comparable information on the life histories of representative species becomes available and if ecological models are developed to decipher complex processes, that shape biodiversity patterns.

Theory on rarity suggests that both predispersal seed predation and competition can be important mechanisms influencing abundance and/or distribution of rare plant populations. Yet few studies have tested these interactions, and those that have evaluated each mechanism independently. Astragalus sinuatus Piper (Whited's milkvetch) is a narrow endemic plant species restricted to eight populations within a 10-km(2) area in eastern Washington. We used experimental and observational methods to test the effects of native insect predispersal seed predators and an invasive grass (Bromus tectorum L. [cheatgrass]) on seed set and population density of A. sinuatus. We quantified per capita seed production and pod predation rates across four sites and among four years. Seed predation rates were high across four sites (66-82%) and all years (65-82%). Experimental reduction of predispersal seed predators significantly increased per capita seed set of A. sinuatus (164-345%) at two experimental sites. Concurrently, two seed addition experiments demonstrated the effect of seed loss and presence of B. tectorum on seedling recruitment and establishment of A. sinuatus over four growing seasons. In the first seed addition experiment, we found no difference in recruitment and establishment between low (40) and high (120) seed addition levels. In the second addition experiment (one level of addition; 40 seeds), we found that recruitment and survivorship increased 200% in plots where B. tectorum was removed compared to plots where B. tectorum was present. Thus, seed addition had no impact in the presence of B. tectorum; conversely, in the absence of B. tectorum, seed addition was highly effective at increasing population numbers. Results suggest that, in areas where B. tectorum is present, recruitment is site limited, and it is seed limited when B. tectorum is absent. We recommend that managers reduce B. tectorum in an effort to increase population growth of A. sinuatus; in areas where B. tectorum is absent, short-term reduction of insect predators should be considered as a strategy to increase population growth of this rare species.","[Combs, Julie K.; Reichard, Sarah H.] Univ Washington, Sch Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Groom, Martha J.] Univ Washington, Bothell, WA 98011 USA; [Groom, Martha J.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Wilderman, David L.] Washington State Dept Nat Resources, Nat Areas Program, Olympia, WA 98504 USA; [Camp, Pamela A.] US Bur Land Management, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA","Combs, JK (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jkcombs@u.washington.edu,"Groom, Martha/AAF-4483-2021",,Washington Department of Natural Resources; U.S. Bureau of Land Management,"We thank A.

But we lack evidence on the mechanisms behind such indirect competition. This study shows that temporal asynchronies in emergence time lead to apparent competition via shared natural enemies in a leafminer-parasitoid community. We present three kinds of evidence on mechanisms driving apparent competition. First, we conducted a two-year population census of Liriomyza helianthi and Calycomyza platyptera, along with all associated parasitoids, at seven sites in the Californian Central Valley, USA. We then assessed C. platyptera parasitism on 16 vegetation islands, half with experimental removal of early-season L. helianthi populations. Finally, we examined parasitoid host preference between leafminer species. We found that Liriomyza helianthi populations emerged approximately one month before C. platyptera. Experimental removal of L. helianthi populations in the early summer led to a 60% reduction in parasitism of C. platyptera. We found no evidence of differential parasitoid preference for host species. The findings suggest that temporal asynchrony can lead to negative effects on later-emerging species and that such indirect competition may be a major structuring force in herbivore communities.","[Blitzer, Eleanor J.; Welter, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Blitzer, EJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14843 USA.",ejb278@cornell.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); Land Institute; Robert van den Bosch graduate research fellowship,"We appreciate the helpful comments of Nicholas Mills, Wayne Sousa, Genni Crawford, Mia Park, and the Berkeley Trophic Lunch seminar group.

We tested the hypothesis that the top-down effects of P cinereus are influenced by the species composition of invertebrates of the forest-floor. In a month-long microcosm experiment, we compared salamander effects on invertebrate species composition in leaf-litter from two sites that differed in species and size composition of invertebrate detritivores (an urban forest site at which isopods and millipedes were numerous and a rural forest site at which Collembola were the most numerous detritivores, but isopods and millipedes were few). Our results were consistent with our initial hypothesis. The presence of salamanders within microcosms was associated with decreased densities of oribatid mites, pseudoscorpions, isopods and millipedes in comparison to salamander-absent controls, but negative effects of salamanders on isopods and millipedes were most strongly expressed within urban litter microcosms. Salamanders; were also associated with a positive, indirect effect, i.e., an increase in density of podomorphic Collembola in comparison to salamander- absent controls, but within urban litter exclusively. Our results suggested that plethodontid salamanders exerted positive, indirect effects through consumption of an intermediate predator, i.e., pseudoscorpions, and macroinvertebrate competitors, i.e., isopods and millipedes, of podomorphic Collembola. We hypothesize that differences in salamander- mediated dynamics between the two Litter sources resulted from prey selection by P cinereus based on differences in prey size and abundance between the rural. and urban forest litter.

Predators can exert strong direct and indirect effects on ecological communities by intimidating their prey. The nature of predation risk effects is often context dependent, but in some ecosystems these contingencies are often overlooked. 2. Risk effects are often not uniform across landscapes or among species. Indeed, they can vary widely across gradients of habitat complexity and with different prey escape tactics. These context dependencies may be especially important for ecosystems such as coral reefs that vary widely in habitat complexity and have species-rich predator and prey communities. 3. With field experiments using predator decoys of the black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci), we investigated how reef complexity interacts with predation risk to affect the foraging behaviour and herbivory rates of large herbivorous fishes (e.g. parrotfishes and surgeonfishes) across four coral reefs in the Florida Keys (USA). In both high and low complexity areas of the reef, we measured how herbivory changed with increasing distance from the predator decoy to examine how herbivorous fishes reconcile the conflicting demands of avoiding predation vs. foraging within a reefscape context. 4. We show that with increasing risk, herbivorous fishes consumed dramatically less food (ca. 90%) but fed at a faster rate when they did feed (ca. 26%). Furthermore, we show that fishes foraging closest to the predator decoy were 40% smaller than those that foraged at further distances. Thus, smaller individuals showed muted response to predation risk compared to their larger counterparts, potentially due to their decreased risk to predation or lower reproductive value (i.e. the asset protection principle). Habitat heterogeneity mediated risk effects differently for different species of herbivores, with predation risk more strongly suppressing herbivore feeding in more complex areas and for individuals at higher risk of predation. 5. Predators appear to create a reefscape of fear that changes the size structure of herbivores towards smaller individuals, increases individual feeding rates, but suppresses overall amounts of primary producers consumed, potentially altering patterns of herbivory, an ecosystem process critical for healthy coral reefs.","[Catano, Laura B.; Rojas, Maria C.; Malossi, Ryan J.; Heithaus, Michael R.; Fourqurean, James W.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, North Miamif, FL 33181 USA; [Peters, Joseph R.] Portland State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Catano, LB (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, Marine Sci Bldg,3000 NE 151st St, North Miamif, FL 33181 USA.",catanol@umsl.edu,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020; Fourqurean, James/AAY-9611-2020","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Fourqurean, James/0000-0002-0811-8500; Peters, Joseph/0000-0002-9625-1626",NOAA Coral Reef Conservation ProgramNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1130786]; Division Of Ocean SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1130786] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This work was supported by a grant from the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program to DEB and B.I.

These interactions operate between prey species as well: the benefits of group living decline in the presence of an alternative prey species. We apply a novel model-fitting approach to data from field experiments to distinguish among competing hypotheses about shifts in predator foraging behavior across a range of predator and prey densities. Our study provides novel analytical tools for analyzing predator foraging behavior and offers insight into the processes driving the dynamics of coral reef fish. Studies of predator foraging behavior typically focus on single prey species and fixed predator densities, ignoring the potential importance of complexities such as predator dilution; predator-mediated effects of alternative prey; heterospecific competition; or predatorpredator interactions. Neglecting the effects of prey density is particularly problematic for prey species that live in mixed species groups, where the beneficial effects of predator dilution may swamp the negative effects of heterospecific competition. Here we use field experiments to investigate how the mortality rates of a shoaling coral reef fish (a wrasse: Thalassoma amblycephalum), change as a result of variation in: 1) conspecific density, 2) density of a predator (a hawkfish: Paracirrhites arcatus), and 3) presence of an alternative prey species that competes for space (a damselfish: Pomacentrus pavo). We quantify changes in prey mortality rates from the predator's perspective, examining the effects of added predators or a second prey species on the predator's functional response. Our analysis highlights a model-fitting approach that discriminates amongst multiple hypotheses about predator foraging in a community context. Wrasse mortality decreased with increasing conspecific density (i.e. mortality was inversely density-dependent). The addition of a second predator doubled prey mortality rates, without significantly changing attack rate or handling time i.e. there was no evidence for predator interference. The presence of a second prey species increased wrasse mortality by 95%; we attribute this increase either to short-term apparent competition (predator aggregation) or to a decrease in handling time of the predator (e.g. through decreased wrasse vigilance). In this system, 1) prey benefit from intraspecific group living though a reduced predation risk, and 2) the benefit of group living is reduced in the presence of an alternative prey species.","[Stier, Adrian C.; Bolker, Benjamin M.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Geange, Shane W.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","Stier, AC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",astier@ufl.edu,,"Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; Three Seas Marine Biology Program; Ocean Bridges Program; French-American Cultural Exchange; Victoria Univ. of Wellington PhD Scholarship; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1130359] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We are grateful for field assistance from N.

But density and population size structure are also shaped by food-dependent processes, such as individual growth, maturation, and reproduction. Mortality relaxes competition and thereby alters the dynamic interplay among these processes. As shown by the recently developed size-structured theory, which can account for food-dependent individual performance, this altered interplay can lead to overcompensatory responses in size class-specific biomass, with increasing mortality. We experimentally tested this theory by subjecting laboratory fish populations to a range of size-selective mortality rates. Overall, the results were in agreement with theoretical predictions. Biomass of the juvenile size class increased above control levels at intermediate adult mortality rates and thereafter declined at high mortality rates. Juvenile biomass also increased when juveniles themselves were subjected to intermediate mortality rates. Biomass in other size classes decreased with mortality. Such biomass overcompensation can have wide-ranging implications for communities and food webs, including a high sensitivity of top predators to irreversible catastrophic collapses, the establishment of alternative stable community states, and the promotion of coexistence and biodiversity.","[Schroder, A.; Persson, L.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [de Roos, A.

Despite this, no study has analysed multispecies interactions by combining such a high number of aspects, mostly because the experimental manipulation of studied populations is rarely possible. In our work, we assessed several aspects of interspecific interactions in a rodent assembly composed by three species, by examining diet and temporal- niche partitioning, as well as relevant ectoparasite load and predation pressure, in a natural environment. We analysed stomach contents and ectoparasite load of 78 individuals belonging to all the species, whereas activity rhythms were measured with camera trapping (2200 night-traps, throughout 1 year). Our findings showed that the largest-sized species, i.e. the brown rat Rattus norvegicus was the strongest competitor and may affect diet, temporal behaviour and susceptibility to parasites of smaller-sized ones, i.e. the black rat Rattus rattus and the house mouse Mus domesticus. Larger-sized species showed a broader trophic niche with respect to smaller-sized ones, whereas the smallest species seemed to avoid the largest ones by shifting its temporal activity when the latter was mostly inactive. Larger-sized species may also act as potential predators towards smaller ones, which are also more vulnerable to ectoparasite infestation and to the predation by the only raptor bird present in the study area, the barn owl Tyto alba. We therefore highlight the importance to carry out community-wide studies, to understand interspecific intraguild relationships.","[Mori, Emiliano; Ferretti, F.; Fattorini, N.] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, SI, Italy","Mori, E (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, SI, Italy.",moriemiliano@tiscali.it,"Fattorini, Niccolo/AAJ-9976-2020","Fattorini, Niccolo/0000-0001-8022-7464; Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0002-0414-1615",,,,107,11,12,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

For marine systems, recruitment has been identified as a critical element uniting local communities within regions. Most studies have addressed this question over large biogeographic scales encompassing multiple regions. Regional species pools are usually defined as fixed and the degree to which this pool is found on a local scale is often used as a measure of regional influence. Usually the degree to which local communities vary temporally and how this relates to the regional pool is not examined. Given that recruitment links local sites within regions and is a temporally dynamic process, it is important to include temporal variation in the regional vs. local control debate; especially given that regional pools themselves are changing much more rapidly with the invasion of new species. Here the results of a study of the colonization of experimental panels at 28 sites within a region encompassing 200 km of the California coast are used to address this question. This study examined experimentally the temporal and spatial variation in species and contrasted intraregional and local factors. At 22 of these sites, all within 15 km of each other, identical colonization experiments were followed for as long as 3 years. Results of these experiments demonstrated that there was some regional control through the seasonal variation in recruitment, but that strong local effects greatly altered the regional input. Substrates of the same size at the same station usually accumulated the same number of species, but among stations mean diversity ranged from 10 to 50 species per substrate. Differences between sites were a function of more localized recruitment than expected and normal post-recruitment processes of competitive dominance, disturbance, and predation that affected the rates at which species were lost. The colonization of most substrates resulted in their attaining an asymptotic or equilibrium diversity maintained by a balance between species immigration and local extinction. Nevertheless, on most substrates diversity fluctuated much more than predicted by an equilibrium model. The similarity in species richness on substrates at the same site regardless of initial exposure time, the large differences among substrates from different sites, the similar pattern of differences among the sites for panels of different sizes, and the resilience of communities to disturbance and their return to the diversity characteristic of a site all argue for strong local factors controlling the diversity within the region.

These differences give rise to different shell forms in different habitats. In those species which have non-planktotrophic development, differences in shell form among shores have been usually explained in terms of natural selection because exposure to waves supposedly favours light shells with large apertures, while predation by crabs on sheltered shores favours elongated, thick shells with smaller apertures. Differences in shell shape among species found at different heights on the shore have been explained in terms of resistance to desiccation and temperature. Such variables would tend to act on a relatively broad-scale, i.e. causing differences among heights on a shore or among shores. Rates of growth, which might vary at much smaller scales within a shore, have also been shown to affect the shapes of many shells. In this study, the shape and relative weight of shells of three species of co-existing littorinids (Littorina unifasciata, Bembicium nanum and Nodilittorina pyramidalis) were measured. These species all have planktotrophic development and they are found on many shores where there is no evidence that they are preyed upon by crabs. Before explanations of shell shape are proposed, it is necessary that patterns of variation, within different parts of a shore and among different shores are clearly documented. These patterns were measured at a number of different spatial scales within and among replicate shores with different amounts of wave exposure. Large and small specimens were included to allow intraspecific comparisons among snails of different sizes found at different heights on the shore. The results showed significant differences among shores in shape and relative weight of shells, but these differences could not be explained by exposure to waves. In addition, snails of different sizes and different species did not show the same patterns although they were collected from the same sites. Importantly, the shell shape of Littorina unifasciata varied significantly among sites at approximately the same height within a shore. These differences could not be clearly correlated with density, mean size nor exposure to waves. The only consistent pattern was a decrease in relative aperture size in specimens living higher on the shore. Models that have commonly been proposed to explain shape and relative weight of shells in other species of gastropods are not adequate to explain the small- and large-scale variation of the measurements described here. It is proposed that any selective advantage of shell morphology and the effects of any variables on the development of shell morphology in these species can only be identified after appropriately designed and replicated field experiments.",,"CHAPMAN, MG (corresponding author), UNIV SYDNEY,INST MARINE ECOL,MARINE ECOL LABS A11,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA.",,"Chapman, Maura/B-2287-2008",,,,,70,35,35,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0260-1230,,,J MOLLUS STUD,J.

Understanding their combined effects on community structure and on ecosystem functioning presents challenges for an improved ecological risk assessment. This study focuses on an artificial stream mesocosms experiment testing for direct and indirect effects of insecticide (chlorantraniliprole - CAP) exposure on the structure of a benthic macroinvertebrate freshwater community and on ecosystem functioning (leaf decomposition, primary production). To understand how predator identity and resource quality alter the community responses to chemical stress, the mediating effects of an invasive predator species (crayfish Procambarus clarkii) and detritus quality (tested by using leaves of the invasive Eucalyptus globulus) on insecticide toxicity were also investigated. Low concentrations of CAP reduced the abundance of shredders and grazers, decreasing leaf decomposition and increasing primary production. Replacement of autochthonous predators and leaf litter by invasive species decreased macroinvertebrate survival, reduced leaf decomposition, and enhanced primary production. Structural equation modeling (SEM) highlighted that CAP toxicity to macroinvertebrates was mediated by the presence of crayfish or eucalypt leaf litter which are now common in many Mediterranean freshwaters. In summary, our results demonstrate that the presence of these two invasive species alters the effects of insecticide exposure on benthic freshwater communities. The approach used here also allowed for a mechanistic evaluation of indirect effects of these stressors and of their interaction on ecosystem functional endpoint, emphasizing the value of incorporating biotic stressors in ecotoxicological experiments.","[Rodrigues, Andreia C.

We used a systematic combination of empirical observational studies and experimental manipulations to comprehensively evaluate the effects of these process on a model endangered rodent, dusky hopping-mice (Notomys fuscus). We established a large manipulative experiment in arid Australia, and collected information from relative abundance indices, camera traps, GPS-collared dingoes (Canis familiaris) and dingo scats, along with a range of related environmental data (e.g. rainfall, habitat type, distance to artificial water etc.). We show that hopping-mice populations were most strongly influenced by geological and climatic effects of resource availability and rainfall, and not land use, invasive species, or human effects of livestock grazing, waterpoint provision, or the lethal control of dingoes. Hopping-mice distribution declined along a geological gradient of more to less available hopping-mice habitat (sand dunes), and their abundance was driven by rainfall. Hopping-mice populations fluctuated independent of livestock presence, artificial waterpoint availability or repeated lethal dingo control. Hopping-mice populations appear to be limited first by habitat availability, then by food availability, then by predation. Contemporary top-predator control practices (for protection of livestock) have little influence on hopping-mice behaviour or population dynamics. Given our inability to constrain the effects of predation across broad scales, management actions focusing on increasing available food and habitat (e.g. alteration of fire and herbivory) may have a greater chance of improving the conservation status of hopping-mice and other small mammals in arid areas. Our study also reaffirms the importance of using systematic and experimental approaches to detect true drivers of population distribution and dynamics where multiple potential drivers operate simultaneously.

Direct competition with L. maackii reduced the abundance and richness of native and exotic species, and native consumers significantly reduced the abundance and richness of native species. Although effects of direct competition and consumption were more pervasive, richness of native plants was also reduced through apparent competition, as small-mammal consumers reduced richness only when L. maackii fruits were present. Our experiment reveals the multiple, interactive pathways that affect the success and impact of an invasive exotic plant: exotic plants may directly benefit from reduced attack by native consumers, may directly exert strong competitive effects on native plants, and may also benefit from apparent competition.","[Orrock, John L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53704 USA; [Dutra, Humberto P.] Life Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Marietta, GA 30060 USA; [Marquis, Robert J.] Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Marquis, Robert J.] Univ Missouri, Whitney R Harris World Ecol Ctr, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Barber, Nicholas] No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60015 USA","Orrock, JL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53704 USA.",jorrock@wisc.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0444217, DEB-0710341]; Webster Groves Nature Study Society; Whitney R.

Modern coexistence theory provides a detailed framework to investigate this topic, but there have been remarkably few empirical applications to the impact of natural enemies. We tested experimentally the capacity for a generalist enemy to promote coexistence of competing insect species, and the extent to which any impact can be predicted by trade-offs between reproductive rate and susceptibility to natural enemies. We used experimental mesocosms to conduct a fully factorial pairwise competition experiment for six rainforest Drosophila species, with and without a generalist pupal parasitoid. We then parameterised models of competition and examined the coexistence of each pair of Drosophila species within the framework of modern coexistence theory. We found idiosyncratic impacts of parasitism on pairwise coexistence, mediated through changes in fitness differences, not niche differences. There was no evidence of an overall reproductive rate-susceptibility trade-off. Pairwise reproductive rate-susceptibility relationships were not useful shortcuts for predicting the impact of parasitism on coexistence. Our results exemplify the value of modern coexistence theory in multi-trophic contexts and the importance of contextualising the impact of generalist natural enemies to determine their impact. In the set of species investigated, competition was affected by the higher trophic level, but the overall impact on coexistence cannot be easily predicted just from knowledge of relative susceptibility. Methodologically, our Bayesian approach highlights issues with the separability of model parameters within modern coexistence theory and shows how using the full posterior parameter distribution improves inferences. This method should be widely applicable for understanding species coexistence in a range of systems.","[Terry, J.

In Lake Vattern, relict Arctic char, fourhorn sculpin, smelt and seven species of crustaceans form a deep-water food-web, and interact closely as competitors, predators and prey. Here, we analyzed new and archived data back to the late 1960s in order to understand and relate observed life-history shifts in the smelt population, to concurrent adverse life-history changes observed in the endangered Arctic char population. Smelt growth was sigmoidal and the size frequency distribution dominated by fish up to 110 mm and age 0-4, although smelt occasionally reached 250 mm. Smelt diet shifts as the fish grow, from zooplankton, to Mysis relicta, to piscivory for individuals larger than 150 mm. Recruitment commonly demonstrates regular inter-annual pulses of YOY abundance although strong year classes produced during years with higher spring temperature cause post-annual irregularity of year class strength. Young smelt reside in surface water and older fish in deeper water. This ontogenetic shift in distribution depends on temperature occupied, prey availability and risk of inter- and intra-specific predation. Interestingly, even though very small Arctic char feed on smelt, most small Arctic char are found in deep water together with large smelt, and most large Arctic char are found in shallow water with small smelt.

They also potentially interact, an issue that is likely to be contributing to the ongoing collapse of native mammal communities across Australia. In the present review, I first describe the mechanisms through which fire could create predation pinch points, exacerbating the impacts of predators, including red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, and feral cats, Felis catus, on their native mammalian prey. These mechanisms include a localised increase in predator activity (a numerically mediated pathway) and higher predator hunting success after fire (a functionally moderated pathway), which could both increase native mammal mortality and limit population recovery in fire-affected landscapes. Evidence for such interactions is growing, although largely based on unreplicated experiments. Improving native mammal resilience to fire in predator-invaded landscapes requires addressing two key questions: how can the impacts of introduced predators on native mammals in fire-affected areas be reduced; and, does a reduction in predation by introduced species result in higher native mammal survival and population recovery after fire? I then examine potential management options for reducing predator impacts post-fire. The most feasible are landscape-scale predator control and the manipulation of fire regimes to create patchy fire scars. However, robust field experiments with adequate statistical power are required to assess the effectiveness of these approaches and preclude null (e.g. compensatory mortality) or adverse (e.g. mesopredator or competitor release) outcomes. Ongoing predator management and prescribed burning programs provide an opportunity to learn through replicated natural experiments as well as experimental manipulations. Standardised reporting protocols and cross-jurisdiction monitoring programs would help achieve necessary spatial and environmental replication, while multi-trophic, spatially explicit simulation models could help synthesise findings from disparate study designs, predict management outcomes and generate new hypotheses. Such approaches will be key to improving management of the complex mechanisms that drive threatened native mammal populations in Australia's predator-invaded, fire-prone landscapes.","[Hradsky, Bronwyn A.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Quantitat & Appl Ecol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Hradsky, Bronwyn A.] Univ Melbourne, NESP Threatened Species Recovery Hub, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Hradsky, BA (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Quantitat & Appl Ecol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.; Hradsky, BA (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, NESP Threatened Species Recovery Hub, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",hradskyb@unimelb.edu.au,,"Hradsky, Bronwyn/0000-0002-0141-020X","Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program through the Threatened Species Recovery HubAustralian Government; Victorian Government Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning; Parks Victoria","Many thanks to Brendan Wintle, Luke Kelly, and journal editors and reviewers for insightful comments on the manuscript, and Julian Di Stefano, Euan Ritchie and Alan York for discussions during my PhD that helped form my ideas.

We assessed empirically whether the results of experiments testing for density dependence applied at larger spatial domains and explained temporal population dynamics. We studied a small coral reef fish, the goldspot goby (Gnatholepis thompsoni), in the Bahamas. We assessed the effects of interactions with conspecifics and with an ecologically similar species, the bridled goby (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum). Two density manipulations on small reef patches revealed that goldspot goby mortality over one month increased as conspecifics became crowded. On five large natural reefs, we correlated the initial year-class density of both species (annual larval settlement) with the subsequent decline of goldspot goby year-classes for five years. Mortality was correlated with conspecific density among reefs for all years, but not among years for all reefs. Thus, spatial density dependence in mortality scaled up qualitatively from small patches to entire reefs but was not associated with temporal density dependence. Our results support the conclusion that field experiments may be extrapolated to larger spatial domains with care, but that using small spatial comparisons to predict temporal responses is difficult without knowing the underlying biological mechanisms.","[Forrester, Graham E.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Steele, Mark A.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Samhouri, Jameal F.; Evans, Bryn; Vance, Richard R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Forrester, GE (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",gforrester@uri.edu,,"Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917; Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 9618011/0096061, OCE 0222087]; NOAA-NURPNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [CMRC-99-CRGF-01-01A, CMRC-01-PRGF-01-01A, CMRC-01-NRME-01-02A, CMRC-01NRME-01-03C, CMRC-03-NRME-01-04A]; Perry Foundation","We thank M.

This predator is often involved with intraguild predation, in most cases with aphids predators. Here, we report the results of experiments designed to understand the outcome of the invasion of H. axyridis on native coccinellid aphidophagous guilds using intraguild predation as a theoretical framework. Tests were conducted to determine the interactions between 1st and 4th instars larvae and H. axyridis adults, with Cycloneda sanguinea, Cycloneda pulchella, Eriopis connexa and Hippodamia convergens larvae, as well as eggs predation rate. Two treatments were used: absence and presence of food, Cinara atlantica. The results showed that 1st and 4th instars larvae and H. axyridis adults are able to prey on larvae and eggs of four Coccinellidae species analyzed, and also their own eggs, showing that this exotic species is a dominant predator in this guild of aphidophagous coccinellids. Adding to these results, studies are recommended, especially the monitoring of these species in the field in the long run, reporting their abundance and diversity as well as their behavior and impact within aphidophagous guilds, especially in Coccinellidae species.","[de Castro-Guedes, Camila Fediuk; de Almeida, Lucia Massutti] Univ Fed Parana UFPR, Dept Zool, Lab Sistemat & Bioecol Coleoptera Insecta, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Moura, Mauricio Osvaldo] Univ Fed Parana UFPR, Dept Zool, Lab Dinam Ecol, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil","de Castro-Guedes, CF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana UFPR, Dept Zool, Lab Sistemat & Bioecol Coleoptera Insecta, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",camifc@yahoo.com,"Moura, Mauricio O/B-1063-2013","Moura, Mauricio O/0000-0001-7948-2986; Fediuk de Castro Guedes, Camila/0000-0002-3110-1272","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [401366/2014-6, 308992/2017-2, 309154/2014-6]","We thank to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) (CFCG, 401366/2014-6), (LMA, 308992/2017-2) and (MOM, 309154/2014-6) for funding.",,65,3,3,1,6,SOC BRASILEIRA ENTOMOLOGIA,CURITIBA,"CAIXA POSTAL 19030, CURITIBA, PR 81531-980, BRAZIL",0085-5626,1806-9665,,REV BRAS ENTOMOL,Rev.

The natural control against dandelion includes seedling predation, with slugs, particularly Arion lusitanicus, being the most important in the Czech Republic. However, the study of slug seedling consumption is difficult because naturally established seedlings are not always available. Therefore, we developed a method of exposing laboratory-grown seedlings as bait for slug predation. Dandelion seeds were sown in plastic cups containing a bottom layer of moist substrate. The emerged seedlings were thinned to 20 and displayed in an open area. During 2008-2010, the seedling baits were placed at 15 sites at 1 month intervals throughout the dandelion vegetative season, in parallel with plasticine baits that monitored slug feeding activity. For each 1 month interval, seedling survival was observed for a period of 8 days, and the estimated time to death was calculated; the percentage of surviving seedlings was then recorded. This method of seedling presentation demonstrated that local and temporal variation in seedling survival is correlated with slug feeding activity. The advantage of this technique is that the seedlings in baits may be presented at any place and time, as required by the experimental design; however, we found that the estimated time to seedling death was shorter for the exposed baits than for the naturally established seedlings. The method is suitable for the study of plant species other than dandelion, and also for aims other than the study of spatiotemporal trends in seedling consumption by slugs.","[Honek, A.; Saska, P.; Koprdova, S.] Crop Res Inst, Dept Entomol, CZ-16106 Prague 6, Ruzyne, Czech Republic; [Martinkova, Z.] Crop Res Inst, Dept Herbol, CZ-16106 Prague 6, Ruzyne, Czech Republic","Honek, A (corresponding author), Crop Res Inst, Dept Entomol, Drnovska 507, CZ-16106 Prague 6, Ruzyne, Czech Republic.",honek@vurv.cz,"Saska, Pavel/K-6434-2013","Saska, Pavel/0000-0003-1397-2987",GACRGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [526/09/1436]; MZe CR [002700604],"We thank Mrs. J.

This type of spread is called a 'patchy spread'. in earlier models, this phenomenon was considered to be a result of a pronounced environmental or/and demographic stochasticity. Recently, it was found that a patchy spread can arise in a fully deterministic predator-prey system and in models of infectious diseases; in each case the process takes place in a homogeneous environment. it is well recognized that the observed patterns of patchy spread in nature are a result of interplay between stochastic and deterministic factors. However, the models considering deterministic mechanism of patchy spread are developed and studied much less compared to those based on stochastic mechanisms. A further progress in the understanding of the role of deterministic factors in the patchy spread would be extremely helpful. Here we apply multi-species reaction-diffusion models of two spatial dimensions in a homogeneous environment. We demonstrate that patterns of patchy spread are rather common for the considered approach, in particular, they arise both in mutualism and competition models influenced by predation. We show that this phenomenon can occur in a system without a strong Allee effect, contrary to what was assumed to be crucial in earlier models. We show, as well, a pattern of patchy spread having significantly different speeds in different spatial directions. We analyze basic features of spatiotemporal dynamics of patchy spread common for the reaction-diffusion approach. We discuss in which ecosystems we would observe patterns of deterministic patchy spread due to the considered mechanism. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Coral-poor and coral-rich areas were surveyed at sites with both low (Hawaii Island) and high (Midway Atoll) predator densities, facilitating examination of relations among predator and recruit densities, habitat, and group metrics. Predator and recruit densities varied spatially and temporally, with a sixfold range in total recruit densities among years. Group (a parts per thousand yen2 recruits) metrics varied with time and tracked predator and recruit densities and the proportion of schooling species. Groups often included heterospecifics whose proportion increased with group size. A non-saturating relationship between group size and recruit density suggests that the anti-predator benefits of aggregation exceeded competitive costs. Grouping behavior may have overarching importance for recruit survival-even at high recruit densities-and merits further study on Hawaiian reefs and elsewhere.","[DeMartini, Edward E.] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Aiea, HI 96701 USA; [Anderson, Todd W.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, Coastal & Marine Inst, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] US Geol Survey, Hawaii Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Beets, James P.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Marine Sci, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","DeMartini, EE (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, 99-193 Aiea Hts Dr, Aiea, HI 96701 USA.",edward.demartini@noaa.gov,,,"NOAA Fisheries, Office of Habitat ConservationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation","Financial support of EED during 2006-2010 was provided by the NOAA Fisheries, Office of Habitat Conservation, Coral Reef Conservation Program.

Since C. novemnotata's decline, the invasive Harmonia axyridis Pallas has become dominant in North America. This study investigated whether H. axyridis has the potential to impede the recovery of C. novemnotata populations. To determine how H. axyridis interacts with C. novemnotata via intraguild predation and competition for prey, we paired first-instar C. novemnotata with first-instar H. axyridis at low and high densities of pea aphid. Coccinella novemnotata survival when paired interspecifically was significantly lower than H. axyridis survival at both aphid densities. Both species had similar weights at eclosion across aphid densities; however, H. axyridis developed faster than C. novemnotata. To examine the effect of larval size on intraguild interactions, we conducted a second experiment where we varied the C. novemnotata and H. axyridis instar in our pairings. Coccinella novemnotata survival and final weight increased when paired with younger H. axyridis larvae. The percentage survival of C. novemnotata in interspecific treatments, at the low aphid density, was lower than for same aged C. novemnotata reared conspecifically, except for pairs initiated with C. novemnotata larvae that were two in-stars more advanced than H. axyridis larvae.

Effects of predators can be complex, and mechanisms by which predators affect invasion success and impact are understood for only a few well-studied communities. We tested experimentally whether a native predator limits an invasive species' success and impact on a native competitor for a community of aquatic insect larvae in water-filled containers. The native mosquito Aedes triseriatus alone had no significant effect on abundance of the invasive mosquito Aedes albopictus. The native predatory midge Corethrella appendiculata, at low or high density, significantly reduced A. albopictus abundance. This effect was not caused by trait-mediated oviposition avoidance of containers with predators, but instead was a density-mediated effect caused by predator-induced mortality. The presence of this predator significantly reduced survivorship of the native species, but high predator density also significantly increased development rate of the native species when the invader was present, consistent with predator-mediated release from interspecific competition with the invader. Thus, a native predator can indirectly benefit its native prey when a superior competitor invades. This shows the importance of native predators as a component of biodiversity for both biotic resistance to invasion and resilience of a community perturbed by successful invasion.","[Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Lounibos, L.

Previous studies showed that the competitive displacement occurs rapidly and is facilitated by clumped insect resources. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of displacement is primarily due to differences in the ability of each species to exploit insect resources. (1) These species show nearly complete diet overlap. (2) Insects are a limiting resource for both geckos as evidenced by positive demographic effects with increased insect abundance. (3) Hemidactylus frenatus depletes insect resources to lower levels than L. lugubris, which results in reduced rates of resource acquisition in L. lugubris. (4) This reduced resource acquisition translates into significant reductions in the body condition, fecundity, and survivorship of L. lugubris individuals. (5) Evidence for interference (and other) mechanisms does not account for these negative demographic effects on L. lugubris. Interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition for L. lugubris, with increasing L. lugubris density having negligible effect on H. frenatus, mirroring the asymmetry of the large-scale displacement. The superior harvesting ability of H. frenatus is most pronounced when insects are clumped spatially and temporally, and is attributable to a variety of species-specific traits such as their larger body size, faster running speed, and reduced intraspecific interference while foraging. We conclude that clumped resources can increase interspecific exploitation competition, and this mechanism may contribute to species turnover when human environmental alterations redistribute resources.","UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, DEPT BIOL 0116, LA JOLLA, CA 92117 USA",,,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Petren, Kenneth/0000-0002-7936-6042",,,,44,222,237,1,81,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1996,77,1,,,,,118,132,,10.2307/2265661,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TR079,WOS:A1996TR07900014,,,,,2021-09-27,

The success or failure of this pest management strategy is still mainly attributed to the ability of a few key natural enemies to suppress the pest density. For example, successful regulation of the California red scale (Aonidiella aurantii), a key citrus pest, is generally credited to specific parasitoids of the Aphytis genus. Currently, research is revealing how herbivore regulation in agroecosystems can be alternatively achieved with a greater number of trophic associations within the system. The goals of the present study were as follows: i) to unravel species-specific trophic links between A. aurantii and its natural enemies in citrus agroecosystems, and ii) to assess their contribution to control of A. aurantii. Predation and parasitism of this herbivorous pest were assessed through exclusion experiments. Species-specific trophic links between this herbivorous pest and its natural enemies were studied using gut-content analysis of field-collected predators employing prey-specific DNA molecular markers. Relative predation rates of the species involved in A. aurantii regulation were estimated. Predation was found to be the main biotic component of A. aurantii mortality, causing reductions of more than 75% in recently settled cohorts. Aonidiella aurantii DNA was detected in the digestive system of 11 species of predators. Generalist and stenophagous predators, mainly associated with other citrus pests such as aphids, proved to be the most important biological control agents of this pest. Complex trophic relationships, such as apparent competition between two key citrus pests, were revealed. The present study highlights the role of predation as biotic mortality factor of key pests in perennial agroecosystems, wherein it is a rich complex of indigenous or naturalized generalist predators that are primarily responsible for this mortality. The results herein presented may therefore offer another perspective on the biological control of one of the key world-wide citrus pests, at least in those regions where specific parasitoids are not able to successfully regulate the scale populations.","[Bouvet, Juan Pedro R.] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Estn Expt Agr EEA Concordia, Buenos Aires, Entre Rios, Argentina; [Bouvet, Juan Pedro R.; Urbaneja, Alberto; Perez-Hedo, Meritxell; Monzo, Cesar] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain","Monzo, C (corresponding author), Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",cmonzo@ivia.es,"Monzo, C./O-5248-2019; Monzo, Cesar/L-7055-2014; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/AAW-6198-2020; Perez-Hedo, Meritxell/O-6441-2019; Urbaneja, Alberto/C-9071-2011","Monzo, C./0000-0003-3247-7412; Monzo, Cesar/0000-0003-3247-7412; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/0000-0001-5986-3685; Perez-Hedo, Meritxell/0000-0003-3411-0761; Urbaneja, Alberto/0000-0001-5986-3685","European Union through FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IRSES project [611810]; Conselleria d'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio de la Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat Valenciana; INTA-Argentina; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain; INIA SpainInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)","Funding for this research: European Union through FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IRSES project (APHIWEB; ID: 611810) and Conselleria d'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio de la Generalitat Valenciana.

These larvae live in water-filled holes in fallen and living trees, where they and three other common odonate species are the top predators. By mid wet season, M. coerulatus larvae were found in nearly half of all tree holes that harbored odonates. Although M. coerulatus were typically, but not always, eliminated from holes inhabited by larger heterospecifics, M. coerulatus were more likely to encounter conspecifics than other odonate species. Hole with less than 1 1 of water rarely contained more than a single larva. In large holes where M. coerulatus was the only odonate species present, multiple larvae coexisted at a density of one larva per 1-21 of water. There the absence of 2-4 of the 5 larval size classes, despite a continuous input of eggs, suggested that cannibalism was a common cause of mortality. The size of the final instar, which determined adult body size, was correlated positively with tree hole volume for male, but not female, larvae. Experiments showed that when two larvae were placed together in 0.4-1 holes with abundant tadpole prey, the larger larva killed the smaller one. Often the larva that was killed was not eaten. Small larvae were more tolerant of each other than were pairs of medium of large larvae. Before killing occurred, the presence of larger larvae reduced the growth of smaller individuals, relative to controls. 'Obligate' killing was density-dependent. In 3.0-1 holes with ad libitum prey, conspecific killing occurred until the larval density stabilized at one larva per 1-1.5 1, similar to the density found in large holes under field conditions, For M. coerulatus, cannibalism functions to reduce the number of potential competitors for food in addition to providing nutrition. When interactions between paired larvae in small holes were experimentally prevented, competition for food reduced the growth of one or both larvae relative to controls. Holes that were watered during the dry season supported larval densities similar to those in the wet season. Thus, dry season mortality could not be attributed to a decrease in available prey. Rather, M. coerulatus larvae could not survive more than 1 month of complete drying. Because the dry season typically lasts more than 6 weeks, habitat drying is a secondary source of mortality, affecting second- or third-generation larvae that fail to emerge before tree holes dry out completely.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST,BALBOA,PANAMA",,,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136",,,,42,87,94,3,29,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,1994,100,1-2,,,,,118,127,,10.1007/BF00317138,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PR645,WOS:A1994PR64500015,28307035,,,,2021-09-27,

We examined the effect of seed and seedling predation on the seedling recruitment of three tree species, Acer rubrum (red maple), Liriodendron tulipifera (yellow poplar), and Quercus rubra (northern red oak), over three years by manipulating seed and seedling exposure to predators under contrasting microsite conditions of shrub cover, leaf litter, and overstory canopy. Species rankings of seedling emergence were constant across microsites, regardless of exposure to seed predators, but varied across years. A. rubrum had the highest emergence probabilities across microsites in 1997, but Q. rubra had the highest emergence probabilities in 1999. Predators decreased seedling survival uniformly across species, but did not affect relative growth rates (RGRs). Q. rubra had the highest seedling survivorship across microsites, while L. tulipifera had the highest RGRs. Our results suggest that annual variability in recruitment success contributes more to seedling diversity than differential predation across microsites. We synthesized our results from separate seedling emergence and survival experiments to project seedling bank composition. With equal fecundity assumed across species, Q. rubra dominated the seedling bank, capturing 90% of the regeneration sites on average, followed by A. rubrum (8% of sites) and L. tulipifera (2% of sites). When seed abundance was weighted by species-specific fecundity, seedling bank composition was more diverse; L. tulipifera captured 62% of the regeneration sites, followed by A. rubrum (21% of sites) and Q. rubra (17% of sites). Tradeoffs between seedling performance and fecundity may promote the diversity of seedling regeneration by increasing the probability of inferior competitors capturing regeneration sites.","Univ Vermont, Dept Bot, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; Duke Univ, Univ Program Ecol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Beckage, B (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Bot, Marsh Life Sci Bldg, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Brian.Beckage@uvm.edu,,,,,,71,23,26,2,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2005,143,3,,,,,458,469,,10.1007/s00442-004-1815-9,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,918CT,WOS:000228517300014,15719246,,,,2021-09-27,

The susceptibility of A. gossypii to this insecticide was much lower than that of two other inhabiting aphids (Myzus persicae and Aulacorthum solani) and predators (Harmonia axyridis and Orius minutus), indicating that the resurgence of A. gossypii was probably caused by the elimination of natural enemies and competitors by this insecticide. In the field plot without insecticide application, there was no outbreak of A. gossypii (or other aphid species) observed due to suppression by indigenous predators (ex. ladybirds, lacewings, Orius bugs); e.g., the density of A. gossypii did not exceed 10 insects per compound leaf, and no other insect pests were conspicuous. Consequently, both the tuber yield and the starch value were comparable to those in the insecticide-treated plot. The indigenous predators inhabited the environment around the field over a wide area during the potato-growing season.

Despite the widespread assumption that macroalgae are able to out-compete corals for space, there have been very few experimental studies testing the nature of this interaction. This study compared the effects of a filamentous red alga, Anotrichium tenue, with those of mixed-species, filamentous algal turfs on massive Porites spp. corals on inshore reefs of the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We compared mortality of coral tissue in plots with A. tenue naturally present on live coral tissue, plots in which A. tenue was naturally present but experimentally removed, and plots where mixed algal turfs were naturally present but A. tenue was not. The results indicate that A. tenue killed coral tissue by active overgrowth. Removing the alga removed the effect. In contrast, general, mixed-species algal turfs did not cause any mortality of coral tissue. We suggest that 2 particular traits of A. tenue may facilitate its effects on the corals. First, unlike most filamentous turf species present, it was able to overgrow live coral tissue, perhaps due to allelochemical effects. Second, individual algal filaments trap relatively large amounts of mucus from the corals and of sediment, apparently increasing the damage to underlying coral tissue. Surveys indicated that A. tenue primarily affected massive Porites spp., that overgrowth effects were not site-specific, but that occurrence of infected corals was not widespread. In particular, distribution patterns were not consistent with an effect of terrestrial runoff. This study provides evidence of an exceptionally lethal effect on corals by a single species of filamentous alga, and emphasizes the species-specific nature of coral-algal competitive outcomes, even within a functional group.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; CRC Reef Res, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia","McCook, LJ (corresponding author), Hasanuddin Univ, Fac Marine Sci & Fisheries, El Segundo, CA 90245 USA.",l.mccook@gbrmpa.gov.au,"Jompa, Jamaluddin/AAD-9280-2021","Jompa, Jamaluddin/0000-0001-9740-333X",,,,39,64,69,2,22,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The impact of such changes on agricultural systems in mid- to high-latitude regions are predicted to be less severe than in low-latitude regions, and possibly even beneficial, although the influence of pests and diseases is rarely taken into account. Most studies have concluded that insect pests will generally become more abundant as temperatures increase, through a number of inter-related processes, including range extensions and phenological changes, as well as increased rates of population development, growth, migration and overwintering. A gradual, continuing rise in atmospheric CO2 will affect pest species directly (i.e. the CO2 fertilization effect) and indirectly (via interactions with other environmental variables). However, individual species responses to elevated CO2 vary: consumption rates of insect herbivores generally increase, but this does not necessarily compensate fully for reduced leaf nitrogen. The consequent effects on performance are strongly mediated via the host species. Some recent experiments under elevated CO2 have suggested that aphids may become more serious pests, although other studies have discerned no significant effects on sap-feeding homopterans. However, few, if any of these experiments have fully considered the effects on pest population dynamics. Climate change is also considered from the perspective of changes in the distribution and abundance of species and communities. Marked changes in the distribution of well-documented species - including Odonata, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera - in northwestern Europe, in response to unusually hot summers, provide useful indications of the potential effects of climate change. Migrant pests are expected to respond more quickly to climate change than plants, and may be able to colonize newly available crops/habitats. Range expansions, and the removal of edge effects, could result in the increased abundance of species presently near the northern limits of their ranges in the UK. However, barriers to range expansions, or shifts, may include biotic (competition, predation, parasitism and disease), as well as abiotic, factors. Climatic phenomena, ecosystem processes and human activities are interactive and interdependent, making long-term predictions extremely tenuous. Nevertheless, it appears prudent to prepare for the possibility of increases in the diversity and abundance of pest species in the UK, in the context of climate change.","MAFF, Cent Sci Lab, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England","Cannon, RJC (corresponding author), MAFF, Cent Sci Lab, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England.",r.cannon@csl.gov.uk,,,,,,127,228,252,4,195,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The difficulty of capturing food has rarely been included in foraging models, even when it is a potentially important modulator of time devoted to foraging. From the central place foraging and provisioning perspectives, it is posited that at high levels of prey selectivity, the time spent to capture prey is longer than at low levels of prey selectivity. Furthermore, in the case of carnivorous predators, it is thought that nutritional composition does not influence foraging strategies. To explore these issues, we investigated the influence of abundance, size, difficulty of capture, gross energy and nutritional composition (fat, protein, protein-fat ratio and amino acid contents) of prey species on the foraging behaviour of a predator species, the common kestrel Falco tinnunculus, in a region of high diversity of prey species. Our results show that capturability index and load-size explain the foraging behaviour of kestrels. Preferred prey take longer to be provisioned, both selectivity and capturability might explain this result.

In addition, the densities of larvae in laboratory experiments are often so high that there is competition for food. Published values for maximal clearance rates and estimated abundances of larvae suggest that these assumptions and experimental conditions are unrealistic for most marine larvae. For most ciliated larvae, maximum clearance rates are at most a few mi of water daily, and their estimated larval concentrations are at most one to several larvae per liter. Therefore these larvae appear to be too scarce for their grazing to affect their food supply. Larvae of most species are also scarce relative to co-occurring planktonic animals that feed on particles in the same size range. Larvae of many species are scarce relative to co-occurring larvae with a similar feeding apparatus. These observations suggest that larvae of most species have a negligible effect on their food supply. Exceptions could occur when a single species of larva dominates the zooplankton; such circumstances appear to be rare, although extreme aggregations of larvae dominated by a single species could be missed by pump or net samples. Analogous but more conjectural arguments can be made for density-dependent attraction of predators to larval prey. These inferences apply to single species, not to meroplanktonic larvae as a whole: in some coastal waters, larvae of benthic invertebrates comprise a large portion of the multicellular planktonic animals. Also, a species' larval growth may be food-limited in many waters, even when the abundance of food is independent of the abundance of its larvae.","UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT ZOOL, FRIDAY HARBOR, WA 98250 USA","Strathmann, RR (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON, FRIDAY HARBOR LABS, 620 UNIV RD, FRIDAY HARBOR, WA 98250 USA.",,,,,,,72,18,18,0,6,GAUTHIER-VILLARS/EDITIONS ELSEVIER,PARIS,"23 RUE LINOIS, 75015 PARIS, FRANCE",0399-1784,,,OCEANOL ACTA,Oceanol.

Brachionus angularis (Rotifera) is preferred in such studies because of their planktonic behavior, high fecundity, and absence of cryptic species. In this study, one-year zooplankton samples were collected twice a month from a subtropical lake and the roles of abiotic and biotic factors regulating the population dynamics of B. angularis were analyzed. The sampled B. angularis were composed of two discontinuous populations: 'summer and autumn' and 'spring and winter', segmented by high mixis rates. The 'summer and autumn' population had high egg ratios, but low egg volumes. Water temperature was the main factor driving temporal dynamics in density, thereby counteracting the negative effect of top-down force. Based on the synchronous dynamics of two fractions of chlorophyll-a, the densities of B. angularis, its potential competitors and predators, together with the reverse correlations between the egg ratio and population density, and Secchi-disk depth, we found that bottom-up and top-down forces were plausible factors regulating variations in population density in spring (March and April). However, the density peak of B. angularis in winter might be primarily ascribed to recruitment from the sediment. We further addressed the necessity for diverse evidence from the speciation of cryptic species, abundance, reproduction, and morphology, in understanding the population dynamics of a field rotifer population.","[Wen, Xin-Li; Xue, Ying-Hao; Zhang, Gen; Xiang, Xian-Ling; Xi, Yi-Long] Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Biot Environm & Ecol Safety Anhui Prov, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China; [Wen, Xin-Li; Xiang, Xian-Ling; Xi, Yi-Long] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Recovery & Reconstruct Deg, Wuhu, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Xue, Ying-Hao] Minist Agr, Rural Energy & Environm Agcy, Beijing, Peoples R China","Wen, XL; Xi, YL (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Biot Environm & Ecol Safety Anhui Prov, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China.",wenxinli1977@126.com; ylxi1965@126.com,"Xiang, Xian-Ling/Q-6388-2018","Xiang, Xian-Ling/0000-0002-1378-5877",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41877417]; Anhui Provincial Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1808085MC79]; Natural Science Foundation of Educational Committee of Anhui Province [KJ2017A320]; Foundation of Provincial Key Laboratories for Conservation and Utilization of Important Biological Resources in Anhui,"This work was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 41877417], the Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation [grant number 1808085MC79], Natural Science Foundation of Educational Committee of Anhui Province [grant number KJ2017A320], and the Foundation of Provincial Key Laboratories for Conservation and Utilization of Important Biological Resources in Anhui.",,50,2,2,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0270-5060,2156-6941,,J FRESHWATER ECOL,J.

We tested the hypothesis that in Neotropical humid sites, reproductive activity in sympatric species will vary in the time of occurrence so that there is no complete temporal overlap. We also investigated whether the length of the breeding season was associated to relative testes size as a proxy for male-male competition. We inferred reproductive phenology from seasonal variation in the number of sexually active individuals, their gonad developmental stage, and male vocal activity from January 2003 to March 2004. Our data do not support the hypothesis of temporal segregation in reproduction for this assemblage because we found a prolonged reproductive pattern in the five species, but there was decreased breeding intensity in the cooler months (November-February). This deduction is supported by a drop in the weight of the ovaries and the number of vitellogenic follicles, absence of mature females or reduction of their abundance, and disappearance of male vocal activity in the winter. We found differences in relative testes size among species, which were not related to differences in the length of the breeding season, but rather to interspecific differences in sex ratio.","[Bignotte-Giro, Irelis; Fong, Ansel G.] Museo Hist Nat Tomas Romay, Ctr Oriental Ecosistemas & Biodiversidad BIOECO, Santiago De Cuba 90100, Cuba; [Lopez-Iborra, German M.] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol IMEM Ramon Margalef, Apdo Correos 99, Alicante 03080, Spain; [Ramirez-Pinilla, Martha P.] Univ Ind Santander, Lab Biol Reprod Vertebrados, Bucaramanga 68001000, Colombia","Bignotte-Giro, I (corresponding author), Museo Hist Nat Tomas Romay, Ctr Oriental Ecosistemas & Biodiversidad BIOECO, Santiago De Cuba 90100, Cuba.",irelis@bioeco.cu,,,Declining Amphibian Population Task Force; Universidad de Alicante,"We thank R.

Competition has historically been viewed as the predominant process affecting plant community structure. In particular, it is often assumed that the dominant resident species is the superior competitor and therefore has large impacts on plant community diversity. This assumption, however, is seldom tested. As well, there are a variety of other processes such as dispersal limitation and seed predation that can influence community structure, although the relative importance of these processes in relation to competition from resident species is still unclear. 2. We examined how interspecific competition, dispersal limitation and post-dispersal seed predation by mice individually and interactively influenced the richness and diversity of local plant assemblages in grasslands of western Montana. 3. We added seeds of 20 mostly locally uncommon native species to subplots in and out of larger rodent exclosure plots. Using a 'species-blind' approach, we manipulated competition from resident plants in these subplots by removing the same amount of cover of one dominant species or several common species. 4. The species richness and diversity of local assemblages was higher in subplots with seed addition than without. Across all levels of the other treatments, average richness for subplots without competitor removal was lower than for competitor removal treatments. However, the removal of one locally dominant species had similar effects to removal of several common species. In contrast, preventing seed predation by mice did not have significant effects on richness. There were no significant interactions between the treatments. 5. Synthesis. Our results reveal a hierarchy of filters that determine local community structure. Many regionally rare species were dispersal limited and established after the seed addition, regardless of release from competition or the presence of seed predators. Subsequently, we found competitive equivalence between dominant and common species.","[Pinto, Sarah M.; Pearson, Dean E.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, Missoula, MT 59801 USA","Pinto, SM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",sarahmariannepinto@gmail.com,,,USDA Cooperative State ResearchUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-35101-16040]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0614406]; U.S. Bureau of Land Management,"We thank Ray Callaway, Winsor Lowe, Lisa Eby and Yvette Ortega for their extensive guidance and feedback.

However, regime shifts can occur even when feedbacks are not strong enough to cause ASS. We investigated the potential for ASS to explain transitions between dominance of an invasive species, rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), and native sunfishes (Lepomis spp.) in northern Wisconsin (USA) lakes. A rapid transition from Lepomis to rusty crayfish dominance occurred as rusty crayfish invaded Trout Lake, and the reverse transition resulted from an eight-year experimental removal of rusty crayfish from Sparkling Lake. We fit a stage-structured population model of species interactions to 31 years of time-series data from each lake. The model identified water level as an important driver, with drought conditions reducing rusty crayfish recruitment and allowing Lepomis dominance. The maximum-likelihood parameter estimates of the negative interaction between rusty crayfish and Lepomis led to ASS in the model, where each species was capable of excluding the other within a narrow range of environmental conditions. However, uncertainty in parameter estimates made it impossible to exclude the potential that rapid transitions were caused by a simpler threshold response lacking alternative equilibria. Simulated forward and backward transitions between species dominance occurred at different environmental conditions (i.e., hysteresis), even when the parameters used for simulation did not predict ASS as a result of slow species responses to environmental drivers. Thus, ASS are possible, but by no means certain, explanations for rapid transitions in this system, and our results highlight the difficulties associated with distinguishing ASS from other types of threshold responses. However, whether regime shifts are caused by ASS may be relatively unimportant in this system, as the range of conditions over which transitions occur is narrow, and under most conditions, the system is predicted to exist in only a single state.","[Hansen, Gretchen J.

ASSEMBLY RULES; FOOD-WEB; SPECIES COOCCURRENCE; GENERALIST PREDATORS; PTEROSTICHUS-MELANARIUS; INVERTEBRATE PREDATORS; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY; ALTERNATIVE PREY","In agricultural systems, polyphagous beetles and spiders are abundant components of the beneficial arthropod community. Although data on the dietary ranges of these groups is increasing, remarkably little is understood regarding how individuals interact with their prey at small spatial scales. We demonstrate the utility of a spatially-explicit network model that integrates predator behaviour using predator-prey co-occurrences. Three co-occurrence matrices, one each for June, July and August, were generated using Vortis suction sample data collected from an 80 point grid imposed on a field of winter wheat. Heuristic predator-prey linkages, based on positive spatial co-occurrence, were imposed on these three matrices to create networks. It was found that primary consumers were highly aggregated and showed a strong tendency to co-occur. This contrasted with patterns of predator-predator or predator-prey co-occurrences that either aggregated to their prey or were weak and more scattered. These patterns could not be explained by either competition for resources or body size differences. Procrustean methods indicated that the networks were temporally dynamic, consistently achieving rates of turnover > 60%. A negative relationship was found between decreasing predator-prey co-occurrence in the network and the number of prey positives in the guts of those predators. For large polyphagous beetles, the closer they were to their prey at the field scale, the more likely they were to have eaten them. This simple underlying relationship suggests that spatial co-occurrence networks can be used to predict feeding behaviour and could make a valuable contribution to food web structuring.","[Bell, James R.; Bohan, David A.] Rothamsted Res, Plant & Invertebrate Ecol, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Bell, James R.; King, R.

We studied the impact of a social parasite - a slavemaking ant - on host ant communities using two complementary field manipulations. In the first experiment, we analysed the effect of social parasite presence on host populations in one habitat. In a second experiment, conducted in two habitats, we used a cross-fostering design, analysing the effect of sympatric and allopatric social parasites. In the first experiment, host colonies benefited to some extent from residing in parasite-free areas, showing increased total production. Yet, in the second experiment, host colonies in plots containing social parasites were more productive, and this effect was most evident in response to allopatric social parasites. We propose several explanations for these inconsistent results, which are related to environmental variability. The discrepancies between the two habitats can be explained well by ecological variation as a result of differences in altitudes and climate. For example, ant colonies in the colder habitat were larger and, for one host species, colonies were more often polygynous. In addition, our long-term documentation - a total of four measurements of community structure in 6 years - showed temporal variation in abundance and life-history traits of ant colonies, unrelated to the manipulations.

We assessed: 1) how M. rubra process the myrmecochorous diapsores (seeds and elaiosome as a single dispersal unit transported by ants) in comparison with native ants; 2) its preference for common native and invasive diaspore species relative to native ants; 3) how far they disperse diaspores in the field; and 4) the diaspore removal rate by invertebrates and vertebrates in infested areas compared to noninvaded sites. Field experiments demonstrated higher diaspore removal rates over a 10-min and 24-h period by M. rubra compared to native ants. M. rubra's diaspore dispersal distance was 40% greater compared to native ants. In two of three laboratory studies and one field study, there was no significant difference between the seed species which M. rubra and native ants selected. Our data suggest no long-term deleterious effects of M. rubra's invasion on diaspore dispersal in the Maine plant community that is comprised of both native and invasive species. This implies that M. rubra benefits from the myrmechorous plant species' diaspores by increasing their dispersal range away from the parent plant and potentially reducing seed predation. However, it is not known whether the fact that the native ant fauna and M. rubra are attracted to the same plant species' diaspores creates a high level of competition between the ants with deleterious effects on the native ant community.","[Gammans, Nicola] Stirling Univ, Beta Ctr, Bumblebee Conservat Trust, Innovat Pk, Stirling FK9 4NF, Scotland; [Drummond, Frank; Groden, Eleanor] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Drummond, Frank] Univ Maine, Cooperat Extens, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Drummond, F (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA.; Drummond, F (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Cooperat Extens, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",fdrummond@maine.edu,,,U.S. Geological Survey/National Park Service grant [ACAD-00064]; Hatch through the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station [ME0-21505]; Maine Agricultural Experiment Station [3600],"We would like to thank Beth Choate, Katie McPhee, Carrie Graham, Judy Collins, Sara Hoffmann, and Erica Davis for their help with the field and laboratory work.

We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the ecological impacts of terrestrial invertebrate invaders and to test how impacts are modulated by the invader's trophic position, habitat attributes (i.e. insularity and disturbance) and the study methodology (observational versus experimental). LocationGlobal. MethodsWe investigated the effects of terrestrial invertebrate invaders on populations, communities and ecosystems by conducting a random effects meta-analysis using 112 articles reporting data from 710 field and laboratory studies. The analysis included 16 insect, 11 earthworm, 7 slug and 1 nematode invaders. ResultsOn average, across invaders, the presence of invaders reduced plant fitness (52%), animal diversity (33%) and animal abundance (29%). Leaf litter decomposition was 41% higher in the presence of invaders, while other ecosystem-level variables such as nutrient cycling were not affected in a consistent direction. Invasive predators and detritivores decreased animal abundance, whereas herbivores and omnivores had limited impacts. Single invaders increased soil nitrogen pools while multiple species did not. Insularity and disturbance did not affect the magnitude of the impacts significantly, mainly because there was a large variation among studies. Main conclusionsOverall, our study indicates that terrestrial invertebrate invaders have significant consistent effects on populations, communities and ecosystems, with islands and disturbed sites not being more prone to impacts. However, effects vary considerably depending on the type of impact being examined and the trophic position of the invader. There is no evidence that invaders cause larger impacts when multiple species of invaders, rather than single invaders, are involved.","[Cameron, Erin K.; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Metapopulat Res Ctr, POB 65 Viikinkaari 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Vila, Montserrat] CSIC, EBD, Avda Amer Vespucio S-N Isla de la Cartuja, Seville 41092, Spain","Cameron, EK (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Metapopulat Res Ctr, POB 65 Viikinkaari 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",erin.cameron@helsinki.fi,"Cabeza, Mar/ABC-4297-2020","Cabeza, Mar/0000-0002-7410-7631","COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [TD1209]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [263995, 250444, 285882, 257686]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness projects FLORMAS [CGL 2012-33801]; Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence [SEV-2012-0262]","E.K.C. acknowledges a Short Term Scientific Mission grant from COST Action TD1209: Alien Challenge and funding from the Academy of Finland (263995, 250444, 285882).

Few studies have examined communities in which all three components-top predator, intermediate predators, and prey-occur at low densities; such disturbed systems are commonplace in Asia. We tested predictions from intraguild predation theory at a site where low density tigers (top predator), leopards and dholes (intermediate predators) competed for scarce prey. We employed occupancy modeling using sign surveys and camera trapping to investigate prey selection and spatial co-occurrence. Tiger and leopard occupancy matched the availability of their respective prey species, but leopard avoided pigs-a favored prey of tiger. Leopard and dhole had low rates of co-occurrence with tiger, and their detection probabilities were 47-52% lower in tiger-occupied open habitat (compared to closed), despite suitable prey there. Tiger occupancy was highest in prey-rich zones, whereas dholes were concentrated in a prey-poor zone where tigers were scarce, suggestive of mesopredator release. Activity periods of leopard and dhole (diurnal) were significantly different from tiger (nocturnal). In sum, tiger distribution appeared to be driven solely by prey availability, whereas leopard and dhole seemed to be influenced by prey availability and avoidance of tigers, mediated by habitat structure. Results agree with predictions that under intraguild predation the dominant predator's distribution matches its resources, whereas intermediate predators trade-off food and safety. Knowledge of habitat-mediated risk effects could inform recovery efforts for low density tigers facing potential exploitation competition from more numerous leopards and dholes.

This study tested the effect of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) strips on aphid and ladybird populations in adjacent winter wheat fields. The field experiment was conducted in three ryegrass-margin wheat plots and three control plots in 2010 in North China. In spring, the same aphid species, Sitobion miscanthi (Takahashi), was found in both the ryegrass strips and wheat plots. The population density of ladybirds in the ryegrass strips (3.5 +/- 0.9/m2) was significantly higher than in the wheat plots (1.5 +/- 0.5/m2). We cut the ryegrass, forcing the ladybirds to migrate to the wheat fields. Three and eight days after cutting the ryegrass, the aphid numbers in the ryegrass-margin wheat plots decreased significantly: they were 19.9% and 53.6%, respectively, lower than in control plots. In the early period of ladybird population development, the percentage of larvae was greater in the ryegrass-margin wheat plots than in controls, and the peak number of pupae in the ryegrass-margin wheat plots occurred 5 days earlier than in the control plots. The results suggest that ryegrass strips may promote the development of ladybird populations. Cutting ryegrass can manipulate ladybirds to enhance biological aphid control in wheat fields. The efficiency of this management approach is discussed.","[Dong, Zhao-Ke; Gao, Feng-Juan; Zhang, Run-Zhi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Dong, Zhao-Ke; Gao, Feng-Juan] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Run-Zhi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Zhang, RZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, 1 Beichen W Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhangrz@ioz.ac.cn,"Dong, Zhaoke/AAI-8334-2020; Dong, Zhaoke/N-8435-2015","Dong, Zhaoke/0000-0002-4462-1162; Dong, Zhaoke/0000-0002-4462-1162","National Science and Technology Department Support Project [2009CB119204, 2008BADA5B05]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Major Project [KSCX1-YW-09-06]","The authors are grateful to Prof. Zhu Ouyang and Mr. Nong Zhu for assistance with the experiments.

It suggests that specialized natural enemies decrease offspring survival at high densities beneath parents, giving locally rarer species an advantage. This mechanism, in its original form, assumes that density dependence is overcompensating: mortality must be disproportionately high at the highest densities, with few offspring recruiting below their parents. We tested this assumption using parallel shadehouse and field density-series experiments on seedlings of a tropical tree, Pleradenophora longicuspis. We found strong, overcompensating mortality driven by fungal pathogens, causing 90% (shadehouse) or 100% (field) mortality within 4 weeks of germination, and generating a negative relationship between initial and final seedling densities. Fungicide treatment led to much lower, density-independent, mortality. Overcompensating mortality was extremely rapid, and could be missed without detailed monitoring. Such dynamics may prevent dead trees from being replaced by conspecifics, promoting coexistence as envisioned by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.","[Bagchi, Robert; Gallery, Rachel E.; Lewis, Owen T.; Gripenberg, Sofia; Narayan, Lakshmi] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Swinfield, Tom; Freckleton, Robert P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Bagchi, R (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Biol & Biomed Sci, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",bagchi.r@gmail.com,"Swinfield, Tom/AAA-1518-2020; Bagchi, Robert/F-1732-2011; Lewis, Owen T/B-9531-2011; Gallery, Rachel E/I-2169-2014; Swinfield, Tom/G-4315-2010; Freckleton, Rob P/B-6455-2013","Swinfield, Tom/0000-0001-9354-5090; Bagchi, Robert/0000-0003-4035-4105; Freckleton, Robert/0000-0002-8338-864X; Lewis, Owen/0000-0001-7935-6111; Gallery, Rachel/0000-0002-9159-8778",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/D010721/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,50,141,145,2,119,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Ecological interactions can modify the influences of abiotic factors both by further constraining distribution and abundance due to competitive or predatory interactions and by expanding habitat distribution or abundance due to beneficial interactions that ameliorate otherwise limiting circumstances. It is likely that the importance of ecological interactions has been greatly underestimated because they tend to only be revealed by experiments and time-series observations in the field. Experiments have revealed opportunistic predation to be a primary enforcer of sponge distribution boundaries that coincide with habitat boundaries in several systems. Within habitats, by contrast, dramatic effects of predators on sponge populations seem to occur primarily in cases of unusually high recruitment rates or unusually low mortality rates for the predators, which are often specialists on the sponge species affected. Competitive interactions have been demonstrated to diminish populations or exclude sponge species from a habitat in only a few cases. Cases in which competitive interactions have appeared obvious have often turned out to be neutral or even beneficial interactions when observed over time. Especially striking in this regard are sponge sponge interactions in dense sponge-dominated communities, which may promote the continued coexistence of all participating species. Mutualistic symbioses of sponges with other animals, plants, or macroalgae have been demonstrated to increase abundance, habitat distribution, and diversity of all participants. Symbiotic microbes can enhance sponge distribution and abundance but also render their hosts more vulnerable to environmental changes. And while photosynthetic symbionts can boost growth and excavation rates for some sponge hosts, in other cases sponge growth proceeds as well or even better in diminished light. Metrics chosen for evaluating sponge abundance make a substantial difference in interpretation of data comparing between different sites, or over time at the same site. In most cases, evaluating abundance by volume or biomass allows more ecologically meaningful interpretation of influences on distribution and abundance than does evaluating abundance by numbers of individuals or area covered. Accurate identification of species, and understanding how they are related within higher taxa, is essential. Studies in every habitat have illustrated the great power of experimental manipulations, and of time-series observations of sponge individuals, for understanding the processes underlying observed patterns; in many cases, these processes have been revealed to be ecological interactions.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Wulff, J (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",wulff@bio.fsu.edu,,,,,,246,75,76,2,94,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-2881,,978-0-12-387787-1,ADV MAR BIOL,Adv.

However, in the case of introduced predators, prey populations might lack the behavioural traits to escape predation. We studied responses of native voles to removal of an alien predator, the American mink (Mustela vison), on small islands in the outer archipelago of the Baltic Sea, SW Finland. Voles were live-trapped on 10 manipulation and 10 control islands in a grid of 50 traps per island. Microhabitat characteristics around trap locations were classified to four types reflecting risks of mink predation and suitability for foraging: grassy patches, juniper bushes, berries and open habitats. Microhabitat use of voles was analysed in relation to microhabitat availability. Field voles (Microtus agrestis) responded to the presence of mink with a microhabitat shift from open grassy habitats to juniper bushes. Bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), however, avoided juniper in the presence of mink and were significantly more often captured in juniper in removal areas. Use of open habitats by bank voles was also affected by their own density on islands. These divergent results may reflect species-specific differences in the social system, diet selection and escape behaviour of voles, but provide novel evidence for a rnicrohabitat shift of native prey aninials induced by an alien predator.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Fey, K (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",karen.fey@utu.fi; p.banks@unsw.edu.au; erkki.korpimaki@utu.fi,,"Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495",,,,56,13,14,0,9,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,UNIV HELSINKI,"P O BOX 26, FI-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND",0003-455X,1797-2450,,ANN ZOOL FENN,Ann.

(Fabaceae)], coccinellids forage on aphids most of the time on the foliage and carabids on the ground. The result of their combined effect can be synergistic, additive, or antagonistic, but this may depend on the prey density and interacting predatory species. In this study, we first determined, under laboratory conditions, the relative tendencies of Therioaphis trifolii (Monell), Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), and Aphis craccivora Koch (all Hemiptera: Aphididae) to drop in the presence and absence of two predators: Eriopis connexa (Germ) and Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (both Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). These experiments showed that T. trifolii and A. pisum dropped more frequently than A. craccivora, and dropping was more frequent in the presence of H. variegata. We also determined the functional responses to aphid densities of five beetle species (Coleoptera: Carabidae) commonly found in alfalfa fields in Chile. All carabid species consumed aphids, with Trirammatus aerea (Dejean) being one of the most voracious. Then, we tested the hypothesis that the interactions between both coccinellid species and T. aerea would be antagonistic at low prey densities, because of competition or intraguild predation, and synergistic as prey density increases. For this, we recorded aphid consumption when predators were alone, or in combinations of a foliar and a ground predator, for five prey densities. For all predators and combinations, aphid consumption increased continuously with aphid density, and more prey were eaten when a foliar- and a ground-foraging predator were combined than when either predator was present. But, contrary to our expectations, we found that the interaction of these foliar- and ground-foraging predators was additive for all prey densities. Our results suggest that coexistence of these species would not interfere with aphid biological control in alfalfa.","[Grez, Audrey A.; Mancilla, Angelica] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Santiago, Chile; [Zaviezo, Tania] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Santiago, Chile","Grez, AA (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Casilla 2,Correo 15, Santiago, Chile.",agrez@uchile.cl,"Zaviezo, Tania/F-3099-2014; Zaviezo, Tania/AAM-5707-2020; Grez, Audrey A./G-8677-2013","Zaviezo, Tania/0000-0002-4993-0386; Zaviezo, Tania/0000-0002-4993-0386; Grez, Audrey A./0000-0002-6907-1283",FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1070412],"We thank Elizabeth Gazzano, Barbara Viera, and Francisca Morales for their help in collecting and maintaining the insects in the laboratory, and two anonymous referees who made significant contributions to this paper.

We developed molecular methods to study adult D. suzukii gut content in order to understand its feeding habits. We designed and verified two primer pairs specific for either blueberries or blackberries and used a qPCR melt curve analysis to determine whether we can detect the presence or absence of berry feeding by adult flies. In a laboratory assay, the blueberry fly meal DNA can be detected for longer periods than the blackberry meal DNA. Generally, female gut contents are less variable than male gut contents. We also tested recently emerged flies that were not fed as adults but developed as larvae in either blueberries or blackberries. Some adult flies from each fruit had detectable fruit DNA in their gut, which could be due to pupal meconium feeding after emergence. Next, we aimed to test the primers in the field to develop techniques to track fruit feeding by D. suzukii in its natural field environment. First, to identify the most appropriate collection method, we determined how long we could detect fruit DNA, using previously developed primers within D. suzukii gut preserved in four types of trap fluid in the laboratory. The likelihood of detecting blackberry DNA differed by day, trap fluid, and between sexes. For the blueberry primer, the possibility of detecting blueberry DNA differed by trap fluid only. Based on those results, we used RV antifreeze with a Scentry SWD lure in field trials at two research station locations, one containing blackberries and one with blueberries. We established transects away from each fruit planting and collected up to 120 total flies at each point along transects. There were no significant differences in the number of flies containing berry DNA among collection points along the transect in both locations. These results suggest that adult flies move between crop and non-crop habitats and may not be highly dependent on fruit food resources.","[Kraft, Laura J.; Sit, Tim L.; Burrack, Hannah J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Diepenbrock, Lauren M.] Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA; [Ashrafi, Hamid; Aryal, Rishi; Fernandez, Gina E.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Raleigh, NC USA","Kraft, LJ (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",laurajkraft@gmail.com,,"Burrack, Hannah/0000-0002-8460-8245; Fernandez, Gina/0000-0002-9295-2687; Ashrafi, Hamid/0000-0002-2094-2367; Sit, Tim/0000-0001-7302-823X",USDA NIFA Specialty Crop Research Initiative [2015-51181-24252],Funding.

Ants interact with a diversity of organisms. These interactions, coupled with their abundance, cause ants to have ecologically important effects across multiple trophic levels. 2. Empirical study of ant nutritional ecology has led to the prediction that a macronutrient imbalance will affect ant behaviour and interspecific interactions that underlie these broad-scale effects. Excess carbohydrate relative to protein is predicted to increase ant aggressiveness, predatory tendency and foraging activity, and to decrease collection of hemipteran honeydew and plant nectar. 3. In field experiments conducted in 2009 and 2010, captive colony fragments of a native ant, Formica podzolica (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), were provided with either simulated prey or carbohydrate solution ad libitum. Foraging behaviours and interactions with flowers, myrmecophilous aphids and aphid natural enemies on wild-grown plants were documented. 4. Strong effects of macronutrient imbalance on foraging manifested quickly and consistently across colonies; in accordance with predictions, prey-fed foragers collected both honeydew and floral nectar, whereas carbohydrate-fed ants ceased collecting these resources. Counter to predictions, carbohydrate-fed ants dramatically lowered their activity levels and did not prey upon aphids. 5. Ants had no effect on aphid enemies in 2009, when the latter were relatively rare, but decreased their abundance in 2010. Despite this protection, the net effect of ants on aphids was negative (measured only in 2009). Prey-fed ants demonstrated a strong preference for honeydew over floral nectar, thus demonstrating that a macronutrient imbalance may lead to different interactions with similar resources. 6.

Predator diversity alterations have been observed in most ecosystems as a result of the loss and/or addition of species. This has implications for predator-prey dynamics as non-trophic interactions among predators, so-called multiple predator effects (MPE), are known to influence predation success. In addition, there is often a density-dependent relationship between prey availability and prey consumption (functional response). While MPE investigations are common in the literature, functional responses have rarely been incorporated into this field of predation ecology. 2. Here, we outline an experimental procedure that incorporates functional responses into multiple predator effect studies. Using three fish species with different functional traits as model predators (bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, southern mouthbrooder Pseudocrenilabrus philander and banded tilapia Tilapia sparrmanii), we assess intra-and interspecific predator interaction outcomes on predator-prey dynamics. This was done by contrasting observed functional responses of heterospecific and conspecific combinations of predators with expected responses based on those of individual predators. 3. Multipredator combinations produced variable results. Bluegill were the only species in which observed conspecific multipredator functional responses matched those of expected based on individual performance (prey risk neutral effects). In contrast, prey risk reduction was observed for both mouthbrooder and tilapia conspecific multipredator trials. Heterospecific combinations revealed strong prey risk reduction effects for mouthbrooder-tilapia and bluegill-tilapia trials, while mouthbrooder-bluegill multipredator functional responses combined additively. These results are discussed within the context of behavioural traits of the species and the development of a trait-based predictive framework. 4. Using a functional response approach allowed for the assessment of multiple predator effects across a range of prey densities. We propose that the incorporation of within-guild predator combinations into classic functional response investigations will enhance predictive capacity development in competition and predation ecology.","[Wasserman, Ryan J.; Ellender, Bruce R.; Weyl, Olaf L.

In North America, the coccinellid community is increasingly dominated by exotic species, and the abundance of some native species has declined dramatically since the 1980s. Several hypotheses have been proposed to describe the mechanism of invasion coupled with native species declines, e.g. vacant niche exploitation, intraguild predation, competitive exploitation and habitat compression. We analyze a 24-year dataset of coccinellid community structure in southwestern Michigan to elucidate the most likely mechanism(s) of native coccinellid decline and implications for their conservation. Correlation analyses indicated that impact of exotic species on native coccinellids varies with their degree of interaction. Although several native species were observed to be in numerical decline, only Adalia bipunctata and Coleomegilla maculata had declines that were statistically significant. The magnitude of decline in these two species varied with the degree of dietary overlap with invaders, thus their decline is most likely driven by competitive exploitation. Habitat use patterns by some native species (A. bipunctata and Coccinella trifasciata) changed during years when the exotic Harmonia axyridis reached high numbers, lending support to the habitat compression hypothesis, where native species survive in ancestral (i.e. natural or semi-natural) habitats when invaders dominate cultivated habitats. Coccinellid communities occurring in semi-natural forested habitats were unique in both composition and variability from those occurring in cultivated habitats. Such semi-natural habitats can act as refuges for native coccinellids and may play a role in maintaining the functional resilience of coccinellid communities.","[Bahlai, Christine A.; Landis, Douglas A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ctr Integrated Plant Syst Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Colunga-Garcia, Manuel] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Gage, Stuart H.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Bahlai, CA (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ctr Integrated Plant Syst Lab, Room 204,578 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",cbahlai@msu.edu,"Landis, Douglas A./L-7991-2019; Bahlai, Christie/L-5500-2019","Bahlai, Christie/0000-0002-8937-8709",National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research program Grant [1027253]; Michigan State University AgBioResearch; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1027253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"The authors would like to thank Aaron Fox, Rufus Isaacs, Helen Roy and William Snyder for helpful comments offered on an earlier draft of this manuscript, as well as the input of two anonymous reviewers.

Where habitats occur as a mosaic, variation in connectivity among patches influences both local species richness and composition, and connectivity is a key conservation concern in fragmented landscapes. Similarly, availability of limiting resources frequently determines species coexistence or exclusion. For primarily cursorial arthropods like ants, gaps between neighboring trees are a significant barrier to movement through the forest canopy. Competition for limited resources such as nest sites also promotes antagonistic interactions. Lianas (woody vines) connect normally isolated neighboring tree crowns and often have hollow stems inhabited by ants. We used two large-scale liana-removal experiments to determine how connectivity and nest site availability provided by lianas affect arboreal ant species richness, species composition, and beta-diversity in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. Removing lianas from a tree crown reduced ant species richness up to 35%, and disproportionately affected species that require large foraging areas. Adding artificial connectivity to trees mitigated the effects of liana removal. Ant colonization of artificial nests was higher (73% occupied) in trees without lianas vs. trees with lianas (28% occupied). However, artificial nests typically were colonized by existing polydomous, resident ant species. As a result, nest addition did not affect ant community structure. Collectively, these results indicate that lianas are important to the maintenance of arboreal ant diversity specifically by providing connectivity among neighboring tree crowns. Anticipated increases in liana abundance in this forest could increase the local (tree-level) species richness of arboreal ants, with a compositional bias toward elevating the density of broad-ranging specialist predators.","[Adams, Benjamin J.] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Urban Nat Res Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Adams, Benjamin J.; Yanoviak, Stephen P.] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Schnitzer, Stefan A.] Marquette Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Schnitzer, Stefan A.; Yanoviak, Stephen P.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama","Yanoviak, SP (corresponding author), Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.; Yanoviak, SP (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama.",steve.yanoviak@louisville.edu,,"Adams, Benjamin/0000-0002-5857-175X; Yanoviak, Stephen/0000-0001-6425-1413","Carl C.

The anurans coexist in permanent ponds, which sometimes contain high densities of A. junius. Laboratory experiments indicated that in the absence of the predator, the two species were similar in competitive abilities and grew at virtually identical rates. In the presence of caged A. junius, however, the bullfrog grew to be larger and the green frog much smaller than when the predator was absent. Both species reacted to the presence of A. junius by reducing activity and altering space use. I argue that the reductions in activity in the presence of the predator affected the two species differently, which in turn changed competitive interactions. I discuss the relation between activity level and competitive ability, and the potential for predators to alter competitive relations by affecting activity levels of syntopic species (a higher order interaction). Vulnerability to predators also increases with activity, and I discuss the implications of an activity-mediated trade-off between growth rate and predation risk to interactions among anuran larvae.

Most efforts in this area have focused on the density-mediated, or lethal effects, of predators on prey density. Recently, there has been growing interest in trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs): the presence of a predator in the environment influences the interaction between two other species (prey and their resource) by altering a trait of the prey species. For example, waterborne cues released by predators can cause changes in prey species behavior, such as feeding rates, thereby altering the impact of the prey species on their resources. Thus, TMIIs represent the non-lethal effects of predators that contrast with the more traditional emphasis on lethal indirect effects. Marine ecologists are just beginning to explore the role of TMIIs in their systems. We examined whether risk cues released by a ubiquitous crab predator (Carcinus maenas) influence the abundance of two dominant species in the rocky intertidal zone (barnacles [Semibalanus balanoides] and fucoid algae [Ascophyllum nodostan]) by altering the. behavior of two of its snail prey (Nucella lapillus and Littorina littorea). We found that the presence of green crab risk cues can have strong cascading indirect effects on the abundance of barnacles and fucoid algae. N. lapillus exposed to risk cues consumed up to 29% fewer barnacles compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues, whereas L. littorea exposed to risk cues consumed 459% fewer fucoids compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues. These cascading interactions appear to reflect suppression of snail feeding by predator risk cues. In both food chains, snails exhibited more refuge-seeking behavior and grew less in the presence of risk cues. Our experiments suggest that TMIIs may have an important and underappreciated influence on species interactions that shape community dynamics on rocky intertidal shores.","Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA; Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Trussell, GC (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.",g.trussell@neu.edu,"Trussell, Geoffrey/AAQ-9165-2020",,,,,100,201,204,2,177,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2003,84,3,,,,,629,640,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0629:TMEIRI]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,656VF,WOS:000181629500016,,,,,2021-09-27,

YOY of both species also showed decreased feeding rates, as did V. hispanica adults. Adult V. hispanica also were more aggressive themselves and had their reproductive behaviour disrupted. Cases of eastern mosquitofish predation on small A. iberus were also observed. The occurrence and intensity of these potentially harmful effects, however, seemed to be modulated by water temperature, reproductive condition, relative size of the interacting fishes and species-specific habitat preferences. Thus, aggression almost disappeared at low water temperatures. Valencia hispanica and eastern mosquitofish used similar vertical positions in the water column and this apparently increased the frequency of their interactions. In contrast, A. iberus preferred positions closer to the bottom than the other two species and this vertical segregation appeared to lead to less direct interaction with eastern mosquitofish. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, under semi-natural conditions, the presence of eastern mosquitofish resulted in an almost 70% reduction in the number of offspring produced by A. iberus. The addition of extra, non-breeding males of A. iberus had no significant effect. YOY A. iberus from cages with eastern mosquitofish or extra males were significantly smaller (c. I mm, or 8% shorter) than those from cages without additional fish. Results for V hispanica were not conclusive, as very few YOY were recovered. In contrast, eastern mosquitofish did not affect the survivorship of breeding adults of both native species. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Bunchgrass seedlings face additional pressures from both livestock grazing and barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs), which infect both young and established grasses throughout the state. Previous work suggested that B/CYDVs could mediate apparent competition between invasive exotic grasses and native bunchgrasses in California. To investigate the potential significance of virus-mediated mortality for early survivorship of bunchgrass seedlings, we compared the separate and combined effects of virus infection, competition and simulated grazing in a field experiment. We infected two species of young bunchgrasses that show different sensitivity to B/CYDV infection, subjected them to competition with three different densities of exotic annuals crossed with two clipping treatments, and monitored their growth and first-year survivorship. Although virus infection alone did not reduce first-year survivorship, it halved the survivorship of bunchgrasses competing with exotics. Within an environment in which competition strongly reduces seedling survivorship (as in natural grasslands), virus infection therefore has the power to cause additional seedling mortality and alter patterns of establishment. Surprisingly, clipping did not reduce bunchgrass survivorship further, but rather doubled it and disproportionately increased survivorship of infected bunchgrasses. Together with previous work, these findings show that B/CYDVs can be potentially powerful elements influencing species interactions in natural grasslands. More generally, our findings demonstrate the potential significance of multitrophic interactions in virus ecology. Although sometimes treated collectively as plant 'predators', viruses and herbivores may exert influences that are distinctly different, even counteracting.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Malmstrom, CM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",carolynm@msu.edu,,,,,,54,51,54,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Amphibians occupy rice fields throughout Asia and South America, but little is known about their functional role in the rice ecosystem. We conducted field surveys in Los Banos, Philippines over two separate rainy seasons (2015 and 2017) to determine whether native Luzon wart frogs and invasive cane toads consume rice pests, and if so, which species was more effective in doing so. We also examined diet composition to test whether the two species compete for food resources in rice fields. We found that despite smaller body sizes, the Luzon wart frog consumed the same total mass of prey as the cane toad (although it consumed fewer total prey items), and that pests made up the largest proportion (54.1%) of its total diet. In contrast, the majority (89.4%) of the cane toad's diet consisted of beneficial arthropod predators. Taxonomic analyses of diet composition and breadth revealed that the diet of Luzon wart frog was distinct from that of the cane toad, although there was overlap, and that both species consumed diverse array of prey. Taken together, these data suggest adult Luzon wart frogs may provide effective pest control services, and that they may not be in direct competition over food resources with adult cane toads in rice fields. We also present the first evidence suggesting that cane toads may indirectly damage rice crops by consuming beneficial predators integral to the function of lowland rice ecosystems. We suggest that rice agro-ecosystems should be managed to promote species such as the native Luzon wart frog, and to reduce populations of the introduced cane toad in order to safeguard native biodiversity while simultaneously improving yields and reducing insecticide input.","[Shuman-Goodier, Molly E.; Diaz, Mildred I.; Propper, Catherine R.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Shuman-Goodier, Molly E.; Almazan, Maria Liberty; Singleton, Grant R.; Hadi, Buyung A.

Recent research shows that exotic carnivores negatively affect the distribution and abundance of the native and endangered carnivores of Madagascar. In this study, we provide information about the frequency and distribution of interactions between exotic (dogs and cats) and native carnivores (Eupleridae) in the Betampona Natural Reserve (BNR), Madagascar, using noninvasive camera trap surveys. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) were the most frequently detected carnivore species within the BNR, and we found that indirect interactions between exotic and native carnivores were frequent (n = 236). Indirect interactions were more likely to occur near the research station (incidence rate ratio = 0.91), which may constitute a disease transmission hot spot for carnivores at BNR. The intervals between capture of native and exotic carnivores suggest that there is potential for pathogen transmission between species in BNR. These capture intervals were significantly shorter near the edge of the reserve (P = 0.04). These data could be used to implement biosecurity measures to monitor interactions and prevent disease transmission between species at the domestic animal and wildlife interface.","[Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa; Parker, Patricia G.] Univ Missouri St Louis, Dept Biol, One Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa; Parker, Patricia G.] Univ Missouri St Louis, Whitney R Harris World Ecol Ctr, One Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa; Andrianalizah, Hertz] Univ Antananarivo, Dept Enseignement Sci & Med Vet, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa] St Louis Zoo, Madagascar Fauna & Flora Grp, One Govt Dr, St Louis, MO USA; [Farris, Zach J.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Parker, Patricia G.] St Louis Zoo, One Govt Dr, St Louis, MO USA","Rasambainarivo, F (corresponding author), Univ Missouri St Louis, Dept Biol, One Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.; Rasambainarivo, F (corresponding author), Univ Missouri St Louis, Whitney R Harris World Ecol Ctr, One Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.; Rasambainarivo, F (corresponding author), Univ Antananarivo, Dept Enseignement Sci & Med Vet, Antananarivo, Madagascar.; Rasambainarivo, F (corresponding author), St Louis Zoo, Madagascar Fauna & Flora Grp, One Govt Dr, St Louis, MO USA.",ftrz98@umsl.edu,"Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa/AAJ-5285-2021; Farris, Zach J./AAW-6579-2020","Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa/0000-0002-7744-9477",Saint Louis Zoo Field Research for Conservation Program; Whitney Harris World Ecology Center; Madagascar Fauna and Flora Group; Rufford Small Grant Foundation,"We would like to thank the Madagascar National Parks (MNP) and the CAFF/CORE committee for permission to conduct this research, the Madagascar Institute for Conservation of Tropical Ecosystem (MICET) and the Madagascar Fauna and Flora Group for logistical assistance in Madagascar, Natacha Rasolozaka, Andriamihajarivo Mamy Navalona, Victorice and Flavien for field assistance.

Since the late 2000s, this species has been commonly considered one of the most abundant aphid predators in most Western European countries. In spite of the large amount of research on H. axyridis, information concerning its relative abundance in agroecosystems is lacking. This study aims to evaluate the abundance of H. axyridis within the aphidophage community in four crops situated in southern Belgium: wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (Poales: Poaceae), corn, Zea mays, potato, Solanum tuberosum (Solanales: Solanaceae), and broad bean Vicia faba (Fabales: Fabaceae). In order to assess the species diversity, the collected data were analyzed by considering (1) the species richness and (2) the evenness according to the Shannon diversity index. Eleven aphidophages were observed in every inventoried agroecosystem, including five abundant species: three coccinellids, the seven-spotted ladybug, Coccinella septempunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), the 14-spotted Ladybird, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata, and H. axyridis; one hoverfly, the marmalade hoverfly, Episyrphus balteatus De Geer (Diptera: Syrphidae); and one lacewing, the common green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea Stephens sensu lato (= s.l.) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). Harmonia axyridis has been observed to thrive, breed, and reproduce on the four studied crops. Harmonia axyridis is the most abundant predator of aphids in corn followed by C. septempunctata, which is the main aphid predator observed in the three other inventoried crops. In wheat and potato fields, H. axyridis occurs in low numbers compared to other aphidophage. These observations suggest that H. axyridis could be considered an invasive species of agrosystems, and that potato and wheat may intermittently act as refuges for other aphidophages vulnerable to intraguild predation by this invader. Harmonia axyridis is not the most abundant aphid predator in the main Belgian crops.","[Vandereycken, Axel; Durieux, Delphine; Joie, Emilie; Haubruge, Eric; Verheggen, Francois J.] Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium","Vandereycken, A (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",a.vandereycken@ulg.ac.be; d.durieux@ulg.ac.be; ejoie@ulg.ac.be; j.sloggett@maastrichtuniversity.nl; e.haubruge@ulg.ac.be; fverheggen@ulg.ac.be,,"Verheggen, Francois/0000-0002-5849-1661; Haubruge, Eric/0000-0002-8138-0476","Service Public de Wallonie (SPW - DGO3) [D31-1197]; Fonds pour la formation a la Recherche dans l'Industrie et l'Agriculture (FRIA), BelgiumFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS","We thank V.

Although it is considered a minor pest in its native range, outbreaks of this species have been reported in North-eastern Italy. In this study, we investigated the potential of two generalist predators, i.e., Chrysoperla carnea and Orius majusculus, in suppressing E. vulnerata in laboratory and semi-field experiments. Both species significantly reduced nymph numbers in laboratory and semi-field conditions. For this reason, field trials were performed. Predator releases in vineyards reduced E. vulnerata abundance by about 30%. Since naturally occurring E. vulnerata antagonists exert a moderate impact and the effectiveness of natural insecticides is limited, the augmentative release of generalist predators can be considered a complementary tool in controlling E. vulnerata populations in vineyards, particularly in organic farms. Outbreaks of the Nearctic leafhopper Erasmoneura vulnerata represent a threat to vinegrowers in Southern Europe, in particular in North-eastern Italy. The pest outbreaks are frequent in organic vineyards because insecticides labeled for organic viticulture show limited effectiveness towards leafhoppers. On the other hand, the naturally occurring predators and parasitoids of E. vulnerata in vineyards are often not able to keep leafhopper densities at acceptable levels for vine-growers. In this study, we evaluated the potential of two generalist, commercially available predators, Chrysoperla carnea and Orius majusculus, in suppressing E. vulnerata. Laboratory and semi-field experiments were carried out to evaluate both species' predation capacity on E. vulnerata nymphs. The experiments were conducted on grapevine leaves inside Petri dishes (laboratory) and on potted and caged grapevines (semi-field); in both experiments, the leaves or potted plants were infested with E. vulnerata nymphs prior to predator releases. Both predator species exhibited a remarkable voracity and significantly reduced leafhopper densities in laboratory and semi-field experiments. Therefore, field studies were carried out over two growing seasons in two vineyards. We released 4 O. majusculus adults and 30 C. carnea larvae per m(2) of canopy. Predator releases in vineyards reduced leafhopper densities by about 30% compared to the control plots. Results obtained in this study showed that the two predators have a potential to suppress the pest density, but more research is required to define appropriate predator-prey release ratios and release timing. Studies on intraguild interactions and competition with naturally occurring predators are also suggested.","[Prazaru, Stefan Cristian; Zanettin, Giulia; Pozzebon, Alberto; Tirello, Paola; Toffoletto, Francesco; Scaccini, Davide; Duso, Carlo] Univ Padua, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy","Prazaru, SC; Pozzebon, A; Duso, C (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy.",stefancristian.prazaru@phd.unipd.it; giuliazanettin22@gmail.com; alberto.pozzebon@unipd.it; paola.tirello@unipd.it; francesco.toffoletto@studenti.unipd.it; davide.scaccini@phd.unipd.it; carlo.duso@unipd.it,"Scaccini, Davide/Z-3901-2019; Pozzebon, Alberto/B-7328-2009; duso, carlo/AAG-8435-2020","Scaccini, Davide/0000-0002-6850-7911; Pozzebon, Alberto/0000-0002-2445-7211; Duso, Carlo/0000-0002-2600-2536; Zanettin, Giulia/0000-0001-5913-9048; Prazaru, Stefan Cristian/0000-0002-0458-8994","projects VIT-VIVE-Innovativi modelli di sviluppo, sperimentazione ed applicazione di protocolli di sostenibilita della vitivinicoltura veneta (POR-FESR Regione Veneto) [BIRD167802/16]; DOR (University of Padova)","This work was partially supported by the projects VIT-VIVE-Innovativi modelli di sviluppo, sperimentazione ed applicazione di protocolli di sostenibilita della vitivinicoltura veneta (POR-FESR Regione Veneto) to C.D. and A.P., BIRD167802/16 to A.P. and DOR (University of Padova) to C.D. and A.P.",,38,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,APR,2021,12,4,,,,,,,321,10.3390/insects12040321,,,13,Entomology,Entomology,RR4HX,WOS:000643062500001,33917285,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-27,

This is particularly the case for invisible invasions by aquatic microbial species. Since in many cases only a few individuals or propagules enter a new habitat, their genetic variation is low and might limit their invasion success, known as the genetic bottleneck. Thus, a key question is, how genetic identity and diversity of invading species influences their invasion success and, subsequently, affect the resident community. We conducted invader-addition experiments using genetically different strains of the globally invasive, aquatic cyanobacteriumRaphidiopsis raciborskii(formerly:Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii) to determine the role of invader identity and genetic diversity (strain richness) at four levels of herbivory. We tested the invasion success of solitary single strain invasions against the invader genetic diversity, which was experimentally increased up to ten strains (multi-strain populations). By using amplicon sequencing we determined the strain-specific invasion success in the multi-strain treatments and compared those with the success of these strains in the single-strain treatments. Furthermore, we tested for the invasion success under different herbivore pressures. We showed that high grazing pressure by a generalist herbivore prevented invasion, whereas a specialist herbivore enabled coexistence of consumer and invader. We found a weak effect of diversity on invasion success only under highly competitive conditions. When invasions were successful, the magnitude of this success was strain-specific and consistent among invasions performed with single-strain or multi-strain populations. A strain-specific effect was also observed on the resident phytoplankton community composition, highlighting the strong role of invader genetic identity. Our results point to a strong effect of the genetic identity on the invasion success under low predation pressure. The genetic diversity of the invader population, however, had little effect on invasion success in our study, in contrast to most previous findings. Instead, it is the interaction between the consumer abundance and type together with the strain identity of the invader that defined invasion success. This study underlines the importance of strain choice in invasion research and in ecological studies in general.","[Bolius, Sarah; Weithoff, Guntram] Univ Potsdam, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Modelling, Potsdam, Germany; [Morling, Karoline] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Dept Aquat Environm Engn, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Wiedner, Claudia] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res, Rostock, Germany; [Weithoff, Guntram] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany","Bolius, S; Weithoff, G (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Modelling, Potsdam, Germany.; Weithoff, G (corresponding author), Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany.",bolius@uni-potsdam.de; weithoff@uni-potsdam.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Science Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [WE2556/9-1]; Open Access Publication Fund of University of Potsdam,"We thank Stefanie Hartmann for the bioinformatic analysis and Alexandra Trinks und Michaela Preick for assistance with library preparation and sequencing.

However, plant quality may also be crucial in mediating herbivore interspecific interactions. This is especially true when competition occurs between distantly related herbivore species, given that small terrestrial herbivores (e.g., insect herbivores) appear to be more sensitive to alterations of plant quality than plant quantity. In this study, we first tested in the field whether large vertebrate herbivores (cattle Bos taurus) exerted a negative effect on smaller insect herbivores (grasshopper Euchorthippus unicolor) through their overlapping foraging preferences for a dominant grass Leymus chinensis. We measured changes in grass quantity, grass quality, and microclimatic conditions in response to vertebrate grazing and conducted additional manipulative studies in the field and the laboratory to identify potential mechanisms underlying the interaction. Our results showed that grazing by large herbivores caused a significant decline in grasshopper population density and individual performance (survival, size, and weight of both female and male E. unicolor), despite a 38% increase in grass nitrogen (N) content in grazed plots. Experiments manipulating N levels of L. chinensis in the field and the laboratory confirmed that enriching plant N had a negative effect on grasshopper individual performance and population size. Therefore, enhanced quality (N content) of plant resources appears to be an important driver in mediating the negative effect of vertebrate grazing on grasshoppers. Synthesis. We document that phylogenetic relatedness and trait similarity can be poor predictors of interaction strength in some cases, since distantly related herbivores of disparate size can interact indirectly via changes in plant quality. Counter-intuitively, the observed negative effect of cattle on grasshoppers was mediated, at least in part, by an increase in plant quality in cattle grazed areas. The implication is that light to moderate grazing, a common management strategy, may contribute to suppression of grasshoppers in the Eurasian steppe grassland system by altering plant nutrient supplies.","[Zhu, Yu; Zhong, Zhiwei; Wang, Deli; Ma, Quanhui; Hassan, Nazim; Zhu, Hui; Wang, Ling] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Sch Environm, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol,Minist Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yu] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pages, Jordi F.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Isle Of Anglesey, Wales; [Finke, Deborah] Univ Missouri, Div Plant Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Wang, D (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Sch Environm, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol,Minist Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wangd@nenu.edu.cn,"Pages, Jordi F/E-7107-2013; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Pages, Jordi F/0000-0001-9346-8312; Liu, Chen/0000-0002-9916-2346; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; ZHU, HUI/0000-0003-0348-5560","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500602]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31230012, 31302012, 31700357]; Program for Introducing Talents to Universities [B16011]; Program for Innovative Research Team in University [IRT-16R11]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2412016KJ023]; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for WalesUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Higher Education Funding Council for England","National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0500602; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31230012, 31302012 and 31700357; Program for Introducing Talents to Universities, Grant/Award Number: B16011; Program for Innovative Research Team in University, Grant/Award Number: IRT-16R11; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2412016KJ023; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales",,69,11,12,9,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The modeling approach illustrates how typically complex interspecific interactions which vary with species and shellfish life stage can influence shellfish populations. Model results show the importance of managing shellfish predators, as well as selected groups of fouling species that may function as larval predators or competitors or both with juvenile shellfish life stages. While the modeling approach is limited by the lack of estimating intensities of interspecific interaction, it allows first-order insight into the relative importance of different types of interactions on shellfish populations and which variables are likely to be the most important in affecting shellfish abundance. Coupled with rigorous experimental hypothesis testing, the qualitative modeling approach provides assistance regarding which life stages of a shellfish species or interacting species needs to be managed in order to maximize shellfish productivity.

Studying these interactions under fluctuating food availability, while taking habitat characteristics into account, offers a quasi-experimental setup to determine the relative impact of con-and heterospecifics on reproductive success of predators. We analyzed the settlement decisions and reproductive success of Eurasian Pygmy Owls (Glaucidium passerinum) in the presence of both breeding conspecifics and their competitor and intraguild predator, Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus), under fluctuating abundance of their primary prey (voles). We used detailed data, collected across 11 years in a large study area (1300 km(2)), on the spatial and temporal variation of habitat characteristics in all available nesting sites, local densities of both species, and vole abundance. We found that Pygmy Owls strongly avoided breeding close to conspecifics but did not avoid Tengmalm's Owl nests. Nest box occupation of Pygmy Owls was positively correlated to the proportion of old spruce, mature and old pine forests, and farmlands, and occupation probability was higher at high vole abundance and in areas occupied in previous years. Pygmy Owl avoidance of conspecifics decreased when voles were abundant. At high conspecific density, Pygmy Owls showed lower hatching success and delayed hatching date, in agreement with the observed spatial avoidance. Finally, even though breeding Pygmy Owls did not spatially avoid Tengmalm's Owls, the density of heterospecifics correlated with low hatching and fledging success in Pygmy Owls. This suggests short term fitness costs when living close to competitors, even when lethal effects of intraguild interactions are subtle. Our results suggest that joint costs of exploitative and interference competition by Tengmalm's Owls, as well as intraguild predation, were lower than those induced by intraspecific competition only. This result might be due to the similar body size between the species considered, Tengmalm's Owls being only twice as large as Pygmy Owls. Interactions among con-and heterospecifics can therefore modify the spatial settlement and reproductive success of individuals on a landscape scale, also within the predator guild.","[Morosinotto, Chiara; Villers, Alexandre; Thomson, Robert L.; Varjonen, Rauno; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Villers, Alexandre] Univ Rochelle, CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UMR7372, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Thomson, Robert L.] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa","Morosinotto, C (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",chimor@utu.fi,"Villers, Alexandre/W-8184-2019; Morosinotto, Chiara/AAK-5266-2020; Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Villers, Alexandre/0000-0003-3050-4106; Morosinotto, Chiara/0000-0002-9172-894X","Center for International Mobility (CIMO [TM-07-4819]; Finnish Cultural Foundation-South Ostrobothnia Regional fund; Turku University Foundation; Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Biological Interactions Graduate School; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [138049, 123379, 136717, 250709]","The two-first authors (C.

Due to the global increase of harmful phytoplankton blooms, the study of dynamic interactions between two competing phytoplankton species in the presence of toxic substances is an active field of research now days. The ordinary mathematical formulation of models for two competing phytoplankton species, when one or both the species liberate toxic substances, is unable to capture the oscillatory and highly variable growth of phytoplankton populations. The deterministic model never predicts the sudden localized behavior of certain species. These obstacles of mathematical modeling can be overcomed if we include interval variability of biological parameters in our modeling approach. In this investigation, we construct imprecise models of allelopathic interactions between two competing phytoplankton species as a parametric differential equation model. We incorporate the effect of toxicant on the species in two different cases known as toxic inhibition and toxic stimulatory system. We have discussed the existence of various equilibrium points and stability of the system at these equilibrium points. In case of toxic stimulatory system, the delay model exhibits a stable limit cycle oscillation. Analytical findings are supported through exhaustive numerical simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aims were to assess: ( a) abundance of early benthic phase (EBP) lobsters and other benthic species at cobble sites, (b) the effect of these species on EBP growth and survival, and ( c) influence of these factors on recruitment and/or viability of restocking. Suction sampling of cobble sites revealeda wide diversity and abundance of potential competitors but no EBP lobsters. Hatchery-produced EBPs were therefore used for small-scale mesocosm experiments. In nature, predation on EBP was rapid without shelter, whereas in-vitro mortality, growth, and behaviour experiments showed that cover potentially increases survival. Scarcity per se may not completely explain the apparently absence of EBP, given that not a single EBP lobster was located either during this study or during any other of the extensive benthic investigations. The present paper discusses the implications of their apparent absence and whether it arises because EBPs are very scarce, cannot be captured by suction sampling, are not within lobster habitat, or occupy a specialized niche within adult habitat outside the range of current sampling methods.","Natl Univ Ireland, Shellfish Res Lab, Galway, Ireland; CEFAS, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; Inst Marine Res, Austevoll Aquaculture Res Stn, Ctr Aquaculture, N-5392 Storebo, Norway; Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ Bologna, DIPROVAL, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Mercer, JP (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Shellfish Res Lab, Galway, Ireland.",srl@iol.ie; r.c.a.bannister@cefas.co.uk; gro.van.der.meeren@imr.no; reynolds@uea.ac.uk; david@alma.unibo.it,,,,,,44,17,17,0,14,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

Using an adaptive management experiment, we tested the hypothesis that reducing moose to historic levels would reduce apparent competition and therefor recover caribou populations. Nested within this broad hypothesis were three specific hypotheses: (1) sport hunting could be used to substantially reduce moose numbers to an ecological target; (2) wolves in this ecosystem were primarily limited by moose abundance; and (3) caribou were limited by wolf predation. These hypotheses were evaluated with a before-after control-impact (BACI) design that included response metrics such as population trends and vital rates of caribou, moose, and wolves. Three caribou subpopulations were subject to the moose reduction treatment and two were in a reference area where moose were not reduced. When the moose harvest was increased, the moose population declined substantially in the treatment area (by 70%) but not the reference area, suggesting that the policy had the desired effect and was not caused by a broader climatic process. Wolf numbers subsequently declined in the treatment area, with wolf dispersal rates 2.5x greater, meaning that dispersal was the likely mechanism behind the wolf numerical response, though reduced recruitment and starvation was also documented in the treatment area. Caribou adult survival increased from 0.78 to 0.88 in the treatment area, but declined in the reference. Caribou recruitment was unaffected by the treatment. The largest caribou subpopulation stabilized in the treatment area, but declined in the reference area. The observed population stability is comparable to other studies that used intensive wolf control, but is insufficient to achieve recovery, suggesting that multiple limiting factors and corresponding management tools must be addressed simultaneously to achieve population growth.","[Serrouya, Robert; McLellan, Bruce N.; van Oort, Harry] Columbia Mt Caribou Res Project, Revelstoke, BC, Canada; [Serrouya, Robert] Univ Alberta, Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [McLellan, Bruce N.] Minist Forests Lands & Nat Resource Operat, Res Branch, Darcy, BC, Canada; [Mowat, Garth] Minist Forests Lands & Nat Resource Operat, Nat Resource Sci Sect, Nelson, BC, Canada; [Mowat, Garth] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Boutin, Stan] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Serrouya, R (corresponding author), Columbia Mt Caribou Res Project, Revelstoke, BC, Canada.; Serrouya, R (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",serruuya@ualberta.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Alberta Ingenuity; Bill Shostak Wildlife Award; Research Branch of the British Columbia Ministry of Forests; Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (Columbia Basin); Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation; Simpcw First Nations; Downie Timber; Louisiana Pacific; Bell Pole; Revelstoke Community Forests Corporation,"Funding to RS was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Alberta Ingenuity, and the Bill Shostak Wildlife Award.

The ecological results indicate that the two species partition a competition-predation gradient on the shore. Pseudacris crucifer is mostly high on the shore at low density in persistent pools with predators (dragonfly larvae, Aeshna juncea); tadpoles have low individual growth rates and metamorphose late at large body size. Pseudacris triseriata is more variable in growth and development but typically grows more rapidly and metamorphoses earlier. All P. crucifer that attain metamorphosis emerge from pools with Aeshna, whereas P. triseriata metamorphose from a mixture of pools with and without predators. A reciprocal transplant experiment showed that both species survived poorly in the upper level pools with predators, which indicates that predation is more important there. The experiment did not show strong competition between the two species in either kind of pool. The phenotypes, including plasticity, of the two species are consistent with their ecological differences. Pseudacris triseriata has traits that functional arguments suggest should assist in processing food: in natural populations it hatches at large size, feeds actively and conspicuously, and has a relatively round body and small tail muscle and tail fin. Pseudacris crucifer has the opposite suite of characters, which functional arguments suggest favor predator avoidance. The variation in larval habitat correlated with differences in plasticity. In the transplant experiment, P. crucifer showed little change in phenotype, whereas P. triseriata reduced activity and increased tail fin and tail muscle size in the presence of Aeshna. This study illustrates that ecological differences in tadpoles correlate with behavioral and morphological phenotypes and that phenotypic traits can be used to predict ecological performance in manipulative experiments in natural settings.","DUKE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, DURHAM, NC 27708 USA","SMITH, DC (corresponding author), WILLIAMS COLL, DEPT BIOL, WILLIAMSTOWN, MA 01267 USA.",,,"Van Buskirk, Josh/0000-0002-0486-3626",,,,45,151,155,2,31,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Lake Wonchi is one of the few remaining fairly pristine high-mountain crater lakes in the central highlands and has never been investigated in detail. We present a first study on zoo-plankton taxa composition, abundance and biomass conducted over more than one year including the underlying environmental drivers. The lake is basic (pH 7.9-8.9), dilute (specific conductivity 185-245 mu S cm(-1)) and oligotrophic with mean trophic status index of 36. The zooplankton community composition showed low species richness comprising a total of fourteen taxa with six cladocerans, one copepod and seven rotifers. Simpson's index of diversity with values between 0.6 and 0.8 pointed towards a homogenous taxa occurrence within the single sample units. The overall mean (+/- SD) standing biomass of zooplankton was 62.02 +/- 25.76 mg dry mass m(-3), which is low compared to other highland and rift valley lakes in Ethiopia. Cyclopoid copepods, in particular Thermocyclops ethiopiensis were the most abundant group and contributed 50% to the total zooplankton abundance followed by cladocerans (38%) and rotifers (12%). Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling resulted in a 3-dimensional model, which revealed similar community composition on successive sampling dates except in December/January and May. Temperature, alkalinity, conductivity and nitrate-N had significant influence on this seasonal pattern. A weak, but significant positive correlation (r= 0.482, N= 20, P= 0.037) between Chlorophyll a and zooplankton biomass mirrors a bottom-up effect of phytoplankton biomass on zooplankton dynamics. The zooplankton of Lake Wonchi displayed some degree of segregation along the epi-and metalimnion during this study, but diel vertical migration was not observed. The results show that fish predation is not the key factor in structuring the vertical distribution of zooplankton in Lake Wonchi.","[Degefu, Fasil] Natl Fisheries & Other Living Aquat Resources Res, Sebeta, Ethiopia; [Degefu, Fasil; Schagerl, Michael] Univ Vienna, Dept Limnol & Oceanog, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Degefu, F (corresponding author), Natl Fisheries & Other Living Aquat Resources Res, POB 64, Sebeta, Ethiopia.",fdegefu7@gmail.com,"Michael, Schagerl/AAC-3356-2021","Michael, Schagerl/0000-0002-8277-7205",Austrian Partnership Program in Higher Education and Research for Development (APPEAR),"We appreciate the financial support of the Austrian Partnership Program in Higher Education and Research for Development (APPEAR).

Some hypotheses are circular, i.e. they are based on the assumption that some taxa have greater diversity in the tropics. These include explanations assuming different degrees of competition, mutualism, predation, epiphyte load, epidemics, biotic spatial heterogeneity, host diversity, population size, niche width, population growth rate, environmental harshness, and patchiness at different latitudes. Other explanations are not supported by sufficient evidence, i.e. there is no consistent correlation between species diversity and environmental stability, environmental predictability, productivity, abiotic rarefaction, physical heterogeneity, latitudinal decrease in the angle of the sun above the horizon, area, aridity, seasonality, number of habitats, and latitudinal ranges. The ecological and evolutionary time hypotheses, as usually understood, also cannot explain the gradients, nor does the temperature dependence of chemical reactions permit predictions on species richness. Only differences in solar energy are consistently correlated with diversity gradients along latitude, altitude and perhaps depth. It is concluded that greater species diversity is due to greater effective evolutionary time (evolutionary speed) in the tropics, probably as the result of shorter generation times, faster mutation rates, and faster selection at greater temperatures.

One underappreciated avenue through which intransitivity can occur is through cyclic population dynamics. Although such cyclic intransitive relationships have been extensively studied in predator-prey systems, evidence of their importance in competitive communities, notably plant communities, is more limited. Most studies of coexistence in plant communities assume fixed-point coexistence even while utilising models that allow for cyclic population dynamics. In this paper, we explore the potential for density-dependent, cyclic population dynamics and intransitivity in a model for annual plants. We then examine how these density-dependent cycles impact mutual invasibility and ultimately stable coexistence between plant species pairs. We do this using data collected from four co-occurring annual plant species living in natural wildflower communities in SW Western Australia. To maximise the number of biologically plausible pathways by which coexistence mediated by density-dependent cyclic intransitivity can occur, we use an annual plant model that allows for competitive direct interactions, facilitative direct interactions and higher-order interactions between species. Results from our empirically parameterised model suggest that monocultures of all four focal species can have cyclic solutions with periodicity <1 under sunny (open) or shaded field conditions. Cyclic patterns drive variation in annual abundance patterns, with stable solutions for persistent monocultures and invasibility potential (the capacity of one population to invade another) common. Mutual invasibility in the face of cyclic population dynamics was found for just one of six species pairs, only under open environmental conditions. Our results illustrate the potential for cyclic intransitivity to both drive and prevent stable coexistence in environmentally heterogeneous biological communities.Synthesis. We provide analytical and empirical evidence that coexistence in competitive communities (annual plants) can be achieved under non-equilibrium circumstances, through density-dependent cyclic intransitivity. Our results suggest that cyclic population dynamics may be common and important for coexistence dynamics in some types of communities. In such communities, the exploration of stable coexistence should, therefore, include consideration of cyclic as well as fixed-point equilibria for maximal accuracy.","[Stouffer, Daniel B.] Univ Canterbury, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Wainwright, Claire E.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Flanagan, Thomas; Mayfield, Margaret M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Mayfield, MM (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",m.mayfield@uq.edu.au,"Mayfield, Margaret M/B-7386-2012; Stouffer, Daniel/C-2223-2008","Mayfield, Margaret M/0000-0002-5101-6542; Wainwright, Claire/0000-0002-3248-5482; Stouffer, Daniel/0000-0001-9436-9674","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP140100574, FT140100498]; Royal Society Te Aparangi [16-UOC-008, RDF-13-UOC-003]","Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP140100574 and FT140100498; Royal Society Te Aparangi, Grant/Award Number: 16-UOC-008 and RDF-13-UOC-003",,45,13,13,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Further, as with plant competition studies, differential resource use patterns may illuminate competition mechanisms among animal taxa. Ladybirds are a diverse family of beetles that possess substantial variation in body mass across taxa. Further, some ladybird species have been widely introduced into novel habitats, where they may pose significant risks of ecological and economic harm. By controlling for allometric scaling, we tested the hypothesis that introduced Asian multicoloured ladybirds (Harmonia axyridis) are more efficient predators on aphids than trophically-analogous, native convergent ladybirds (Hippodamia convergens). We utilized a prey-replacement FR design, and assessed rates of pea aphid consumption as a function of initial prey density. H. axyridis possessed significantly higher absolute and mass-adjusted FRs (Type II) than the native species, consistent with expectations. The higher FR was mediated by reduced handling time, suggesting that the ability of H. axyridis to manipulate and digest prey exceeds that of H. convergens. Our feeding results may explain, in part, the increasing occurrence and abundance of the introduced species, and documented declines of native species of prey and competitor in invaded habitats.","[Crookes, Steven; DeRoy, Emma M.; MacIsaac, Hugh J.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Dick, Jaimie T.

Using a combination of fieldwork and laboratory experiments, we show that intraguild predation may be important in the field distribution of generalist predators that share a common prey: the eggs (and larvae) of the leaf beetle Phratora vulgatissima, a major insect pest in coppicing willow plantations. We focused on a species from the hoverfly genus Parasyrphus (Syrphidae), which may exhibit large temporal and spatial variation in density. Predator and prey densities were quantified in 40 field plots in willow plantations. The likelihood of finding hoverfly eggs declined with increasing densities of two predatory minds, Orthotylus marginalis and Closterotomus fulvomaculatus, which exhibit less mobile behaviour similar to that of hoverfly larvae. The density of a more mobile predatory bug species, the anthocorid Anthocoris nemorum, was not associated with hoverfly occurrence. These results corroborate the hypothesis that less mobile predators should be stronger intraguild predators than mobilepredators. Further partial support for this hypothesis was obtained in the laboratory study where individual predators were presented with clutches of P vulgatissima eggs containing one hoverfly egg: the less mobile C. fulvomaculattts and O. marginalis tended to consume the hoverfly egg more readily than the more mobile A. nemorum. However, most individuals of all three bug species consumed the egg of the potential competitor - the syrphid - within 24 h. The field study also showed that hoverfly occurrence was positively associated with the density of their prey and with the presence of nearby forests. We conclude that intraguild predation, abundance of prey and the surrounding habitat affect the distribution of hoverflies in this system and should be considered when developing biological control methods.","[Bjorkman, Christer; Johansson, Hans; Snall, Tord] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Bjorkman, C (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, POB 7044, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",christer.bjorkman@ekol.slu.se,,,"Oscar and Lili Lamm Foundation; Swedish Energy AgencySwedish Energy Agency; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2005-933, 2005-1326]","We thank Richard Hopkins for valuable comments, Karin Eklund for assistance and Tomas Gronqvist for conducting the chemical analysis.

To determine whether intraguild predation and competition for prey may be partially responsible for the decline, we paired first-instar larvae of two populations of C. novemnotata (eastern and western) with first-instar C. septempunctata at low or high aphid densities. Survival of both C. novemnotata populations was significantly lower when larvae were paired with C. septempunctata, and western C. novemnotata exhibited significantly lower survival compared with the eastern population. This relationship depended on aphid density with the greatest survival of both C. novemnotata populations occurring at the high aphid density. Both male and female C. novemnotata weighed less on the day of eclosion when paired with C. septempunctata as compared with pairings with conspecifics. In a second test, C. septempunctata and C. novemnotata instars were varied at the start of the trial and C. novemnotata survival to adulthood in the presence of C. septempunctata was dependent of the instar of C. novemnotata used to initiate the experiment. C. novemnotata exhibited higher rates of survival and weighed significantly more on the day of eclosion when C. novemnotata was older than its C. septempunctata partner. These results suggest that interspecific competition including intraguild predation by C. septempunctata may contribute to C. novemnotata population declines, but that the intensity of this impact may vary across C. novemnotata populations.","[Turnipseed, Rakim K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Turnipseed, Rakim K.; Ugine, Todd A.; Losey, John E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Turnipseed, RK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rturnipseed@berkeley.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank the Lost Lady Project participants for helping us to collect rare species to start our colonies, and the National Science Foundation for project and salary support.

Such regulatory role may be of special relevance in novel communities resulting from biological invasions. Non-indigenous species frequently escape natural predators that limit their distribution and abundance in the native range. However, biological interactions also can limit the establishment and spread of non-native populations. There is a growing concern that climate change might affect predator-prey interactions exacerbating the ecological impacts of non-indigenous species. However, mechanisms underlying such interactions are poorly understood in marine ecosystems. Here, we explored if past environmental stress, i.e., increasing temperature and decreasing pH, could affect the vulnerability of two mussel prey, the native Mytilus galloprovincialis and the non-indigenous Xenostrobus securis, to predation by the native dogwhelk Nucella lapillus. In addition, we evaluated the consequences on the feeding behaviour of Nucella lapillus. First, we exposed monospecific assemblages of each mussel species to combined experimental conditions of increasing temperature and decreasing pH in mesocosms for 3 weeks. Then assemblages were placed on a rocky shore and were enclosed in cages with dogwhelks where they remained for 3 weeks. Despite the lack of preference, consumption was much greater on the native than on the invasive mussels, which barely were consumed by dogwhelks. However, this trend was diverted when temperature increased. Thus, under a coastal warming scenario shifts in dogwhelks feeding behaviour may help to contain invader's populations, especially in estuarine areas where these predators are abundant.

I tested the effect of experimental venue by conducting parallel manipulations in mesocosms and in the field. A target-neighbor experiment estimating the impact of larval wood frog (Rana sylvatica) density on the performance of spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) larvae was carried out in a set of artificial pond mesocosms and within mesh enclosures placed in natural ponds. Larvae of P. crucifer suffered sharp reductions in growth and development in the presence of increasing R. sylvatica densities when reared in mesocosms, but showed no response in field enclosures. A comparative test suggested that mesocosms yielded relatively unrealistic responses. These findings demonstrate that, apart from other considerations such as spatial scale, experimental venue can alter conclusions regarding interactions between species. If venue dependence is widespread, ecologists will need to strategically assess the choice of venue when considering the goals of their experiments.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Skelly, DK (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",,"Skelly, David/D-3878-2013",,,,,27,119,120,0,39,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2002,83,8,,,,,2097,2101,,10.2307/3072041,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,583WP,WOS:000177434200004,,,,,2021-09-27,

While detrimental effects of invasive predators on native species are well documented, we often lack a mechanistic understanding of the invasion success. Lack of prey avoidance behaviour can lead to higher consumption rates by invasive predators compared to native predators. This competitive advantage is expected to contribute to the invasion success of non-native predators. 2. We compared aphid consumption and cue avoidance behaviour of aphids between four native ladybird species (Coccinella septempunctata,Adalia bipunctata,Propylea quatuordecimpunctata, andHippodamia variegata) and the invasive Asian ladybirdHarmonia axyridis. 3. The invasiveH. axyridisand the nativeC. septempunctataconsumed more aphids than the three smaller native ladybird species. In line with our expectations, aphids avoided leaves bearing cues of most native ladybird species but not of the invasiveH. axyridis. 4. Our results indicate that body size rather than ladybird origin determined aphid predation rates. The lack of aphid avoidance behaviour towards cues ofH. axyridisindicates that they were not able to recognise the chemical cues of the invasive predator. 5. Relatively large body size and the absence of cue avoidance in aphids might benefit the invasiveH. axyridis, particularly in comparison to smaller native ladybird species. The absence of avoidance behaviour in aphids might lead to even higher predation rates ofH. axyridisunder more natural conditions.","[Bertleff, Denise; Diekmann, Jette; Brand, Sophia; Uenlue, Ayse Guel; Bucher, Roman] Philipps Univ Marburg, Fac Biol, Conservat Ecol, Karl von Frisch Str 8, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Bertleff, D (corresponding author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Fac Biol, Conservat Ecol, Karl von Frisch Str 8, D-35043 Marburg, Germany.",denisebertleff@gmail.com,"Bucher, Roman/AAD-2881-2019","Bucher, Roman/0000-0002-3001-2876",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [BU3382/1-1],We thank Carolin Gutwirth and Laura M.

We hypothesized that the predators would modify their foraging tactics when small fishes (capelin [Mallotus villosus]) and large pelagic fishes (mackerel, saury) varied in inter-annual abundances. We predicted differences in (1) diving behavior, (2) spatial, and (3) temporal patterning of foraging behavior. Predictions 1 and 2 were supported, prediction 3 rejected. Dives were significantly deeper (4.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.3 m) and longer (10.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 5.0 +/- 0.2 s), and more U-shaped dives (dives where birds stayed at more or less one depth) were performed (52% +/- 7% vs. 7% +/- 2%) in the year with higher abundance of forage fishes. Flight patterns exhibited remarkable spatial and geographic differences: gannets flew significantly (17%) more and foraging ranges were about twice as long when they pursued large pelagic fishes (mean = 122 +/- 81 km vs. 62 +/- 12 km). The 95% kernel feeding range was 34 times larger when large pelagic fishes were available. Yet foraging trip durations were not different between years. Inter-annual variation in foraging tactics by the same species at the same colony in successive years was strongly related to prey availability, showing that spatial foraging parameters can be determined largely by ocean and prey conditions.","[Garthe, Stefan] Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, Busum, Germany; [Montevecchi, William A.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Psychol, St John, NF, Canada; [Montevecchi, William A.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF, Canada; [Montevecchi, William A.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ctr Ocean Sci, St John, NF, Canada; [Davoren, Gail K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Zool, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Garthe, S (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, Busum, Germany.",garthe@ftz-west.uni-kiel.de,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Research and Technology Centre in Busum; Memorial University of Newfoundland,"A.

Shared enemies may link the dynamics of their prey. Recently, quantitative food webs have been used to infer that herbivorous insect species attacked by the same major parasitoid species will affect each other negatively through apparent competition. Nonetheless, theoretical work predicts several alternative outcomes, including positive effects. 2. In this paper, we use an experimental approach to link food web patterns to realized population dynamics. First, we construct a quantitative food web for three dominant leaf miner species on the oak Quercus robur. We then measure short- and long-term indirect effects by increasing leaf miner densities on individual trees. Finally, we test whether experimental results are consistent with natural leaf miner dynamics on unmanipulated trees. 3. The quantitative food web shows that all leaf miner species share a minimum of four parasitoid species. While only a small fraction of the parasitoid pool is shared among Tischeria ekebladella and each of two Phyllonorycter species, the parasitoid communities of the congeneric Phyllonorycter species overlap substantially. 4. Based on the structure of the food web, we predict strong short- and long-term indirect interactions between the Phyllonorycter species, and limited interactions between them and T. ekebladella. As T. ekebladella is the main source of its own parasitoids, we expect to find intraspecific density-dependent parasitism in this species. 5. Consistent with these predictions, parasitism in T. ekebladella was high on trees with high densities of conspecifics in the previous generation. Among leaf miner species sharing more parasitoids, we found positive rather than negative interactions among years. No short-term indirect interactions (i.e. indirect interactions within a single generation) were detected. 6. Overall, this study is the first to experimentally demonstrate that herbivores with overlapping parasitoid communities may exhibit independent population dynamics - or even apparent mutualism. Hence, it proves the potential for versatile indirect interactions in nature, and suggests that the link between patterns in food web structure and realized population dynamics should be verified by rigorous experiments.","[Tack, Ayco J.

We investigated spatial patterns in the diet and distribution of the young-of-the-year of 3 marine transients-the weakfish Cynoscion regalis, the spot Leiostomus xanthurus and the Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus-and the juveniles and adults of 1 estuarine resident, the white perch Morone americana, in 5 marsh creeks systems along a salinity gradient running from the poly/mesohaline (12 to 20) lower bay to the meso/oligohaline upper bay (0 to 12). Sampling was conducted monthly from April through November in 1997 and 1998, resulting in over 1700 otter trawl (4.9 m, 6 mm cod-end mesh) samples and 5703 fish stomachs examined, making this one of the largest studies of its kind. We employed a bootstrap technique to generate 95% confidence intervals for proportional consumption of the major prey categories. The diets of the target species differed significantly among the 5 marsh creeks. Mysid consumption was high for all species at the 3 most saline marshes and low at the 2 freshest sites, suggesting either low mysid abundance or availability at the latter sites. Consumption of insect larvae was important only at the freshest site. L. xanthurus consumed 80% annelids at the most saline sites, but less that 32% at the other sites. The other important consumer of annelids, Micropogonias undulatus, consumed similar quantities of annelids at all sites (32 to 41%). Total stomach fullness was almost always higher at the sites of highest fish abundance. We conclude that the marine transients appear to recruit preferentially to sites of high resource abundance, while M. americana is restricted by physico-chemical tolerance during the spring through fall to limited juvenile habitats where it may experience food resource competition.","Natl Aquarium, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Marine Field Stn, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Tuckerton, NJ 08087 USA","Nemerson, DM (corresponding author), Natl Aquarium, Pier 3-501 E Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",dnemerson@aqua.org,,,,,,58,60,61,0,29,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The de Wit model of competition was used to examine the competitive relationships between Ph. vitta, and C. alpina and P. felina, using chironomids or tubificid worms as food. In mixed cultures of Ph. vitta and P. felina fed on tubificids a stable equilibrium existed within the range of relative densities used in the experiments, whereas Ph. vitta was competitively superior to C. alpina in cultures fed on each of the food types, and to P. felina fed on chironomids. However, in theory, an equilibrium could occur when 10 or 6-7 times as many Ph. vitta as P. felina and C. alpina respectively are in the culture, when intraspecific rather than interspecific competition would become more important. Where the three triclad species coexist in the Welsh study stream, they are in similar numbers. This could imply that food is not limiting, with no consequent interspecific competition, or that the laboratory experiments were too simplistic to allow any interpretation of the field situation.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUT BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,1,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR 15,1991,211,1,,,,,43,50,,10.1007/BF00008615,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,FG274,WOS:A1991FG27400005,,,,,2021-09-27,

We conducted laboratory and field experiments to evaluate the effects of intra- and interspecific interactions on the use of food resources and behavior of the sea stars Leptasterias polaris and Asterias vulgaris, 2 major predators in subtidal communities of the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, We demonstrate interference (encounter) competition between the two. For both species, the presence of the other (as detected by both contact and chemical signals) decreased feeding activity and provoked behavioral changes (avoidance, decrease in percentage feeding). These effects were reversible and short-lived, and were more pronounced when there was a shortage of food and when sea stars were exposed to simulated attacks by the other species (involving pedicellarial pinching). L. polaris seemed to be the inferior competitor as (1) it switched to less profitable prey size (smaller mussels, Mytilus edulis) when A. vulgaris was present, and (2) it avoided A. vulgaris and reduced its feeding activity when food was scarce, The dominance of A. vulgaris is possibly attenuated at our study site (near its northern distributional limit) by the reduction of its fitness when water temperatures are low (most of the year) and during the winter when it migrates to deeper water, Competition for food resources seems to occur periodically (mainly summer), in localized areas (patches and beds of mussels) or when sea stars form dense aggregations in which they are likely to interact frequently, Interactions, and thus the chance of competition, are less likely at greater depths. Coexistence seems to be permitted by both the attenuation of the dominance of A. vulgaris and by the great variations in how L. polaris and A. vulgaris interact (strongly affected by variations in prey availability, sea star abundance, and in the patterns of prey use by both sea stars).","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, GIROQ, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Himmelman, JH (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",john.himmelman@bio.ulaval.ca,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,73,33,35,1,21,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Numerical and analytic tools from non-equilibrium statistical physics capture the stochastic kinetics of these complex interacting many-particle systems beyond rate equation approximations. Including spatial structure and stochastic noise in models for predator-prey competition invalidates the neutral Lotka-Volterra population cycles. Stochastic models yield long-lived erratic oscillations stemming from a resonant amplification mechanism. Spatially extended predator-prey systems display noise-stabilized activity fronts that generate persistent correlations. Fluctuation-induced renormalizations of the oscillation parameters can be analyzed perturbatively via a Doi-Peliti field theory mapping of the master equation; related tools allow detailed characterization of extinction pathways. The critical steadystate and non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics at the predator extinction threshold are governed by the directed percolation universality class. Spatial predation rate variability results in more localized clusters, enhancing both competing species' population densities. Affixing variable interaction rates to individual particles and allowing for trait inheritance subject to mutations induces fast evolutionary dynamics for the rate distributions. Stochastic spatial variants of three-species competition with 'rock-paper-scissors' interactions metaphorically describe cyclic dominance. These models illustrate intimate connections between population dynamics and evolutionary game theory, underscore the role of fluctuations to drive populations toward extinction, and demonstrate how space can support species diversity. Two-dimensional cyclic three-species May-Leonard models are characterized by the emergence of spiraling patterns whose properties are elucidated by a mapping onto a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Multiple-species extensions to general 'food networks' can be classified on the mean-field level, providing both fundamental understanding of ensuing cooperativity and profound insight into the rich spatio-temporal features and coarsening kinetics in the corresponding spatially extended systems. Novel space-time patterns emerge as a result of the formation of competing alliances; e.g. coarsening domains that each incorporate rock-paper-scissors competition games.","[Dobramysl, Ulrich] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Mobilia, Mauro] Univ Leeds, Sch Math, Dept Appl Math, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Pleimling, Michel; Taeuber, Uwe C.] Virginia Tech, Dept Phys, MC 0435,Robeson Hall,850 W Campus Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Pleimling, Michel; Taeuber, Uwe C.] Virginia Tech, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, MC 0435,Robeson Hall,850 W Campus Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Pleimling, Michel] Virginia Tech, Acad Integrated Sci, MC 0405,300 Turner St NW, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Dobramysl, U (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",u.dobramysl@gurdon.cam.uc.uk; m.mobilia@leeds.ac.uk; pleim@vt.edu; tauber@vt.edu,"Mobilia, Mauro/A-7045-2010","Mobilia, Mauro/0000-0002-1424-567X; Dobramysl, Ulrich/0000-0001-9363-654X","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMR-1205309, DMR-1606814]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation [GBR/1119205 STP]; Herchel Smith Postdoctoral Fellowship; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1606814] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","The authors are indebted to Eli Ben-Naim, Bart Brown, Nicholas Butzin, Sara Case, Sheng Chen, Debanjan Dasgupta, Udaya Sree Datla, Clinton Durney, Shadi Esmaeili, Erwin Frey, Ivan Georgiev, Nigel Goldenfeld, Qian He, Bassel Heiba, Ben Intoy, Luo-Luo Jiang, Alan McKane, David Konrad, Darka Labavic, Will Mather, Hildegard Meyer-Ortmanns, Shahir Mowlaei, Tim Newman, Matjaz Perc, Tobias Reichenbach, Ahmed Roman, Alastair Rucklidge, Shannon Serrao, Max Shafer, Bartosz Szczesny, Attila Szolnoki, Sid Venkat, Mark Washenberger, Robert West, and Royce Zia for fruitful collbarations and/or insightful discussions.

The ability to estimate per capita interaction strength from observational data is desirable because of the logistical difficulty of using experimental manipulations to obtain such measures for all species within complex natural communities. In this paper, I derive observational measures of per capita interaction strength having units matching those of dynamic food web models (per capita consumption and assimilation rates). I also highlight the difference between per capita interaction strength (a parameter used in theoretical models) and species impact (empirical measures of total species effect). I then use behavioral observations and population censuses in a rocky intertidal community to estimate both per capita interaction strengths and species impacts on invertebrate prey of Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), American Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), and Northwestern Crows (Corvus caurinus). Estimated per capita interaction strengths exhibited a skewed distribution with many weak interactions and few strong interactions: mean +/- 1 SD of log(10)(interaction strength) = -1.95 +/- 1.40 (bird-day/m of shore)(-1). Per capita interaction strength correlated poorly (r(2) = 0.152-0.157) and nonlinearly with both consumption rates and percentage contribution of a prey species to the diet. Using my observational estimates of per capita interaction strengths, I predicted the species impact of bird predation on different prey taxa. Predictions included strong effects of birds on goose barnacles (Pollicipes polymerus), limpets (Lottia and Tectura spp.), sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus spp.), and large starfish (Pycnopodia helianthoides and Solaster stimpsoni), but little effect on mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. trossulus), dogwhelk snails (Nucella spp.), and acorn barnacles (Semibalanus cariosus). I compared nine of the predictions with 126 results of experimental manipulations of birds. The predictions agreed both qualitatively and quantitatively with the experimental results. These findings suggest that observational measures of interaction strength that have units matching those of dynamical food web models may be reasonable to use in estimating those found in natural communities.","UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT ZOOL, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",,,"Wootton, J.

Throughout Caribbean reefs, fairy basslets Gramma loreto and blackcap basslets G. melacara are segregated by depth with a narrow zone of overlap. Local populations of these planktivores are found under isolated reef ledges, where fairy basslets compete with conspecifics for access to prime feeding positions at the outer edges. I investigated the existence, mechanisms, and effects of interspecific competition on the local distribution and demography of basslets. I documented aggression and feeding rates of both species and conducted a reciprocal removal experiment comparing the re sponse of each basslet in competitor-removal versus unmanipulated populations of both species. Positioning of both basslets under ledges was consistent with an overall size hierarchy, with larger fish progressively closer to the outer edges of ledges. Fairy basslets were more aggressive, yet competition had symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species. Interference between species drove juveniles further back under ledges, where feeding and growth rates of individuals were reduced. Competition had no effect on the density of basslets during this 8 wk experiment. Aggression occurred between larger basslets, but with no consequential effects on any parameters measured. This study demonstrates sym metrical effects of interspecific competition on juvenile coral-reef fishes, a phenomenon that has rarely been documented previously.","[Kindinger, Tye L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",kindingt@science.oregonstate.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-08-51162, OCE-12-33027]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This study was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants to M.

Because a number of recent studies have shown that large predatory invertebrates can both compete with and prey on small vertebrates and because introductions of non-native species may play a role in amphibian declines, the effects of introduced centipedes Lithobius forficatus and native centipedes Scolopocryptops sexspinosus on juveniles of the red-backed salamander Plethodon cinereus were examined. In laboratory arenas, juvenile salamanders exhibited submissive behaviour in response to the odours of both species of centipede. There were no significant differences in salamander response to the two centipede odour treatments, but compared to controls, juveniles of P. cinereus spent significantly more time in escape and in a flattened submissive posture when presented with native centipede odours. Despite significant size differences between centipedes and juvenile salamanders, no predation of salamanders by either species of centipede occurred in any pairings. Juveniles exhibited more chemosensory behaviour towards native centipedes and towards their odours and exhibited marked reductions in aggressive posturing when centipedes were present. Field and laboratory data suggest that juveniles of P. cinereus and centipedes were negatively associated. In laboratory trials, the native centipede excluded juvenile salamanders from cover objects and we found fewer instances of co-occurrence in the field than expected. These studies are the first to examine the behavioural interactions between juveniles of P. cinereus and invertebrate predators, one introduced and one native, of eastern deciduous forest-floor food webs.","John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA; Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Univ Heights, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,"Venesky, Matthew/A-2865-2010; Hickerson, Cari-Ann/A-8013-2008",,,,,40,15,16,0,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Recent emphasis on the energetic basis of assemblage composition is intriguing and warrants further work, and the generality of zero-sum dynamics requires further assessment. Desert systems continue to be the focus of much ecological research, and small mammals remain central figures in understanding the interplay between biotic and abiotic factors and between intrinsic and extrinsic drivers.

Insecticides are agents of environmental disturbance that can potentially change ecological relationships and competitive outcomes, but this subject has seldom been examined. As the co-existing cereal grain beetle species Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky and Rhyzopertha dominica F. share a common realized niche, directly competing for the same resources, they were used as models in our study. Intraspecific competition experiments were performed with increasing insect densities and insecticide doses in additive and replacement series using various density combinations of both beetle species maintained on insecticide-free or -sprayed grains. Insecticide-mediated release from competitive stress was not observed in our study of intraspecific competition in grain beetles. The insecticide enhanced the effect of insect density, particularly for the maize weevil S. zeamais, further impairing population growth at high densities. Therefore, insecticide susceptibility increased with intraspecific competition favoring insecticide efficacy. However, the effect of insecticide exposure on competitive interaction extends beyond intraspecific competition, affecting interspecific competition as well. Sitophilus zeamais was the dominant species when in interspecific competition prevailing in natural conditions (without insecticide exposure), but the dominance and species prevalence shifted from S. zeamais to R. dominica under insecticide exposure. Therefore, high conspecific densities favored insecticide efficacy, but the strength of the relationship differs with the species. In addition, the insecticide mediated a shift in species dominance and competition outcome indicating that insecticides are relevant mediators of species interaction, potentially influencing community composition and raising management concerns as potential cause of secondary pest outbreaks.","[Cordeiro, Erick Mauricio G.; Correa, Alberto S.; Guedes, Raul Narciso C.] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Correa, Alberto S.] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Dept Entomol & Acarol Agr, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Guedes, RNC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",guedes@ufv.br,"Guedes, Raul Narciso Carvalho/L-3924-2013; Correa, Alberto S/C-4683-2014; Cordeiro, Erick MG/P-7042-2015","Guedes, Raul Narciso Carvalho/0000-0001-6229-7549; Correa, Alberto S/0000-0002-3788-7480; ",Minas Gerais State Foundation of Research Aid (FAPEMIG)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); CAPES Foundation (Brazilian Ministry of Education)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology,"Funding was provided by the following Brazilian agencies: Minas Gerais State Foundation of Research Aid (FAPEMIG; www.fapemig.br), the CAPES Foundation (Brazilian Ministry of Education; www.capes.gov.br), and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq; Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology; www.cnpq.br).

One hypothesis for this pattern is that biotic resistance of native species is reducing the success of small-bodied, introduced fishes. The eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki is common in many freshwater habitats in Florida and although small-bodied (< 50 mm), it is a predator and aggressive competitor. We conducted four mesocosm experiments to examine the potential for biotic resistance by eastern mosquitofish to two small-bodied nonindigenous fishes, variable platyfish (Xiphophorus variatus) and swordtail (X. hellerii). Experiments tested: (1) effect of eastern mosquitofish density on adult survival, (2) effect of eastern mosquitofish on a stage-structured population, (3) role of habitat structural complexity on nonindigenous adult survival, and (4) behavioral effects of eastern mosquitofish presence and habitat complexity. Eastern mosquitofish attacked and killed non-native poeciliids with especially strong effects on juveniles of both species. Higher eastern mosquitofish density resulted in greater effects. Predation on swordtails increased with increasing habitat complexity. Eastern mosquitofish also actively drove swordtails from cover, which could expose non-native fish to other predators under field conditions. Our results suggest that eastern mosquitofish may limit invasion success.","[Thompson, Kevin A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Thompson, Kevin A.; Hill, Jeffrey E.] Univ Florida, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Trop Aquaculture Lab, Ruskin, FL 33570 USA; [Nico, Leo G.] US Geol Survey, SE Ecol Sci Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA","Thompson, KA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.",Kevin.thompson@oregonstate.edu,,,"University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural SciencesUniversity of Florida; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; UF School of Natural Resources and the Environment","The authors thank Charles Cichra, University of Florida, for valuable input throughout this research.

We examined these processes in and among populations of field voles, sibling voles, bank voles and common shrews in western Finland, using spatially replicated trapping data collected four times a year during two vole cycles (1987-1990 and 1997-1999). Populations of the four species exhibited relatively strong interspecific temporal synchrony in their multiannual fluctuations. During peak phases, we observed slight deviations from close temporal synchrony: field vole densities peaked at least two months earlier than those of either sibling voles or bank voles, while densities of common shrews peaked even earlier. The growth rates of all four coexisting small mammal species were best explained by their own current densities. The growth rate of bank vole populations was negatively related to increasing densities of field voles in the increase phase of the vole cycle. Apart from this, no negative effects of interspecific density, direct or delayed, were observed among the vole species. The growth rates of common shrew populations were negatively related to increasing total rodent (including water voles and harvest mice) densities in the peak phase of the vole cycle. Sibling voles appeared not to be competitively superior to field voles on a population level, as neither of these Microtus voles increased disproportionately in abundance as total rodent density increased. We suggest that interspecific competition among the vole species may occur, but only briefly, during the autumn of peak years, when the total available amount of rodent habitat becomes markedly reduced following agricultural practices. Our results nonetheless indicate that interspecific competition is not a strong determinant of the structure of communities comprised of species exhibiting cyclic dynamics. We suggest that external factors, namely predation and shortage of food, limit densities of vole populations below levels where interspecific competition occurs. Common shrews, however, appear to suffer from asymmetric space competition with rodents at peak densities of voles; this may be viewed as a synchronizing effect.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Huitu, O (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,62,46,51,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2004,27,2,,,,,197,206,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2003.03684.x,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,808DK,WOS:000220549600008,,,,,2021-09-27,

Carabid communities are regulating weeds in arable fields and include a mix of species ranging from granivores to predators that are obligate omnivores. It is not clear from field studies whether granivore and obligate omnivore species either contribute equally or are complementary in the process of weed suppression, and little is known about the impact of potential predator interference within carabid communities on weed suppression. We compared the weed seed foraging strategy of the granivore Harpalus affinis and the obligate omnivore Poecilus cupreus. Using no-choice test experiments, we compared their activity and seed acceptance for four weed species through a scoring of the proportion of tested individuals consuming weeds, their latency before the consumption of the first seed and the total number of seeds consumed. We then evaluated their seed acceptance for dandelion seed Taraxacum officinale under predator interference by using chemical cues of carabids and tested the impact of three treatments, namely cues of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition and intraguild predation. We found that the obligate omnivore P. cupreus was highly active, had a low latency before consuming its first seed but had an interest in only two of the four weed species. P. cupreus seed acceptance remained unchanged in the presence of predator cues. By contrast, H. affinis was slow to start its seed consumption, accepted equally seeds of the four weed species and significantly increased its seed consumption in the presence of cues mimicking intraguild predation. These findings indicate that the two species differ in their foraging strategies, and as such, could have different contributions to weed seed suppression. This novel result calls for further studies documenting the foraging strategy of carabid species that thrive in arable fields as this could significantly improve our understanding of the delivery of weed seed regulation.

Recently, widespread observations show a dominance shift from the early invader, Dreissena polymorpha, to its successor, Dreissena bugensis. These observations likely reflect congeneric species differences in physiological and behavioural traits. Here, we assessed the mussel attachment strength, attachment rate, and the mode of byssal failure as trait differences that could potentially contribute to dominance shifts. The attachment traits were measured in field and laboratory experiments. Fouling plates were deployed in the Rhine-Meuse river delta and dreissenids were collected and acclimatised in 60 L non-aerated freshwater tanks. Attachment strength was positively correlated with shell size. The attachment strength of D. bugensis was significantly greater compared to slower growing D. polymorpha individuals of a dreissenid field assemblage. This corresponded to the superior byssal thread morphology of D. bugensis (i.e. higher number and two times wider byssal threads). Moreover, our results indicated that byssal threads of D. bugensis are stronger than those of D. polymorpha, as the latter ruptured more often. Additionally, D. bugensis had a significantly lower attachment rate than D. polymorpha. Having a greater attachment strength gives D. bugensis an advantage when it comes to withstanding currents and predators. On the other hand, not being attached allows an individual to actively move around. This would allow them to move away from fast changing unfavourable environmental conditions. These attachment traits indicate competitive benefits for D. bugensis over D. polymorpha, therefore possibly contributing to the dominance shifts.","[D'Hont, Anouk; Gittenberger, Adriaan] GiMaRIS, Marine Res Inventory & Strategy Solut, Rijksstr Weg 75, NL-2171 AK Sassenheim, Netherlands; [D'Hont, Anouk; Leuven, Rob S.

Laboratory experiments were performed with water from control and fish mesocosms to avoid the direct impact of fish predation. In the experiments with the water from the fish mesocosms, fish indirectly negatively affected the demographic parameters of large cladocerans (Daphnia magna and D. pulicaria) due to the enhanced abundance of blue-green algae in the phytoplankton. However, small Ceriodaphnia quadrangula and littoral species Simocephalus vetulus did not respond to the presence of blue-greens. Due to this mechanism, the total abundance of cladoceran species can be sustained during the development of blue-green algae because large and small bodied species differ in their resistence to high concentratons of blue-green algae. Fish chemical signals (kairomones) did not influence the demographic parameters of any cladoceran species.","[Feniova, I. Yu.; Petrosyan, V.

Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis; MGRS) is among the most critically endangered mammals in the United States and is isolated on the periphery of the species' range, potentially increasing its conservation priority. To investigate potential threats to the population and provide a tool for land managers, we developed a spatially explicit population dynamics model. We tested model predictions using available range-wide data from the literature and field work specific to the MGRS. A general model input data set using mean life history values overpredicted MGRS abundance. However, we found significant correlation with known squirrel abundance using a general data set with curtailed fecundity and survival. A model with MGRS-specific data provided the best fit to observed population size. We investigated potential impacts of two major threats to the MGRS: competition from introduced Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti) and increased levels of predation. Predation and particularly competition could have significant effects on the future population of the MGRS. Careful attention must be used to model the viability of fringe populations as peripheral populations can have a different life history than populations found in the range core.

However, especially on tropical islands, rodent eradications can fail for various reasons, and it is unclear whether the temporary reduction of a rodent population during an unsuccessful eradication operation has beneficial effects on native birds. Here we examine the response of four endemic land bird species on subtropical Henderson Island in the Pitcairn Island Group, South Pacific Ocean, following an unsuccessful rodent eradication in 2011. We conducted point counts at 25 sampling locations in 14 survey periods between 2011 and 2015, and modelled the abundance trends of all species using binomial mixture models accounting for observer and environmental variation in detection probability. Henderson Reed Warbler Acrocephalus taiti more than doubled in abundance (2015 population estimate: 7,194-28,776), and Henderson Fruit Dove Ptilinopus insularis increased slightly between 2011 and 2015 (2015 population estimate: 4,476-10,072), while we detected no change in abundance of the Henderson Lorikeet Vini stepheni (2015 population estimate: 554-3014). Henderson Crake Zapornia atra increased to pre-eradication levels following anticipated mortality during the operation (2015 population estimate: 4,960-20,783). A temporary reduction of rat predation pressure and rat competition for fruit may have benefitted the reed warbler and the fruit dove, respectively. However, a long drought may have naturally suppressed bird populations prior to the rat eradication operation in 2011, potentially confounding the effects of temporary rat reduction and natural recovery. We therefore cannot unequivocally ascribe the population recovery to the temporary reduction of the rat population. We encourage robust monitoring of island biodiversity both before and after any management operation to better understand responses of endemic species to failed or successful operations.","[Bond, Alexander L.; Cuthbert, Richard J.; Lavers, Jennifer L.; McClelland, Gregory T.

As with other tropical ecosystems, the major threats to wildlife are habitat loss, hunting and invasive species, of which the feral cat (Felis catus) is considered the most damaging. Our camera-trapping study focused on a terrestrial vertebrate species inventory on Bohol Island and tempo-spatial co-occurrences of feral cats with their prey and competitors. The survey took place in the Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape, and we examined the primary rainforest, its border with agricultural land, and rural areas in the vicinity of villages. Altogether, over 2,885 trap days we captured 30 species of vertebrates-10 mammals (including SUS philippensis), 19 birds and one reptile, Varanus cumingi. We trapped 81.8% of expected vertebrates. Based on the number of events, the most frequent native species was the barred rail (Gallirallus torquatus). The highest overlap in Biel activity between cats arid potential prey was recorded with rodents in rural areas (Delta = 0.62); the lowest was in the same habitat with ground-dwelling birds (Delta = 0.40). Cat activity was not recorded inside the rainforest; in other habitats their diet activity pattern differed. The cats' activity declined in daylight in the proximity of humans, while it peaked at the transition zone between rainforest and fields. Both rodents and ground-dwelling birds exhibited a shift in activity levels between sites where cats were present or absent. Rodents tend to become active by day in cat-free habitats. No cats' temporal response to co-occurrences of civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus and Viverra tangalunga) was found but cats in diel activity avoided domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Our first insight into the ecology of this invasive predator in the Philippines revealed an avoidance of homogeneous primary rainforest and a tendency to forage close to human settlements in heterogeneous habitats. A detailed further investigation of the composition of the cat's diet, as well as ranging pattern, is still needed.","[Bogdan, Vlastimil; Junek, Tomas; Vymyslicka, Pavla Junkova] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic","Junek, T (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic.",tom_junek@yahoo.com,"Vymyslicka, Pavla Junkova/ABH-9466-2020","Vymyslicka, Pavla Junkova/0000-0001-6915-1876","Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20144257, 20134247]","The project was financially supported by grants GA FZP, reg.

A higher frequency of non-lethal injuries in Astacus suggested the predominance of Pacifastacus in interference interactions. These results support a competitive exclusion hypothesis. 4. A dramatic change in relative abundance of the two species in recent years was the result of an almost complete cessation in recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) in Astacus. Poor recruitment in Astacus was probably caused by the combined effects of interspecific competition and predation, resulting in increased mortality among YOY Astacus, and by reproductive interference, suppressing the less common species. 5. The results support the hypothesis that the observed replacement of Astacus by Pacifastacus is governed by a combination of several interacting mechanisms, of which (sic)","UPPSALA UNIV,INST LIMNOL,S-75236 UPPSALA,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,66,100,104,1,37,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Tapes philippinarum occurred at significantly higher densities and occupied a deeper stratum in the sediment than Anomalocardia squamosa, which is a species protected by a much thicker shell. Both species showed an aggregated pattern of spatial distribution over the scale of 10(1) to 10(-2) m. There was no correlation between the densities of the two bivalves nor was there any relationship between body condition and burying depth of Tapes philippinarum. However, individuals of Anomalocardia squamosa residing in the 2-4 cm depth stratum had a significantly higher condition index than their counterparts in the 0-2 cm stratum. The three-dimensional distribution pattern of the two bivalves in relation to density and presence of the other species was investigated by using tagging experiments in the laboratory whereby the exact three-dimensional position of the individuals was recorded in the form of an x,y,z coordinate. The same relative vertical distribution pattern of the bivalves as in the field was maintained while nearest neighbour analysis using the three- (x,y,z coordinates) or two-dimensional (only the x,y coordinates) data yielded different conclusions about the distribution pattern of the bivalves. The three-dimensional analysis consistently suggested an aggregated pattern whereas horizontal distribution was mostly random in the sediment matrix. Both horizontal, vertical and total displacement by individuals of Tapes philippinarum, but not Anomalocardia squamosa, were significantly affected by manipulations of the densities of conspecifics and/or A. squamosa. The latter species, however, was responsive to manipulations in terms of their burying depth. Both species showed considerable movements over the 2-week experimental period. The presence of a predator Portunus pelagicus did not significantly change the vertical distribution pattern of the two bivalves but the mortality of Tapes philippinarum was significantly higher than that of Anomalocardia squamosa. The results suggest that short-term responses such as emigration may be an important response to potential competitive interaction among infaunal bivalves and that such interaction may reduce the usefulness of long-term indicators such as growth and mortality. Whereas burying depth of infaunal bivalves may be influenced intra-specifically by trade-off between predation risk and hunger level, the soft tissue: shell weight (approximate to defence) ratio seems to be a more general predictor of vertical distribution in intra- as well as inter-specific comparisons.","UNIV HONG KONG,SWIRE INST MARINE SCI,HONG KONG,HONG KONG","Lee, SY (corresponding author), UNIV HONG KONG,DEPT ECOL & BIODIVERS,POKFULAM RD,HONG KONG,HONG KONG.",,"Lee, Joe S.

Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that AMF may increase the crop yield (number of fruits and their weight) and activity level of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD), enzymes that seemingly decrease infestation by arthropod pests. The most abundant arthropod species found were the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae, western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, and the seven-spot ladybird, Coccinella septempunctata. Sweet pepper mutualism with AMF significantly reduced colonization by the peach-potato aphid under greenhouse conditions. Aphid density increased, however, on two of four pepper varieties tested under open field conditions. The density of ladybird predators did not appear directly influenced by AMF under greenhouse conditions, whereas a significantly higher predator density was found on three out of four pepper plant varieties with fungal mutualism tested under field conditions. Crop yield was significantly higher on plants with AMF mutualism under greenhouse conditions, but no clear effects were detected under field conditions. Both PPO and POD activity increased significantly and remained higher than controls until day 14 of the experiment under mutualism with AMF, although only in the greenhouse. The results suggest that under greenhouse conditions, pepper plant mutualism with AMF can increase pepper yield by reducing the numbers of the key pest, peach-potato aphid.","[Balog, Adalbert; Balint, Janos; Benedek, Klara; Szabo, Karoly-Attila] Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transylvania, Fac Tech & Human Sci, Dept Hort, 1-C Sighisoarei St, Targu Mures, Corunca, Romania; [Loxdale, Hugh D.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Sir Martin Evans Bldg,Museum Ave, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Janosi-Rancz, Katalin-Tunde] Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transylvania, Fac Tech & Human Sci, Dept Math & Informat, 1-C Sighisoarei St, Targu Mures, Corunca, Romania; [Domokos, Erzsebet] Univ Med, Dept Fundamental Pharmaceut Sci Pharmaceut Bot &, Gheorghe Marinescu Str 38, Targu Mures, Romania","Balog, A (corresponding author), Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transylvania, Fac Tech & Human Sci, Dept Hort, 1-C Sighisoarei St, Targu Mures, Corunca, Romania.",adalbert.balog@ms.sapientia.ro,"Balint, Janos/B-8200-2013; Adalbert, Balog/AAR-4097-2021; Balog, Adalbert/O-9649-2019","Balint, Janos/0000-0002-0351-888X; Loxdale, Hugh David/0000-0002-6987-7172",,,,40,5,7,2,47,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

Yet, very little is known how animals gather and integrate information about environmental factors to fine tune investment. Observing the decisions and success of other individuals, particularly when those individuals initiate breeding earlier, may provide a way for animals to quickly arrive at better breeding investment decisions. Here we show, with a field experiment using artificial nests appearing similar to resident tit nests with completed clutches, that a migratory bird can use the observed high and low clutch size of a resident competing bird species to increase and decrease clutch size and egg mass, accordingly. Our results demonstrate that songbirds can discriminate between high and low quantity of heterospecific eggs, and that social information can have long-term physiological consequences affecting reproductive strategies. Such behaviour may help animals to better adapt to changing environments and lead to convergent traits with competitors.","[Forsman, Jukka T.; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas; Nykanen, Inka L.] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Forsman, JT (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",jukka.forsman@oulu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [122665, 125720]",We acknowledge the financial support provided by the Academy of Finland (project nos. 122665 and 125720).

There have been no preview studies on the freshwater fish distribution in Terraba. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine fish species richness, abundance and distribution there. Fish sampling was done using a combination of gears such as gill net, fine mesh net and visual observation. Thirty three species, 26 genera and 14 families were collected in four sampling sites along the river. The number and biomass captured during the entire study was 984 individuals and 147 410.9 g respectively. Most of them are carnivorous species (48%), 33.3% are omnivorous and 12% detritivorous, and only two species are herbivorous. The most important species in relative abundance (56.5%) and biomass (53.7%) in the study area was the machaca (Brycon behreae). It should be clear that although the list of fish species that occur in Terraba River is reasonably complete, knowledge of their ichthyogeographic history patterns is superficial. The main community component was secondary freshwater species; with 17 invading brackish water species and one introduced species (tilapia O. niloticus). Nine species are reported for the first time in this river. The diversity index H' varied from 2.32 (El Brujo) to 1.67 (Coto), a similar pattern was also showed for the other indexes. Most of our results were similar to those of previous studies on freshwater fish distribution elsewhere, however no significant correlation between species distribution and environmental variables was found, and we hypothesized that the depth and water velocity and geomorphological are major environmental variables that influence the fish distribution. Our findings are opposed to the tendency, for species composition, to increase from upstream to the mouth of the river, which is probably due to two major human activities (discharge of waste of pineapple fields and sediments in the main channel). These activities could constitute in the future a real threat for the fish population and other aquatic organisms. Growth rates, competition, predation pressures, community organization, biotic versus physical factors in relation to distribution, and many other aspects of fish biology remain to be studied. Future surveys will involve more quantitative surveys in different seasons and over time to monitor the long-teen variation in the diversity and abundance of freshwater fish species in Terraba. Rev.

Abundances of mites, rotifers, protozoans, and bacteria increased significantly with prey addition. Protozoan species richness also increased with increasing resource levels, whereas additional resources did not affect bacterial species richness. Increases in top-predator density decreased rotifer abundance but increased bacterial abundance and species richness. Increases in bacterial abundance and richness indicate that a trophic cascade occurs via the larvae, rotifer, and bacteria pathway; omnivory appears to be not strong enough to affect the trophic cascade. Top-down and bottom-up forces both had strong, but different, effects on the abundance and richness of intermediate trophic levels. For most components of the inquiline community, species richness and population sizes are resource limited, whereas predator limitation targets a limited set of groups.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Kneitel, JM (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",kneitel@bio.fsu.edu,,"Kneitel, Jamie/0000-0002-7841-1198",,,,59,111,115,2,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2002,83,3,,,,,680,688,,10.2307/3071873,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,523QY,WOS:000173967500010,,,,,2021-09-27,

In the intertidal zone, oysters engineer ecological communities by reducing temperature and desiccation stress, enhancing the availability of hard substrate for attachment, and by ameliorating biological interactions such as competition and predation. Using a field experiment manipulating shading, predator access and availability of shell substrate at four sites distributed over 900km of east Australian coastline, we investigated how the relative importance of these mechanisms of facilitation vary spatially. At all sites, and irrespective of environmental conditions, the provision of hard substrate by oysters enhanced the abundance and richness of invertebrates, in particular epibionts (barnacles and oyster spat) and grazing gastropods. Mobile arthropods utilised the habitat provided by disarticulated dead oysters more than live oyster habitat, whereas the abundance of polychaetes and bivalves were much greater in live oysters, suggesting the oyster filter-feeding activity is important for these groups. In warmer estuaries, shading by oysters had a larger effect on biodiversity, whereas in cooler estuaries, the provision of a predation refuge by oysters played a more important role. Such knowledge of how ecosystem engineering effects vary across environmental gradients can help inform management strategies targeting ecosystem resilience via the amelioration of specific environmental stressors, or conservation of specific community assemblages.","[McAfee, Dominic] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [McAfee, Dominic; Bishop, Melanie J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","McAfee, D (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.; McAfee, D (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",dominic.mcafee@adelaide.edu.au,"Mcafee, Dominic/ABD-5585-2020","McAfee, Dominic/0000-0001-8278-8169; Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP150101363]; Australian Postgraduate Award, Macquarie UniversityAustralian Government; Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University","This research was funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Grant DP150101363 to M.

One might therefore expect snail assemblages to be equilibrial and structured by interspecific interactions such as competition. If competition is strong and persistent throughout an assemblage, then it should manifest as density compensation (a negative correlation in population density between competitors) and be most pronounced for species pairs that are morphologically similar, as they should compete most strongly for resources. We assessed the degree to which terrestrial snails in the LEF exhibit density compensation, from both spatial and temporal perspectives. In general, density compensation was weak, especially from a spatial perspective. Moreover, the degree of density compensation was not significantly associated with dissimilarity in body size or shell shape. These results suggest that external factors such as predation or disturbance probably maintain population densities at low enough levels that the effects of interspecific competition do not become intense or persistent enough to mold patterns of assemblage structure for terrestrial snails.","[Bloch, Christopher P.] Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Bloch, CP (corresponding author), Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA.",cbloch@bridgew.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BSR-8811902, DEB 9411973, DEB 0080538, DEB 0218039]","This research was supported by grants BSR-8811902, DEB 9411973, DEB 0080538, and DEB 0218039 from NSF to the Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies, University of Puerto Rico, and to the International Institute of Tropical Forestry, USDA Forest Service, as part of the Long-Term Ecological Research Program in the Luquillo Experimental Forest.

During a three-year study of tadpole assemblage composition, we found that the anuran community used a variety of bodies of water for reproduction; these ranged from streams and streamside ponds to isolated forest ponds. The distribution of several tadpole species was negatively related to fish density, while other species coexisted with high densities of fish. Tadpole size did not ensure survival against fish, and few tadpoles avoided fish by hiding in the leaf litter. Controlled predation experiments using a single tadpole species in a no-choice situation were conducted over 24- to 48-hour periods. Nearly al species of tadpoles that occurred in habitats with high fish densities were unpalatable to fish (except Centrolenella oyampiensis), indicating that unpalatability is a major adaptation allowing tadpoles and fish to coexist in this system. Unpalatability (to fish), however, was nor an effective antipredator defense against odonate larvae, the other major tadpole predator in this system. The combination of predation pressure and the antipredator traits exhibited by individual species largely determined the composition of tadpole assemblages in individual bodies of water (alpha diversity). The heterogeneous distribution of predators among bodies water and the diversity of antipredator defenses exhibited by larva amphibians facilitated high diversity in this community (beta diversity).","Griffith Univ Gold Coast, Sch Environm & Appl Sci, Nathan, Qld 9726, Australia; Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia, Dept Ecol, BR-69011970 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; Univ Estado Rio Janero, Inst Biol, Sector Ecol, BR-20550 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; Griffith Univ, Div Australian Environm Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia","Hero, JM (corresponding author), Griffith Univ Gold Coast, Sch Environm & Appl Sci, PMB 50 Gold Coast MC, Nathan, Qld 9726, Australia.",,"Magnusson, William E/J-9408-2014; Catterall, Carla P/K-7996-2017; Rocha, Carlos Frederico D/A-6225-2013; Hero, Jean-Marc/A-4257-2010","Magnusson, William E/0000-0003-1988-3950; Catterall, Carla P/0000-0002-1914-0455; Rocha, Carlos Frederico D/0000-0003-3000-1242; ",,,,65,59,66,0,38,ASSOC TROPICAL BIOLOGY INC,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0006-3606,,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,MAR,2001,33,1,,,,,131,141,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2001.tb00163.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,436WX,WOS:000168959800012,,,,,2021-09-27,

In salt marshes in the Gulf of Mexico, the marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) is an abundant and conspicuous member of the community, climbing up the stems of marsh plants to remain out of the water at high tide. Though Littoraria are thought to primarily utilize stems of marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora as a source of food and refuge, Littoraria were more abundant in mixed assemblages of Spartina and Juncus roemerianus than in Spartina-only areas at the same tidal height. Mesocosm experiments confirmed that Juncus provided a refuge for Littoraria, with predation by Callinectes sapidus (but not Melongena corona) reduced when Juncus was present. However, Littoraria's utilization of Juncus as well as the effectiveness of Juncus as a refuge depended strongly on plant height: when Juncus was experimentally clipped to a shorter height than Spartina, snail abundance on Spartina and snail predation by crabs increased. Interestingly, this plant-animal refuge led to a corresponding refuge for Spartina from Littoraria: Spartina plants lost less biomass to snail grazing when growing with Juncus in mesocosm and field experiments, and Spartina plants in natural assemblages were taller when growing with Juncus than when growing alone, even in the presence of abundant snails. This example highlights the potential importance of plant-plant and plant-animal associational refuges in competitive plant assemblages.","Florida State Univ, Coastal & Marine Lab, St Teresa, FL 32358 USA","Hughes, AR (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Coastal & Marine Lab, 3618 Highway 98, St Teresa, FL 32358 USA.",rhughes@bio.fsu.edu,,,FSU; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0928279],"I thank Gerry Webb, Joy Webb, Jim Hughes, and Lillian Hughes for kindly providing access to field sites.

Interpretation of field survey data can be difficult, however, because species numbers in any case change with time and location, as a result of density dependence acting through or together with changing levels of food supply, predation, parasitism, interspecific competition, migration, environmental variables, and so on. As a first step toward resolving these difficulties it is argued that single-species microcosm experiments are needed that establish the joint effects on populations of stress levels and population density. Inter alia these will show how carrying capacity changes with stress levels in the absence of variation in other physical and biotic variables. Until now population effects of stressors have generally been assessed experimentally by calculating population growth rates in Life Table Response Experiments (LTREs), but these are time consuming and labor intensive and have only been performed at low population density. It is argued that measurements made at low density may underestimate population stress responses. To undertake the proposed experiments, faster and more efficient techniques for measuring population growth rates and their associated confidence intervals are needed, and some suggestions are made as to hew these might be achieved.","Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Div Zool, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England","Sibly, RM (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Div Zool, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England.",,,"Sibly, Richard/0000-0001-6828-3543",,,,17,57,60,0,9,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Both species have persisted in the lake for decades, but their water-column densities are negatively correlated. The larger Daphnia pulicaria dominates in some years, the smaller D. galeata mendotae in others, and in some years one species replaces the other seasonally. Although this pattern results in part from annual variation in vertebrate predation pressure, predation alone cannot explain the irregular daphnid dynamics. In 1992-1995, I examined the water-column abundances, birth and death rates of both species. D. pulicaria dominated in two years, D. galeata mendotae was replaced by D. pulicaria in one year and in 1994, both species persisted in low numbers. To test the effect of temporal changes on the strength of intra- and interspecific competition on both juvenile and adult daphnids, I manipulated a series of field enclosures in 1994 and 1995. The outcome of competition varied within and between years, and its effects were most evident at the highest densities and lowest resource levels. For adults of both species, the effects of interspecific competition were detected more often than those of intraspecific competition. Lipid reserves (a metric of fitness) among juveniles were generally low, with those of D. galeata mendotae often being less than those of D. pulicaria. Contrary to the results of other studies examining competition in daphnids, spatial segregation and predictable within year reversals in competitive dominance most likely do not play a large role in fostering coexistence of the Oneida Lake daphnids. Instead, coexistence of these competitors is promoted by interannual variation and long-lived diapausing eggs.","Cornell Univ, Ecol & Systemat Sect, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Caceres, CE (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",caceres@mail.inhs.uiuc.edu,,,,,,69,44,45,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,233,244,,10.1007/s004420050512,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700029,28308457,,,,2021-09-27,

C. gibba is widespread, abundant, and possesses characteristics such as fast growth which may confer a competitive advantage over endemic species like the commercial scallop Pecten fumatus Reeve, 1855. Experimental manipulations in the field showed that ambient densities of C. gibba significantly affected the size and growth of juvenile P. fumatus. This effect was greater than the effect of an equivalent number of conspecific scallops. C. gibba did not, however, affect scallop condition or survival in the short term, although the power of the test to detect a 50% decrease in survival was low. The percentage of experimental scallops lost to different sources of mortality was also unaffected by the presence of C. gibba, as was the density of predators found in experimental enclosures. This study is the first to experimentally demonstrate the impact of an introduced marine mollusc on an endemic species in Australia, A possible mechanism underlying this impact is competition for food, as both species are suspension feeders which live in an environment where resource limitation may occur.","Marine & Freshwater Resources Inst, Queenscliff, Vic 3225, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Talman, SG (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 11-115, Hamilton, New Zealand.",s.talman@niwa.cri.nz,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,49,16,16,1,12,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We constructed individual-based spatially explicit simulation models of two mixed conifer-angiosperm forests, growing on soils of contrasting phosphorus (P) availability, to investigate how browsing by invasive red deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) and granivory by invasive rodents (primarily house mouse Mus musculus) might alter forest dynamics. Models were parameterized with field data. Seedling growth and survival rates were estimated inside and outside deer exclosures. Seed predation rates were estimated at high and low rodent densities in mast and non-mast seeding years. For the alluvial terrace forest, which grew on P-rich soil, our model contained 15 tree species dominated by angiosperms; our model of the P-poor marine terrace forest contained seven species dominated by conifers. The two forest models were used to explore four 500-year scenarios: deer and rodents present, deer present and rodents absent, deer absent and rodents present, and deer and rodents absent. Our field studies revealed that the highest probabilities of seed predation by rodents occurred for two canopy species in mast years and in neighborhoods of high species-specific basal area, and that deer browsing had the greatest negative effects on the growth and survival rates of angiosperm seedlings. Our simulation models predicted that the presence of deer and rodents would reduce the abundances of canopy codominants, and hence total basal area, in the alluvial terrace forest. The presence of deer increased the dominance of conifers in both forests, but effects of deer and rodents were much stronger in the alluvial terrace forest. Our study revealed two emergent properties. First, rodent- and deer-induced reductions in seedling abundances did not always translate into reduced sapling and adult tree abundances. Second, when deer changed the abundance of a canopy dominant, other species were affected by altered interspecific competition. We conclude that the effects of invasive deer and rodents will be greatest in forests growing on P-rich soils. Exclusion of deer is predicted to have greater long-term effects on forest dynamics than exclusion of rodents.","[Forsyth, David M.; Gormley, Andrew M.] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm & Primary Ind, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; [Wilson, Deborah J.] Landcare Res, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Easdale, Tomas A.; Ruscoe, Wendy A.; Gormley, Andrew M.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Kunstler, Georges] Irstea, UR Ecosyst Montagnards, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Canham, Charles D.; Murphy, Lora] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Ruscoe, Wendy A.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Wright, Elaine F.] Dept Conservat, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Gaxiola, Aurora; Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Gaxiola, Aurora] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago, Chile","Forsyth, DM (corresponding author), Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm & Primary Ind, 123 Brown St, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia.",dave.forsyth@depi.vic.gov.au,"Wilson, Deborah J/B-8651-2008; Canham, Charles D/F-6161-2011; Kunstler, Georges/F-9179-2012; Ruscoe, Wendy A./A-5273-2018","Canham, Charles D/0000-0001-8361-9148; Kunstler, Georges/0000-0002-2544-1940; Ruscoe, Wendy A./0000-0002-7763-0356; Coomes, David/0000-0002-8261-2582; Wilson, Deborah/0000-0002-6401-3092; Easdale, Tomas/0000-0001-5086-8527; Gormley, Andrew/0000-0001-9833-7012",New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation via Ecosystem Resilience Outcome-Based Investment [C09X0502]; New Zealand Department of Conservation; Natural Environmental Research Council (UK)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; University of CambridgeUniversity of Cambridge,"This research was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation via Ecosystem Resilience Outcome-Based Investment (Contract C09X0502), investment of Landcare Research's retained earnings, the New Zealand Department of Conservation, the Natural Environmental Research Council (UK), the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, and University of Cambridge.

Three levels of pH (4.3, 4.6, or 6.0) and three levels of density (0, 30 or 60 embryos) were arranged in a blocked design and replicated three times for Hyla gratiosa. At the end of this experiment the effects of pH (4.3, 4.6, or 6.0), density of H. femoralis (30 or 60), and prior use by H. gratiosa (at 0, 30, or 60 larvae per tank) on the survival and growth of H. femoralis, were examined. Higher density increased larval period and decreased size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa. Lower pH decreased survival rate and also decreased size at metamorphosis. Body sodium concentrations were lowest at the low pH values. Lower pH increased the susceptibility of H. gratiosa tadpoles to the adverse effects of higher densities. For H. femoralis higher density decreased survival, increased larval period and decreased size at metamorphosis. Hyla femoralis also had lower survivorship at low pH and exhibited decreased size at metamorphosis. However, unlike the results with Hyla gratiosa, there were no interactive effects between pH and density for any of the life-history traits studied. The effect of previous colonization by H. gratiosa on H. femoralis survival was facilitative. Body sodium concentrations of H. femoralis were lowest at the highest pH value. Metamorphs of the same size had much lower levels of sodium in H. femoralis than H. gratiosa. In general, H. femoralis was less affected by pH variation than H. gratiosa. These results demonstrate that abiotic factors can interact strongly with biotic effects such as density and they suggest that interspecific interactions can be strongly modulated by the background abiotic environment.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,TALLAHASSEE,FL 32306","WARNER, SC (corresponding author), PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,MUELLER LAB 208,UNIV PK,PA 16802, USA.",,,,,,,45,51,54,0,25,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,88,3,,,,,331,339,,10.1007/BF00317575,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GP207,WOS:A1991GP20700005,28313793,,,,2021-09-27,

Via manipulation in a fully quantitative design, we delayed community development by excluding insect colonization in mouse and rat carcasses for 3 days, to study the role of early competitively dominant colonizers [burying beetles (Nicrophorus spp.; Coleoptera: Silphidae) and blowfly larvae (Diptera: Calliphoridae)] in the course of heterotrophic succession on small cadavers. Earlier studies demonstrated that in the case of large mammalian carrion, exclusion of insects' access to the carcass in the early stages of decomposition altered the successional trajectory and species assemblages. However, the effect of such manipulation in easy monopolizable small vertebrate carrion remained unknown. Our results demonstrate that delaying insect access to carrion significantly lowered blowfly larvae abundances, while it simultaneously had no effect on colonization and carrion burial by burying beetles. Higher abundances of blowfly larvae seem to deter necrophagous beetles, whereas they are not harmful to the larvae of flesh flies, at least in larger rat carcasses. Predatory beetle species preferred the lower abundances of blowfly larvae, presumably due to better accessibility of their prey. Our results therefore suggest that in the course of the entire season, larvae of blowflies are the dominant competitors in small carcasses, and significantly affect the assembly of other insect groups, whereas burying beetles may exhibit a more temporal pattern of dominance.","[Kadlec, J.; Mikatova, S.; Maslo, P.; Sipek, P.] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12844 2, Czech Republic; [Sipkova, H.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Sladecek, F.

This omnivorous configuration occurs frequently in food webs, but theory suggests that it is unstable unless stabilizing mechanisms exist that can decrease the strength of the omnivore and consumer interaction. Although these mechanisms have been documented in native food webs, little is known about whether they operate in the context of an introduced species. Here, we study a marine mussel aquaculture system where the introduction of omnivorous mussels should generate an unstable food web that favors the extinction of the consumer, yet it persists. Using field and laboratory approaches, we searched for stabilizing mechanisms that could reduce interaction strengths in the food web. While field zooplankton counts suggested that mussels influence the composition and abundance of copepods, stable isotope results indicated that life-history omnivory and cannibalism facilitated the availability of prey refugia, and reduced competition and the interaction strength between the mussel omnivore and zooplankton consumers. In laboratory experiments, however, we found no evidence of adaptive feeding which could weaken predator-consumer interactions. Our food web study suggests that the impact of an introduced omnivore may not only depend on its interaction with native species but also on the availability of stabilizing mechanisms that alter the strength of those interactions.","[Granados, Monica; Duffy, Sean; Fussmann, Gregor F.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [McKindsey, Christopher W.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Maurice Lamontagne, Mont Joli, PQ, Canada","Granados, M (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",monica.granados@mail.mcgill.ca,"McKindsey, Chris/AAH-6773-2020","McKindsey, Chris/0000-0002-3026-6454; Fussmann, Gregor/0000-0001-9576-0122; Granados, Monica/0000-0002-6750-9341",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [STPGP 365217],"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: STPGP 365217",,63,3,3,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We describe an experimental study of such mechanisms in a hybrid zone between the fire-bellied toad Bombina bombina and the yellow-bellied toad B. variegata. In this system, preference for different breeding habitats reduces the frequency of hybridization. A comparison of habitat ecology shows that the semi-permanent ponds in which B. bombina usually breeds have higher densities of aquatic predators than the temporary puddles typically used by B. variegata. We test for behavioural adaptations in tadpoles to these different levels of predation. B. bombina tadpoles are significantly less active than B. variegata, both before and after the introduction of a predator to an experimental arena; this reduces their vulnerability as many predators detect prey through movement. Behavioural differences translate into differential survival: B. variegata suffer higher predation rates in laboratory experiments with three main predator types (Triturus sp., Dytiscus larvae, Aeshna nymphs). This differential adaptation to predation will help maintain preference for alternative breeding habitats, and thus serve as a mechanism maintaining the distinctions between the two species.",,"Kruuk, LEB (corresponding author), UNIV EDINBURGH, INST CELL ANIM & POPULAT BIOL, W MAINS RD, EDINBURGH EH9 3JT, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND.",,"Kruuk, Loeske E.

In field experiments the densities of diatoms increased where C. volulator were removed, by spraying with insecticide, and where N. diversicolor were prevented from surface deposit feeding, by the insertion of porous mats under the surface. The mean daily rates of consumption of diatoms by individual C, volutator and N. diversicolor in the field were estimated to be 2150 to 3767 and 5476 to 12 184 cells respectively. In the laboratory the effects of C, volutator and N, diversicolor on the species composition of the diatom assemblage were similar.

Alien species are altering ecosystems around the globe. To predict and manage their impacts, the underlying mechanisms need to be understood. This is challenging in ecosystems undergoing multiple disturbances as unexpected interactions can alter the impact of individual disturbances. Such interactions are likely to be common in disturbed ecosystems, but have so far received little attention. 2. We investigated whether interactions between an invading shrimp Palaemon elegans and another human-induced disturbance, the population growth of a native mesopredator, the threespine stickleback, influences a third human-induced disturbance, the increase in biomass of filamentous algae. Increases in both the native mesopredator population and algal biomass have been promoted by eutrophication and a trophic cascade triggered by declining predatory fish stocks. 3. We used mesocosm and field enclosure experiments, combined with analyses of long-term trends in the abundance of the invader and the native mesopredator, to dissect the influence of the two species on algal biomass when alone and when co-occurring. 4. The impact of the invader on algal biomass depended on the native mesopredator; shrimp on their own had no effect on algal growth, but mitigated algae accumulation when competing with the stickleback for resources. Competition caused the shrimp to shift its diet from grazers to algae, and its habitat choice from open to vegetated habitats. The native mesopredator, in contrast, increased algal biomass irrespective of the presence of the invader, by preying on grazers and inducing a trophic cascade. 5. Our results show that the presence of a native mesopredator causes an invader to alter its behaviour and thereby its ecological impact. This demonstrates that interactions between invaders and other anthropogenic disturbances can alter the ecological impact of invaders, and, notably, that the impact of invaders can be positive and stabilize disturbed ecosystems. These results stress the importance of considering interactions among disturbances when investigating the ecological impact of alien species.","[Candolin, Ulrika; Bertell, Elina; Kallio, Jarkko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Helsinki, Finland","Candolin, U (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Helsinki, Finland.",ulrika.candolin@helsinki.fi,,"Candolin, Ulrika/0000-0001-8736-7793",Walter ja Andree de Nottbeckin Saatio; Svenska Kulturfonden; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [277667]; Koneen Saatio,"Walter ja Andree de Nottbeckin Saatio; Svenska Kulturfonden; Academy of Finland, Grant/Award Number: 277667; Koneen Saatio",,67,7,7,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The availability and consumption rates of propagules influence mangrove recruitment and can play a major role in their viability and restoration potential. We assess the potential trophic competition between Goniopsis cruentata and Ucides cordatus, two dominant crab species in the New World, by experimentally comparing herbivory levels between forest stands with varying crab abundance. We hypothesize that herbivory rates (HR) of G. cruentata will be lower in mangroves where it coexists with U. cordatus than in mangroves where U. cordatus is absent. The removal of Rhizophora mangle propagules was very rapid, and HR were overall high and increased through time. However, HR did not differ significantly between mangroves with and without the potential trophic competitor U. cordatus. Our study did not support previous literature indications of food competition between these two crab species, which seem to have developed strategies for competition avoidance.","[Wellens, Siel; Sandrini-Neto, Leonardo; Lana, Paulo] Univ Fed Parana, Ctr Marine Studies CEM, Lab Benth Ecol, BR-83255976 Pontal Do Parana, Parana, Brazil; [Gonzalez-Wangueemert, Mercedes] Univ Algarve, Ctr Ciencias Mar CCMAR, CIMAR Lab Assoc, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal","Wellens, S (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Ctr Marine Studies CEM, Lab Benth Ecol, Av Beira Mar S-N, BR-83255976 Pontal Do Parana, Parana, Brazil.",siel.wellens@gmail.com,"Lana, Paulo C/A-9325-2010; Gonzalez-Wanguemert, Mercedes/M-3467-2013","Lana, Paulo C/0000-0002-8464-3382; Gonzalez-Wanguemert, Mercedes/0000-0002-0656-358X; Sandrini-Neto, Leonardo/0000-0003-4086-6741",Universidade Federal do Parana; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BPD/70689/2010]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [IF/00998/2014],"We thank Universidade Federal do Parana for the financial support, and Dr. Marcelo Antonio Amaro Pinheiro for his insights.

We tested whether changes in population density of a large herbivore (elk, Cervus canadensis) affected sex-specific group size and whether the response was density- or frequency-dependent. We quantified the probability and strength of changes in group sizes and dispersion as population density changed for each sex. We used group size data from a population of elk in Manitoba, Canada, that was experimentally reduced from 1.20 to 0.67 elk/km(2) between 2002 and 2009. Our results indicated that functional responses of group size to population density are sex-specific. Females showed a positive density-dependent response in group size at population densities >= 0.70 elk/km(2) and we found evidence for a minimum group size at population density <= 0.70 elk/km(2). Changes in male group size were also density-dependent; however, the strength of the relationship was lower than for females. Density dependence in male group size was predominantly a result of fusion of solitary males into larger groups, rather than fusion among existing groups. Our study revealed that density affects group size of a large herbivore differently between males and females, which has important implications for the benefits e.g., alleviating predation risk, and costs of social behaviors e. g., competition for resources and mates, and intra-specific pathogen transmission.","[Vander Wal, Eric; van Beest, Floris M.; Brook, Ryan K.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Anim & Poultry Sci, Coll Agr & Bioresources, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada; [Vander Wal, Eric] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada","Vander Wal, E (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Anim & Poultry Sci, Coll Agr & Bioresources, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",eric.vander.wal@usherbrooke.ca,"van Beest, Floris M./C-6745-2019","van Beest, Floris M./0000-0002-5701-4927","Parks Canada Agency; PrioNet Canada; National Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Manitoba Conservation; Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives; Canadian Food Inspection Agency; University of Manitoba; University of Saskatchewan; Riding Mountain Biosphere Reserve; Louisiana Pacific; Nature Conservancy of Canada; Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation; Manitoba Wildlife Federation; Eastlands Wildlife Association; Westlake Wildlife Association; Earth Rhythms Inc.; Seven Oaks Game and Fish; Global Precision Inc.","Funding was provided primarily by Parks Canada Agency and PrioNet Canada.

Direct and indirect effects of native predators and competitors on invasive lionfish,CORAL REEFS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competition; Consumptive effects; Groupers; Non-consumptive effects; Invasive species control,RED LIONFISH; ECOLOGY; METAANALYSIS; FISHES; DRIVEN,"Biotic resistance is the ability of an ecological community to prevent or limit the establishment or success of non-indigenous species. Native species can confer resistance by outcompeting or directly consuming non-native invaders. The fear of being eaten could also limit invader success, but non-consumptive effects of native predators have rarely been documented as a source of biotic resistance. Here, we test whether native groupers on Caribbean coral reefs can promote biotic resistance to invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish through competition, consumption, and/or through non-consumptive effects. Stomach content analysis of more than 200 groupers, comprising five species, revealed no instances of predation on lionfish. To test for competitive and non-consumptive effects of groupers, we released tagged juvenile lionfish onto reef patches that varied in grouper densities and monitored lionfish behaviours over five weeks. At dawn, during peak grouper and lionfish hunting times, juvenile lionfish hid more on reefs with more grouper predators. Juvenile lionfish were also less active during the day on reefs with high grouper densities. Hiding and inactivity are incompatible with foraging and thus should result in lionfish eating fewer prey and having reduced somatic growth rates. Although there was no substantial effect of interspecific competition on lionfish behaviours, we found that lionfish swam greater distances with increasing densities of intraspecific competitors at dawn. We did not detect a cascading effect of grouper predators on smaller fishes, perhaps because the seasonal peak in prey fish recruitment masked the effects of lower lionfish predation. Fear of native predators by lionfish has the potential to reduce invader foraging success, although it might not fully mitigate the negative effects on native prey communities. Efforts to rebuild grouper populations throughout the Caribbean may still aid in controlling the lionfish invasion despite weak evidence of interspecific competition and lack of direct predation on lionfish, but further research is needed. At broader scales, our findings highlight that the global depletion of large predators can have implications beyond demographic effects on prey.","[Smith, Nicola S.; Cote, Isabelle M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Smith, NS (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",nicolas@sfu.ca,,,Organization of American States Graduate Scholarship; Bullitt Foundation Environmental Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery grantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank Jocelyn Curtis-Quick, Fiona Francis, Kyla Jeffrey, Helen Yan, Emma Atkinson, and Adrienne Berchtold for assistance collecting data in the field.

However, how range shifts will alter biotic interactions and community structure in alpine streams is not well understood. In the Pyrenees, climate-induced physicochemical habitat change is hypothesized to facilitate the colonization of high-altitude streams by Perla grandis, a carnivorous stonefly. A field-based experiment was conducted in mesocosm channels beside a hillslope spring (2000 m asl) in the Taillon-Gabietous catchment, French Pyrenees. The influence of P. grandis predation on community structure, feeding trait composition, body-size spectrum, and algal chlorophyll a concentration was examined. Gut contents were analyzed and used to identify consumed prey. Total invertebrate density was not significantly reduced by P. grandis, but Baetis spp. densities were depressed in the treatment channels through a combination of direct consumption and predator avoidance (emigration/drift). However, despite fewer grazers in the predator treatment channels, the magnitude of the trophic cascade effect on basal resources (measured as chlorophyll a density) was comparable between treatment and control channels. The results of this experiment suggest that size/species-specific predation, intraguild predation, and interference competition are the likely mechanisms that altered the body-size spectrum in treatment channels. In synergy with climate-driven physicochemical habitat change, the extinction risk of some range-restricted taxa (prey and other predators) could be increased where P. grandis colonization occurs. Hence, conservation efforts are required to ensure that additional anthropogenic stressors (e.g., nutrient enrichment, cattle trampling, hydropower development, ski runs, and tourism) are limited to minimize further pressures on these unique and sensitive habitats.","[Khamis, K.; Hannah, D.

In this study, we define patterns of local distribution and recruitment of two common intertidal chthamalid barnacles (Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus) at 15 sites along the shore of central Chile. Surveys revealed patterns of adult distribution to be consistent across the study region; Jehlius was numerically dominant at the highest intertidal levels and Notochthamalus was more abundant at lower shore levels. Despite slight spatial segregation, our results show that there is ample overlap in the distribution of these species, with inter-specific mixing over scales of few centimeters, occurring over 60-80% of the entire barnacle zone. Recruitment rates of the two species were highly correlated among sites (separated by kms), suggesting similar determinants of onshore larval transport between these species. Additionally, we found evidence that Notochthamalus was recruitment limited while Jehlius experienced higher post-settlement mortality. Densities of established individuals were generally positively correlated at scales of just 25 cm(2) and largely uncorrelated over scales of 2500 cm(2) across sites and tidal levels, indicating that asymmetric inter-specific competition is unlikely to affect adult populations. After monitoring individuals under various crowding conditions (single individuals, surrounded by conspecifics, and surrounded by heterospecifics) and at different tide elevations for more than a year, we found no evidence of negative intra- or inter-specific effects on individual growth rates. We conclude that lottery-type interactions and species-specific post-settlement mortality rather than an inter-specific competitive hierarchy likely determine patterns of coexistence of Jehlius and Notochthamalus in central Chile.

We determined the distribution of both species in 166 lakes in the District of Muskoka, south-central Ontario, Canada-the watershed with the longest history and largest prevalence of Bythotrephes invasions in North America. The frequency of occurrence of Leptodora was substantially reduced (twofold) in the presence of Bythotrephes. We argue that Bythotrephes is responsible for this dramatic reduction in the frequency of occurrence of Leptodora. Lakes in which both species co-occurred could not be distinguished from invaded lakes without Leptodora, suggesting a pattern of species replacement at a watershed level. We believe this is the first account of the widespread replacement of a native, pelagic macroinvertebrate predator by Bythotrephes in North America, and it does not bode well for Leptodora given the rapid, ongoing spread of Bythotrephes.","[Weisz, Erika J.; Yan, Norman D.] York Univ, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Yan, Norman D.] Dorset Environm Sci Ctr, Dorset, ON P0A 1E0, Canada","Weisz, EJ (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Biol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",erikaweisz@gmail.com,"Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013","Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865","Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Ontario Ministry of the Environment; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR); Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH)","Support for this research was provided by the Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant to NDY, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) and the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH).

The genus is almost worldwide in distribution, on tropical and temperate shores, with currently over twenty recognised species. The majority of members of this genus commonly occur in the middle and upper intertidal. At the global scale (1000s km), the four currently recognised informal groups of Chthamalus exhibit a regional endemicity that has probably resulted from tectonic events during the last 70-90 Ma. The 'challengeri' and 'fissus' groups are thought to be the most ancestral within Chthamalus. Their extant distributions derive from the late Cretaceous. The 'malayensis' and 'stellatus' groups are assumed to be more derived and are probably sister taxa. The latter two groups exhibit overlap with the apparently more ancient 'challengeri' and 'fissus' groups. Abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, desiccation, aspect, winds and fetch) together with biotic factors (e.g. supply-side) all affect the distribution of Chthamalus species at regional (100s km) and local (1-10s km) scales. The relationship between these factors and Chthamalus distributions has best been studied in the north-east Atlantic species C. stellatus and C. montagui and to a lesser extent in the western Atlantic species C. fragilis. Microhabitat (within shore) patterns of distribution in Chthamalus barnacles are controlled by biotic (e.g. supply-side, competition, predation and grazer/algal interactions) and abiotic (e.g. shading and run-off) factors. The highly fluctuating temperatures and desiccation stress that Chthamalus species experience when aerially exposed at low tide appear to have a major deterministic effect on species distributions, often limiting the vertical distribution of Chthamalus species on the shore. On sheltered shores, the abiotic stress due to minimal wave splash may be more important than biotic factors, while on moderately exposed and exposed shores, that can be supplied with many propagules and where density-dependent factors come into play, biotic factors may be more important. Abiotic factors may also scale up to explain large scale patterns of distribution, such as trends in Chthamalus abundance between NE and SE Atlantic coasts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Tree cavities are important but limited resources in most forests; thus, some invasive mammals can be serious competitors for native cavity-using species, especially cavity-nesting birds. Despite the potential impact, such inter-class competition has rarely been considered. We examined the possibility of resource competition for tree cavities between the invasive raccoon Procyon lotor and the native Ural owl Strix uralensis. Both species are nocturnal and use tree cavities during daytime. We assessed an overlap in cavity use for both species as an indication of potential competition by monitoring 341 cavities during their breeding season in a natural park in Hokkaido, Japan. Of 341 potentially available cavities, raccoons and Ural owls used 37 and 32, respectively. The characteristics of 58 cavities used by raccoons or owls were compared to 49 random cavities to determine if they selected cavities with certain characteristics. As predicted from a large amount of tree cavities and a low raccoon density in this managed forest, we did not find direct evidence of competition, such as physical interaction, intrusion to cavities, or habitat segregation. Cavity types used by both species overlapped considerably in terms of height, entrance size, depth, and other characteristics: their habitats were widely overlapped. Further, in four cavities, one species was replaced by the other. Given the similar habitat requirements, the invasive raccoon could be a potential competitor for Ural owl when raccoon density increases and/or cavity availability decreases, which is the case for many forests in Japan. This study suggests that potential threats of resource competition among not only closely but also distantly related taxa should be taken into consideration when studying the impacts of invasive species.","[Kobayashi, Fumiya; Koizumi, Itsuro] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan; [Toyama, Masahiro; Koizumi, Itsuro] Hokkaido Univ, Creat Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan","Koizumi, I (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan.",itsuro@cris.hokudai.ac.jp,"Koizumi, Itsuro/D-4222-2009",,Fujiwara Natural History Foundation,"We appreciated valuable comments by Teru Yuta and two anonymous reviewers on the earlier version of the manuscript.

Many invasive marine crabs (infraorder Brachyura) are regarded as particularly capable consumers; however, native crabs can also exert significant influence on community structure. We used marine crabs as a focal group to test whether non-native consumers have greater impacts than native consumers on native prey populations by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of 834 crab foraging experiments. In addition to the effect of crab origin (non-native or native) on prey abundance, we examined the effects of interaction type (direct or indirect), prey type, and experimental design. Overall, direct consumption by non-native crabs did not reduce prey abundance more than predation by native crabs, although the magnitude of reductions in prey abundance varied with prey type and experimental design. Indirect inter actions with crabs (i. e. through trophic cascades with crabs as the initiators) generally increased the abundance of native species. The direct and indirect impacts of non-native crabs were significantly greater than those of native crabs on primary producers and in simplified experiments with low species diversity. Thus, detecting differences between native and non-native crabs may be heavily influenced by experimental design. Importantly, we found few studies that considered direct interactions (competitive or predatory) between native and non-native crabs. These inter actions should be a focus of future research because they could greatly alter consumption rates and overall prey mortality in the wild.","[Howard, Brett R.; Cote, Isabelle M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Therriault, Thomas W.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Pacific Biol Stn, Nanaimo, BC V9T 6N7, Canada","Howard, BR (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",brett.howard@sfu.ca,"Therriault, Thomas W./AAS-5883-2020; Howard, Brett/AAG-7444-2020","Therriault, Thomas W./0000-0002-6215-3331; Howard, Brett/0000-0003-4103-1324",Second Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN II); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Funding was provided by a scholarship from the Second Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN II) to B.R.H. and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant to I.M.C.,,77,9,9,6,57,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We used a series of laboratory reconstructions of the detritus-based food web in the leaves of the northern pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea to test the hypothesis that interactions at higher trophic levels could control bacterial densities and community structure. The typical pitcher community is composed of a basal-level bacterial assemblage, bacterivorous protozoa and rotifers, and larvae of the pitcher plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii. Using organisms isolated from natural pitchers, we constructed food webs comprising 1-4 consumer species tall possible combinations of the presence and absence of Colpoda, Cyclidium, Bodo, and Wyeomyia larvae) along with a constant bacterial species pool in a factorial design experiment. Bacterial community structure was modified by the direct effects of grazing by protozoa and mosquito larvae, by the indirect effects of competitive interactions among the three protozoans, and by the cascading effects of predation by mosquito larvae. Each combination of grazers/predators produced a different, species-specific pattern of bacterial species relative abundances. Changes in nutrient supplies and other abiotic characteristics of the microcosm environment resulting from the feeding activities of Wyeomyia and the protozoa also had indirect effects on bacterial species profiles. We found an apparent trophic cascade that was mediated by the species composition and relative abundances of the intermediate-level protozoan grazers. Our data support the hypothesis that Wyeomyia smithii serves as a keystone predator in the pitcher community. Mosquito larvae were responsible for the overall architecture of the pitcher food web and the subsequent interactions among grazers and the basal-level bacterial community. At low densities, mosquito larvae controlled patterns of coexistence among protozoan species by modifying competitive interactions, while at normal field densities, Wyeomyia rapidly drove the two ciliates to extinction but permitted continued existence of heterotrophic microflagellates. Wyeomyia larvae also played a dominant role in structuring the bacterial assemblage. Bacterial species profiles in food webs containing Wyeomyia were more similar to each other than to the patterns observed in webs without mosquito larvae. Our results suggest that the interactions among members of microbial communities are just as complex as those observed in plant and animal communities and require study at the species level. Because interactions among higher trophic levels can cascade down to the microbial level, it is therefore appropriate to consider the microbes as integral parts of the entire ecosystem, not merely as decomposers or food resources, but as fully interacting members of the community.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60015 USA","Cochran-Stafira, DL (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,102,106,110,3,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1998,79,3,,,,,880,898,,10.2307/176587,,,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZG985,WOS:000073060300012,,,,,2021-09-27,

Eggs of three Sympetrum species were collected on October 2005 at Akita prefecture located at north of Japan, and the eggs had been laid on soil surface of paddy field till April 2006. The eggs (3 trays with 50 eggs each) were held under four constant temperatures (8, 13, 18 and 23A degrees C) with a photoperiod (L:D 14:10; relative light intensity 3,000 Lux) and 23A degrees C in darkness. No S. infuscatum eggs, but 67 and 60% S. frequens and S. darwinianum hatched in constant darkness. This result suggests that S.frequens and S.darwinianum do not require light for hatching, but S.infuscatum requires light for hatching. Eggs of S. darwinianum and S. infuscatum did not hatch at 8A degrees C. In S. frequens, some eggs hatched but the hatching rate was significantly lower at 8A degrees C than at higher temperatures (P < 0.05). At higher temperatures, the hatching rate did not differ significantly for three Sympetrum species. At 13A degrees C, S. infuscatum hatched fastest, 0.18 for S. infuscatum, 0.11 for S. darwinianum and 0.08 for S. frequens. The mean head width of second stadium larva of S. frequens, S. darwinianum and S. infuscatum were 0.4 +/- A 0.01, 0.4 +/- A 0.01 and 0.6 +/- A 0.01 mm (SD), respectively. These results suggest that S. infuscatum may have a competitive advantage over S. frequens and S. darwinianum under conditions that favor S. infuscatum through hatching speed.","[Jinguji, Hiroshi] Miyagi Univ, Taihaku Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9820215, Japan; [Tuyuzaki, Hiroshi] Akita Prefectural Univ, Akita 0100444, Japan; [Ueda, Tetsuyuki] Ishikawa Prefectural Coll, Nonoshi, Ishikawa 9218836, Japan","Jinguji, H (corresponding author), Miyagi Univ, Taihaku Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9820215, Japan.",jinguji@myu.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18780188]","We are grateful to Y.

We found no significant density-dependent effects on either the predator or prey species, likely due to meiofaunal prey oversupply; however, the diet composition of the prey species Sillago spp. changed significantly in the presence of their potential predator.

A key objective of the eradication is to reduce storm petrel predation by burrowing owls Athene cunicularia, which stopover on the island during their fall migration. Mouse trapping and field surveys of both owls and depredated storm petrel carcasses conducted during 2000-2012 reveal a strongly seasonal, inter-related pattern among the three species: When owls arrive during the fall, mice are super-abundant and the overwhelming choice of prey for those owls that remain. In the winter, the mouse population crashes just as storm petrels begin to arrive in large numbers; owls that remain on the island switch to preying upon storm petrels until May, when they depart to breed. Capture-recapture analyses of storm petrels showed (1) annual adult survival was inversely related to owl abundance, especially during January-April, and (2) storm petrels demonstrated a declining trend in abundance 2006-2012. The latter was associated with low rates of adult survival, high abundance of overwintering burrowing owls, and high incidence of depredated storm petrels. To evaluate projected impacts to storm petrels of a change in owl predation, we developed a Leslie matrix model, incorporating environmental stochasticity. We modeled future storm petrel population trajectories, allowing for different levels of owl-mediated predation. Our results suggest that a reduction in owl abundance, a projected consequence of the elimination of mice, has the potential to substantially reduce overall storm petrel mortality, thereby reducing storm petrel declines and increasing the likelihood of stable trends in the future. While long-term benefits to storm petrels of mouse eradication are apparent, the risk of increased predation due to prey-switching by owls also needs to be addressed. This study highlights uncertainty of outcomes, which must be considered in evaluating management impacts. This study demonstrates the value of concurrent, continuous, long-term datasets in providing a quantitative basis for management to aid the conservation of species of concern.","[Nur, Nadav; Bradley, Russell W.; Salas, Leo; Warzybok, Pete; Jahncke, Jaime] Point Blue Conservat Sci, 3820 Cypress Dr 11, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA; [Bradley, Russell W.] Calif State Univ Channel Isl, One Univ Dr, Camarillo, CA 93012 USA","Nur, N (corresponding author), Point Blue Conservat Sci, 3820 Cypress Dr 11, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA.",nnur@pointblue.org,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service [81640-5-J046, 81640AJ008]; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; Bently Foundation; Baker Trust; Marisla Foundation; Mead Foundation; Campini Foundation; Bernice Barbour Foundation; Kimball Foundation; RHE Charitable Foundation; Volgenau Foundation","We thank all of the Farallon biologists who supervised these studies, and all of the volunteer field assistants who helped collect the data.

During early ontogeny, the growth and survival of larval fish often depends on food availability. Because habitat and diet shifts are strongly tied to individual body size, factors that influence the growth rates of individuals (e.g. resource limitation, competition) also affect other aspects of ontogeny including the timing of habitat or diet shifts. In the context of biological invasions, non-native species can potentially disrupt the interaction of larval fish with their food via competition for shared prey, reducing growth and survival during a vulnerable period of an organism's life history. We hypothesised that invasive planktivores negatively affect native species through the vulnerable larval life stage via competition for zooplankton resources. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments to assess and contrast the effects of invasive (bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and native (golden shiners, Notemigonus crysoleucas) planktivores on zooplankton densities, and their effects on the growth, survival, abundance, and habitat use of larval bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Overall, the effects of the invasive planktivore were consistently greater than the native planktivore in terms of reduced prey densities, reduced bluegill growth rates, and delays to the timing of ontogenetic habitat shifts. Growth rates of bluegill larvae were reduced by 58-87% in the presence of bighead carp and 37% in the presence of golden shiners (relative to controls), but such reductions did not consistently lead to reduced survival (in mesocosm experiment) or relative abundance (in pond experiment). However, we estimated that bighead carp and golden shiners delayed ontogenetic habitat shifts in bluegill by 9-24 and 1-3 days, respectively. Although we did not detect an effect of planktivores on the numbers of larval bluegill, our findings suggest that bighead carp may still affect bluegill ontogeny and freshwater food webs by disrupting the timing of ontogenetic habitat shifts. By affecting the coupling of habitats via organism movements during early ontogeny, bighead carp may indirectly disrupt predator-prey interactions of native taxa.","[Fletcher, Cameron M.; Collins, Scott F.; Nannini, Michael A.; Wahl, David H.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL USA; [Fletcher, Cameron M.; Collins, Scott F.; Wahl, David H.] Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA; [Nannini, Michael A.] Sam Parr Biol Stn, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Kinmundy, IL USA","Collins, SF (corresponding author), Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA.",collscot@illinois.edu,,"Collins, Scott/0000-0002-9405-1495",Illinois Department of Natural Resources [CAFWS-93],"Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Grant/Award Number: CAFWS-93",,52,6,6,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Its occurrence in southeast Florida extends along nearly 70km of coastline, from near the Port of Miami, Miami-Dade County, northward to Deerfield Beach, Broward County. It occurs abundantly as an epizoite on octocorals, attaining population densities of 25 individuals and more per 10-cm long octocoral stem. The surface texture of octocoral hosts (rough, smooth) did not affect the densities of the ophiuroid epizoites, and there were significantly greater abundances on octocorals during two winter sampling periods than in the summer. Beige and orange-coloured morphs are sometimes present on the same octocoral stem. Gut content analysis supported a suspension feeding mode, revealing essentially identical ingested items in both colour morphs with a preponderance of amorphous detritus and filamentous algae. Molecular genetic evidence (COI & 16s) has established the identity of O. mirabilis and its relationship to invasive Brazilian populations. The orange and beige morphs form two distinct, but closely related lineages that may represent two separate introductions. The orange morph shares haplotypes with Brazilian and Caribbean specimens suggesting a further range expansion of the 'original' invasion. The beige morph, however, shares haplotypes with specimens from the Mexican Pacific and Peru and potentially represents a secondary introduction. Traits promoting dispersal and establishment of this species in new habitats are manifold: vagility and ability to cling tightly to diverse host taxa (e.g. sponges, cnidarians, bryozoans, and echinoderms), frequent asexual reproduction (fissiparity), suspension feeding, including a wide range of dietary items, possession of integument-covered ossicles and arm spines offering protection from predators, and an effective competitive edge over associated microbiota for substrate space.","[Glynn, Peter W.; Gillette, Phillip] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Alitto, Renata] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Dominguez, Joshua; Martinez, Nicolas] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Undergrad Marine & Atmospher Sci Program, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Christensen, Ana B.] Lamar Univ, Dept Biol, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA; [Riegl, Bernhard M.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Dania, FL USA; [Dettloff, Kyle] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL USA","Glynn, PW (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",pglynn@rsmas.miami.edu,,"Dettloff, Kyle/0000-0001-8512-2733; Alitto, Renata/0000-0001-9732-4877",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2018/10313-0],"We thank Gordon Hendler for the initial identification of Ophiothela, Herman Wirshing and Charles Messing for identifying octocoral host species, Cristina Diaz for identifying sponges and Larry E.

Mosquito larvae are their most common prey. Holes colonized naturally by predators and prey had lower densities of mosquitoes if odonates were present than if they were absent. Using artificial tree holes placed in the field, we tested the effects of odonates on their mosquito prey while controlling for the quantity and species of predator, hole volume, and nutrient input. In large and small holes with low nutrient input, odonates depressed the number of mosquitoes present and the number that survived to pupation. Increasing nutrient input (and consequently, mosquito abundance) to abnormally high levels dampened the effect of predation when odonates were relatively small. However, the predators grew faster with higher nutrients, and large larvae in all three genera reduced the number of mosquitoes surviving to pupation, even though the abundance of mosquito larvae remained high. Size-selective predation by the odonates is a likely explanation for this result; large mosquito larvae were less abundant in the predator treatment than in the controls. Because species assemblages were similar between natural and artificial tree holes, our results suggest that odonates are keystone species in tree holes on BCI, where they are the most common large predators.",,"Fincke, OM (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA,DEPT ZOOL,NORMAN,OK 73019, USA.",,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136; Yanoviak, Stephen/0000-0001-6425-1413",,,,45,79,84,2,21,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1997,112,2,,,,,244,253,,10.1007/s004420050307,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YA693,WOS:A1997YA69300015,28307577,,,,2021-09-27,

Reestablishing fire has been proposed as a mechanism to restore dominance of native plants in grasslands invaded by nonnative plants, yet fire may function differently in these altered systems, potentially affecting animals in novel ways. To assess whether invasions by nonnative plants alter the effects of fire on animals, we performed a manipulative experiment in semi-desert grasslands of southeastern Arizona that have been invaded by a perennial, nonnative grass from Africa, Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana). We applied fire to 36 of 54 1-ha plots established along an invasion gradient where dominance of E. lehmanniana ranged from 0% to 91% of total live plant biomass. Over the 5-year period from 2000 to 2004, we used mark-recapture methods to assess how population and community attributes of small mammals varied along the gradient of nonnative grass and in response to fire. We quantified changes in presence of 17 species, abundance of 9 species, total abundance of all species combined, species richness, and species composition. Based on 11,226 individual mammals from 24 species, we found that effects of nonnative-grass dominance varied with habitat preferences of each species, resulting in composition of the small-mammal community changing predictably along the invasion gradient. As dominance of nonnative grass increased, presence and abundance of granivorous heteromyids and insectivores (e. g., Chaetodipus, Perognathus, Onychomys; pocket mice and grasshopper mice) decreased, whereas presence and abundance of omnivorous and herbivorous murids (e. g., Reithrodontomys, Sigmodon; harvest mice and cotton rats) increased. Species richness of the small-mammal community averaged 8.4 species per plot and was highest at intermediate levels of nonnative-grass dominance where vegetation heterogeneity was greatest. Abundance of all small mammals combined averaged 26.9 individuals per plot and did not vary appreciably with nonnative-grass dominance. During the 4- to 8-week period immediately after fire, abundance of 6 of the 9 most common species changed, with 5 species decreasing and 1 species increasing on burned plots relative to unburned plots. During this same time period, species richness of small mammals decreased by an average of 3 species (38%) and total abundance of all species combined decreased by an average of 16 individuals (61%) on burned plots relative to unburned plots. Effects of fire on vegetation biomass, on presence of 9 of 17 mammalian species, and on abundance of 4 of 9 mammalian species remained evident >= 2 years after fire. Effects of fire on most small-mammal species varied with the degree of nonnative-grass dominance, suggesting that fire functioned differently in areas invaded by nonnative plants relative to areas dominated by native plants. Specifically, effects of fire on presence of 12 of 14 species and abundance of 7 of 9 species varied along the gradient of E. lehmanniana. During this post-fire period, however, composition of the small-mammal community in areas dominated by nonnative grass transitioned towards composition of areas dominated by native grasses, suggesting that fires had some restorative effect on habitat for small mammals. The relative strength of this effect will likely depend in general on the structural and compositional contrasts between invaded and native plant communities. Despite the reported neffectiveness of fire at reducing dominance of nonnative plants, restoring fire to grasslands invaded by nonnative plants can help maintain the mosaic of vegetation conditions necessary to support the diverse assemblage of animals that inhabit these fire-governed ecosystems.

We demonstrate estimation of environmental limits for a threatened species using a novel combination of response modeling techniques. Our study species was Litoria olongburensis (wallum sedgefrog), which has a biphasic lifecycle (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adult phases) with larvae developing in naturally acidic wetlands of coastal sandy lowlands (wallum) of subtropical eastern Australia. Land development in, and around, areas occupied by the frog is the main cause of the species' decline, while climate change is emerging as a new threat. The species will continue to decline where these processes destroy, fragment or degrade habitat. We surveyed waterbodies throughout the latitudinal range of the species' distribution, recording wallum sedgefrog density and environmental variables including abiotic waterbody characteristics, key vegetation types, potential competitors and potential predators. For each environmental variable, we tested the fit of increasingly complex response models to the highest possible quantile of wallum sedgefrog density. The best-fitting model indicated the most likely response, if any, to the variable. This model was then applied to estimate environmental limits. Our analysis indicated wallum sedgefrogs were less likely to occur in waterbodies with pH outside 3.53-4.61 (+/- 0.11) and maximum water depth outside 23.4-46.0 (+/- 3.5) cm, and their density decreased with increasing densities of eastern sedgefrogs, wallum froglets and common froglets. The optimal pH levels and water depths indicated by our analysis provide a necessary baseline for predicting and responding to impacts on wallum sedgefrogs caused by changes in land use or climate. The negative relationship with eastern sedgefrogs supports the hypothesis that competition from eastern sedgefrogs is the mechanism that limits occurrence of wallum sedgefrogs in higher pH wetlands. The modeling framework that we developed for our study can be applied to improve management of other species exposed to anthropogenic threats including climate change.","[Shuker, Jon D.; Simpkins, Clay A.; Hero, Jean-Marc] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Environm Futures Res Inst, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia","Shuker, JD (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Environm Futures Res Inst, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",jon.shuker@griffithuni.edu.au,,"Shuker, Jon/0000-0002-0813-7402",FKP Pty Ltd; Griffith UniversityGriffith University,"Surveys were conducted with permission of the New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change (license number S12717) and the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency (permit number WITK05620308).

Corophium volutator (Pallas), a burrowing amphipod abundant in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, frequently interacts with the eastern mudsnail, Ilyanassa obsoleta (Say), as both species utilize similar habitats and food resources. Typically these interactions result in negative effects on C. volutator. There is evidence that Corophium species exhibit avoidance behaviour when interacting with other species, but whether such a response occurs in the presence of I. obsoleta is unknown. To investigate C. volutator response to I. obsoleta. total C. volutator abundance and vertical distribution within the sediment was examined in a field experiment involving I. obsoleta enclosures and exclosures at two mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy. I. obsoleta densities were manipulated between June and August 2008 and their effects on C. volutator abundance and vertical distribution observed. Results varied between mudflats and C volutator size classes. At Peck's Cove, total C volutator abundance was largely unaffected by I. obsoleta. No size class exhibited a distribution shift in response to I. obsoleta, though both mid-sized individuals and adults occupied deeper layers of sediment late in the summer. Abundance of C. volutator in all size classes at Grande Anse was reduced in July in direct proportion to exposure to I. obsoleta, and adults occupied higher sediment layers in July when L obsoleta were excluded, suggesting that I. obsoleta curtailed use of these upper layers. juvenile abundance rebounded in August, possibly due to the mass dispersal of a newly produced juvenile cohort. Adults were reduced in all treatments in August, probably as a result of normal seasonal mortality. Differences in C. volutator responses between mudflats highlight the site-specific nature of such interactions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Its value to science has changed and grown since it was founded to answer agricultural questions. In recent times the experiment has shown inter alia how: plant species richness, biomass and pH are related; community composition responds to climatic perturbation and nutrient additions; soil is acidified and corrected by liming. It also provided one of the first demonstrations of the evolution of adaptation at a very local scale and contains a putative case of the evolution of reproductive isolation by reinforcement. The application of molecular genetic markers to archived plant material promises to reveal a whole new chapter of genetic detail about the long-term dynamics of plant populations. 2 Over the range of values observed at Park Grass, biomass (productivity) has a negative effect upon species richness. Any positive effect of species richness on productivity could only be weak by comparison. The experiment provides support for both the competitive exclusion and pool size hypotheses for determination of species density. 3 Instantaneous comparisons of species richness between plots do not accurately reflect temporal rates of loss which may be multiplicative rather than additive. This suggests that comparisons among sites, nutrient inputs, especially N treatments, or soil acidity may in general underestimate the threat posed to plant species diversity by long-term changes in plant nutrient availability, both enrichment and depletion. 4 Differences between plots at the community level are maintained despite a flow of propagules between plots. There is no strong evidence for a spatial mass effect. 5 Guild (grass/legume/other) compositions of plant communities have equilibrated, but the species composition within guilds is more dynamic and continues to change over time, suggesting that species and guild abundances are independently regulated. 6 At least some members of all the major trophic levels, including predators (spiders), herbivores (leafhoppers) and detritivores (springtails) are treatment-specific in their distributions. 7 Plant populations on Park Grass are subdivided by treatments which, to some degree, have led to plots becoming genetically isolated from one another and decoupled demographically. This subdivision has created a metapopulation structure in each species, characterized by species-specific rates of local colonization and extinction. 8 Inverse clines in flowering time occur in the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum across some plot boundaries. These suggest that reproductive isolation between plots has been reinforced by natural selection. 9 Drift as well as selection may have taken place in A. odoratum, especially on plots where effective population size is restricted by population bottlenecks caused by drought. 10 Park Grass illustrates how long-term experiments grow in value with time and how they may be used to investigate scientific questions that were inconceivable at their inception. This is as likely to be true of the future of Park Grass as it has proved to be of its past.","Open Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; Lincoln Univ, Field Serv Ctr, Agr Grp, Canterbury, New Zealand; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, Cambs, England","Johnston, E (corresponding author), Open Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",j.silvertown@open.ac.uk,"Heard, Matthew/E-6743-2012; Edwards, Grant R/E-8216-2018","Edwards, Grant R/0000-0003-4165-007X",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [CEH010021] Funding Source: researchfish,,,77,254,261,3,227,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We investigated variation in interaction strength between the original keystone predator, the seastar Pisaster ochraceus, and its primary prey, mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. trossulus). The study was prompted by differences in community structure at two low zone sites along the central Oregon coast, Boiler Bay (BB) and Strawberry Hill (SH). Predators, especially seastars, were larger and more abundant at SH than at BB. Further, sessile animals were more abundant and macrophytes were less abundant at SH. Predators were more abundant at wave-exposed sites at both sites, and at SH, sessile invertebrates were more abundant at the wave-exposed location and sand cover was high at the wave-protected location. To test the hypothesis that variation in predation strength explained some of these differences, we examined the seastar-mussel interaction at locations with high and low wave exposure at both sites. Predation intensity was quantified by determining the survival of mussels in clumps (50 mussels per clump, shell length 4-7 cm) transplanted to large plots (18-163 M2) with or without seastars in the low intertidal zone. Predation effects were quantified by determining prey recolonization rates in marked quadrats in the same large plots. Spatial variation in interaction strength was quantified by examining predation at scales of metres (among transplants within plots), 10's of metres (between replicate plots within each exposure at each site), 100's of metres (between wave exposures within locations), and 10 000's of metres (between sites). Temporal variation was evaluated by performing the experiments in 1990 and 1991. The relation between prey (mussel) recruitment and growth to differences in community structure was evaluated by quantifying recruitment density in plastic mesh balls (collectors) and growth of individually marked transplanted mussels, respectively, at each site x exposure x tide level combination each month for 4 yr. Predation intensity varied greatly at all spatial scales. At the two largest spatial scales (10's of kilometres, 100's of metres), differences in both survival Of transplanted mussels and prey recolonization depended on variation in seastar abundance with site, wave exposure, prey recruitment and growth, and at SH protected, the extent of sand burial. Variation at the two smallest scales (metres, 10's of metres) was high when seastars were scarce and low when seastars were abundant. Transplanted mussels suffered 100% mortality in 2 wk at wave-exposed SH, but took > 52 wk at wave-protected BB. Seastar effects on prey recolonization were detected only at the SH wave-exposed site. Here, where prey recruitment and growth were unusually high, the mussel M. trossulus invaded and dominated space within 9 mo. After 14 mo, whelks, which increased in both size and abundance in the absence of Pisaster, arrested this increase in mussel abundance. Similar changes did not occur at other site x exposure combinations, evidently because prey recruitment was low and possibly also due to whelk predation on juveniles. Longer term results indicate that, as in Washington state, seastars prevent large adult M. californianus from invading lower intertidal regions, but only at wave-exposed, not wave-protected sites. Thus, three distinct predation regimes were observed: (1) strong keystone predation by seastars al wave-exposed headlands; (2) less-strong diffuse predation by seastars, whelks, and possibly other predators at a wave-protected cove, and (3) weak predation at a wave-protected site buried regularly by sand. Comparable experimental results at four wave-exposed headlands (our two in Oregon and two others in Washington), and similarities between these and communities on other West Coast headlands suggest keystone predation occurs broadly in this system. Results in wave-protected habitats, however, suggest it is not universal. In Oregon, keystone predation was evidently contingent on conditions of high prey production (i.e., recruitment and growth), while diffuse predation occurred when prey production was low, and weak predation occurred when environmental stress was high. Combining our results with examples from other marine and non-marine habitats suggests a need to consider a broader range of models than just keystone predation. The predictive and explanatory value of an expanded set of models depends on identifying factors distinguishing them. Although evidence is limited, a survey of 17 examples suggests (1) keystone predation is evidently not distinguished from diffuse predation by any of 11 previously proposed differences, but (2) may be distinguished by rates of prey production. Further, (3) differential predation on competitively dominant prey does not distinguish keystone from nonkeystone systems, since this interaction occurs in both types of community. Instead, differential predation on dominant prey evidently distinguishes strong-from weak-predation communities.

But no-one has examined the joint influences of stochastic variation, predators, and density-dependent habitat selection on our interpretations of species coexistence. I begin the search with simulation models of habitat isodars (lines along which the fitness of individuals is identical in two or more habitats) assuming ideal-free habitat selection by two prey species exploited by a habitat-selecting parasitoid 'predator'. The models include both regulating and non-regulating stochasticity. The intriguing results include the following: (1) all three species often achieved a true ideal-free distribution; (2) predators reduced prey population sizes and increased the frequency of local habitat extinctions; (3) despite the predator's differential reduction of prey densities, there was no evidence of apparent competition; (4) all species exhibited pulses of dispersal associated with donor-receiver population dynamics; (5) isodars produced valid estimates of competition between prey only in constant environments lacking habitat-selecting predators; (6) habitat-selection by predators forced prey into their preferred habitats; (7) the resulting ghost of competition obscured the prey species' competitive interaction; (8) isodars correctly revealed density-dependent habitat selection by the predator. Overall, the results appeared to depend primarily on the predator's habitat choice, rather than on prey trade-offs between competitive ability and reduced value (handling time) to the predator. Habitat selection theory, and its revelation via isodars, can thus provide considerable insight into processes affecting real communities, and most especially if ecologists assess carefully the constraints for their analysis and interpretation. Nevertheless, isodars designed to measure competition are likely to be most reliable in donor-controlled or experimental systems where regulating stochasticity has relatively little influence on prey dynamics.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; Lakehead Univ, Fac Forestry & Forest Environm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,,,,,73,23,24,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Both species diversity and total abundance were higher in Netlon bags, compared with sandstone tiles. However, hydroids, bryozoans, tubicolous polychaetes, a number of epifaunal molluscs and macroalgae were more abundant on tiles. Between-sites differences in taxonomic group abundances mostly reflected the benthic fauna and flora beneath the collectors and would be explained by differential settlement and survival, according to local environmental conditions. Sediment type, depth, salinity, water turbulence, food and biotic interactions would be the factors regulating settlement.

When both species were found in one pond, the common frogs metamorphosed up to 20 days earlier than the moor frogs. Most variation in time for metamorphosis, among ponds and years, is explained by temperature effects, but a causal relationship was not established. Within a pond, metamorphosis was later in cold summers than in warm summers. Size at metamorphosis was affected by tadpole density; at high densities metamorphs were smaller. Size at metamorphosis was not related to time for metamorphosis. There was an effect of pond drying; if ponds were about to dry up, metamorphosis was accelerated by about 2.4 days. Tadpoles from ponds with a late metamorphosis in the field had tadpoles that metamorphosed early in a common garden experiment, suggesting counter gradient selection.","Lund Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Loman, J (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",,,,,,,37,55,64,1,33,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4221 USA",0952-8369,,,J ZOOL,J.

These shifts in species composition also often result in substantial alterations in the strengths of species interactions. However, some species appear to be little affected by these changes that cause species turnover at other positions in the food web. An example of such a difference in species responses is apparent in the distributions of coenagrionid damselflies (Odonata: Zygoptera) among permanent water bodies with and without fish as top predators. Enallagma species segregate between ponds and lakes that do and do not support fish populations, with each lake type having a characteristic Enallagma assemblage. In contrast, species of Ischnura, the sister genus to Enallagma, are common to both fish and fishless ponds and lakes. Previous research has shown that Enallagma species segregate because they are differentially Vulnerable to the top predators in each lake type: dragonflies in fishless lakes and fish in fish lakes. This paper reports the results of a series of laboratory and field experiments quantifying the mortality and growth effects of interactions in the food webs surrounding Enallagma and Ischnura species in both lake types. These results are compared to determine how features of the food web change to force segregation of Enallagma species between the lake types but permit Ischnura species to inhabit both. The results of experiments conducted in a fishless lake show that damselflies are not food limited in this lake type, but that they do strongly compete via interference mechanisms. Interference effects between the genera are symmetrical. Ischnura species have substantially higher growth rates than Enallagma species under all conditions in fishless lakes. Although both Enallagma and Ischnura experience substantial mortality from predation by dragonflies (Anax and Aeshna species, the top predators in fishless lakes), these dragonflies display a significant bias towards feeding on Ischnura. Mortality rates due to dragonfly predation are not density dependent. The results of experiments done in a fish lake indicate that damselflies are food limited and thus compete for resources in fish lakes. Ischnura growth rates are also substantially higher than Enallagma species in the fish-lake system. Dragonfly species that coexist with fish (Basiaeschna and Epitheca species) do not impose significant mortality on coexisting damselflies, but they do compete for resources with the damselflies, and they may also generate feeding interference in the damselflies. Fish impose significantly higher mortality on Ischnura. species than on coexisting Enallagma species, and this mortality is negatively density dependent. The coexistence of Enallagma and Ischnura species is fostered in both lake types by trade-offs in their abilities to avoid predators and to utilize resources. Native Enallagma species are better at avoiding coexisting predators in each lake type, but these abilities come at the expense of the ability to utilize resources effectively and to avoid the predator found in the other lake type. In contrast, Ischnura are better at utilizing resources in both lake types, but these abilities come at the expense of effectively avoiding both fish and dragonflies. Understanding the trade-offs faced by species at similar trophic positions within a food web is critical to predicting changes in food webs following major environmental perturbations such as changing the top predator.","Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Invasive plants like Acacia longifolia can change habitat structure and thereby alter the taxonomic and functional diversity and composition of predator communities. This work aims to evaluate the effect of this invasive plant species on spider assemblages, at both taxonomic and functional levels, in grey dunes. Spiders were sampled in six native and six invaded sites, in northwestern Portugal. Individuals were identified to species level and their functional features were quantified. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were used to compare differences of species richness, abundance, functional diversity (FDQ) and trait proportions between native and invaded dunes. We also assessed the relative contribution of replacement and richness differences to overall taxonomic and functional dissimilarity between native and invaded dunes. GLMs showed that there was no change in species richness between dune types, but there was a significant increase in FDQ in invaded dunes. Significant shifts in the proportion of trait categories were observed. Native dunes favoured ambush hunters and myrmecophagous species. On the contrary, invaded dunes favoured species that inhabit leaf litter, web builders and crustaceophagous species. The proportion of diurnal species was higher in native dunes, contrary to invaded dunes, where both diurnal and nocturnal species dominated. Taxonomic and functional dissimilarity was mainly determined by the replacement, not the net loss, of species and traits. These results showed that functionally different spider species were favoured by the invasion of Acacia longifolia. The invasion of Acacia longifolia certainly attenuated the extreme habitat conditions normally found in grey dunes, allowing the immigration of more generalist species from neighbouring habitat types into invaded dunes. Thus, it can be concluded that there was no homogenization, taxonomic or functional, but changes in the composition of spider assemblages and the replacement of functions after dune invasion.","[Gomes, Marisa; Carvalho, Jose Carlos; Gomes, Pedro] Univ Minho, CBMA Ctr Mol & Environm Biol, Dept Biol, P-4710087 Braga, Portugal; [Carvalho, Jose Carlos] Univ Acores, CE3C, Azorean Biodivers Grp, P-9700042 Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal","Gomes, M (corresponding author), Univ Minho, CBMA Ctr Mol & Environm Biol, Dept Biol, P-4710087 Braga, Portugal.",marisantunesgomes@gmail.com,"Carvalho, Jose Carlos Tavares/S-2427-2019; Gomes, Pedro T Teixeira/I-8348-2015","Carvalho, Jose Carlos Tavares/0000-0003-3662-9794; Gomes, Pedro T Teixeira/0000-0002-5595-6988",FCT I.P.

I studied the role of competition in structuring the benthic community of hard substrates in a coldwater stream dominated by mobile insects that grazed upon periphyton and by relatively sessile filter-feeding insects. I expected competitive interactions among periphyton grazers to be significant and chronic because the community was not subject to frequent flow-related disturbances and grazer densities were high despite consistently low periphyton availability. Laboratory and field experiments were performed to determine: (1) the potential for, and relative strengths of, competition within and between two common, widely distributed grazers, the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior and the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus, (2) the role of Glossosoma in affecting the organization of the community, and (3) the mechanisms of competition. Strong intraspecific effects on Baetis survivorship were observed in laboratory enclosures within the range of natural densities, but interspecific effects were not detected. Glossosoma survivorship was not affected by competition with itself or with Baetis. Individuals of both species experienced significant intra- and interspecific effects on growth, but the relative strengths of these effects differed between species. The effects of Baetis on Glossosoma growth were stronger than the effects of Glossosoma on itself. In contrast, Baetis growth was much less affected by the presence of Glossosoma than by conspecifics. Both species strongly depressed periphyton abundance, indicating that observed competitive effects resulted, in part, from exploitation. Exclusion of Glossosoma from habitats in the field resulted in a marked increase in periphyton biomass throughout a 10-mo study in which the movements of other taxa were not restricted. Most periphyton grazers responded to this increase in resource availability with increased densities in the Glossosoma exclusion treatment relative to the control. The size distributions of several chironomid grazers suggested that larval growth rates were greater in the absence of Glossosoma than with Glossosoma present. The larvae of two relatively small-bodied filter-feeders (Simulium, Rheotanytarsus) responded positively to the removal of Glossosoma, but larger bodied species (Hydropsyche, Brachycentrus) were not affected. There was not strong evidence for seasonal variation in the intensity of competition. Effects of Glossosoma on filter-feeders appeared to result from a form of interference competition, but there was no evidence for the operation of interference among grazers. Glossosoma had no effect on the colonization of habitats by grazers, and the feeding rates of Baetis and Glossosoma were not affected by the presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics. Contrasting patterns in periphyton abundance between the laboratory and field experiments suggest that, when their movements are unrestricted, Baetis departs periphyton patches at higher food densities than does Glossosoma to search for food elsewhere. Thus, strong competitive effects of Baetis on Glossosoma in the laboratory experiments resulted, in part, from limited Baetis dispersal in the enclosures. Baetis and Glossosoma appear to exhibit trade-offs in feeding efficiency and the costs of exploiting food patches that should help to ensure their coexistence on a spatially variable food resource. Results of this study suggest that the structure of benthic communities in coldwater streams composed largely of mobile taxa may often be strongly influenced by Glossosoma. A similar role has been observed for sessile, territorial grazers in other systems. Glossosoma's dominance does not result from aggressive behavior, but from physiological, behavioral, and life cycle attributes that allow it to regulate periphyton biomass throughout the year.",,"KOHLER, SL (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, 607 E PEABODY DR, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA.",,,,,,,89,139,144,0,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Size can determine whether an individual consumes, is consumed, competes, or avoids individuals of the same or different species. Two complementary mesocosm experiments with a tri-trophic food chain (top predator, toadfish, Opsanus tau; intermediate prey, mud crab, family Xanthidae; basal resource, oyster, Crassostrea virginica) were conducted to measure how the size of both the top predator and the intermediate prey affects consumptive and behavioral interactions in trophic cascades. In the first experiment, I systematically varied the sizes of predators and prey, respectively. The amount of crab biomass consumed was dependent on crab size and not toadfish size, but the effect of crab size did not cascade to alter oyster survival. Increased oyster survival from crab interference competition in the absence of toadfish was similar to oyster survival from predator-avoidance behavior in the presence of a toadfish. When all crab size classes were present, crab mortality was similar in the presence and absence of toadfish, highlighting the importance of intraguild predation in food-web dynamics. The second experiment separated crab mortality by other crabs from crab mortality by predatory toadfish and found that crab mortality generally switched from intra-to interguild predation when a toadfish was present. In addition, field surveys indicated mud crab abundance and size was primarily influenced by mud crab recruitment, but not by toadfish abundance, which supports our experimental results that interactions among mud crabs have similar effects to predator-prey interactions. These findings indicate that changes in size or abundance of intermediate prey may be comparable to changes in top predator abundance in terms of trophic interactions and their transmission to lower levels, which suggests that certain types of relatively simple food chains can be resilient to the loss of higher trophic levels.","[Geraldi, Nathan R.] Univ N Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Dept Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Geraldi, NR (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Lab, Portaferry BT22 1PF, North Ireland.",n.geraldi@qub.ac.uk,"Geraldi, Nathan/AAA-3645-2020","Geraldi, Nathan/0000-0002-2669-3867",National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NOAA); North Carolina Coastal Recreational Fishing License Grant,"I thank C.

Minnow traps and giving-up density (GUD) plates (plexiglas plates covered with trout crumble and fine gravel) were used to assess habitat use and perceived habitat quality for forage fishes, respectively, while passive integrated transponder tags provided data on habitat use by predator species to assess the level of predation risk. Data were collected both before and after a hypoxia manipulation (2-3mgl(-1) dissolved oxygen, DO) to create a before-after control-effect style experiment. Fathead minnows Pimephales promelas were more abundant and consumed more food from GUD plates in hypoxic bays after the DO manipulation, indicating hypoxic locations were perceived as higher quality, lower-risk habitats. The frequency of predator visits was not consistently affected. The duration of visits, and therefore the total time spent in these habitats, however, was significantly shorter. These predator data, combined with the prey information, are consistent with the hypothesis that hypoxic regions function as predator refuges. The refuge effect is not the result of predator exclusion, however; instead predators are rendered less capable of foraging and pose less of a threat in hypoxic locations.","[Hedges, K.

However, in some situations, concomitant changes in the abundance of predators, competitors, or prey within MPAs, or strong gradients in the surrounding environmental seascape may counteract the purported benefits making it more difficult to predict how species will respond to protection. We used a network of MPAs in California, spanning a large temperature gradient, to investigate the drivers of demographic variability in the commercially important red sea urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus. We investigated how demographic metrics varied geographically in response to protection, temperature, and the main sea urchin resource, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. We found significant conservation benefits to this fished sea urchin within MPAs designated six years prior to the beginning of this study. Within MPAs, red sea urchins were generally larger resulting in greater adult biomass density and reproductive biomass density. In addition, kelp density was an important explanatory variable of all red sea urchin demographic traits examined (adult size, gonadosomatic index [GSI], density, adult biomass density, and reproductive biomass density). Kelp density was positively correlated with red sea urchin GSI and adult size, but the relationships with density, adult biomass density, and reproductive biomass density were complex and the directionality changed depending on the region (or environmental setting) examined. Our results demonstrate that kelp, red sea urchin reproduction, and the effects of spatial management on demographic processes are tightly coupled with the oceanographic regime.

Many recent studies concern some sort of impact assessment of a single species. Few studies addressed the noise impact on species interactions underwater, whereas there are some studies that address community-level impact but only on land in air. Key processes such as predator-prey or competitor interactions may be affected by the masking of auditory cues, noise-related disturbance, or attentional interference. Noise-associated changes in these interactions can cause shifts in species abundance and modify communities, leading to fundamental ecosystem changes. To gain further insight into the mechanism and generality of earlier findings, we investigated the impact on both a predator and a prey species in captivity, zebrafish (Danio rerio) preying on waterfleas (Daphnia magna).","[Shafiei Sabet, Saeed; Neo, Yik Yaw; Slabbekoorn, Hans] Leiden Univ, Fac Sci, Inst Biol Leiden, Dept Behav Biol, NL-2300 Leiden, Netherlands","Shafiei Sabet, S (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Fac Sci, Inst Biol Leiden, Dept Behav Biol, NL-2300 Leiden, Netherlands.",s.shafiei.sabet@biology.leidenuniv.nl; y.y.neo.2@umail.leidenuniv.nl; H.W.Slabbekoorn@biology.leidenuniv.nl,"sabet, saeed shafiei/P-3771-2016; /C-4987-2014","sabet, saeed shafiei/0000-0001-5919-2527; /0000-0001-8619-5539",,,,12,5,5,0,44,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0065-2598,2214-8019,978-1-4939-2981-8; 978-1-4939-2980-1,ADV EXP MED BIOL,Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.,,2016,875,,,,,,957,961,,10.1007/978-1-4939-2981-8_118,,,5,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,BE2TA,WOS:000370000900119,26611055,,,,2021-09-27,

General theory from aquatic ecology predicts that smaller aquatic habitats have shorter hydroperiods favouring species that are better resource competitors and complete development quickly. Larger habitats are predicted to have longer hydroperiods enabling longer-lived predators to persist. Habitats with long hydroperiods and predators are predicted to favour slower-developing, predator-resistant species, rather than competitive species. 2. In a field experiment, habitat size and hydroperiod were manipulated independently in water-filled containers, to test these hypotheses about processes structuring aquatic communities. Human-made containers were used that are dominated by mosquitoes that vary in desiccation resistance, competitive ability, and predation resistance. 3. Habitat size and drying had significant effects on abundances of larvae of the common species in these communities. There was sorting of species by habitat size and by drying, with species that are better competitors relatively more abundant in smaller, more ephemeral habitats, and predator-resistant, slower-developing species relatively more abundant in larger or permanently flooded habitats. There were no detectable effects of habitat size or drying on the dominant predator. 4. Habitat size and its interaction with drying affected inputs of eggs to containers. Habitat size also affected relative abundances of the two dominant species in the egg population. 5. Although habitat size and hydroperiod significantly affected composition of these communities, these impacts did not appear to be mediated through effects on predator abundance. Species-specific differences in habitat size and drying regime preferences, and habitat-dependent larval performance appear to be the main forces shaping these communities.","[Westby, Katie M.; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Campus Box 4120, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Westby, Katie M.] Washington Univ St Louis, Tyson Res Ctr, 6750 Tyson Valley Rd, Eureka, MO 63025 USA","Westby, KM (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Campus Box 4120, Normal, IL 61790 USA.; Westby, KM (corresponding author), Washington Univ St Louis, Tyson Res Ctr, 6750 Tyson Valley Rd, Eureka, MO 63025 USA.",katiewestby206@gmail.com,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease grant [IRISM094322-01A1]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank P.J.

Due to the costs of coexistence with competitors, a breeding habitat selection strategy that avoids competitors is expected to be favored. However, many migratory birds appear to gain benefits from an attraction to the presence of resident birds, even though residents are assumed to be competitively dominant. Thus far the mechanisms of this habitat selection process, heterospecific attraction, are unknown, and the consequences for resident birds of migrant attraction remain untested. Through heterospecific attraction, migrants may gain benefits if the density or territory location of residents positively reflects habitat quality, and/or they gain benefits through increased frequency of social interactions with residents in foraging or predator detection. In this experiment, we examined the reciprocal effects of spatial proximity on fitness-related traits in migrant pied flycatcher (Ficedula, hypoleuca) and resident great tit (Parus major) by experimentally forcing them to breed either alone or in close proximity to each other. Surprisingly, great tits bore all the costs of coexistence while flycatchers were unaffected, even gaining slight benefits. In concert with an earlier study, these results suggest that flycatchers use tits as information about good-quality nest-site locations while benefits from social interactions with tits are possible but less important. We suggest that utilizing interspecific social information may be a common phenomenon between species sharing similar resource needs. Our results imply that the effects of interspecific information rise can be asymmetric and may therefore have implications for the patterns and consequences of species coexistence.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; Uppsala Univ, Anim Ecol Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Forsman, JT (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",jukka.forsman@oulu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012; Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X",,,,56,54,56,0,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

We examined the degree to which potential mutualists of a seaweed provide complementary vs. redundant benefits to their host to begin to assess the effects of mutualist diversity on host performance. The gastropods Anachis lafresnayi (Costoanachis lafresnayi) and Mitrella lunata (Astyris lunata) are common associates of the red alga Chondrus crispus in subtidal locations in southern New England. Field surveys showed that where these snails were rare, Chondrus was sparse and covered with a heavy growth of sessile invertebrates, but where snails were common, Chondrus was abundant and free from fouling overgrowth. In manipulative field experiments, plants with no snails had the most overgrowth (measured both as percent cover and total mass) and lost 25% of their mass in five weeks. Plants with either species of snail alone were also heavily fouled and lost mass. Those with only Mitrella were overgrown by solitary ascidians, whereas those with only Anachis were overgrown by bryozoans, suggesting that both snails remove epibionts, but they differ in the suite of epibionts they are capable of removing. As a result, only Chondrus with both species of snail present remained unfouled and gained mass over the course of the experiment. Field tethering experiments showed that both snail species can gain a refuge from crab predation by associating with Chondrus. Our results show that these two snail species are not interchangeable and they provide complementary benefits to their host because they differ in their prey preferences. If this type of differentiation in resource use often mediates coexistence among mutualists, then complementary effects of mutualists on their hosts may be common.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Ecolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA","Stachowicz, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Ecolut & Ecol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jjstachowicz@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,46,52,54,1,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2005,86,9,,,,,2418,2427,,10.1890/04-0819,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,957MJ,WOS:000231373600017,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

Although the popular logistic equation for the growth of a single species incorporates this intraspecific competition, multi-trophic models often ignore self-limitation of the consumers. Instead, these models often assume that the predator-prey interactions are purely exploitative, employing simple Lotka-Volterra forms in which consumer species lack intraspecific competition terms. Here we show that intraspecific interference competition can account for the stable coexistence of many consumer species on a single resource in a homogeneous environment. In addition, our work suggests a potential mechanism for field observations demonstrating that habitat area and resource productivity strongly positively correlate to biodiversity. In the special case of a modified Lotka-Volterra model describing multiple predators competing for a single resource, we present an ordering procedure that determines the deterministic fate of each specific consumer. Moreover, we find that the growth rate of a resource species is proportional to the maximum number of consumer species that resource can support. In the limiting case, when the resource growth rate is infinite, a model with intraspecific interference reduces to the conventional Lotka-Volterra competition model where there can be an unlimited number of coexisting consumers. This highlights the crucial role that resource growth rates may play in promoting coexistence of consumer species. (C) 2003 Society for Mathematical Biology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The competition hypothesis proposes that this pattern of habitat segregation reflects the effects of interspecific competition on habitat selection. To test this hypothesis we conducted field experiments that allowed the two species to select from among several habitats when alone and when together. We expected to find a lower proportion of each species in the habitat most associated with the other species, and a negative correlation between the demography and density of each species and the density of the competing species, but this was not the case. Interspecific competition did affect movement patterns of prairie voles. In the presence of meadow voles, net movement (immigration minus emigration) of prairie voles in high-cover habitats decreased and net dispersal of individuals from high- to low-cover habitats increased. Thus, our results indicated only a weak effect of competition on habitat selection. We suggest that other mechanisms, such as differences in habitat preference (or tolerance), differences in dispersal ability, and the advantage of first residency, need to be considered in conjunction with interspecific competition to explain the habitat segregation observed in these species.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Batzli, GO (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",,,,,,,28,13,15,0,4,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Using microbial communities comprising bacterivorous ciliated protists assembled in laboratory microcosms, we experimentally investigated these questions by independently manipulating the intensity of disturbance (in the form of density-independent mortality) and community assembly history (including a control treatment with simultaneous species introduction and five sequential assembly treatments). Species diversity patterns consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis emerged in the controls, as several species showed responses indicative of a tradeoff between competitive ability and ability to recover from disturbance. Species diversity in communities with sequential assembly, however, generally declined with disturbance, owing to the increased extinction risk of later colonizers at the intermediate level of disturbance. Similarities among communities subjected to different assembly histories increased with disturbance, a result due possibly to increasing disturbance reducing the importance of competition and hence priority effects. This finding is most consistent with the idea that increasing disturbance tends to reduce the likelihood of alternative stable states. Collectively, these results indicate the strong interactive effects of disturbance and assembly history on the structure of ecological communities.","[Jiang, Lin; Patel, Shivani N.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Jiang, L (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",lin.jiang@biology.gatech.edu,"Jiang, Lin/K-5572-2019",,,,,52,84,85,6,101,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2008,89,7,,,,,1931,1940,,10.1890/07-1263.1,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,331JC,WOS:000258007500015,18705379,,,,2021-09-27,

We estimated stage-specific mortality rates for three common grasshopper species from a Nebraska (USA) sandhills grassland (Ageneotettix deorum, Melanoplus sanguinipes and Phoetaliotes nebrascensis), and partitioned the impact due to wandering spider predation from remaining sources. Survivorship was estimated for multiple developmental stages (3rd instar through adult) under experimental conditions that either prevented or permitted predation from free-living, wandering spiders (primarily Schizocosa species). Total stage-specific mortality, including spider predation, examined over the period of single stages was greatest for the youngest stages (91 % for 3rd instar, 73 % for 4th instar, 63.5 % for 5th instar and 30.4 % for adults). For the developmental stages considered and averaged for all species, the contribution to total mortality from spider predation over the 10-d period (approximately the length of a developmental stage) ranged from 17 % for 3rd instar nymphs to 23 % for 4th and 5th instars, and an undetectable level for adults. While spiders may depress grasshopper numbers, contributions from spider predation to grasshopper population dynamics are uncertain.

How fish and crustaceans use intertidal salt-marsh creeks in the German Wadden Sea",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nekton; Habitat use; Salt marsh; Wadden sea; Habitat quality,PREDATION RISK; ESTUARINE; COMMUNITIES; HABITATS; NEKTON; FOOD; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE,"Worldwide, salt marshes have proven important or even essential for a wide variety of marine nekton. But in the world's largest intertidal wetland, the Wadden Sea, their role for nekton is surprisingly unexplored. Building on extensive field sampling, this study presents an inventory of fish and crustacean species using German Wadden Sea salt marshes and investigates their habitat use and affinity. Ten species dominated the nekton assemblage of the salt-marsh creeks both in frequency of occurrence and in relative abundance. Repetitive samplings resulted in highly variable catches, probably caused by the abundance in the subtidal. However, common goby (Pomato-schistus microps) and brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) were depleted with the 9 consecutive hauls when occurring in high numbers, indicating a high habitat affinity. Seasonal and diurnal quantitative sampling revealed seasonal shifts within the nekton community and significant higher densities during night than day for seven out of the nine dominant salt-marsh nekton species. Nekton densities tended to be lower than elsewhere in the Wadden Sea and thus animals using the salt-marsh creeks may benefit from lower resource competition. Compared to the subtidal not only the species composition differed significantly but also the size composition. The majority of fish in the marsh creeks were small (97% < 4.5 cm), consisting of larvae, juveniles and adults of small species. Thus, the use of salt-marsh creeks seems predominantly be triggered by size than by life stage. The absence of aquatic and avian piscivores indicates that salt-marsh creeks function for small nekton as refuge from predators. However, the habitat value depends also on the connected low tide refuges and the access pathways in between. The difference of the nekton community of the marsh creeks from the subtidal raises the demand for habitat-specific monitoring programmes and further research on the connectivity and interactions between different habitat types, both considering seasonal and diurnal abundance variabilities.","[Friese, Julia D.

We conducted a field experiment to evaluate Culex oviposition behavior in response to the interspecific competitor Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae, and resources in the form of quantity of plant detritus, and dissolved nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) derived from that detritus. We tested a set of specific predictions: 1) As a poorer competitor, Culex will avoid ovipositing in containers with superior interspecific competitors; 2) Culex choose oviposition habitats that contain greater amount of resources for the microbial food of their offspring; 3) Sufficiently high resource abundance can override avoidance of oviposition in containers with interspecific competitors. Culex restuans Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) was the only species ovipositing, and the oviposition responses changed over time. The effect of resources was more important in driving oviposition decisions at the beginning and end of the experiment. The amount of resources, as manifest by TN and TP concentrations, had differential effects on oviposition. At the beginning females laid more eggs in containers with low detritus, which had the highest TN. After that, females preferred those containers with high detritus, which had low TN and high TP. The effect of competitors was important only during the middle of the experiment. Paradoxically, even as a poorer competitor Cx. restuans preferentially oviposited in containers with late-instar Ae. triseriatus, suggesting that the presence of successful heterospecifics indicates a good quality larval habitat.","[Grech, Marta G.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Grech, Marta G.] UNPSJB, Fac Ciencias Nat, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Grech, MG (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina.",mgrech@comahue-conicet.gob.ar,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID grantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322-01A1]; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We wish to thank G.

This biodiversity loss is generally facilitated by human activities such as land cover change and hydrological alternation. Recent advances in stable isotope analysis (SIA) have been highlighted in many studies addressing fundamental issues in invasion ecology, especially in quantifying competition for resources between native and exotic species. However, how anthropogenic disturbance influences trophic relationships among invasive and native species remains poorly understood. Location Middle-lower Yangtze River Region, China. Methods To investigate the effects of human disturbance on interspecific trophic interactions, this study compared isotopic niche space and overlap of the introduced red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and the native oriental river shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) and freshwater snail (Bellamya aeruginosa) in natural and modified wetlands. Results Based on carbon and nitrogen SIA, we found ubiquitous niche shifts in macroinvertebrates with increased competition, which might lead to significant niche contraction in modified habitats at both community and population scales. Moreover, the isotopic niche width of the exotic crayfish was twice as larger as that of natives at both habitats, suggesting that the exotic P. clarkii had great competitive superiority over the native species. However, the effects of habitat modification on niche overlap were inconsistent. While the niche overlap between crayfish and shrimp was significantly higher in modified habitats than in natural open waters, niche overlap between crayfish and the snail was significantly reduced. Main conclusions Collectively, our findings highlight that the competitive outcomes of interspecific trophic interactions can be dependent on the prey availability and diversity, which embraces both the classic optimal foraging theory and competition theory to understand how environmental change, such as habitat alternation, affects the biological invasion processes.","[Wang, Yuyu; Tan, Wenzhuo; Li, Bin; Wen, Li; Lei, Guangchun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuyu; Tan, Wenzhuo; Li, Bin; Lei, Guangchun] Natl Field Sci Observat & Res Stn Dongting Lake W, Hanshou, Peoples R China; [Wen, Li] NSW Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Sci Div, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Lei, GC (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",guangchun.lei@foxmail.com,,"WEN, LI/0000-0003-3783-3826; Wang, Yuyu/0000-0003-2081-5277",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017ZY15]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0405303],"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2017ZY15; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFC0405303",,80,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

The ingestion rates ( biomass of rotifers per hour) for the two rotifer species also differed, but both increased with increasing rotifer density. This is the first experiment to measure zooplankton consumption by bivalve molluscs at different zooplankton densities. The feeding rates of mussels in this study were compared with those of phytoplankton and other zooplankton from previous studies. The diameter of the mussel inhalent siphon was correlated linearly with the shell length and tissue weight, and was usually an order of magnitude wider than rotifer sizes.

Strategies should be different for indirect resource competition (exploitation, e.g., foraging and avoidance behaviour) than for direct interspecific interference (e.g., aggression, vigilance, and nest guarding). We studied the effects of resource competition and nest predation in sympatric small mammal species using semi-fossorial voles and shrews, which prey on vole offspring during their sensitive nestling phase. Experiments were conducted in caged outdoor enclosures. Focus common vole mothers (Microtus arvalis) were either caged with a greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) as a potential nest predator, with an herbivorous field vole (Microtus agrestis) as a heterospecific resource competitor, or with a conspecific resource competitor. Results: We studied behavioural adaptations of vole mothers during pregnancy, parturition, and early lactation, specifically modifications of the burrow architecture and activity at burrow entrances. Further, we measured pre- and postpartum faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) of mothers to test for elevated stress hormone levels. Only in the presence of the nest predator were prepartum FCMs elevated, but we found no loss of vole nestlings and no differences in nestling body weight in the presence of the nest predator or the heterospecific resource competitor. Although the presence of both the shrew and the field vole induced prepartum modifications to the burrow architecture, only nest predators caused an increase in vigilance time at burrow entrances during the sensitive nestling phase. Conclusion: Voles displayed an adequate behavioural response for both resource competitors and nest predators. They modified burrow architecture to improve nest guarding and increased their vigilance at burrow entrances to enhance offspring survival chances. Our study revealed differential behavioural adaptations to resource competitors and nest predators.","[Liesenjohann, Monique; Liesenjohann, Thilo; Eccard, Jana Anja] Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med, Dept Nat Sci Biochem, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","Liesenjohann, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",monique.liesenjohann@uni-potsdam.de,"Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008","Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [ec361/4-1],"We thank Prof. Fritz Trillmich for providing his laboratory at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, for the FCM extractions and Elke Hippauf for technical support with the extractions.

However, coexistence among species may be promoted by niche partitioning if native species can use resources that the invasive species cannot. Previous research has shown that some strains of the aphid Aphis craccivora are toxic to a competitively dominant invasive lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis. Our objective was to investigate whether these aphids might be an exploitable resource for other, subdominant, lady beetle species. We compared larval development rate, survival, and adult weight of five lady beetle species in no-choice experiments with two different strains of A.craccivora, one of which is toxic to H.axyridis and one that is nontoxic. Two lady beetle species, Cycloneda munda and Coleomegilla maculata, were able to complete larval development when feeding on the aphid strain that is toxic to H.axyridis, experiencing only slight developmental delays relative to beetles feeding on the other aphid strain. One species, Coccinella septempunctata, also was able to complete larval development, but experienced a slight reduction in adult weight. The other two lady beetle species, Hippodamia convergens and Anatis labiculata, demonstrated generally low survivorship when consuming A.craccivora, regardless of aphid strain. All five species showed increased survival and/or development relative to H.axyridis on the toxic aphid strain. Our results suggest that this toxic trait may act as a narrow-spectrum defense for the aphids, providing protection against only some lady beetle enemies. For other less-susceptible lady beetles, these aphids have the potential to provide competitive release from the otherwise dominant H.axyridis.","[Jackson, Kelly A.; McCord, Joshua S.; White, Jennifer A.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA","White, JA (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA.",jenawhite@uky.edu,,"White, Jennifer/0000-0003-1276-561X","National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [0224651, 2014-67013-21576]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: Hatch No. 0224651 and 2014-67013-21576",,40,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In the Florida Keys (USA), anecdotal observations have long pointed to an inverse relationship in abundance of two large decapod crustaceans found co-occurring in hard-bottom habitat, the stone crab Menippe mercenaria and the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. We used them to explicitly test whether competition for a renewable resource (shelter) can drive the abundance and distribution of the inferior competitor. We first explored this relationship in shelter competition mesocosm experiments to determine the competitively dominant species. Results showed that stone crabs are clearly the dominant competitors regardless of the number of lobsters present, the presence of co-sheltering species such as the spider crab, Damithrax spinosissimus, or the order of introduction of competitors into the mesocosm. We also found that lobsters use chemical cues from stone crabs to detect and avoid them. We then tested the ramifications of this competitive dominance in the field by manipulating stone crab abundance and then tracking the abundance and distribution of spiny lobsters through time. Increased stone crab abundance immediately resulted in decreased lobster abundance and increased aggregation. The opposite occurred on sites where stone crabs were removed. When we stopped removing stone crabs from these sites, they soon returned and lobster abundance decreased. This study explicitly demonstrated that interspecific competition can drive population dynamics between these species, and ultimately, community composition in these shallow water habitats.","[Behringer, Donald C.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Behringer, Donald C.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Behringer, Donald C.; Hart, John E.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",behringer@ufl.edu,,,University of Florida School of Natural Resources and EnvironmentUniversity of Florida; NOAA Florida Sea Grant College Program [R/LR-B-65]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0928398],"We thank D.

Many studies of predatorprey interactions include the effect of spatial heterogeneity, but these are mostly based on species with restricted mobility or conducted in experimental settings. 2 Here, we aim to identify the patterns through which spatial heterogeneity affects predatorprey dynamics and to review the literature on the effect of spatial heterogeneity on predatorprey interactions in terrestrial mammalian systems, i.e. in freely moving species with high mobility, in non-experimental settings. We also review current methodologies that allow the study of the predation process within a spatial context. 3 When the functional response includes the effect of spatial heterogeneity, it usually takes the form of predator-dependent or ratio-dependent models and has wide applicability. 4 The analysis of the predation process through its different stages may further contribute towards identifying the spatial scale of interest and the specific spatial mechanism affecting predatorprey interactions. 5 Analyzing the predation process based on the functional response theory, but separating the stages of predation and applying a multiscale approach, is likely to increase our insight into how spatial heterogeneity affects predatorprey dynamics. This may increase our ability to forecast the consequences of landscape transformations on predatorprey dynamics.","[Gorini, Lucrezia] Hedmark Univ Coll, Dept Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, NO-2480 Koppang, Norway; [Gorini, Lucrezia; Boitani, Luigi] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Anim & Human Biol, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Linnell, John D.

Within mutualisms, resistance to any partner can impact the mutualism as a whole. Larvae of the globally invasive Sirex woodwasp Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) complete their development in the sapwood of Pinus spp. (Pinaceae) only in the presence of the fungus, Amylostereum areolatum (Basidiomycota). In the Southern Hemisphere where Pinus are introduced, Sirex noctilio is an outbreak invasive pest, but in North America where Pinus is indigenous it has not irrupted to economic levels 15+ yr since introduction. To test the biotic resistance hypothesis, we characterized the arthropod community attracted to and co-infesting Pinus resinosa trees at the geographic frontier of its introduced North American range, quantified antagonistic interactions observed within trees, and assayed competition of fungal species under laboratory conditions. A suite of potential natural enemies and competitors inhabited Sirex-infested P. resinosa trees. Trees experimentally exposed to ovipositing Sirex noctilio females and to physical wounding attracted greater numbers of saprophagous beetles (Cerambycidae: Xylotrechus sagittatus and Curculionidae: Ips pint) and parasitoid wasps (Ichneumonidae: Ibalia leucospoides) compared to undamaged controls. Recruitment of Xylotrechus and Thalia was positively related to numbers of oviposition scars left by Sirex females. Within xylem tissue, abundant Xylotrechus larvae killed and consumed more than 10% of Sirex larvae. This facultative intraguild predation was positively density-dependent but nonlinear, with a unimodal peak at intermediate Sirex density. Sirex density in xylem was weakly, negatively related to Ips bark beetle density, suggesting potential competition between fungal associates (Ascomycota: Ophiostoma ips) for sapwood resources. Benchtop experiments in natural and artificial media supported the hypothesis of competition between Ips and Sirex fungal associates, with faster growth and competitive dominance of the bluestain fungus under most scenarios tested. Altogether, this study provides evidence for multiple mechanisms of biotic resistance, whereby a resident community reduces survival or performance of both an invasive insect and its fungal mutualist.","[Thompson, Brian M.; Bodart, Jake; Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Bodart, Jake] Arkansas State Plant Board, Arkansas Agr Dept, Little Rock, AR 72203 USA","Gruner, DS (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dsgruner@umd.edu,"Gruner, Daniel S./A-5166-2010","Gruner, Daniel S./0000-0002-3153-4297",USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [09-DG-11083150-021]; Sigma Xi; University of Maryland; Washington Explorers Club,"We thank A.

We tested this idea with a native primary parasitoid, Eretmocerus eremicus, and an exotic autoparasitoid Encarsia sophia, both attacking the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Autoparasitoids are intraguild consumers that attack and kill both the immature stages of hemipteran hosts, such as whiteflies, and heterospecific and conspecific parasitoids. In population cages on cotton plants in the field in 1997 and 1998, we introduced whiteflies and then parasitoids in a replacement design with constant total numbers of parasitoids, as follows: (1) control (whiteflies only), (2) E. eremicus only, (3) E. sophia only, and (4) both E. eremicus and E. sophia. Destructive samples of plants were taken 2, 4, and 6 wk after wasp releases, and immature whitefly and wasp stages were censused. In 1997, there were no significant differences in whitefly densities among treatments. In 1998, the control treatment densities were significantly greater than parasitoid treatments, but there was no difference among the parasitoid treatments, indicating equivalent suppression of whitefly populations by the two parasitoid species. In both years, similar patterns in parasitoid dynamics were observed. Densities of E. eremicus were significantly higher in the absence of E. sophia. In contrast, E. sophia densities were unaffected by the presence of E, eremicus. The results suggest that interference by the autoparasitoid reduced primary parasitoid density, but with no concommitant disruption of host suppression. The results support theoretical predictions that no disruption should occur when both parasitoids are equally efficient and suggest that an autoparasitoid may be as efficient as a primary parasitoid in suppressing host densities.","Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Hunter, MS (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, 410 Forbes Bldg, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",mhunter@ag.arizona.edu,"Hunter, Martha/AAF-5288-2020; Hunter, Martha/B-7307-2012","Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X; Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X",,,,46,22,30,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2002,83,5,,,,,1459,1469,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1459:DAADHS]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543YK,WOS:000175131300026,,,,,2021-09-27,

We assess the influence of prey availability on the foraging performance of breeding African penguins Spheniscus demersus using data from instrumented birds during 14 pelagic fish surveys carried out over 3 years around their two largest breeding colonies, St Croix and Bird islands in Algoa Bay. Characteristics of prey fields targeted by African penguins were identified by assessing the response of foraging birds to the acoustically determined distribution of small pelagic fish. Path- and dive-derived foraging performance metrics were modelled as a response to overall and targeted prey abundance estimates to assess potential nonlinear functional relationships between penguin foraging effort and prey availability. African penguins displayed marked spatial heterogeneity in their selection of foraging sites, but birds from both colonies invariably foraged on fish schools Generalized additive model fits improved for all foraging performance responses when using targeted prey abundance (i.e. only fish in areas frequented by penguins and at depths <40 m, as opposed to estimates using all prey). Models for trip duration (r(2) = 0.45) and foraging path length (r(2) = 0.44) showed a negative nonlinear form in their response to targeted prey abundance, with significant improvement in penguin foraging effort when prey abundance was greater than 45% of the maximum prey biomass recorded. Synthesis and applications. Functional relationships between seabird foraging performance and prey supplies have the potential to inform the sustainable management of fisheries that compete for the same prey. Our findings highlight the importance of quantifying prey that is available to seabirds when assessing critical thresholds in prey abundance below which seabird foraging performance is adversely affected. These findings can be integrated into dynamic ocean management strategies to mitigate resource competition around seabird colonies. A framework for flexible, colony-centred closures is proposed as a more dynamic alternative to time/area closures with the potential to respond to prevailing habitat conditions in near real-time.","[McInnes, Alistair M.; Ryan, Peter G.] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Lacerda, Miguel] Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Pichegru, Lorien] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, Summerstrand, South Africa; [Pichegru, Lorien] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Zool, Summerstrand, South Africa","McInnes, AM (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, Rondebosch, South Africa.",amcinnes3@gmail.com,,"Pichegru, Lorien/0000-0003-3815-9845; McInnes, Alistair/0000-0002-9125-9629",African Penguin Species Champion project of the Charl van der Merwe Trust; South African Department of Science and Technology-National Research Foundation; Responsible Fisheries Alliance,The African Penguin Species Champion project of the Charl van der Merwe Trust; South African Department of Science and Technology-National Research Foundation; The Responsible Fisheries Alliance,,59,2,2,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Because availability and quality of these sites are variable, parents may have to choose between immediately available lower-quality rearing sites or extended search time. In some frog species with larval transport, parents are known to select bodies of water that are free of predators, cannibalistic tadpoles, or intraspecific competitors for larval deposition and rearing sites. We tested whether abiotic factors and the presence of predators and conspecific tadpoles affect tadpole deposition behavior in a population of smooth guardian frog, Limnonectes palavanensis, on the island of Borneo. Females lay eggs on land and males guard them until they hatch; after hatching, tadpoles climb onto the male's back and are subsequently transported to small pools of water on the forest floor, which are scarce and patchily distributed. We estimated the abundance of natural tadpole rearing sites in our study area and conducted experiments using artificial pools to test whether abiotic characteristics of these pools affect the probability of larval deposition. We also performed choice experiments to test whether males of L. palavanensis avoid pools with conspecific tadpoles or predators. Lastly, we tested whether the tadpoles of this species exhibit cannibalism. The abundance of natural deposition sites was low, and males readily used artificial pools for tadpole deposition. Males were less likely to deposit tadpoles in artificial pools located in steep areas, and males did not avoid depositing tadpoles in pools with conspecifics or with experimentally introduced predators. Males exhibited clutch-partitioning behavior, dividing tadpoles between adjacent artificial pools. Pool availability, rather than the presence of potential competitors or predators in a pool, affects tadpole deposition decisions in this species.","[Vallejos, Johana Goyes; Wells, Kentwood D.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Grafe, T.

While several studies have demonstrated the effects of varying predation intensities, the effects of varying frequencies of predation have not been addressed explicitly. Here, I studied the impact of variable predation by whelks on a mid-intertidal successional community at a wave-exposed environment on the coast of Oregon. Densities of whelks were monitored in fixed-position quadrats for 34 mo, permitting an estimation of the natural spatial and temporal variation in predation by whelks. Two simultaneous cage experiments were then conducted for a period of 25 mo. One experiment evaluated the effect of prolonged exclusion of invertebrate predators on the sessile community. The other experiment evaluated the effects of the intensity and the temporal frequency of predation by whelks by manipulating both the density and presence of whelks inside cages. Three density levels were combined with three temporal patterns of predation (constant predation, medium and low frequency) in an orthogonal design to create nine different predation regimes. The replicated design allowed me to separate the effects of these two components of predation. The densities of the two whelk species present in the study site, Nucella canaliculata and N. emarginata, were highly correlated over time and varied greatly within and among years. Some areas of the site had whelks present most of the time (high frequency), while other areas were rarely visited. The frequency at which whelks were observed in a given area was uncorrelated with the yearly mean density, which contributed to the within-habitat variability in predation regimes by whelks. A suite of direct and indirect effects were observed following the permanent exclusion of invertebrate predators, notably, a rapid increase in the cover of the bay mussel Mytilus trossulus and a slow and small increase in the cover of gooseneck barnacles and the California mussel Mytilus californianus. Temporally variable predation (medium and low frequencies) produced community compositions different from those observed under a constant predation regime or predator exclusions. In general, individual species responses to variable predation could not be predicted from knowledge of the overall effect of predators obtained in the permanent exclusion experiment, nor from the results observed under different intensities and constant predation. Similarly, the actual number of predation days, estimated from the density and number of days whelks were in the cages, was not correlated with the mean cover of species. These results support the hypothesis that temporal frequency is an important component of predation with distinctive effects on intertidal prey communities. Both the ability of some prey to escape predators by reaching a large size and the temporal pattern of prey recruitment seemed important in determining the effect of variable predation on individual prey, but mechanistic understanding of the responses was complicated by the existence of many indirect effects. While temporally variable predation did not significantly increase spatial variability in prey abundance, constant predation regimes tended to reduce this variability over the course of succession. Temporal variability in predation by whelks can have distinctive effects on prey, create distinctive community compositions, and affect successional paths in this intertidal community. Temporal variability in predation is probably an important, yet poorly understood cause of spatial heterogeneity in most ecosystems.","OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,"Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013",,,,,98,101,103,0,40,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Web-location cannot be designed simply to optimize foraging success, but must be a compromise between competing factors, including microhabitat parameters (physical structure, microclimate) and predator avoidance. 2. We tested the hypothesis that, despite these compromises, linyphiid spiders managed to locate their webs within microsites with enhanced prey resources. 3. We tested further the 'equilibrium' hypothesis that spiders, within a community of species, occupy different, relatively narrow niche axes and despite being generalists do not simply aggregate to the same resources. 4. In the first study of its kind, prey resources at web-sites were compared with those at matched non-web-sites with the same microhabitat properties. This was carried out for two subfamilies of Linyphiidae, one of which (Linyphiinae) is web-dependent and locates its web just above the ground, and the other (Erigoninae) is less web-dependent, locating its web on the ground and often hunting away from its web. We hypothesized that these subfamilies would locate their webs at microsites with enhanced densities of the prey most likely to be captured by their contrasting foraging strategies. We used spider weights as a surrogate for nutritional state, and compared spiders in webs with those without webs. 5. We found that even within a relatively uniform crop of wheat, spiders located their webs at microsites with greater prey resources. The most numerous prey, Collembola, were at significantly greater density at web-sites of both subfamilies of spider. However, there were significantly more Collembola at web-sites of the surface-hunting Erigoninae. By contrast, significantly more non-Collembola prey, especially aphids and Thysanoptera, were found at web-sites of the Linyphiinae, whose aerial webs might be expected to intercept such prey more efficiently. 6. These differences were also present at matched non-web-sites, suggesting that microsite selection by the spiders was determined by the spectra of prey present. Comparison of the weights of web-owning and non-web-owning Tenuiphantes tenuis (Linyphiinae) demonstrated the nutritional benefits of web-owning. 7. The results suggested that the spiders used a combination of web-location strategies at the microhabitat level, foraging behaviour and (known) high-intensity intraspecific competition, to exploit prey-rich microsites efficiently within fields in a dynamic manner.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, S Glam, Wales; Hort Res Int, Warwick CV35 9EF, England","Harwood, JD (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, POB 915, Cardiff CF10 3TL, S Glam, Wales.",HarwoodJD@Cardiff.ac.uk,"Symondson, William OC/A-4476-2010","Symondson, William/0000-0002-3343-4679; Harwood, James/0000-0002-0018-7288",,,,47,111,112,2,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Using a response surface design and a press manipulation of densities, we tested effects of competition within and between two species of coral reef fishes (Coryphopterus glaucofraneum and Gnatholepis thompsoni). By tracking individually tagged fishes, we showed that the per-capita effect of intraspecific competitors on individual growth was at least twice as great as the effect of interspecific competitors. Growth rate was better predicted by measures of density that incorporated body size, rather than numerical density, suggesting interference competition. Individuals of both species interacted aggressively with conspecifics at least twice as often as with heterospecifics. Individuals of both species also covered more area while foraging and spent less time in shelter when crowded than when at lower densities. In combination, these behaviours suggest that increased metabolic costs at high density contribute to competitive effects on growth. These competitive interactions occurred among adult fishes, so reduced growth may translate to reduced fecundity as well as reduced survival, and so contribute to population regulation.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93103 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Forrester, GE (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",gforrester@uri.edu,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X",,,,40,48,48,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2006,148,4,,,,,632,640,,10.1007/s00442-006-0397-0,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,056OG,WOS:000238533400010,16518631,,,,2021-09-27,

We investigated whether coexisting snail species in 145 treeless fen communities in the Western Carpathian Mountains differed more in size and diet than would be expected by chance, as predicted for traits commonly associated with competition and differential resource acquisition under limiting similarity theory. 2. Contrary to expectations, coexisting snail species were no more different in body size than expected by chance under a null model. However, variation in body size played a significant role in structuring snail communities: coexisting snail species were significantly more similar with respect to body size. 3. We developed two new test statistics to expand our investigation of limiting similarity to include diet, a nominal trait. We tested whether communities of snails were characterized by a greater richness of diet, and whether different diets were represented more or less evenly within communities. Communities of snails were significantly less evenly distributed than expected by chance, with detritivores being over-represented relative to predatory strategies. 4. We also examined the effect of water pH and conductivity, herbaceous cover, and bryophyte and vascular plant richness, on these trends by examining how the effect size of our tests varied across these gradients. Convergence in species size increased with increasing habitat pH. Specifically, smaller snail species were over-represented in fen communities in general, and this effect was accentuated in increasingly calcareous fens. 5. Theory predicts that traits related strongly to environmental conditions are more likely to be convergent. Our findings support this suggestion, as small snail species have an advantage in tolerating freezing conditions over winter when refuges are limited. 6. These results add to the growing body of literature demonstrating that variation in body size and diet play a strong role in structuring communities, although frequently in ways not predicted by limiting similarity theory. Finally, our results increase our understanding of how species are assembled non-randomly into communities with respect to important traits.","[Schamp, Brandon] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada; [Horsak, Michal; Hajek, Michal] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, CZ-61137 Brno, Czech Republic","Schamp, B (corresponding author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada.",brandon.schamp@algomau.ca,"Hajek, Michal/H-1648-2014","Hajek, Michal/0000-0002-5201-2682; Horsak, Michal/0000-0003-2742-2740","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; GAAVGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [B601630803]; MSMMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [0021622416]","We thank Petra Hajkova, Daniel Dite, Nicole Cernohorsky and Adam Lacina for help with the collection of field data.

One potential mechanism for these declines is interference competition via intraguild predation; specifically, increased predation of native coccinellid eggs and larvae following the introduction of exotic coccinellids. Our previous studies have shown that agricultural fields in Michigan support a higher diversity and abundance of exotic coccinellids than similar fields in Iowa, and that the landscape surrounding agricultural fields across the north central U. S. influences the abundance and activity of coccinellid species. The goal of this study was to quantify the amount of egg predation experienced by a native coccinellid within Michigan and Iowa soybean fields and explore the influence of local and large-scale landscape structure. Using the native lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata as a model, we found that sentinel egg masses were subject to intense predation within both Michigan and Iowa soybean fields, with 60.7% of egg masses attacked and 43.0% of available eggs consumed within 48 h. In Michigan, the exotic coccinellids Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis were the most abundant predators found in soybean fields whereas in Iowa, native species including C. maculata, Hippodamia parenthesis and the soft-winged flower beetle Collops nigriceps dominated the predator community. Predator abundance was greater in soybean fields within diverse landscapes, yet variation in predator numbers did not influence the intensity of egg predation observed. In contrast, the strongest predictor of native coccinellid egg predation was the composition of edge habitats bordering specific fields. Field sites surrounded by semi-natural habitats including forests, restored prairies, old fields, and pasturelands experienced greater egg predation than fields surrounded by other croplands. This study shows that intraguild predation by both native and exotic predators may contribute to native coccinellid decline, and that landscape structure interacts with local predator communities to shape the specific outcomes of predator-predator interactions.","[Gardiner, Mary M.; Landis, Douglas A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [O'Neal, Matthew E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA USA","Gardiner, MM (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Ohio Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Entomol, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.",gardiner.29@osu.edu,"Gardiner, Mary/B-3733-2012; Landis, Douglas A./L-7991-2019",,USDA CSREESUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2004-51101-02210]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1027253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research is the result of a multi-state collaborative effort funded by the USDA CSREES Risk Avoidance and Mitigation Program, grant number 2004-51101-02210.

In New Zealand, mammal-resistant fences have enabled multi-species mammal eradications in order to protect indigenous species. When house mice are the only mammals remaining in these biodiversity sanctuaries, they may reach a high population density, with potential consequences for their indigenous prey. We studied mouse populations in the absence of other mammals for 5 years at mammal-resistant fenced forest sites at Maungatautari, Waikato. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) to estimate mouse population density quarterly in two independently fenced sites, with contrasting levels of mouse management that were switched half-way through the study. In the absence of mouse control, mouse population density reached 30-46 ha(-1) at one site each year after summer breeding, and 23 ha(-1) at the other site. Mouse tracking rates in inked footprint tunnels were positively related to numbers of mice captured in each session, but not significantly to mouse density. The highest mouse densities were similar to estimates in New Zealand forest and alpine ecosystems after mass seeding (masting) events, but lower than estimates in another sanctuary and on some islands lacking larger terrestrial mammals. We suggest that in the absence of competition and predation from other mammals, food limitation may have prevented mouse populations from attaining very high densities in this mainland forest location.","[Wilson, Deborah J.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Innes, John G.; Fitzgerald, Neil B.; Bartlam, Scott; Watts, Corinne; Smale, Mark C.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand","Wilson, DJ (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",wilsond@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Wilson, Deborah J/B-8651-2008","Wilson, Deborah/0000-0002-6401-3092","Strategic Science Investment Fund for Crown Research Institutes from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation group; Waikato Regional Council","We thank Bill and Sue Garland for sustained friendly permission to access their private land, and Maungatautari Ecological Island Trust staff and volunteers for access to land and for other collaborations.

We evaluate the factors determining their use of prey (feeding rate and prey selection) by comparing prey use in the laboratory and in the field. Both seastars have the same preferred prey, the mussel Mytilus edulis, select medium-sized mussels (1.5-3.0 cm), and show similar responses to increasing mussel density (functional response). Differences between the two seastars in their feeding abilities appear to affect both their size selection of mussels and use of alternative prey when mussels become rare or absent. A. vulgaris selects larger mussels than L. polaris when mussel abundance is low, and this may optimize its energetic intake. L. polaris is be better able to prey on the crevice-dwelling clam Hiatella arctica and A. vulgaris on the ophiuroid Ophiopholis aculeata. These differences in prey selection may reduce potential competitive interactions between the two seastars, as they cause prey partitioning when the preferred prey is rare or absent. The greater feeding rate of A. vulgaris on larger mussels likely provides it with a competitive advantage when the abundance of preferred prey is limited. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The species was detected in the north-eastern Baltic Sea in 2003 and has rapidly expanded its distribution ever since. This invasive amphipod has been notably successful in shallow, soft and mixed bottom habitats becoming one of the most abundant gammarid colonizing such environments. This study carried out two experiments: (1) an outdoor aquarium experiment to assess interspecific competition among the invasive G. tigrinus and the native Gammarus duebeni and compare their reproductive potential, and (2) an in situ meshbag experiment to determine the effect of adult G. tigrinus and native gammarids on juvenile gammarid amphipods. These demonstrated that the adult G. tigrinus had no effects on the adult G. duebeni; however, the invasive amphipod had higher reproductive potential compared to the native species such as G. duebeni. Moreover, almost all adult gammarids exerted a significant predation pressure on juvenile amphipods. Thus, the combined effect of predation on juvenile amphipods and large brood production of G. tigrinus could be plausible explanations describing increased abundance of G. tigrinus and decrease of local gammarid populations in the north-eastern Baltic Sea but plausibly in similar shallow water habitats in other seas.

Our study tested whether benthic microhabitats with high flows provide suspension-feeding larval black flies (Simulium vittatum) with a spatial refuge in which the negative impact of predatory flatworms (Dugesia dorotocephala) is reduced. We conducted a short-term field experiment in Chester Creek (southeastern Pennsylvania, United States) to examine how the number of black fly larvae inhabiting the substrates responded to manipulated variations in flatworm abundance and current speed. The abundance of flatworms declined with increasing current speed, thereby creating the potential for sites with high flows to provide larvae with a refuge from these predators. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the final abundance of larvae exhibited a significant negative relationship to flatworm abundance and a significant positive relationship to current speed. After adjusting for variations in elapsed time and initial larval abundance, flow and predators explained 38% of the variation in the rate of change in larval abundance. The positive correlation between larval abundance and flow had two components: a positive, direct effect of flow on larvae, which arises because these food-limited consumers prefer to reside within sites with faster flows where they can feed at higher rates; and a negative effect of flow on predators, and of predators on larvae, which combine to yield a positive indirect effect of flow on larvae. This indirect effect demonstrates the existence of flow-mediated refuges (i.e., microhabitats in which the impact of predation is reduced due to high flows), although the effect accounts for a small proportion of total variation in larval abundance. A consideration of biomechanical relationships suggests that microhabitats with high flows are likely to create prey refuges in a wide range of freshwater and marine benthic environments. In particular, predators will often experience greater dislodgement forces than prey because of their larger size and because they project farther above the bed where current speeds are faster. Moreover, the ability to resist a given dislodgement force may be greater for many prey, especially those that are sessile or semi-sessile.","Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia, Patrick Ctr Environm Res, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA; Swarthmore Coll, Dept Biol, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Hart, DD (corresponding author), Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia, Patrick Ctr Environm Res, 1900 Benjamin Franklin Pkwy, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA.",hart@acnatsci.org,,,,,,66,39,40,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1998,114,2,,,,,263,273,,10.1007/s004420050445,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZG592,WOS:000073019100016,28307941,,,,2021-09-27,

However, dispersal may also exacerbate the negative effects of an invader. Introduced species can open or create new niche space, which could facilitate the establishment of competitors or predators that previously could not succeed in the uninvaded local community. To investigate the interaction between dispersal and invasion by a non-native consumer, we conducted a field mesocosm experiment that introduced zebra mussels into native zooplankton communities. Regional zooplankton were collected and added to both invaded and uninvaded communities. In uninvaded communities, zooplankton dispersal reduced cladoceran diversity by similar to 40%, rotifer abundance by similar to 65% and copepod nauplii abundance by similar to 80%. In invaded communities, dispersal increased cladoceran diversity by similar to 60%, but also further exacerbated the negative effects of zebra mussels on rotifer abundance.

Surveys of naturally breeding populations on an experimental pond site indicated that the two species often compete in the larval phase, and because both species may overwinter as larvae, interactions can occur between disparate size (year) classes. Using an additive design, I conducted field experiments manipulating densities of four species-class combinations (year I and II bullfrogs and green frogs) in the presence of low numbers of the other classes. The design permitted estimates of the effect of manipulated species/classes on different target classes and, because the latter were held constant, the effects of manipulated classes on themselves. Strong competitive effects were found within and between species/classes with one important exception. Neither class of green frogs affected small bullfrogs despite the fact that both had strong effects on large bullfrogs. Both classes of bullfrogs, however, affected both classes of green frogs. In general, smaller classes had a greater per unit biomass effect on target classes than larger classes and tolerated competitive effects better. Independent of size effects, bullfrogs appeared to be better competitors than green frogs because of other traits, presumably greater activity levels. I interpret these results in terms of a simple model of the ontogenetic scaling of foraging costs and gains. This model enables a mechanistic interpretation of the above results through the two components of competitive interactions, effect and response. Larger classes have greater per capita effects on resources, but because the gain curve is decelerating, smaller classes have greater per unit biomass effects. On the other hand, smaller classes respond less to competitors because net gain for these classes is higher of affected less by a decline in resources. I argue that to understand size-structured interactions in many taxa, we must first isolate the underlying ontogenetic or size-scaling component of competitive relations, and then add to these relations the effects of unique species traits.",,"WERNER, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT BIOL, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,66,123,127,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1994,75,1,,,,,197,213,,10.2307/1939394,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MP602,WOS:A1994MP60200019,,,,,2021-09-27,

In this study, we examine the impacts of the trophic ecology of non-native fishes on the three species' in the San Rafael River, Utah, USA. We employ a suite of abundance comparisons, stable isotope techniques and size-at-age back-calculation analyses to compare food web structure and growth rates of the three species' in study areas with and without established populations of non-native species. We found that the three species' are more abundant in areas with few non-native fishes present, regardless of habitat complexity. Stable isotope analyses indicate non-native fishes lengthen the food chain by 0.5 trophic positions. Further, the trophic niche spaces of the native fishes shift and are narrower in the presence of non-native fishes, as several non-native species' trophic niche spaces overlap almost entirely with each of the three species' (bluehead sucker and flannelmouth sucker 100%, roundtail chub 98.5%) indicating strong potential for competition. However, the three species' demonstrated no evidence of reduced growth in the presence of these non-native fishes.

Here, we use simple models to examine the management relevance of this disconnection between theory and experiments in communities with intraguild predation (IGP). Equilibrium theory shows that IGP can promote coexistence of competitors on a shared resource. However, adding the intraguild predator can result in higher resource densities than in a system with the intraguild prey alone with its resource. This has important management implications when the shared resource is a pest species whose population is controlled by natural enemies. Our models demonstrate why short-term experiments and studies ignoring alternate resources may bear no relationship to a system at equilibrium. Short-term experiments quantifying only attack rates can predict a broad range of outcomes. By ignoring conversion efficiency, consumer longevity, and immigration, short-term studies may, for example, cause erroneous decisions about the introduction of natural enemies in biological control. Thus, attack rates, conversion efficiencies, and immigration rates must all be quantified for a thorough, long-term understanding of IGP in field systems.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Briggs, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",cbriggs@berkeley.edu,"Briggs, Cheryl/F-7456-2013","Borer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2259-5853; Briggs, Cheryl/0000-0001-8674-5385",,,,26,81,83,1,22,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Results from this 2006 study suggest that the presence of alien predatory largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, may have influenced abundance and habitat selection of the native Galaxias zebratus at one location in a small CFR mountain stream. Numbers of adults, but not of juveniles, were significantly lower where M. salmoides was present, suggesting a size-specific influence on G. zebratus abundance. Because other studies have found the influence of a predator to be affected by prey size and the diel activity of predator and prey, we measured microhabitat use by adult and juvenile G. zebratus by day and by night. Galaxias zebratus selected deeper, faster-flowing microhabitats more strongly where M. salmoides was present than where it was absent. This suggests that G. zebratus adjusts its habitat use in the presence of M. salmoides, although differences in available habitat, or in interactions with other indigenous species, could be partly responsible for the observed differences. In-stream vegetation presence was strongly positively related to depth and strongly negatively related to velocity at positions where G. zebratus was observed, suggesting that the deeper, slower-flowing microhabitats occupied by G. zebratus were structurally more complex than the shallower, faster-flowing ones.","[Shelton, J.

Exploitative competition for food typically occurs at elevated densities, but crowding rarely results in mortality and competitive exclusion. Predation by decapods, gastropods, and, sometimes asteroids, is more important in controlling patterns of distribution and abundance. Most field tests leading to this synthesis have been conducted between 35 degreesN and 35 degreesS and/or with bivalves in the families Veneridae and Tellinidae. To test the robustness of these ecological processes at another geographic setting (45 degreesN) using a species from another family within the suspension-feeding guild (Myidae), we per-formed a short-term field manipulation at an intertidal mud flat in eastern Maine, USA. We followed survival and growth of 10,080 juveniles (12.4-mm shell length (SL)) of the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria L., in field enclosures with and without predator-deterrent netting at three densities (330, 660 and 1320 m(-2)) along a tidal gradient over four sampling intervals from April to December 1996. We used a generalized completely randomized block design to assess variation in these dependent variables within a given tidal height (high, mid, and low) on a particular date. Mortality varied seasonally, peaking (13.6%) between August and September when seawater temperatures were warmest. No significant mortality occurred after September, when mean (+/- 95% CI) percent survival pooled over all treatments was 72.9 +/- 8.5%. Netting (6.4-mm aperture) effectively excluded predators along the tidal gradient as overall mean clam survival, independent of tidal position, was 88.7 +/- 4.1% in protected units (plastic plant pots with area = 181 cm(2)), but decreased from upper and mid tide levels (82.9 +/- 6.1%) to lower on the shore (66.3 +/- 9.7%) in unprotected units. Density-dependent mortality resulted in reduced survival (-4.6%) in clams stocked at the two highest levels (P < 0.001); however. numbers of dead clams with undamaged valves provided little evidence that this effect was due to starvation. Incremental growth also varied seasonally with greatest a-mounts of shell added during June-August at all tidal levels. Shell growth stopped or slowed significantly after September at all tidal positions. Mean SL increased with decreasing tidal height (December sizes: high = 20.6 <plus/minus> 2.9 mm, mid = 24.1 +/- 1.0 mm; low = 28.2 +/- 1.2 mm), however. submergence time alone failed to explain completely these differences. Density-dependent growth was detected once (August-September). Animals at the two highest densities experienced a growth depression of ca. 7%. We conclude predation, rather than competition, is more important in regulating populations of soft-shell clams in this intertidal location. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, decreasing water quality and global warming are key contributors to coral reef decline, which poses substantial environmental threats. In response to this degradation, an innovative coral reef restoration technology, called Biorock, utilizes weak direct current electric fields to cause limestone deposition on conductive materials, inevitably inducing prolific coral reef growth. Although expediting coral growth, research on how the associated electric fields may impact the behavioural patterns of teleosts and/or organisms (i.e. elasmobranchs) possessing electroreception capabilities is lacking. Therefore, we studied the behavioural responses of two shark species, the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) and the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi) and multiple teleost species towards weak direct current electric fields in Bimini, Bahamas. Generalized linear mixed model analyses based on 90 trials illustrate that both the feeding and avoidance behaviors of C. leucas and C. perezi were significantly associated with treatment type, with the weak experimental electrode treatments resulting in the greatest quantity of avoidances and fewest feedings for both species. However, data analyses illustrate that teleost feeding behavior was not observably impacted by experimental treatments. Although the Biorock technology exhibits promise in coral reef restoration, the findings from this study illustrate a need for future large-scale studies assessing shark behavioral patterns around these devices, since the deterrence of apex predators may impact ecosystem balance.","[Uchoa, Marcella P.; O'Connell, Craig P.] OSeas Conservat Fdn, 3636 Waldo Ave,Apt 2B, Bronx, NY 10463 USA; [Goreau, Thomas J.] Global Coral Reef Alliance, 37 Pleasant St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","O'Connell, CP (corresponding author), OSeas Conservat Fdn, 3636 Waldo Ave,Apt 2B, Bronx, NY 10463 USA.",oseasfdn@gmail.com,,,Global Coral Reef Alliance; Wave Foundation; O'Seas Conservation Foundation,"We thank the Global Coral Reef Alliance, the Wave Foundation, and O'Seas Conservation Foundation for providing partial funding, equipment, and training to make this project possible.

The categorisation of 40 undisturbed lagoons into nine habitat types based on habitat isolation and archipelago position was supported by clear relationships with spring temperature and total fish abundance. Rutilus rutilus, breams (Abramis/Blicca sp.) and Perca fluviatilis were the most abundant and frequently occurring species. The fish assemblage differed among the nine habitat types. Rutilus rutilus, P. fluviatilis and breams were discriminating species in the majority of habitat types with low physical harshness, whereas Alburnus alburnus and Gasterosteus aculeatus increased their contributions in habitat types with high physical harshness. Rutilus rutilus and breams were thus common in lagoons with high habitat isolation situated in the inner archipelago. These lagoons were characterised by warm water and high vegetation coverage. Gasterosteus aculeatus was restricted to lagoons with low habitat isolation and exposure and low vegetation coverage, situated in the outer archipelago. Perca fluviatilis had the widest distribution of all species. The coverage of two macrophytes, Potamogeton perfoliatus and Zannichellia palustris, and salinity matched best the distance among habitat types. These habitat characteristics, as well as the fish abundances and assemblages differed most across the habitat types in the outer and mid archipelago zones and in the lowest habitat isolation. These patterns suggest that the structuring effect of habitat isolation increases along the archipelago gradient as differences between local and regional conditions increase. In the inner archipelago, overall low physical harshness induces homogeneous conditions and the habitat isolation is less important here than in the other zones. We suggest that this difference in the relative importance of the two gradients depending on the level of respective gradient ultimately forms these heterogeneous coastal habitats in a successional landscape. Rutilus rutilus and P. fluviatilis were responsible for large parts of the assemblage patterns. Although sympatric due to similar habitat requirements, differences in dispersal capability, competitive ability and predation vulnerability may add explanation to detected differences in distribution and abundance in these two species in an open system. Our results also stress the structuring role of vegetation in terms of total coverage and species composition, as these two aspects of macrophyte diversity may act as complementary habitat modifiers across gradients of physical harshness.

Yet this pattern of patch use also can be caused by dominant interspecific competitors. We develop a simple theory of this form of apparent predation risk that describes the patch use of an optimal forager confronted with dominant individuals. The theory predicts that subordinate animals should increase their use of safe foraging patches as the density of nearby dominants increases. We tested the theory with meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We used dyadic encounters to confirm that meadow voles are dominant over red-backed voles. We then evaluated their respective foraging patterns in pairs of covered and open patches in 4 adjacent subgrids in an old-field enclosure. Subordinate red-backed voles foraged indifferently between covered and open patches when few meadow voles were present. Red-backed voles increased their use of both patches as the number of nearby meadow voles increased. Giving-up densities were lowest, and harvesting efficiency highest, in covered patches when the number of nearby meadow voles was high. These results document competition between the 2 species and suggest that vigilance toward dominant meadow voles magnifies the risk experienced by red-backed voles in open patches. Investigators assessing foraging behavior between safe and risky patches might misinterpret the competitive effect as predation risk unless they 1st account for competition among foraging individuals.","[Halliday, William D.; Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Halliday, William D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Lakehead University,"We thank M.

The arctic fox in mainland Europe is endangered, while the red fox is increasing its range in the north. It has been suggested that the southern distribution limit of the arctic fox is determined by interspecific competition with the red fox. This has been criticised, on the basis that the species co-exist on a regional scale. However, if the larger red fox is superior and interspecific competition important, the arctic fox should avoid close contact, especially during the breeding season. Consequently, the distribution of breeding dens for the two species would be segregated on a much smaller spatial and temporal scale, in areas where they are sympatric. We tested this hypothesis by analysing den use of reproducing arctic and red foxes over 9 years in Sweden. High quality dens were inhabited by reproducing arctic foxes more often when no red foxes bred in the vicinity. Furthermore, in two out of three cases when arctic foxes did reproduce near red foxes, juveniles were killed by red foxes. We also found that breeding arctic foxes occupied dens at higher altitudes than red foxes did. in a large-scale field experiment, red foxes were removed, but the results were not conclusive. However, we conclude that on the scale of individual territories, arctic foxes avoid areas with red foxes. Through interspecific interference competition, the red fox might thus be excluding the arctic fox from breeding in low altitude habitat, which is most important in years when food abundance is limited and competition is most fierce. With high altitude refuges being less suitable, even small-scale behavioural effects could scale up to significant effects at the population level.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Tannerfeldt, M (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",tanner@zoologi.su.se,"Angerbjorn, Anders/A-5982-2013; Elmhagen, Bodil/M-4444-2014; Angerbjorn, Anders/AAX-3670-2021","Angerbjorn, Anders/0000-0001-5535-9086; Elmhagen, Bodil/0000-0001-5496-4727; ",,,,52,142,145,0,185,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2002,132,2,,,,,213,220,,10.1007/s00442-002-0967-8,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,580PL,WOS:000177242900008,28547354,,,,2021-09-27,

Previous work suggested that emergent rock on these shores is normally dominated by fucoid rockweeds because predatory whelks control the sessile animal competitors, mussels and barnacles, and because herbivorous littorinids control ephemeral algal competitors. Abundances of all species except seasonal ephemeral algae were very small throughout this experiment and we found no significant effects of carnivory, herbivory, plant-anima competition or plant-plant competition. A slight facilitation of Fucus recruitment is attributed to a thin mat of ephemeral, blue-green algae. Very few other studies have directly manipulated intertidal ephemeral algae. As primary succession may be very rare in this assemblage, these results may be specific to these circumstances, but they highlight the varying importance of species interactions with variable recruitment. In particular, it appears that variations in recruitment success may be important to community structure, even when recruitment is not limited by propagule supply. The scale of the study also provides insight into successional processes occurring after the recent, extensive ice-scour of exposed seashores in this region.","DALHOUSIE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, HALIFAX B3H 4H2, NS, CANADA",,,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012",,,,,66,61,61,0,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

These same changes in habitat quality should likewise affect the foraging efforts of individuals at the patch scale. We used density manipulations, fenced enclosures in the field, to examine patch use in two species of gerbils, Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi and G. pyramidum. At the same time, we used sand tracking to measure activity densities and confirm that gerbils show density-dependent habitat selection across the stabilized and semistabilized sand habitats. We then quantified individual patch use, using giving-up densities (GUD; the amount of food left behind in a resource patch following exploitation) in artificial food patches. Gerbils used resource patches in a density-dependent manner, showing lower GUDs at higher activity densities. Interestingly, this was not the case in both habitats. In the stabilized sand habitat, GUDs for both gerbils were high. and decreased with increasing activity density, but in the semistabilized dune habitat, GUDs remained constantly low. This led GUDs in the two habitats to converge at high activity densities. For these surprising findings We Suggest two mechanistically different explanations, one that relies oil the ideal despotic distribution and the other, on safety in numbers. Evidence Supports the second hypothesis, in which safety is pumped from the semistabilized to the stabilized habitat with increasing activity density.","[China, Victor; Kotler, Burt P.; Shefer, Noa; Abramsky, Zvika] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [China, Victor] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; [Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84993 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","China, V (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",victor.china@gmail.com,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012; ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF)US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2000127],"We thank Anat Ben-Natan for field work and enormous assistance, Hadas Hawlena for productive discussions, and the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.

Omnivory is an important interaction that has been the centre of numerous theoretical and empirical studies in recent years. Most of these studies examine the conditions necessary for coexistence between an omnivore and an intermediate consumer. Trait variation in ecological interactions (competition and predator tolerance) among intermediate consumers has not been considered in previous empirical studies despite the evidence that variation in species-specific traits can have important community-level effects. 2. I conducted a multifactorial microcosm experiment using species from the Sarracenia purpurea phytotelmata community, organisms that inhabit the water collected within its modified leaves. The basal trophic level consisted of bacterial decomposers, the second trophic level (intermediate consumers) consisted of protozoa and rotifers, and the third trophic level (omnivore) were larvae of the pitcher plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii. Trophic level number (1, 2 and 3), resources (low and high), omnivore density (low and high) and intermediate consumer (monoculture of five protozoa and rotifers) identity were manipulated. Abundance of the basal trophic level, intermediate consumers, and growth of the omnivore were measured, as well as time to extinction (intermediate consumers) and time to pupation (mosquito larvae). 3. The presence of different intermediate consumers affected both bacteria abundance and omnivore growth. At high resource levels, Poteriochromonas, Colpidium and Habrotrocha rosa reduced bacteria densities greater than omnivore reduction of bacteria. Mosquito larvae did not pupate at low resource levels except when Poteriochromonas and Colopoda were present as intermediate consumers. Communities with H. rosa were the only ones consistent with the prediction that omnivores should exclude intermediate consumers at high resources. 4. These results had mixed support for predictions from omnivory food web theory. Intermediate consumers responded and affected this community differently under different community structures and resource levels. Consequently, variation in species-specific traits can have important population- and community-level effects and needs to be considered in food webs with omnivory.","Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Biol Sci, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA","Kneitel, JM (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Biol Sci, 6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",kneitel@csus.edu,,"Kneitel, Jamie/0000-0002-7841-1198",,,,36,14,15,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Whilst many studies have shown elevational patterns in species richness and turnover, little is known about how food web structure is affected by elevation. Contrasting responses of predator and prey species to elevation may lead to changes in food web structure. We investigated how the quantitative structure of a herbivore-parasitoid food web changes with elevation in an Australian subtropical rain forest. On four occasions, spread over 1year, we hand-collected leaf miners at twelve sites, along three elevational gradients (between 493m and 1159m a.s.l). A total of 5030 insects, including 603 parasitoids, were reared, and summary food webs were created for each site. We also carried out a replicated manipulative experiment by translocating an abundant leaf-mining weevil Platynotocis sp., which largely escaped parasitism at high elevations (900m a.s.l.), to lower, warmer elevations, to test if it would experience higher parasitism pressure. We found strong evidence that the environmental change that occurs with increasing elevation affects food web structure. Quantitative measures of generality, vulnerability and interaction evenness decreased significantly with increasing elevation (and decreasing temperature), whilst elevation did not have a significant effect on connectance. Mined plant composition also had a significant effect on generality and vulnerability, but not on interaction evenness. Several relatively abundant species of leaf miner appeared to escape parasitism at higher elevations, but contrary to our prediction, Platynotocis sp. did not experience greater levels of parasitism when translocated to lower elevations. Our study indicates that leaf-mining herbivores and their parasitoids respond differently to environmental conditions imposed by elevation, thus producing structural changes in their food webs. Increasing temperatures and changes in vegetation communities that are likely to result from climate change may have a restructuring effect on host-parasitoid food webs. Our translocation experiment, however, indicated that leaf miners currently escaping parasitism at high elevations may not automatically experience higher parasitism under warmer conditions and future changes in food web structure may depend on the ability of parasitoids to adapt to novel hosts.","[Maunsell, Sarah C.; Kitching, Roger L.; Burwell, Chris J.] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Griffith Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Burwell, Chris J.] Queensland Museum, Nat Environm Program, South Brisbane, Qld 4101, Australia; [Morris, Rebecca J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Maunsell, SC (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan campus,Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",S.Maunsell@griffith.edu.au,,,Griffith School of Environment as part of SM's PhD programme; Environmental Futures Research Institute; Ecological Society of Australia; NCCARF terrestrial biodiversity network; Royal Society University Research FellowshipRoyal Society of London,"The authors would like to thank three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that greatly improved this manuscript.

We set up experimental polyp colonies of 3 scyphozoans (Aurelia coerulea, Nemopilema nomurai, Rhopilema esculentum) on settling plates in Jiaozhou Bay, China, and monitored them at 2-7 d intervals for 8 mo (December 2012 to August 2013). Polyps of A. coerulea survived, even proliferating by budding during the entire period, while those of N. nomurai and R. esculentum experienced high mortality and died out after strobilation. Strobilation in all 3 species occurred from late winter to early summer, but the exact timing, duration, frequency, strobilation percentage, and disc numbers strobila(-1) differed by species. A. coerulea started strobilation earliest, on 25 February (temperature: 3.9 degrees C), and persisted for 105 d until 9 June (18.1 degrees C). N. nomurai strobilated from 28 March to 9 June (6.4-18.1 degrees C), with some performing a second, less conspicuous strobilation from 6 May to 9 June (12.0-18.1 degrees C). R. esculentum strobilated last, from 15 April to 8 July (9.0-21.5 degrees C). Greater polyp population resilience in A. coerulea over N. nomurai and R. esculentum can be attributed, at least in part, to persistent propagation by budding, which may facilitate the annually recurring medusa blooms of A. coerulea observed in the region. The latter 2 species may give rise to medusa blooms only when their vulnerable polyps have survived well. Due to the later strobilation, R. esculentum ephyrae may be susceptible to competition for food with and predation by post-ephyra stages of A. coerulea and N. nomurai.","[Feng, Song; Sun, Song; Zhang, Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Feng, Song; Sun, Song; Zhang, Fang] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shi-Wei; Sun, Song; Zhang, Guang-Tao; Liu, Meng-Tan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Jiaozhou Bay Marine Ecosyst Res Stn, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Sun, Song] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Uye, Shin-ichi] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, 4-4 Kagamiyama 1 Chome, Higashihiroshima 7398528, Japan","Sun, S (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.; Sun, S (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.; Sun, S (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Jiaozhou Bay Marine Ecosyst Res Stn, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.; Sun, S (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",sunsong@qdio.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41706127]; State Key Program of National Natural Science of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41230963]; Aoshan Science and Technology Innovation Project [2016ASKJ02-2]; Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Ecology and Environmental Sciences [U1606404]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA11020305]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1404405]; CAS-PIFI Fellowship,"We thank Jennifer Purcell for constructive suggestions for an early version of the manuscript.

Several different mechanisms have been linked with strongly interacting species (e.g., predation, competition, abiotic habitat modification), but the most important organisms often influence ecosystems in multiple ways. We propose that these strong interactors share a broad common feature: They catalyze ecosystem processes, such as rates of primary productivity, species interactions, and/or physical disturbances. We provide a case study of Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata), focusing on its influence as a provider of large woody debris (LWD) on food web dynamics in tropical floodplain rivers and associated oxbow lakes. Large woody debris has been subject to considerable attention because of its perceived importance in creating geomorphologically favorable conditions for target commercial species (e.g., distribution of pools and riffle for salmonids). However, in this study we suggest that LWD catalyzes a suite of ecological processes in addition to geomorphology that determines its important role within aquatic communities. Through a factorial experiment manipulating large and small fish access to treatments with and without LWD piles, we tested the role of Spanish cedar in modifying interactions between different-sized fishes, invertebrates, and primary producers in a tropical floodplain river and associated oxbow lake. Path analysis revealed that fishes influence particulate matter accumulation and invertebrate abundances more so in wood piles than outside of wood piles in both river and lake ecosystem contexts. In addition to providing the first experimental test of factors controlling trophic dynamics in an Amazonian river, we suggest that understanding the role of organisms through the ecological processes they catalyze provides an overarching conceptual framework to link single species and ecosystem-based management strategies.","[Heilpern, Sebastian A.; Wootton, J.

Agricultural landscapes are characterised by high fragmentation with remnant semi-natural habitats being typically restricted to narrow field margins. These linear habitats are key to maintaining local biodiversity, but can also harbour irruptive pest species, such as voles. The common vole Microtus arvalis, is a main vertebrate pest in continental European farmlands, and recently invaded the inland Mediterranean agricultural landscapes of NW Spain, where regular crop-damaging outbreaks now occur. Knowing how reliant common voles are on field margins in Mediterranean agricultural landscapes would be an important step forward for more targeted management. Here we report on common vole habitat use in Mediterranean European farmland and compare them with those found in northern latitudes, thus seeking for both general patterns as well as geographical differences. We conducted seasonal trappings over 6-years in the main habitats (cereal and alfalfa crops, fallows, and their margins). We show a strong edge effect, in the form of an exponential decay in vole abundance from the margin towards the inside of fields, and vole abundances 23 times higher in margins that inside fields. The magnitude of this edge effect varied depending on crop type, season and vole abundance (density-dependence). Cereal crops were characterised by a stronger edge effect than alfalfas or fallows (with abundance 8-10 times higher in margins than in fields during spring and autumn). Cereals appeared as the least optimal habitat for common voles, with important spill-over of voles inside the fields in summer when densities increased. Field margins, where vegetation characteristics hardly change seasonally, provide a limited (5% of the agricultural surface) but stable habitat and key refuge for common voles in Mediterranean farmlands. Our results suggest that targeting management actions in the field margins of cereal crops during spring and autumn and inside alfalfa fields during population increases should be considered in integrated control schemes of crop-damaging common vole outbreaks.

We also measured the effect of parasitism on stem damage caused by the asparagus miner. The identity and abundance of the parasitoids of the asparagus miner were determined in asparagus fields in Michigan from weekly asparagus miner pupal collections during the 2010-2013 seasons. Twelve species of hymenopterous parasitoids were reared from asparagus miner pupae, including Chorebus rondanii (Giard) (Ichneumonoidea: Braconidae), 10 species in three families of Chalcidoidea, and one species of Bethylidae (Chrysidoidea), that represent new host records for the asparagus miner. C. rondanii and Thinodytes cephalon (Walker) (Pteromalidae) were the most common parasitoids. The effects of different diets and flowers on the lifespan of the pest and parasitoid adults were also evaluated. Buckwheat resulted in the shortest life span for the asparagus miner, whereas Riddell's goldenrod significantly increased its lifespan relative to the control. Parasitoid lifespan was doubled when individuals were fed sugar-rich diets. In the field, parasitoids preferred stems that contained more pupae and damage. The two most commonly reared parasitoids should be considered as targets for future conservation biological control efforts of the asparagus miner.","[Morrison, William R., III] USDA ARS, Appalachian Fruit Res Stn, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA; [Gibson, Gary A.

We tested the hypothesis that feeding damage to plants increases with plant size, as the conspicuousness of large plants makes resource finding and colonisation easier. Further, large plants can be attractive to herbivores, as they offer greater amounts and ranges of resources and niches, but direct evidence from experiments testing size effects on feeding damage and consequently on plant fitness is so far missing. We established a common garden experiment with a plant size gradient (10-130 cm height) using 21 annual Brassicaceae species, and quantified plant size, biomass and number of all aboveground components (flowers, fruits, leaves, stems) and their proportional feeding damage. Plant reproductive fitness was measured using seed number, 1000 seed weight and total seed weight. Feeding damage to the different plant components increased with plant size or component biomass, with mean damage levels being approximately 30 % for flowers, 5 % for fruits and 1 % for leaves and stems. Feeding damage affected plant reproductive fitness depending on feeding damage type, with flower damage having the strongest effect, shown by greatly reduced seed number, 1000 seed weight and total seed weight. Finally, we found an overall negative effect of plant size on 1000 seed weight, but not on seed number and total seed weight. In conclusion, being conspicuous and attractive to herbivores causes greater flower damage leading to higher fitness costs for large plants, which might be partly counterbalanced by benefits such as enhanced competitive/compensatory abilities or more mutualistic pollinator visits.","[Schlinkert, Hella; Westphal, Catrin; Clough, Yann; Ludwig, Martin; Tscharntke, Teja] Univ Gottingen, Agroecol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Clough, Yann] Ctr Environm & Climate Res, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Ludwig, Martin] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Phytomed, Inst Hort Prod Syst, D-30419 Hannover, Germany; [Kabouw, Patrick] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands","Schlinkert, H (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Agroecol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",hella.schlinkert@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Westphal, Catrin/F-9560-2015; Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Clough, Yann/B-9739-2014","Westphal, Catrin/0000-0002-2615-1339; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Ludwig, Hella/0000-0001-7645-9529; Clough, Yann/0000-0002-2901-7602",Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony,"Special thanks for help in the field go to Susanne Jahn and Brigitte Junemann, as well as to Christiane Schlinkert, Eugen Schlinkert, Barbara Scheid, Christina Fischer, Verena Rosch, Georg Everwand, Jenny Osterburg, Annabelle Rohlfing, Anna-Katharina Franke, Petra Kubisch, Alexandra Arndt, Carina Burmeister and Felix Steinmeyer.

The main factors that are thought to influence population size are either resources (bottom-up), or predation (top-down), or interspecific competition (parallel). However, there are highly variable and often contradictory results regarding their relative strengths and influence. These varied results are often interpreted as indicating shifting control among the three main factors, or a complex, nonlinear relationship among environmental variables, resource availability, predation, and competition. We argue here that there is a missing link in our understanding of predator-prey dynamics. We explore whether the landscape-of-fear model can help us clarify the inconsistencies and increase our understanding of the roles, extent, and possible interactions of top-down, bottom-up, and parallel factors on prey population abundance. We propose two main predictions derived from the landscape-of-fear model: (1) for a single species, we suggest that as the makeup of the landscape of fear changes from relatively safe to relatively risky, bottom-up impacts switch from strong to weak as top-down impacts go from weak to strong; (2) for two or more species, interspecific competitive interactions produce various combinations of bottom-up, top-down, and parallel impacts depending on the dominant competing species and whether the landscapes of fear are shared or distinctive among competing species. We contend that these predictions could successfully explain many of the complex and contradictory results of current research. We test some of these predictions based on long-term data for small mammals from the Chihuahuan Desert in the United States. and Mexico. We conclude that the landscape-of-fear model does provide reasonable explanations for many of the reported studies and should be tested further to better understand the effects of bottom-up, top-down, and parallel factors on population dynamics.","[Laundre, John W.; Hernandez, Lucina; Lopez-Portillo, Jorge; Gonzalez-Romero, Alberto; Grajales-Tam, Karina M.] Inst Ecol, AC, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Laundre, John W.; Hernandez, Lucina; Gronemeyer, Peg] New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Laundre, John W.; Hernandez, Lucina] SUNY Coll Oswego, Oswego, NY 13126 USA; [Lopez Medina, Perla] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Queretaro 76010, Qro, Mexico; [Campanella, Andrea] New Mexico State Univ, Jornada Basin LTER USDA ARS, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Browning, Dawn M.] USDA ARS Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Laundre, JW (corresponding author), Inst Ecol, AC, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",launjohn@hotmail.com,"Gonzalez-Romero, Alberto/Q-6701-2018; Portillo, Jorge Lopez/L-2492-2014; Grajales-Tam, Karina Magdalena/Q-6828-2018","Gonzalez-Romero, Alberto/0000-0001-5800-1223; Portillo, Jorge Lopez/0000-0002-6827-3297; Grajales-Tam, Karina Magdalena/0000-0002-8880-3275; Browning, Dawn M./0000-0002-1252-6013",CONACyT of MexicoConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [1843P-N9507]; Earthwatch Institute; INECOL [902-16]; SEMAR-NAT of Mexico; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0004526]; New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Center; TE Inc.; American Society of Mammalogists; Ecological Society of America; ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service [ARS-0423561] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER,"This work was conducted in conjunction with the Mapimi Long-Term Exclusion Experiment (MLTER) coordinated by L.

Short-term apparent competition is the negative indirect effect that one prey species has on another prey species via its effects on predator foraging behavior. In theory, the density-dependent foraging behavior of granivorous rodents and their preference for certain seeds are capable of inducing short-term apparent competition among seed species. In this study, I examined the foraging behavior of two heteromyid rodent species (family; Heteromyidae). Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) and little pocket mice (Perognathus longimembris). In one experiment I tested the preferences of both rodent species for the seeds of eight plant species. Both rodent species exhibited distinct hut variable preferences for some seeds and avoidance of others. However, the differences in preference appeared to have only an occasional effect on the strength of the short-term apparent competition detected in a field experiment. In another experiment, I found that captive individuals of both rodent species had approximately equal foraging effort (i.e., time spent foraging) in patches that contained a highly preferred seed type (Oryzopsis hymenoides) regardless of seed density and the presence of a less preferred seed type (Astragalus cicer) in the patches. The rodents also harvested a large proportion of O. hymenoides seeds regardless of initial seed density; this precluded a negative indirect effect of A. cicer on O. hymenoides. But there was a negative indirect effect of O hymenoides on A. cicer caused hy rodents having a lower foraging effort in patches that only contained A. cicer seeds than in patches that contained A. cicer and O. hymenoides seeds. The indirect interaction between O. hymenoides and A. cicer thus represented a case of short-term apparent competition that was non-reciprocal. h lost importantly, it was caused by the foraging behavior of the rodents.","Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Conservat Biol Program, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Veech, JA (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Pearson Hall,Room 212, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",,,,,,,30,31,31,3,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Herbivore communities can be sensitive to changes in predator pressure (top-down effects) and resource availability (bottom-up effects) in a wide range of systems. However, it remains unclear whether such top-down and bottom-up effects reflect direct impacts of predators and/or resources on herbivores, or are indirect, reflecting altered interactions among herbivore species. 2. We quantified direct and indirect effects of bottom-up and top-down processes on an eelgrass (Zostera marina) herbivore assemblage. In a field experiment, we factorially manipulated water column nutrients (with Osmocote TM slow-release fertilizer) and predation pressure (with predator exclusion cages) and measured the effects on herbivore abundance, richness and beta diversity. We examined likely mechanisms of community responses by statistically exploring the response of individual herbivore species to trophic manipulations. 3. Predators increased herbivore richness and total abundance, in both cases through indirect shifts in community composition. Increases in richness occurred through predator suppression of common gammarid amphipod species (Monocorophium acherusicum and Photis brevipes), permitting the inclusion of rarer gammarid species (Aoroides columbiae and Pontogeneia rostrata). Increased total herbivore abundance reflected increased abundance of a caprellid amphipod species (Caprella sp.), concurrent with declines in the abundance of other common species. Furthermore, predators decreased beta diversity by decreasing variability in Caprella sp. abundance among habitat patches. 4. Osmocote TM fertilization increased nutrient concentrations locally, but nutrients dissipated to background levels within 3 m of the fertilizer. Nutrient addition weakly affected the herbivore assemblage, not affecting richness and increasing total abundance by increasing one herbivore species (Caprella sp.). Nutrient addition did not affect beta diversity. 5. We demonstrated that assemblage-level effects of trophic manipulations on community structure are the result of distinct and often indirect responses of herbivore species. These results underscore the importance of understanding herbivore-herbivore interactions in a system commonly subjected to both eutrophication and overfishing.","[Amundrud, Sarah L.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Amundrud, SL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",amundrud@zoology.ubc.ca,"O'Connor, Mary I/F-2275-2010; O'Connor, Mary/R-2933-2019; Amundrud, Sarah/Y-9833-2019","O'Connor, Mary/0000-0001-9583-1592; Amundrud, Sarah/0000-0002-0457-1551",NSERC USRANatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"This research was supported by a NSERC USRA grant to SLA, and NSERC Discovery grants to MIO and DSS.

Land use in a buffer of 500 m was assessed, and alfalfa insect abundance was estimated with sticky yellow traps. The number of catches of several herbivores and predators was related to the proportion of landscape components and several field variables. Results indicated that the proportion of orchards in the buffer negatively affected the abundance of predators on alfalfa, likely because orchards treated with pesticides are a sink for predators moving in the landscape, among other possible causes. Other landscape variables such as noncrop habitats, winter cereals, and landscape diversity analysed by the Shannon index had a minor influence. Among field variables, field size influenced positively the abundance of insects on alfalfa, whereas alfalfa growth stage and age affected positively or negatively the different herbivores and predators. Of course, abundance of predators and prey was affected by the abundance of prey and predators, respectively. These findings suggest that a high proportion of intensively managed crops (orchards) in the landscape interferes with the role of alfalfa as a reservoir of predatory insects for adjacent crops and that the responses to local and landscape structures are temporal and species-specific as previously concluded for maize. Consequently, landscape and field management strategies to improve pest control must consider both types of variables as well as their changing influence when we modify them.","[Madeira, Filipe; Clemente-Orta, Gemma; Sossai, Samuel; Albajes, Ramon] Univ Lleida, AGROTECNIO Ctr, Rovira Roure 191, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Madeira, Filipe] MORE CoLab Mt Res Collaborat Lab, Environm & Ecosyst Management Area, Av Cidade Leon 596, P-5300358 Braganca, Portugal; [Alomar, Oscar; Batuecas, Ivan] IRTA Ctr Cabrils, Dept Protecc Vegetal, Cabrils 08348, Spain","Madeira, F (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, AGROTECNIO Ctr, Rovira Roure 191, Lleida 25198, Spain.; Madeira, F (corresponding author), MORE CoLab Mt Res Collaborat Lab, Environm & Ecosyst Management Area, Av Cidade Leon 596, P-5300358 Braganca, Portugal.",fmadeira@morecolab.pt,"Albajes, Ramon/AAZ-3784-2021; Orta, Gemma Maria Clemente/ABE-7278-2020; Madeira, Filipe/E-3592-2015","Orta, Gemma Maria Clemente/0000-0002-1948-8371; Madeira, Filipe/0000-0001-6585-2173","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [AGL2014-53970-C2-1-R, AGL2014-53970-C2-2-R, PID2019-107030RB-C21]; CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya; EU Horizon 2020 project EMPHASIS [634179]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES2015-072378, BES-2015-075700]; EU Horizon 2020 project EUCLID [633999]","This work was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) (Grant Numbers AGL2014-53970-C2-1-R, AGL2014-53970-C2-2-R and PID2019-107030RB-C21).

In addition, the ecology of juveniles is often distinctly different from that of other life-stages, including differences in interactions with predators and competitors and responses to the physical environment. In particular, newly-settled stages often experience quantitatively or qualitatively different predation than older life-stages. We have documented this in a New England hard substrate community where the wrasse, Tautogolabrus adspersus, and two species of tiny gastropods, Mitrella lunata and Anachis lafresnayi, prey on newly-settled and juvenile ascidians but not on adults. An extensive series of field experiments was conducted using artificial pilings placed subtidally. Results demonstrated that (1) the predators were extremely active and fairly specific in their prey, (2) predators could eliminate prey species regardless of settlement densities, (3) predation varied drastically with life-stage, and (4) predators control community structure and composition by altering the number of settling larvae that survived their first several weeks to become identifiable recruits.

However, most grazing experiments have been carried out with single snail species, and little is known about snail effects on trophic resources by coexisting species. Substrate colonization and feeding behavior of Physa spp. (Physidae) and Helisoma trivolvis (Planorbidae) were observed in single- and two-species laboratory trials. Spatial overlap between Physa and H. trivolvis was derived from distributions of snail individuals on trophic (living macrophytes, periphyton, and leaf litter) and spatial resources (aquarium space divided into quadrats). Food consumption was determined as biomass changes with respect to snail-devoid controls. Snails reduced the degree of spatial overlap when coexisting, though Physa appeared to affect H. trivolvis distribution more than vice-versa regardless of snail density. Both species preferred leaf litter as a substrate, and both increased nutrient (phosphorus) concentration of water. Periphyton and leaf litter biomass loss was similar in all snail-present aquaria, with only inedible leaf veins left intact at the end of the 10-day experiment.

The influence of species dispersal in a metacommunity is poorly understood, particularly its effect at the local community level. We aimed to address this deficiency by evaluating the potential influence of dispersal on local community structure in a rock pool metacommunity. Short term dispersal was quantified over an 11 day period by intercepting propagules dispersing via overflowing pool water and via wind. The composition of dispersing organisms was compared to natural local communities in the rock pools surveyed annually on 11 occasions. On average, the composition and abundance of dispersing species was approximately 54.1 +/- 9.3% (mean +/- SD) similar to the established pool community. Some species were more abundant among dispersers than they were in the pool community. This may be attributed to several factors including a variation in tolerance to environmental conditions, dispersal capacity, and local scale species interactions (predation and competition). In general, we found considerable similarity between short term dispersal and long term local community structure across a metacommunity. Differences in abundance patterns between the resident rock pool community and the dispersal assemblage emphasize that dispersal, a regional process, must interact with local factors in structuring communities.","[Sciullo, L.; Kolasa, J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada","Sciullo, L (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",lsciullo@gmail.com,,,National Sciences and Engineering Research Council grant (NSERC),We would like to thank Dr. J.

Colonies nesting semi-naturally in plywood nestboxes were studied using videography, extensive surveys, and colony-specific marking of gynes. Both single- and multiple-foundress colonies of P. dominulus were significantly more productive than comparable colonies of P. fuscatus. The disparity in productivity was significantly more pronounced in single-foundress colonies than in multiple-foundress colonies. P. dominulus had significantly shorter larval and pupal development times than P. fuscatus, which allowed P. dominulus to produce its first workers about a week earlier than P. fuscatus. P. dominulus had a number of additional advantages over P. fuscatus that contributed to its productivity including (1) significantly less parasitism by Strepsiptera, (2) significantly greater probability of renesting after predation by raccoons, (3) significantly lower usurpation pressures, and (4) possibly longer foraging days . The recovery of colony-marked foundresses indicated that gynes of P. dominulus suffered significantly greater mortality than gynes of P. fuscatus during winter diapause and that foundresses of both species were equally, strongly philopatric. P. dominulus is likely replacing P. fuscatus in many areas of southeastern Michigan via indirect or exploitative competition. The two species may be competing for nest sites.","Oakland Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Rochester, MI 48309 USA","Gamboa, GJ (corresponding author), Oakland Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Rochester, MI 48309 USA.",gamboa@oakland.edu,,,,,,9,38,42,0,22,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0020-1812,1420-9098,,INSECT SOC,Insect.

However, the current singular focus on harvest-mediated evolution in target species overlooks the potential for evolution in non-target members of communities. Here we use an individual-based model to explore the scope and pattern of harvest-mediated evolution at non-target trophic levels and its potential feedbacks on abundance and yield of the harvested species. The model reveals an eco-evolutionary trophic cascade, in which harvest at top trophic levels drives evolution of greater defense or competitiveness at subsequently lower trophic levels, resulting in alternating feedbacks on the abundance and yield of the harvested species. The net abundance and yield effects of these feedbacks depends on the intensity of harvest and attributes of non-target species. Our results provide an impetus and framework to evaluate the role of non-target species evolution in determining fisheries yield and sustainability.","[Wood, Zachary T.; Kinnison, Michael T.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Wood, Zachary T.; Kinnison, Michael T.] Univ Maine, Ecol & Environm Sci Program, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Palkovacs, Eric P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Wood, ZT (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA.; Wood, ZT (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Ecol & Environm Sci Program, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",zachary.t.wood@maine.edu,"Wood, Zachary T/AAH-3650-2020","Wood, Zachary T/0000-0001-7369-9199","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch through the Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment Station [ME0-31706, 3592]; University of Maine Graduate Student Government; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1457112, DEB 1457333]; NOAA Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystems and Climate; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1457112] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This project was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project number ME0-31706 through the Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment Station, publication number 3592.

In particular, the influence of small takes on fish assemblages is poorly understood. Field surveys and stable-isotope analyses were used to evaluate the impact of differing levels of flow abstraction on fish assemblage structure, and native-non-native patterns of coexistence, associated with small surface water abstractions in four streams in New Zealand. Study design accounted for longitudinal processes (spatial autocorrelation) to isolate the effects of abstractions on fish assemblages. Reaches with reduced flows downstream of abstraction points had significantly lower fish abundances per metre of stream length, probably because of decreased habitat size, altered interspecific interactions and barriers to movement. The loss of larger fish in reaches with high abstraction resulted in shallower mass-abundance slopes and shorter stable isotope-derived food-chain lengths, likely to have been caused by fewer trophic links in the food web. The large fish absent from these reaches were flow-sensitive introduced salmonids, resulting in higher relative abundances of small-bodied native fish, probably as a result of predatory and competitive release. Quantification of metrics designed to characterize ecosystem functioning as well as abundance and species composition indicated that small water abstractions can alter both the structure and composition of stream fish assemblages and modify the outcomes of native-non-native species interactions. Thus, a better understanding of the effects of small abstractions could be used to improve the strategic management of fish in invaded riverscapes.","[Boddy, Nixie C.; Fraley, Kevin M.; Warburton, Helen J.; Kelly, Dave; McIntosh, Angus R.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Jellyman, Phillip G.; Booker, Doug J.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand","Fraley, KM (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",kvnfraley@gmail.com,"Fraley, Kevin/J-5107-2019; McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011","Fraley, Kevin/0000-0001-5068-5616; McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813; Jellyman, Phil/0000-0002-5239-8239",NIWA Sustainable Water Allocation Programme; UC,"We thank Dr Richard White and other members of the University of Canterbury (UC) Freshwater Ecology Research Group for field assistance and advice during this project, and Gawler Downs Station for allowing access to sampling sites.

For a species approaching extinction, it is not possible to go back in time to measure the agents that operated at various stages of the decline. Accordingly, managers are often restricted to measuring factors currently affecting residual populations, which may not be related to factors that operated earlier in the decline, and inferring other mechanisms from different lines of evidence. In this review, I adopt a methodical diagnostic framework to comprehensively evaluate the potential causal factors for the decline of the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) in Tasmania, and propose a hypothesis as to the cause of decline. Potential causal agents were gleaned from two key sources: factors implicated in the eastern quoll's historical demise on the Australian mainland, and factors that changed during the recent period of quoll decline in Tasmania. The three most likely candidate causal agents were investigated over 4 years to evaluate their likely contribution to the decline. Here, I synthesise the findings from this recent research to advance a hypothesis as to the cause of the eastern quoll decline in Tasmania. I suggest that a period of unsuitable weather reduced quoll populations to an unprecedented low abundance, and that populations are now too small to overcome established threat intensities to which they were robust when at higher densities. Residual small populations are inherently more susceptible to demographic, environmental and genetic stochasticity and are unlikely to recover without management intervention. I propose a study design to experimentally test this hypothesis, and outline priority areas for future research and actions to guide in the future management and conservation of the species. This case study illustrates an approach by which practical species conservation problems might be solved and recovery strategies may be better informed, thereby ensuring positive conservation outcomes for threatened species.","[Fancourt, Bronwyn A.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Fancourt, BA (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Bronwyn.Fancourt@utas.edu.au,"Fancourt, Bronwyn/R-4278-2019","Fancourt, Bronwyn/0000-0003-2969-1530",,,,138,14,14,1,64,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,1448-5494,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

However, the interactions that underlie biotic resistance depend heavily on the contexts in which species interact. Consequently, studies of biotic resistance that consider single processes, patches, species or life-history stages may provide an incomplete picture of the capacity for communities to resist invasion. Many organisms have multiphasic life cycles, where individuals can occupy distinct niches at different stages of the life history. Generally, studies of biotic resistance focus on interactions within a single life-history stage, and interactions at other life-history stages are overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that different mechanisms of biotic resistance occur across the life history and together limit the invasion success of an introduced marine invertebrate (Ciona intestinalis) in Northern California. We tested the role of interactions (competition and predation) with the resident community in limiting the abundance of Ciona through experiments conducted on fertilization, larval survival, settlement, early postsettlement survival, and the survival of juveniles and adults. Under some circumstances, Ciona became abundant in mid-successional stages and showed more rapid growth rates than a morphologically similar native species, Ascidia ceratodes. However, predators reduced Ciona abundance much more than that of Ascidia at several life stages. Furthermore, Ciona appeared to be a weaker competitor at the adult stage. Early life-history interactions with other sessile species at the fertilization, larval and recruit stages had modest to no effects on Ciona abundance. The presence of biotic resistance mechanisms acting at multiple life stages, and potentially under different conditions, suggests that different components of biotic resistance interact to enhance the resident community's resistance to invasion.","[Rius, Marc] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Rius, Marc] CSIC, Ctr Adv Studies Blanes, CEAB, Blanes 17300, Spain; [Potter, Elaine E.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Aguirre, J.

Exotic plants often compete with native plants for space and limiting resources, potentially altering community floral dynamics. We used observations and a biomass-removal experiment to explore the effects of an invasive exotic flowering plant, Linaria vulgaris, on community and individual species flowering phenology and abundance in subalpine meadows in Colorado, USA. Invasion by L. vulgaris was associated with a shift in both the timing and abundance of community flowering. Invaded plant communities exhibited depressed flowering by 67% early in the season relative to uninvaded communities, but invaded sites produced 7.6 times more flowers than uninvaded sites once L. vulgaris began flowering. This increase in flowers at the end of the season was driven primarily by prolific flowering of L. vulgaris. We also found lower richness and evenness of resident flowering species in invaded plots during the period of L. vulgaris flowering. At the species level, a common native species (Potentilla pulcherrima) produced 71% fewer flowers in invaded relative to uninvaded plots, and the species had reduced duration of flowering in invaded relative to uninvaded sites. This result suggests that L. vulgaris does not simply alter the flowering of subordinate species but also the flowering of an individual common species in the plant community. We then used observational data to explore the relationship between L. vulgaris density and resident floral production but found only partial evidence that higher densities of L. vulgaris were associated with stronger effects on resident floral production. Taken together, results suggest that a dominant invasive plant can affect community and individual-species flowering.","[Wilke, Brook J.] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Wilke, Brook J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Wilke, Brook J.; Irwin, Rebecca E.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Irwin, Rebecca E.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Wilke, BJ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",wilkebro@msu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0089643, DEB-0455348]","We thank those who aided in data collection and species identification, including E.

These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.","Western Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; USDA, US Forest Serv, Pacific SW Res Stn, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; CNRS, CEBC, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR 5553, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; Natl Environm Res Council, Swindon SN2 1EU, Wilts, England; Univ Notre Dame, Dept Sci Biol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; Ecole Normale Super, Ecol Lab, UMR 7625, F-75230 Paris 05, France; Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, FIN-15140 Lahti, Finland; US Geol Survey, Mt Rushmore Natl Mem, Keystone, SD 57751 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Hooper, DU (corresponding author), Western Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",hooper@biol.wwu.edu,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Hector, Andrew/H-4199-2011; Setala, Heikki M/P-7354-2015; Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021; Chapin, F Stuart/AAZ-3931-2020; Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Hector, Andrew/0000-0002-1309-7716; Chapin, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; Setala, Heikki Martti/0000-0002-5230-4001",,,,391,4529,4826,287,8755,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

By allowing coevolution both within and between trophic levels the model breaks the traditional dichotomy between coevolution among competitors and coevolution between a prey and its predator. By allowing the diversity of prey and predator species to emerge as a property of the evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS), the model breaks another constraint of most approaches to coevolution that consider as fixed the number of coevolving species. The number of species comprising the ESS is influenced by a parameter that determines the predator's niche breadth. Depending upon the parameter's value the ESS may contain: 1) one prey and one predator species, 2) two prey and one predator, 3) two prey and two predators, 4) three prey and two predators, 5) three prey and three predators, etc. Evolutionarily, these different ESSs all emerge from the same model. Ecologically, however, these ESSs result in very different patterns of community organization. In some communities the predator species are ecologically keystone in that their removal results in extinctions among the prey species. In others, the removal of a predator species has no significant impact on the prey community. These varied ecological roles for the predator species contrasts sharply with the essential evolutionary role of the predators in promoting prey species diversity. The ghost of predation past in which a predator's insignificant ecological role obscures its essential evolutionary role may be a frequent property of communities of predator and prey.","UNIV ARIZONA,DEPT AEROSP & MECH ENGN,TUCSON,AZ 85721","BROWN, JS (corresponding author), UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT BIOL SCI,BOX 4348,CHICAGO,IL 60680, USA.",,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012",,,,,50,140,146,1,53,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,OCT,1992,46,5,,,,,1269,1283,,10.2307/2409936,,,15,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,JV371,WOS:A1992JV37100002,28569003,Bronze,,,2021-09-27,

We studied the type of interactions (competition and intraguild predation) that existed between the nymphal parasitoids Anagyrus cachamai and A. lapachosus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), two candidate neoclassical biocontrol agents against the Puerto Rican cactus pest mealybug, Hypogeococcus sp. (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). The surrogate native congener host in Argentina, the cactus mealybug Hypogeococcus sp., was studied to predict which species should be released; in the case that both should be released, in which order, and their potential impact on host suppression. In the laboratory we conducted experiments where different densities of the host mealybug were exposed to naive females of A. cachamai and A. lapachosus sequentially in both directions. Experiments were analyzed by combining a series of competitive behavioral and functional response models. A fully Bayesian approach was used to select the best explaining models and calculate their parameters. Intraguild predation existed between A. cachamai, the species that had the greatest ability to exploit the resource, and A. lapachosus, the strongest species in the interference competition. The role that intraguild predation played in suppression of Hypogeococcus sp. indicated that a multiple release strategy for the two biocontrol agents would produce better control than a single release; as for the release order, A. lapachosus should be released first.","[Aguirre, Maria B.; Logarzo, Guillermo A.] Fdn Estudio Especies Invas FuEDEI, Bolivar 1559, RA-1686 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Aguirre, Maria B.; Bruzzone, Octavio A.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Bruzzone, Octavio A.] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr INTA, Estn Expt Agr Bariloche, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Triapitsyn, Serguei V.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Diaz-Soltero, Hilda] US Anim & Plant Hlth Inspect Serv, USDA, San Juan, PR USA; [Hight, Stephen D.] Florida A&M Univ, Ctr Biol Control, USDA ARS CMAVE, Tallahassee, FL 32308 USA","Aguirre, MB (corresponding author), Fdn Estudio Especies Invas FuEDEI, Bolivar 1559, RA-1686 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.; Aguirre, MB (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",redbell_@hotmail.com,,,"USDA-APHIS Farm Bill [17-8130-0757-IA, 19-8130-0852-IA]; USDA-APHIS Invasive Species Coordination Program [APH-HQ-16-0181]","We thank Arabella Peard for reviewing the draft of the manuscript.

To address this, marine protected areas (MPAs) are often established to protect biodiversity and recover stocks. We analyzed the potential impact of establishing MPAs on marine ecosystems using mathematical models. We demonstrate that establishment of an MPA can sometimes result in a considerable decline, or even extinction, of a species. We focus on a prey-predator system in two patches, one exposed to fishing activity and the other protected (MPA). Our analyses reveal that the establishment of the MPA can cause a reduction in prey abundance, and even extinction of the prey. Such unintended consequences are more likely to occur if the predator species is a generalist and if the MPA is intended to protect only the predatory species. Further, a mobile predator that migrates adaptively rather than randomly is associated with a greater reduction in prey abundance.","[Takashina, Nao; Iwasa, Yoh] Kyushu Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Mougi, Akihiko] Ryukoku Univ, Dept Environm Solut Technol, Fac Sci & Technol, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan","Takashina, N (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",nao.takashina@gmail.com,"Takashina, Nao/AAB-6392-2020; Iwasa, Yoh/G-5368-2010","Takashina, Nao/0000-0002-9594-9264; Iwasa, Yoh/0000-0003-0691-1852","Ministry of the Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan [S9]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","This work was performed under the support of the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S9) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan, a Grant-in-Aid of JSPS entitled Experimental Social Sciences, and also a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) to YI.

The enclosures were sited at forest-field ecotones. Within them, we manipulated vole density, food patch microhabitat (i.e. predation risk) and distance from the forest edge. We studied the effect of these variables on giving-up densities of white-footed mice. Giving-up densities increased in response to higher Vole activity. Under higher vole activity, mice increased foraging costs associated with risky. open microhabitats. These results were consistent only with apparent competition. Thus shared predators may be contributing to the pattern of habitat selection between mice and voles along forest-field ecotones.","Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Schmidt, KA (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, MS 3131, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",kenneth.schmidt@ttu.edu,"Manson, Robert Hunter/AAD-6443-2021; Manson, Robert H/Q-9015-2018","Manson, Robert H/0000-0001-9732-8894",,,,45,5,5,1,26,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

I studied the breeding biology of the Yellow-faced Parrot (Alipiopsitta xanthops) between 2007 and 2009. Yellow-faced Parrots are endemic to the Cerrado (neotropical savanna) biome of central South America. Their reproductive biology is poorly known and here I provide basic information on reproduction, including breeding success, nest-site characteristics, and whether the availability of cavities is a limiting factor. Average clutch-size was two eggs, and hatching success was high (92%). All nests were in cavities in termite mounds, with used cavities deeper and with wider entrances than cavities that were not used. Entrances to nests were orientated towards the north-east. Although the number of cavities in the environment appears to be high, specific nesting requirements and competition with other cavity-nesting birds and insects may reduce the number of cavities that can be used. Nevertheless, nests were never observed to be reused and site-fidelity appeared to be low. Specific nesting requirements and low site-fidelity may create problems for near-threatened species with declining populations, such as the Yellow-faced Parrot. Additional studies and the immediate implementation of conservation actions are essential to avoid future declines of populations of Yellow-faced Parrots.","Univ Brasilia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-70253060 Brasilia, DF, Brazil","Dias, RI (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-70253060 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",raphaeligor@unb.br,"Dias, Raphael Igor/C-3155-2018","Dias, Raphael Igor/0000-0002-6804-7409",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"I am grateful to Alexandre Dias for the revision of, and useful comments on, this manuscript.

Increases in stress hormones in vertebrates may be associated with these processes and contribute to the decline in survival or reproduction of the native species. Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) have gone extinct across much of the British Isles and parts of Northern Italy following the introduction of North American invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). We extracted glucocorticoid metabolites from faecal samples to measure whether the presence of the invasive species causes an increase in physiological stress in individuals of the native species. We show that native red squirrels in seven sites where they co-occurred with invasive grey squirrels had glucocorticoid concentrations that were three times higher than those in five sites without the invasive species. Moreover, in a longitudinal study, stress hormones in native red squirrels increased after colonisation by grey squirrels. When we experimentally reduced the abundance of the invasive grey squirrels, the concentration of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in co-occurring red squirrels decreased significantly between pre- and postremoval periods. Hence, we found that the invasive species acts as a stressor which significantly increases the concentrations of glucocorticoids in the native species. Given that sustained elevations in glucocorticoids could reduce body growth and reproductive rate, our results are consistent with previous studies where the co-occurrence of the invasive grey squirrel was associated with smaller size and lower reproductive output in red squirrels.","[Santicchia, Francesca; Martinoli, Adriano; Wauters, Lucas Armand] Univ Insubria, Guido Tosi Res Grp, Environ Anal & Management Unit, Varese, Italy; [Dantzer, Ben; van Kesteren, Freya] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Dantzer, Ben] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Unit Physiol Pathophysiol & Expt Endocrinol, Dept Biomed Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Dept Vet Sci & Publ Hlth, Milan, Italy; [Wauters, Lucas Armand] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Antwerp, Belgium","Santicchia, F (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Via JH Dunant 3, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",f.santicchia@uninsubria.it,"Santicchia, Francesca/L-2591-2019; Dantzer, Ben/E-9779-2011; Ferrari, Nicola/E-6331-2013; Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008; Martinoli, Adriano/L-4924-2016","Santicchia, Francesca/0000-0003-4814-9632; Dantzer, Ben/0000-0002-3058-265X; Ferrari, Nicola/0000-0001-8959-3495; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Martinoli, Adriano/0000-0003-0298-0869; Wauters, Lucas Armand/0000-0002-7012-9200; van Kesteren, Freya/0000-0002-3034-9022; Wauters, Lucas/0000-0002-4871-5035",ESI (European Squirrel Initiative),ESI (European Squirrel Initiative),,69,20,20,2,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

To evaluate this hypothesis, the seasonal and inter-annual demographics of co-existing populations of Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia galeata mendotae in offshore Lake Michigan were evaluated during 2008-2016. Overall, D. g. mendotae composed 69% of the herbivorous cladocerans, but seasonal abundance varied so that early in the growing season, B longirostris were usually the most abundant species, whereas D. g. mendotae abundance peaked in September or October. Egg ratios (for adults) and birth rates for both species peaked during July-August, with overall mean egg ratios of 2.76 and 0.82 and overall birth rates of 0.09 and 0.06 for D. g. mendotae and B. longirostris, respectively. Egg ratios peaked before epilimnetic chlorophyll concentrations, which peaked in October or November. Birth rates declined in late summer/early fall, coinciding with declining egg ratios, decreasing water temperatures, and the onset of resting egg production. Predation requirements of Bythotrephes on both cladocerans was relatively high at times each year, and generally coincided or followed the peak period of production for both species. Low vertebrate planktivore abundance, higher egg ratios, and higher birth rates appear to facilitate the dominance of D. g. mendotae over B. longirostris despite high predation requirements on both species by Bythotrephes. However, high abundance early in the season before D. g. mendotae became abundant provided a mechanism for B. longirostris to co-exist with D. g. mendotae in the offshore of Lake Michigan.","[Pothoven, Steven A.] NOAA, Lake Michigan Field Stn, 1431 Beach St, Muskegon, MI 49441 USA; [Vanderploeg, Henry A.] NOAA, 4840 S State Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA","Pothoven, SA (corresponding author), NOAA, Lake Michigan Field Stn, 1431 Beach St, Muskegon, MI 49441 USA.",steve.pothoven@noaa.gov,,,,,,57,1,1,2,22,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",1863-9135,,,FUND APPL LIMNOL,Fundam.

Plant biomass was greatest when diverse predator assemblages induced antipredator behaviors in herbivores, an effect not further strengthened when predators could also kill caterpillars. Predators within diverse communities were more likely to forage on plants and to disrupt herbivore feeding, reflecting greater aversion to foraging among conspecific than heterospecific competitors. Predator diversity, therefore, initiated behavioral changes at the predator and then herbivore trophic levels, both to the benefit of plants. Our results indicate that strong, emergent species-richness effects can be transmitted entirely through behavioral interactions, independent of resource consumption.","[Steffan, Shawn A.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Steffan, SA (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Tree Fruit Res & Extens Ctr, Dept Entomol, 1100 N Western Ave, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA.",shawn_steffan@wsu.edu,,"Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102; Steffan, Shawn/0000-0002-2219-6409",National Research Initiative of the USDA-CSREESUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2004-01215]; Washington State University ARC,"This project was supported by the National Research Initiative of the USDA-CSREES (grant number #2004-01215) as well as by a Washington State University ARC Graduate Research Fellowship.

However, ecologists have only begun to explore non-trophic interactions in species-rich communities. We investigated interactions within a community including two predator-prey linkages separated in space: ground-active predatory beetles and their fly egg prey on the ground, and lady beetles and their aphid prey in plant foliage. In field and greenhouse experiments we found that ground-active predators preyed heavily on fly eggs except when both aphids and lady beetles were present. The aphids drop from the foliage to escape foraging lady beetles, and once on the ground apparently triggered ground-active predators to switch from attacking fly eggs to attacking aphids. This suggests that the first non-trophic interaction in the foliage, mediated by aphid antipredator behavior, in turn initiated and accentuated a second non-trophic interaction on the ground, mediated by prey-switching behavior by ground predators. Our results demonstrate that successive non-trophic interactions can be propagated along chains of more than three species, and can serve to link species that are otherwise spatially isolated.","[Prasad, Renee P.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Snyder, WE (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",wesnyder@wsu.edu,,"Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102",Organic Farming Research Foundation; United States Department of Agriculture's Western Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education programUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Natural Resources Conservation Endowment at Washington State University,"This work was supported by grants from the Organic Farming Research Foundation, the United States Department of Agriculture's Western Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program, and the Natural Resources Conservation Endowment at Washington State University.

The hypothesis that size-selective predation and species-specific prey behaviours facilitate the coexistence between larvae of invasive Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and U.S.A.-native Ochlerotatus triseriatus (Say) was tested experimentally with the predator Corethrella appendiculata (Grabham). 2. Larval behaviours associated with a higher risk of predation were identified, and prey behavioural responses were tested in either the physical presence of predators or in water containing predation cues. Larvae that thrashed on container bottoms had a higher risk of being captured by fourth instar C. appendiculata than did larvae resting on the water surface. Ochlerotatus triseriatus, but not A. albopictus, adopted low-risk behaviours in response to water-borne cues to predation. Both prey species reduced risky behaviours in the physical presence of the predator, but O. triseriatus showed a stronger response. 3. The vulnerability of 2nd and 3rd instar prey to predation was compared, and behavioural responses were correlated with prey vulnerability. Second instars of both species were more vulnerable to predation by C. appendiculata than were 3rd instars, and the 3rd instar A. albopictus was more vulnerable than O. triseriatus of the same stage. All instars of O. triseriatus showed a similar reduction of risky behaviours in response to the presence of C. appendiculata despite 4th instar prey being relatively invulnerable to size-selective predation. 4. Weaker predator avoidance, coupled with superior competitive ability, of invasive A. albopictus is likely to contribute to its coexistence with O. triseriatus in containers of the south-eastern U.S.A., where C. appendiculata can be abundant.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol, Normal, IL 61790 USA; Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci Behav Ecol Evolut, Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61761 USA; Univ Florida, Florida Med Entomol Lab, Vero Beach, FL USA","Kesavaraju, B (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",bkesava@ilstu.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI044793, R15AI051374] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI044793, R15 AI051374, R15 AI051374-01A1, R01 AI044793-05A2] Funding Source: Medline",,,44,50,50,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Dietary data of both species were analysed to draw conclusions on their ecology, possible dietary overlap, hints for coexistence mechanisms and community structure. In this study, M dasycneme and M. daubentonii fed mainly on Chironomidae (M dasycneme: 44.4%; M. daubentonii: 32.8%) and Trichoptera (M dasycneme: 20.4%; M daubentonii: 22.2%), showing a high trophic niche overlap and similar niche breadth. Nevertheless, there were differences in the diet of the two species concerning the predation of chironomids. Differences also occur regarding the prey types, referring to the terrestrial or aquatic life-cycle of prey groups. This could be evidence for different foraging habitats and a spatial segregation of both species.

Mobile facultative scavengers are likely to negatively impact tundra biodiversity as dominant competitors or predators, if they spill over into tundra. Here, we provide the first quantitative assessments of the structure of a scavenger guild in low arctic tundra with emphasis on how it changes along spatial gradients from neighbouring ecosystems (i.e. forest and coast) and with altitude (i.e. productivity gradients). We also assess the likelihood of interactions between guild members that may negatively impact vulnerable tundra species. Location North-eastern part of Norway. Methods Extensive records of scavenger prevalence were obtained by deploying automatic digital cameras at experimental carcasses in tundra regions covering several thousand square kilometres and three winters in northern Norway. Main conclusions We found short-range neighbourhood effects of forest and coast within the tundra scavenger guild. Species richness declined steeply with decreasing distance from the neighbouring ecosystems, in particular subarctic forest, and with increasing altitude. Bird species with strongholds in forest (golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos and hooded crow Corvus cornix) or along the coast (white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla) were mostly responsible for short-range neighbourhood effects on guild structure. However, the two most abundant guild members, the common raven Corvus corax and the red fox Vulpes vulpes, exhibited no spatial patterns within the range of neighbourhoods and altitudes examined. There was a clear diurnal segregation in the use of carcasses between birds and mammals reducing the likelihood of direct interactions between these two taxa. Presence of red fox appeared to exclude the arctic fox Vulpes lagopus, the only endemic tundra species within the guild, from carcasses.","[Killengreen, Siw T.; Stromseng, Elise; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Killengreen, ST (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",siw.killengreen@uit.no,"Killengreen, Siw/G-9205-2016; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039",Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management,"We would like to thank Ashild Bye, John Andre Henden, Erik Isakson, Bjorn Hugo Kristoffersen, Arne Petter Sarre, Elin Skog and Alfred Orjebu for skilled help during field work.

In theory, intraguild predators can therefore be very effective as biological control agents of intraguild prey species, especially in productive environments. We investigated this hypothesis using the mixotrophic chrysophyte Ochromonas as intraguild predator and the harmful cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa as its prey. Ochromonas can grow photoautotrophically, but can also graze efficiently on Microcystis. Hence, it competes with its prey for inorganic resources. We developed a mathematical model and parameterized it for our experimental food web. The model predicts dominance of Microcystis at low nutrient loads, coexistence of both species at intermediate nutrient loads, and dominance of Ochromonas but a strong decrease of Microcystis at high nutrient loads. We tested these theoretical predictions in chemostat experiments supplied with three different nitrogen concentrations. Ochromonas initially suppressed the Microcystis abundance by >97% compared to the Microcystis monocultures. Thereafter, however, Microcystis gradually recovered to similar to 20% of its monoculture abundance at low nitrogen loads, but to 50-60% at high nitrogen loads. Hence, Ochromonas largely lost control over the Microcystis population at high nitrogen loads. We explored several mechanisms that might explain this deviation from theoretical predictions, and found that intraspecific interference at high Ochromonas densities reduced their grazing rates on Microcystis. These results illustrate the potential of intraguild predation to control pest species, but also show that the effectiveness of their biological control can be reduced in productive environments.","[Wilken, Susanne; Naus-Wiezer, Suzanne; Van Donk, Ellen] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wilken, Susanne; Verspagen, Jolanda M.

The widely introduced Cane Toad, Rhinella marina, has attracted particular interest in studies of the effects of invasive species on native communities. In this study, we examined the effects of competition with invasive Cane Toad larvae on the growth, development, and survival of native White-lipped Frog (Leptodactylus albilabris) larvae. We conducted two experiments; the first was a food calibration experiment to determine appropriate high and low food concentrations, and the second was a competition experiment in which we varied species compositions and food availability. In the food calibration experiment, lower food levels reduced the survival of both species. In the competition experiment, the presence of R. marina reduced the proportion of L. albilabris that survived to metamorphosis under the high food treatment. Otherwise, the introduced species had little negative impact on the native species. In contrast, larvae of R. marina experienced severe reductions in growth and survival in the presence of L. albilabris. Significant effects of the presence of L. albilabris on R. marina development were observed as early as the first two weeks, and continued up to metamorphosis. We conclude that L. albilabris larvae outcompete R. marina larvae when their numbers are approximately equal. Adaptations to life in ephemeral habitats may have provided L. albilabris with a competitive advantage over R. marina. Further studies are needed to determine if these patterns persist under natural conditions.","[Flores-Nieves, Chris Z.; Logue, David M.; Santos-Flores, Carlos J.] Univ Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Ctr, Dept Biol, Mayaguez, PR 00680 USA","Logue, DM (corresponding author), Univ Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Ctr, Dept Biol, Carr 108 Barrio Miradero Km 1-3, Mayaguez, PR 00680 USA.",david.logue@upr.edu,"Logue, David/AAM-6781-2021",,"Department of Biology at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus","We would like to thank Yamil O.

A previous study showed that the beech leaf mining weevil, Orchestes fagi, was significantly less abundant close to horse-chestnut trees infested by the invasive horse-chestnut leaf mining moth, Cameraria ohridella, compared to control sites. Apparent competition through the sharing of natural enemies was proposed as a potential mechanism underlying this effect. To test the occurrence of apparent competition between the two leaf miner species, three observational studies and one experimental manipulation were carried out in Switzerland during 3 years. The total mortality, parasitism, predation and parasitoid diversity of larvae and pupae of O. fagi were compared between sites with and without horse-chestnut trees severely attacked by C. ohridella. Total mortality and predation rates of O. fagi were not significantly different between sites with and sites without C. ohridella. Despite a large overlap between the parasitoid complexes of the two leaf miners, parasitism of O. fagi was found to be positively influenced by the presence of horse-chestnuts infested by C. ohridella in only one of the four studies and only for 1 year. Similarly, parasitoid diversity was not higher near infested horse-chestnut trees compared to control sites. Thus, little evidence for apparent competition was found. Possible reasons, including possible insufficiencies in the experimental circumstances and design, are discussed.","[Pere, Christelle; Bell, Robert; Kenis, Marc] CABI Europe Switzerland, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland; [Pere, Christelle; Turlings, Ted C.

Apparent mutualism results when multiple prey species reduce predation risk for each other by altering a predator's functional response. Short-term apparent competition occurs when multiple prey species increase predation risks for each other through the numerical response, i.e. increasing the predator's birth rate, or aggregative response, i.e. attracting a higher density of predators. Our objectives in this study were to determine the aggregative response and 2-prey functional response of a predator and to examine indirect effects over a range of prey densities. We used the clam Macoma balthica and juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus as prey for adult blue crabs. In laboratory experiments, we determined the single-prey functional responses of the crabs to each prey species and the 2-prey functional response. We combined the 2-prey functional response with the known blue crab aggregative response to clams to estimate field predation rates. Our model predicts that at low prey densities, clams and juvenile blue crabs exhibit apparent mutualism, whereas at high clam densities, this relation switches to short-term apparent competition. These unexpected results highlight the need to incorporate multiple aspects of predation at multiple scales when considering indirect effects.","[Long, W.

These predators are predicted to select habitats that maximize the efficacy of their deceptive signal and offer high levels of prey traffic. The orchid mantis Hymenopus coronatus preys upon pollinators that are deceived by the predator's resemblance to a flower. Habitat patches that contain flowers can offer orchid mantises high levels of insect activity, yet may be detrimental to the success of their deceptive signaling strategy. Currently 2 exclusive hypotheses-previously applied to deceptive flowers-predict the interaction between signaling efficacy under different flower densities. Increased competition for pollinators from nearby flowers suggests that orchid mantis signals should be more effective when in isolation from flowers (remote habitats hypothesis). Alternatively, orchid mantises may benefit from increased insect activity when near flowers (magnet species hypothesis). We found that orchid mantises had no preference for inhabiting flowers over leafy vegetation. They were also no more effective in attracting prey when sitting upon flowers compared to when in isolation from flowers. However, field experiments revealed that the density of flowers in their immediate vicinity did have an effect on orchid mantis attractiveness. Mantises were visited by more flying insects when in patches of high flower density, suggesting that they benefit from the magnet species effect. Co-occurring flowers do not negatively impact the efficacy of the orchid mantis' deceptive signal and areas with high densities of flowers may allow them access to high levels of prey availability.","[O'Hanlon, J.

The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and assemblage composition. 2. We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and (ii) their host plant specificity. 3. Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of spatial scales. 5. Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to host-parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or consumer species. 6. Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in seed predation rates for plant recruitment. Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding of the ecology of insect seed predator-plant interactions will be valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops. Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of ecological communities more widely.","[Lewis, Owen T.; Gripenberg, Sofia] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Lewis, OT (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",owen.lewis@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Lewis, Owen T/B-9531-2011","Lewis, Owen/0000-0001-7935-6111",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/D010721/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,69,41,43,3,95,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The intensity of predation is greatly influenced by the environment, and the physical structure of habitats may influence predation intensity by providing refuge for prey or reducing the foraging efficiency of predators. In this context, the aim of the present study is to verify the influence of predation on the richness and density patterns of crustaceans inhabiting different species of Mussismilia corals, which provide various habitat structures for the associated fauna. We conducted an exclusion experiment to include total, partial and no cage treatments. The richness and density of crustaceans differed among coral species and cage treatments, except between partial cage and no cage treatment. Mussismilia harttii showed higher richness and density in uncaged and partial cage treatments compared with M. braziliensis, which in turn showed higher values than M. hispida. These findings indicate the importance of predation in the structure of crustacean assemblage associated with Mussismilia species and that differences in the richness and abundance of associated fauna result from the different habitat structures provided by each species of Mussismilia.","[Nogueira, Marcos M.; Neves, Elizabeth; Johnsson, Rodrigo] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, LAB MAR Lab Invertebrados Marinhos Crustacea Cnid, Rua Barao de Jeremoabo 147,Campus Ondina, BR-40170115 Salvador, BA, Brazil","Nogueira, MM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, LAB MAR Lab Invertebrados Marinhos Crustacea Cnid, Rua Barao de Jeremoabo 147,Campus Ondina, BR-40170115 Salvador, BA, Brazil.",mmouran@gmail.com,,,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa no Estado da Bahia (FAPESB),Scholarship funded by Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) and Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa no Estado da Bahia (FAPESB).,,27,1,1,1,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1438-387X,1438-3888,,HELGOLAND MAR RES,Helgoland Mar.

Introductions of alien species are unplanned experiments allowing investigation of co-adaptation of both native and invasive species over a short period. We analysed food niche differentiation between native European mink and alien American mink after invasion of the latter species in Belarus. European mink feed mainly on crayfish, frogs and fish whereas American mink prefer small mammals, fish and frogs. The diet of both species varied between seasons and during the period of alien mink invasion. Concurrent with the progress of American mink invasion, the European mink food niche has narrowed to feeding mainly on frogs, with the proportion of aquatic prey (fish and crayfish) in their diet drastically reduced. In contrast, the American mink food niche became wider during invasion. The breadth was stable but included a varied proportion of different prey categories: namely an increased proportion of aquatic prey and a decreased proportion of water vole and waterfowl. The increase in abundance of American mink saw a decrease in the proportion of larger prey in their diet. When American mink preyed more often on frogs, food niche overlap of both predators increased. This result suggests that arrival of an alien competitor reduced food abundance (exploitative competition) and caused a change in native mink diet.","[Zalewski, Andrzej] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowicza, Poland; [Sidorovich, Vadim E.; Polozov, Alexey G.] Natl Acad Sci Belarus, Vertebrate Predat Res Unit, Inst Zool, Minsk 220072, BELARUS","Zalewski, A (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowicza, Poland.",zalewski@zbs.bialowieza.pl,"Zalewski, Andrzej/K-7271-2012","Zalewski, Andrzej/0000-0003-4518-2787",British Government's Darwin Initiative Foundation; Institute of Zoology of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus; Marie Curie European Reintegration GrantEuropean Commission,"The main financial support was provided by the British Government's Darwin Initiative Foundation.

Metaproteomic and metabolite findings from the laboratory were then corroborated using regression-based modeling performed on metagenomic and metabolite data from more than 40 produced fluids from five hydraulically fractured shale wells. Collectively, our findings show that Halanaerobium, Geotoga, and Methanohalophilus strain abundances predict a significant fraction of nitrogen and carbon metabolites in the field.

The distribution of estuarine organisms depends on the availability of suitable environmental conditions, the extent of which may differ across seasons. Furthermore, ecological interactions among organisms, such as predation and competition, often occur when multiple species overlap spatiotemporally and can influence their distributions and abundances. Determining the habitat associations and overlap patterns among predator and prey species across seasons can thus enhance our understanding of ecosystem function. This study used a long-term monitoring data set to examine the habitat suitability and overlap patterns between 4 predator and 4 prey species in a northwestern Gulf of Mexico estuary. Seasonal (fall and spring) habitat suitability models and maps were created, which allowed for delineation of spatiotemporal overlap between predators and prey. Environmental drivers of habitat suitability differed among species, but temperature and salinity were frequently the most important variables. Seasonal differences in habitat suitability were observed for all species, but these differences were more notable for prey than for predators. Seasonality in habitat suitability was likely driven primarily by seasonal changes in environmental conditions and movements related to reproductive activities. Spatiotemporal overlap between predators and prey was observed primarily in whichever season each prey species was more abundant and in regions where highly suitable habitat was most ubiquitous for each predator. These results suggest that overlap between these predators and prey is highly seasonal, implying seasonality in the diets of predators and predation pressure on prey.","[Livernois, Mariah C.; Wells, R.

A primary question for these systems is whether the two predators produce emergent effects: greater or less prey mortality than expected based on the two predators acting alone. We conducted an in-lab experiment on a two predator (the crab Cancer productus and the sea-star Evasterias troschelii), one prey (the bivalve Mytilus trossulus) system common to the marine rocky intertidal of the northeastern Pacific. In 156 mesocosm experimental trials, mortality rates of M. trossulus were compared between Crabs only, Sea-stars only, and a Mixed treatment with both predators present. The experiment used a substitutive design, i.e., predator density was held constant. Based on a Linear Mixed Effects Model, the interactive effects of the number of predator species and water temperature had the greatest effect on mussel mortality. For the observed temperature range, the two predators in the Mixed treatment killed fewer mussels than expected based on the average mussel mortality of the one-predator treatments. As the two predators were never observed to interfere with each other directly, the reduced prey mortality is possibly a trait-mediated indirect interaction, involving behavioral modification (mutual avoidance) on the part of the predators. Temperature may mediate these results; crabs consumed more mussels at higher temperatures while sea-stars did so at lower temperatures. As these experiments were conducted over a large part of the known temperature range for this region, these results suggest that mussels may experience seasonal shifts in both predation rates and the identity of the predator, which should be investigated in future field studies. Increasingly warmer temperatures anticipated in the coming century could increase mussel mortality due to predation by cancrid crabs, which appear to have temperature responsive feeding rates. Understanding this two-predator one-prey system better is particularly important given that mussels are important foundational species, and recent climate change has affected abundances of the taxa involved.","[Leighton, Lindsey R.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Tyler, Carrie L.] Univ Miami, Dept Geol & Environm Earth Sci, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Leighton, LR (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",lindseyrleighton@gmail.com,,,NSERC Discovery Grant (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); National Geographic Research GrantNational Geographic Society,"This research was funded by an NSERC Discovery Grant (Canada), and a National Geographic Research Grant to Leighton.

The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis on temporal samples (10-57 years) of 19 breeding bird assemblages of various habitats. We used presence/absence null model (SIM2) in combination with the C-score and Sorensen indices. The C-score index estimates the average number of checkerboards for two species, while the S(sic)rensen index measures the qualitative similarity of co-occurrence between two species in a time series. We used pairwise null model analysis to select significant species pairs based on three selection criteria: the standard confidence interval criterion, conservative empirical Bayes mean based criterion and confidence limit based criterion. Altogether, 21402 species pairs were analysed. The SIM2 algorithm detected from 157 to 7 segregated pairs depending on the selection criterion. The number of significant negative pairs with possible biological significance (foraging guild membership, predator-prey interactions) was far lower and represented approximately 0.0-0.3% (4-65) of pairs in a matrix. Indeed, the number of detected negative associations depended on the selection criterion. Moreover, the number of segregated pairs was negatively related to the area of the census plots and fill of the species matrix. Our results underline the minor importance of interspecific competitive interactions in temporal patterns of bird assemblages.

Human exploitation of marine resources leads to increasing amounts of anthropogenic sound underwater, which may affect marine life negatively. Marine mammals and fishes are known to use sounds and to be affected by anthropogenic noise, but relatively little is known about invertebrates such as decapod crustaceans. We conducted experimental trials in the natural conditions of a quiet cove. We attracted shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) and common shrimps (Crangon crangon) with an experimentally fixed food item and compared trials in which we started playback of a broadband artificial sound to trials without exposure. During trials with sound exposure, the cumulative count of crabs that aggregated at the food item was lower, while variation in cumulative shrimp count could be explained by a negative correlation with crabs. These results suggest that crabs may be negatively affected by artificially elevated noise levels, but that shrimps may indirectly benefit by competitive release. Eating activity for the animals present was not affected by the sound treatment in either species. Our results show that moderate changes in acoustic conditions due to human activities can affect foraging interactions at the base of the marine food chain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the majority of the studies have been entirely based on the call counts, and they agreed that vocal activity was a good indicator of chick's nutritional need and/or condition. Fewer researches were dedicated to the temporal-frequency variables of the begging calls themselves and they showed contrary results. Here begging behaviour in three burrow nested, uniparous species of auks (Alcidae) was studied. These objects provide an opportunity to study the signalling value of begging calls in the absence of important confounding factors such as nestling competition and predation pressure. I recorded calls of individual chicks in two conditions: during natural feeding and after experimental four-hour food deprivation. I found that almost all measured acoustic variables contain information about the chick's state in all studied species. The hungry chicks produced calls higher in fundamental frequency and power variables and at higher calling rate compared to naturally feeding chicks. The effect of food deprivation on most acoustic variables exceeded both the effects of individuality and species. In all studied species, the frequency variables were stronger affected by hunger than the calling rate and call durations. I suppose that such strong change of acoustic variables after food deprivation can be explained by absence of vocal individual identification in these birds. As parents do not need to check individuality of the chick in the burrow, which they find visually during the day time, the chicks could use all of the acoustic variables to communicate about their nutritional needs.","Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Moscow 119234, Russia","Klenova, AV (corresponding author), Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Vorobievy Gory 1-12, Moscow 119234, Russia.",anna.v.klenova@gmail.com,,,Russian Scientific FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-14-00237]; Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-14-00237] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,"Funding: To conduct this study AVK was funded by the Russian Scientific Foundation (grant 14-14-00237).

We also studied the response of weasels to odours of the two species in the laboratory. The enclosure experiment was conducted using constant vole densities (16 voles/ha) but with varying relative abundance of the two species. Weasels showed higher predation rates on bank voles, and males had higher predation rate than females. Females killed disproportionately more of the more abundant prey species, but they preferred bank voles to field voles when both were equally available. Overall, the predation rate also increased with increasing abundance of bank voles. Therefore our results are in agreement with earlier laboratory results showing preference for bank voles, even if no intrinsic preference for odours of either species was observed in our laboratory study. We suggest that the least weasel hunts according to prey availability, prey aggregation and suitability of hunting habitat, and that this causes the observed dependence of least weasels on field voles and emphasises the role of the field vole in the vole-weasel interaction in cyclic vole populations. Furthermore, our results suggest that predation by weasels may facilitate the coexistence of the two vole species via predator switching, and that it may cause the observed synchrony in dynamics between vole species.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Systemat & Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Sundell, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Systemat & Ecol, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",janne.sundell@helsinki.fi,,,,,,59,47,47,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2003,101,3,,,,,615,623,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12264.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,680PH,WOS:000182986200019,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, resource acquisition often involves conflicting functional demands that may ultimately shape broader ecological patterns. For instance, termites play major roles in ecosystem functioning through their foraging and building activities. Yet, while experiments suggest improved foraging in sand, nest construction depends on clay. Hence, these functions may trade off, with species optima reflecting interspecific variation in building requirements. We investigated whether a foraging-building trade-off could affect termite populations by using three species differing in building requirements, namely Neocapritermes braziliensis, Anoplotermes banksi and Labiotermes labralis. We characterized their populations in relation to soil texture and food amount across a tropical rain forest landscape, and then compared the observed patterns. Colony density was unrelated to food amount in the three species. However, A. banksi was denser at balanced mixtures of sand and clay, consistent with a compromise between foraging and building demands. Further, the species building more mineralized nests (L. labralis) was more abundant on clayish soils, whereas the species relying less on soil for nest construction (N. braziliensis) was more abundant on sandy soils. Changes in colony density correlated with changes in size structure: in N. braziliensis and A. banksi, colony mass variability increased with density due to a sharp decrease in minimum colony mass, consistent with higher productivity and/or size-asymmetric competition. This study suggests a novel functional trade-off that may help drive population density and size structure both within and across termite species.","[Costa Lima Pequeno, Pedro Aurelio] Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Grad Program Ecol, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Franklin, Elizabeth] Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Biodivers Coordinat, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Venticinque, Eduardo Martins] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Bot Ecol & Zool, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Serrao Acioli, Agno Nonato] Univ Fed Amazonas, Inst Nat & Culture, BR-69630000 Benjamin Constant, AM, Brazil","Pequeno, PACL (corresponding author), Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Grad Program Ecol, Av Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",pacolipe@gmail.com,"Venticinque, Eduardo M/G-8961-2015","Venticinque, Eduardo M/0000-0002-3455-9107; Pequeno, Pedro/0000-0001-7350-0485","Brazilian state of Amazonas' Foundation for Research Support (FAPEAM); Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [470375/2006-0, 558318/2009-6]","We thank the staff of Fazenda UFAM, Jonatha P. da Silva, Rosinaldo C.

The ACH has been deduced from a theory that postulates that environmental conditions should be most favourable for a species at the centre of its distribution. This idealised density pattern, however, has been supported by limited field studies, as natural patterns are often more complex. It is thus of interest to examine under what conditions compliance with the ACH could be favoured. Such conditions could be smooth environmental gradients with limited habitat patchiness throughout the distribution range of a species. Thus, we tested the ACH by measuring the density of an intertidal barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) across its full vertical distribution range (from low to high elevations) on a rocky shore with similar substrate properties across elevations. To do a reliable test, we surveyed eight elevation zones applying an equal sampling effort in each zone. Average barnacle density conformed to the ACH, as it peaked at the middle of the vertical distribution range of this species. The same underlying theory predicts a similar unimodal pattern for maximum body size, but this trait was decoupled from density, as maximum barnacle size increased from low to high elevations. Overall, although the ACH is not a universal predictive tool as once envisioned, it may predict some cases well, as shown by this study. Therefore, the ACH should not be discarded completely, and its domain of application should be further evaluated.","[Scrosati, Ricardo A.; Freeman, Matthew J.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, Antigonish, NS, Canada","Scrosati, RA (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, Antigonish, NS, Canada.",rscrosat@stfx.ca,"Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [311624],"This study was funded by a Discovery Grant (#311624) awarded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to Ricardo A.

As a strong test of the prevailing generalization that competition plays a relatively trivial role among suspension-feeding invertebrates in the soft sediments on the estuarine seafloor, we manipulated local densities of bivalves, two species of Katelysia, in a Western Australia lagoon, characterized by exceptionally high bivalve abundances (averaging 157 m-2). 2. Competition appeared weakly and sporadically, evident in only one of five intervals, when survivorship was 20-30% lower, production of undamaged empty shells 3-5 times higher, and average growth of survivors 50% lower for both Katelysia scalarina Lamarck and Katelysia rhytiphora Lamarck in the highest density treatment (320 m-2) than in the others (20-160 m-2). 3. Surprisingly, during both winter-spring intervals survivorship was also 25% lower at the lowest density for both species. The type of mortality was one that resulted in disappearance of the empty shell. Addition of sufficient numbers of sham clams, dead shells filled with sand and implanted in living position in the sediments, acted to prevent the enhancement of mortality at low density. This demonstration of the importance of a structural barrier implies that the agent of mortality at low density is a predator. Sampling error, emigration and post-mortem transport by scavengers can be ruled out by results of direct tests. 4. In a caging experiment, the predatory seastar Coscinasterias calamaria (Gray) replicated the pattern of enhanced predation rate on Katelysia of both species at low density. This represents a candidate for the unknown predator that was deterred by the structural barrier created by crowding of shells. A demersal fish is an alternative candidate. 5. Contrary to previous data for suspension feeders in estuarine soft sediments, which commonly show negative effects of adults on local recruitment of young, recruitment of K. scalarina was greater around higher densities of adult bivalves in one of two tests. Survivorship of recruits did not vary with adult density, suggesting that the recruitment pattern may have resulted from gregarious larval settlement around adults rather than from differences in early post-settlement survivorship. 6. Evolution and expression of gregarious settlement may be a reasonable expectation, given the sporadic and small penalties of competition, and the large and repeated benefits of mutual defences at high density. More broadly, positive interactions such as commensalism, mutualism and facilitation might be expected to be more prevalent in systems like the soft-sediment benthos where competition is so ineffective and relatively unimportant.","UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA, DEPT ZOOL, NEDLANDS, WA 6009, AUSTRALIA","PETERSON, CH (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012; Black, Robert/F-5312-2013","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Black, William/0000-0001-6839-8674",,,,64,57,59,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Contrary to these premises, evidence of interspecific competition in web-weaving spiders is ambiguous, and new experiments on natural communities are interesting. This paper reports on an experiment designed to test competitive effects in a natural community of web-weaving spiders, accomplished by selective removal of each of the three locally dominant species: Araneus marmoreus, Argiope bruennichi, and Agelena labyrinthica. No statistically significant difference was found among control plots and the plots where one of the three species had been removed, for any of the variables measured, but the small number of replicates limited statistic power. Considering only effect direction, and not statistical significance, these removal experiments supported competitive effects on community structure, habitat overlap, and spider body size. On the other hand, effects were contrary to competitive expectations as regards abundance and habitat breadth. These results are in line with the findings of the other removal experiments conducted so far on spiders, that uncovered small intra- and interspecific competitive effects fbr some variables but not for others. So Ear, there is no evidence that interspecific competition may affect spider communities, although a low-level competition remains possible, but difficult to test statistically for its evolutionary consequence.","Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Fasola, M (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, Piazza Botta 9, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",fasola@ipv36.unipv.it,,"FASOLA, MAURO/0000-0002-7366-5893",,,,19,3,3,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1125-0003,1748-5851,,ITAL J ZOOL,Ital.

Studies on biotic resistance to plant invasions have typically focused on competition and occasionally on herbivory, while resource-oriented studies have focused on water or nutrient pulses. Through synthesizing these approaches, we identify conditions that create invasion opportunities. In a nested fully factorial experiment, we examined how chronic alterations in water availability and rodent density influenced the density of invasive species in both the Mojave Desert and the Great Basin Desert after fire. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and mediated effects controlling the density of invasives in both deserts. In the first 2 years after our controlled burn in the Great Basin, we observed that fire had a direct effect on increasing the invasive forb Halogeton glomeratus as well as a mediated effect through reducing rodent densities and herbivory. 4 years after the burn, the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum was suppressing Halogeton glomeratus in mammal exclusion plots. There was a clear transition from years where invasives were controlled by disturbance and trophic interactions to years were resource availability and competition controlled invasive density. Similarly, in the Mojave Desert we observed a strong early influence of trophic processes on invasives, with Schismus arabicus benefitted by rodents and Bromus rubens negatively influenced by rodents. In the Mojave Desert, post-fire conditions became less important in controlling the abundance of invasives over time, while Bromus rubens was consistently benefitted by increases in fall rainfall.","[Gill, Richard A.; O'Connor, Rory C.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Biol, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [O'Connor, Rory C.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Rhodes, Aaron; Bishop, Tara B.

Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant-and predator-mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem-feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore-plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti-herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.","[Ramirez, Ricardo A.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Eubanks, Micky D.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Ramirez, RA (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ricardo.ramirez@usu.edu,"Ramirez, Ricardo/AAE-8394-2021",,U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI-2008-02341],"We thank P.

Field studies of each species in relatively undisturbed habitats provided data including behavioral interactions between avian predators and squirrel monkeys and the latter's vigilance response, habitat use, group size, population density and within-group food competition. Three hypotheses were examined. The first two identified aspects of the habitat structure exploited by squirrel monkeys and their avian predators as key parameters. (1) The overall success of avian attacks is a function of the density of understory vegetation present to hinder these birds from closely approaching individual troop members. (2) The extent of continuous canopy forest cover within habitats underlies which of two vigilance strategies are exhibited. Preemptive vigilance occurs when monkeys allocate time to visual scrutiny in a manner consistent with the intent of obtaining advance warning on the approach of an avian predator. During reactive vigilance, in contrast, monkeys are not overtly vigilant against an aerial attack until an attack or other stimulus strongly indicative of immediate risk occurs. Preemptive vigilance occurs in open habitats with little canopy, while reactive vigilance predominates when birds can make effective ambush attacks from forest canopy cover. Both hypotheses were supported. Group sizes vary significantly across the three squirrel monkey species with S. boliviensis having the largest and S. sciureus the smallest mean group size. Our third hypothesis examined the premise that group size in social animals reflects a tradeoff between predation risk (whether based on long-term observations or extrapolated from habitat structure) and within-group food competition. The power of this tradeoff mechanism to explain group-size variation was contrasted with a simpler, one parameter model, within-group food competition under an ideal free distribution. The ideal free distribution approach was consistent with the observed ranking of group sizes, whereas the tradeoff model provided mixed results. In retrospect, the weakness of the tradeoff model is not surprising. Changes in the risk incurred by individual members of a squirrel monkey troop as a consequence of variation in group size are likely of much smaller magnitude than the risk exposure resulting from local habitat structure.","Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Florida, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Boinski, S (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",boinski@ufl.edu,,,,,,180,62,63,0,51,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,NOV-DEC,2003,140,,11-12,,,,1421,1467,,10.1163/156853903771980666,,,47,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,766EU,WOS:000188354400005,,,,,2021-09-27,

Here we report on a long-term study of the independent effects of, and the interactions among, two sources of temporal variation (seasonal and annual) and two sources of spatial variation for a rocky intertidal community in the northern Gulf of California. The sources of spatial variation were: (1) microspatial effects due to the foraging patterns of a common predatory snail (Acanthina angelica) and (2) macrospatial effects due to differences among sites. The results from semiannual samples of 100-cm2 quadrats showed highly significant temporal and spatial effects for all members of the sessile community (barnacles, mussels, algae) and for limpets over the 8-yr study period. There were also highly significant season x space interactions for all sessile members of the community, which probably resulted from seasonal settlement by the sessile members of the community, and aestivation by the predator. Finally, we observed highly significant year x space effects as well as year x season x space effects for most species. These latter interactions can be understood as an amplification of seasonal and spatial effects due to the largely unpredictable differences among years. An analysis of the variance components showed that most of the variation in percentage cover of barnacles and a brown encrusting alga was due to microspatial effects, while most of the variation in mussels, limpets, and a green alp was due to year and season effects. This combination of results suggests that competition and predation by Acanthina are relatively more important in controlling the distributions and local abundances of barnacles and encrusting algae, and that unpredictable differences among years in settlement are more important in controlling the local population densities of mussels and limpets. The importance of these differences are discussed in relation to interpretation of short-term experimental studies in population and community studies.","UNIV MELBOURNE, DEPT ZOOL, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA","LIVELY, CM (corresponding author), INDIANA UNIV, DEPT BIOL, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47405 USA.",,"Lively, Curtis M/A-8057-2011",,,,,66,42,43,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,162,173,,10.2307/1939511,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Enhanced biological diversity potentially offers agricultural producers a means of reducing the cost of their production. Conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes may be greatly enhanced by the adoption of certain crop management practices, such as reduced pesticide usage or measures to prevent soil erosion. Still, the vast monocultures comprising the crop area in many Canadian agricultural landscapes are often of limited conservation value, thus the inclusion of appropriate wildlife habitat in and around arable lands is a fundamental prerequisite for the integration of wild species within agricultural landscapes. This review of current literature considers the potential for non-crop areas within agricultural landscapes to be reservoirs of agronomically beneficial organisms including plants, invertebrates, and vertebrate species. Non-crop habitats adjacent to crop land have been identified as significant for the maintenance of plant species diversify, for the conservation of beneficial pollinating and predatory insects, and as essential habitat for birds. A key component for enhancement of biodiversity is the reintroduction of landscape heterogeneity by (1) protection and enhancement of key non-crop areas, (2) smaller fields and farms, and (3) a greater mixture of crops, through rotation, intercropping and regional diversification. The benefits of increased biodiversity within arable lands are reviewed for various species groups. In the Canadian. context, any serious attempt to derive significant agronomic benefit from increased biodiversity will require considerable changes in the agricultural programs and policies which shape mainstream industrialized agriculture. The problems of crop depredation by vertebrate species, weed and insect competition, which still represent significant impediments to the creation and proper management of wildlife habitat, are also discussed.",,"Mineau, P (corresponding author), CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV, NATL WILDLIFE RES CTR, 100 BLVD GAMELIN, HULL, PQ K1A 0H3, CANADA.",,,,,,,118,41,44,1,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1187-7863,1573-322X,,J AGR ENVIRON ETHIC,J.

Nevertheless, the oviposition preferences of blow flies may cause a bias of PMI estimations because of a delay or acceleration of egg laying. Chrysomya megacephala (F.) and C. rufifacies (Macquart) are two predominant necrophagous blow fly species in Taiwan. Their larvae undergo rather intense competition, and the latter one can prey on the former under natural conditions. To understand the oviposition preferences of these two species, a dual-choice device was used to test the choice of oviposition sites by females. Results showed when pork liver with and without larvae of C. rufifacies was provided, C. megacephala preferred to lay eggs on the liver without larvae. However, C. megacephala showed no preference when pork liver with and without conspecific larvae or larvae of Hemipyrellia ligurriens (Wiedemann) was provided. These results indicate that females of C. megacephala try to avoid laying eggs around larvae of facultatively predaceous species of C. rufifacies. However, C. rufifacies showed significant oviposition preference for pork liver with larvae of C. megacephala or conspecific ones when compared with pork liver with no larvae. These results probably imply that conspecific larvae or larvae of C. megacephala may potentially be alternative food resources for C. rufifacies, so that its females prefer to lay eggs in their presence. When considering the size of the oviposition media, pork livers of a relatively small size were obviously unfavorable to both species. This may be because females need to find sufficient resources to meet the food demands of their larvae. In another experiment, neither blow fly species showed an oviposition preference for pork livers of different stages of decay. In addition, the oviposition preferences of both species to those media with larvae were greatly disturbed in a dark environment. If we removed the larvae that had previously fed on the pork liver and let the females choose, no oviposition preference was observed; but both species still showed a preference for the larger media in the dark. This suggests that female blow flies can use visual cues to recognize larvae on the media and decide on their oviposition site. Our studies point out the effects of some biotic and abiotic factors which were previously overlooked, and remind us to reevaluate these effects on oviposition, especially when using insect developmental data to estimate PMIs.","[Yang, Shih-Tsai; Shiao, Shiuh-Feng] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 10764, Taiwan","Shiao, SF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",sfshiao@ntu.edu.tw,,"SHIAO, SHIUH-FENG/0000-0002-4213-0423","National Science Council, ROCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC99-2321-B-002-040, NSC100-2631-H-002-018]; Institute of Forensic Medicine, Ministry of Justice, ROC [IFM90-M04, IFM91-M02]","This work was supported by the National Science Council, ROC (NSC99-2321-B-002-040 and NSC100-2631-H-002-018) and the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Ministry of Justice, ROC (IFM90-M04 and IFM91-M02).",,36,18,19,1,60,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"10001 DEREKWOOD LANE, STE 100, LANHAM, MD 20706-4876 USA",0022-2585,,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Using an approach combining experimental perturbations and path analysis, I examined the mechanisms by which birds directly and indirectly affected other members of an intertidal community, evaluated alternative causal hypotheses, and predicted whether interactions among other unmanipulated species would be strong or weak. Comparing treatments with t tests indicated that excluding bird predators with cages caused increases in Pollicipes polymerus, and declines in Nucella spp., Mytilus californianus, and Semibalanus cariosus. However, these conclusions provided no insight into the underlying mechanisms causing the differences. Path analysis permitted insight into the causal mechanisms by making a variety of predictions about the strength of direct interactions: (a) Bird predation negatively affects Pollicipes, but not Nucella, Leptasterias, or Mytilus; (b) Pollicipes reduces Semibalanus and Mytilus abundance because of space competition; (c) Mytilus reduces Semibalanus cover through competition for space; and (d) as prey species, Semibalanus and Pollicipes enhance Nucella density, but Nucella predation does not have important effects on Semibalanus or Pollicipes. Based on the estimated strength of direct interactions, the importance of indirect effects among species could also be predicted. In experiments manipulating Nucella, Pollicipes, Semibalanus, and birds independently of one another, I tested 11 of the interactions predicted by the path analysis; all were supported. Path analysis in conjunction with limited experiments may provide an efficient means to predict important direct and indirect interactions among unmanipulated species within ecological communities.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL NJ15,SEATTLE,WA 98195; UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720",,,"Langerhans, R.

This parasitoid attacks larvae of Diptera inhabiting ephemeral microhabitats such as decaying plant and animal material. Females oviposit in young larval stages, but the eventual size of the host pupa determines host food availability for competing offspring. The size of the pupa can differ greatly between host species. We questioned how A. minuta females deal with this delay between the moment of oviposition and eventual host food availability, and whether they make clutch size decisions that benefit their fitness. It was shown that females indeed vary their clutch size considerably and in an adaptive way: (1) females lay larger clutches in larvae of host species that produce larger pupae, even when the larvae are the same size at the moment of oviposition, and (2) females lay larger clutches in larger larvae than in smaller larvae of the same host species. The latter seems functional as larvae parasitized at an older stage indeed developed into larger pupae compared to larvae parasitized at a younger stage. Furthermore, mortality of parasitized young host larvae was greater than that of both unparasitized larvae and parasitized older larvae. Under field conditions the risk of mortality of young host larvae is expected to be even higher due to the limited period of microhabitat (host food) availability, strong scramble type competition between the host larvae, and the longer period of being exposed to predation.",,"VET, LEM (corresponding author), WAGENINGEN UNIV AGR,DEPT ENTOMOL,POB 8031,6700 EH WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,"Vet, Louise E.M./B-1342-2009","Vet, Louise E.M./0000-0002-2287-1128",,,,25,19,22,0,4,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,1993,95,3,,,,,410,415,,10.1007/BF00320996,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LY334,WOS:A1993LY33400016,28314018,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

In rocky intertidal habitats along southern New England, the recently introduced Asian Shore Crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, has been implicated in the displacement of the more established invasive European Green Crab, Carcinus maenas. We coupled faunal sampling with two field experiments to examine whether H. sanguineus is also displacing C. maenas in the Gulf of Maine. First, we investigated natural recruitment of the two species across an elevation gradient, using cage exclusion units to manipulate predator access. Excluding H. sanguineus adults significantly increased the density of C. maenas recruits, but not conspecific recruit density. Next, to simulate the transition that occurred from pre-invasion to the establishment of H. sanguineus, we conducted a predator inclusion experiment manipulating the density of adult H. sanguineus to examine the effects on C. maenas and conspecific recruit densities. In contrast to the previous experiment, we found that the density of H. sanguineus included in cages negatively affected conspecific recruit density but had no effect on C. maenas recruit density. We hypothesize that juxtaposing results from the two experiments may be a consequence of the considerably greater abundance of C. maenas recruits relative to H. sanguineus recruits during the first experiment.

Octopuses are notorious predators of decapod crustaceans, and their use of crevice shelters suggests that they may also compete for shelter with their lobster prey. Lobsters use mainly chemical cues to detect and avoid octopus, so we hypothesized that the negative association between these species may be as much the consequence of avoidance of a superior competitor as it is of direct predation. Surveys of lobsters and octopuses occupying artificial shelters at 19 hard-bottom sites confirmed that lobsters do not share dens with octopuses, and also show that lobster and octopus abundances are negatively correlated. Tethering experiments on a subset of those sites revealed that predation on lobster was indeed higher on sites with more octopuses. Results from mesocosm studies indicated that although juvenile lobsters do not attain a size refuge from octopus predation, the presence of alternative prey and lobster conspecifics reduces the risk of predation on lobster by octopus. Mesocosm experiments also showed that octopuses were the competitive dominants when shelter was limited. Thus, the negative association between lobster and octopus in the field appears to be driven by both predation and avoidance of octopus-rich sites by lobsters, rather than competition per se. However, crevice shelters suitable for juvenile lobster are limited in many hard-bottom areas in the Florida Keys, so areas where octopuses are abundant may further limit the local accessibility of shelters for juvenile spiny lobsters even if the direct effects of predation by octopus are minimal.","[Butler, Mark J., IV; Lear, Jennifer A.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","Butler, MJ (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",mbutler@odu.edu,,,NOAA Coastal Ocean ProgramNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA160P2561]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE9730195],"We thank D.

Perhaps the most obvious way this occurs is when predators reduce competitor densities. However, consumption could also generate phenotypic selection on prey that determines the strength of competition, thus coupling consumptive and trait-based effects of predators. In a mesocosm experiment simulating fish predation on damselflies, we found that selection against high damselfly activity rates - a phenotype mediating predation and competition - weakened the strength of density dependence in damselfly growth rates. A field experiment corroborated this finding and showed that increasing damselfly densities in lakes with high fish densities had limited effects on damselfly growth rates but generated a precipitous growth rate decline where fish densities were lower - a pattern expected because of spatial variation in selection imposed by predation. These results suggest that accounting for both consumption and selection is necessary to determine how predators regulate prey competitive interactions.","[Siepielski, Adam M.; Hasik, Adam Z.; Ping, Taylor; Serrano, Mabel; Strayhorn, Koby; Tye, Simon P.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Siepielski, AM (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",amsiepie@uark.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021","Hasik, Adam/0000-0002-4069-7186",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1748945],"Comments from Sean Giery, Mark McPeek, Denon Start, and three anonymous reviewers on earlier versions of this ms greatly sharpened our thinking and presentation of this work.

Although the role of natural enemies has been well-studied in tropical systems, relatively few studies have experimentally manipulated insect abundance in temperate forests and tracked impacts over multiple years. We conducted a three-year experiment (2012-2014) deterring insect herbivores from seedlings in new treefall gaps in deciduous hardwood forests in Maryland. During this study, we tracked recruitment of all tree seedlings, as well as survivorship and growth of 889 individual seedlings from five tree species: Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, Fraxinus spp., Liriodendron tulipifera, and Liquidambar styraciflua. Insect herbivores had little effect on recruitment of any tree species, although there was a weak indication that recruitment of A. rubrum was higher in the presence of herbivores. Insect herbivores reduced survivorship of L. tulipifera, but had no significant effects on A. rubrum, Fraxinus spp., F. grandifolia, or L. styraciflua. Additionally, insects reduced growth rates of early pioneer species A. rubrum, L. tulipifera, and L. styraciflua, but had little effect on more shade-tolerant species F. grandifolia and Fraxinus spp. Overall, by negatively impacting growth and survivorship of early pioneer species, forest insects may play an important but relatively cryptic role in forest gap dynamics, with potentially interesting impacts on the overall maintenance of diversity.","[Lemoine, Nathan P.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Burkepile, Deron E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Biol Evol & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Parker, John D.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD USA","Lemoine, NP (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",lemoine.nathan@gmail.com,,"Burkepile, Deron/0000-0002-0427-0484",FIU FRSP; Dissertation Evidence Acquisition Grant (FIU); Dissertation Year Fellowship (FIU); USDA NIFA-AFRI Postdoctoral Fellowship [2016-67012-25169],"This work was funded by a FIU FRSP grant to DEB and a Presidential Fellowship (FIU), Dissertation Evidence Acquisition Grant (FIU), a Dissertation Year Fellowship (FIU), and a USDA NIFA-AFRI Postdoctoral Fellowship (2016-67012-25169) to NPL.

We examined intraguild predation (IGP) between larvae of these two exotic species and larvae of the two most abundant native coccinellids in eastern Washington State, C. transversoguttata and Hippodamia convergens. In pairings between the two native species in laboratory microcosms containing pea (Pisum sativum) plants, neither native had a clear advantage over the other in IGP. When the natives were paired with either Harmonia axyridis or C. septempunctata, the natives were more frequently the victims than perpetrators of IGP. In contrast, in pairings between the exotic species, neither had an IGP advantage, although overall rates of IGP between these two species were very high. Adding alternative prey (aphids) to microcosms did not alter the frequency and patterns of relative IGP among the coccinellid species. In observations of encounters between larvae, the introduced H. axyridis frequently survived multiple encounters with the native C. transversoguttata, whereas the native rarely survived a single encounter with H. axyridis. Our results suggest that larvae of the native species face increased IGP following invasion by C. septempunctata and H. axyridis, which may be contributing to the speed with which these exotic ladybird beetles displace the natives following invasion.","Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Soil & Entomol Sci, Div Entomol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Snyder, WE (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, 166 FSHN Bldg, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",wesnyder@wsu.edu,,"Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102; Eigenbrode, Sanford/0000-0003-0054-8511",,,,40,121,132,0,68,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2004,140,4,,,,,559,565,,10.1007/s00442-004-1612-5,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,845TF,WOS:000223266500003,15179586,,,,2021-09-27,

These types of interaction are particularly exemplified in freshwater pond communities, where substantial size variation exists both within and among species of top consumers. We investigated whether density dependence can modify the outcome of size-structured interactions between larval stages of two pond-breeding salamanders, Ambystoma annulatum and Ambystoma opacum. Size structure exists in populations of these species due to variation in the timing of breeding, which we hypothesised would amplify predation rates and competitive asymmetries from the early-arriving species (A. annulatum) on the later-arriving species (A. opacum). We manipulated the relative densities of both A. annulatum and A. opacum in outdoor mesocosms. We maintained the experiment through metamorphosis, and analysed size at metamorphosis, larval period length and survival of each species. Ambystoma annulatum imparted a strong density-dependent effect on A. opacum through a combination of predation and competition. Survival of A. opacum was negatively related to the density of A. annulatum. For the A. opacum that survived, body size was reduced and larval period lengthened at higher A. annulatum densities, indicative of interspecific competition that was partly explained by resource pre-emption. In contrast, A. annulatum was only affected by intraspecific density-dependent competition. Our results suggest that density-dependent effects reinforce asymmetric interactions among larval salamanders. However, the intensity of the asymmetric interactions is mediated by the arrival time and size of conspecifics. Specifically, earlier-arriving species can negatively affect the later-arriving species via size-mediated predation and competition. The interactive effects of density dependence and arrival time of community members are probably a common mechanism generating size variability in ecological communities. Yet, most studies only evaluate one mechanism or the other. By interweaving these two processes, our work displays the importance of understanding context-dependence in species interactions.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Burkhart, Jacob J.; Davenport, Jon M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Biol, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Biol, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",thander@siue.edu,,,,,,54,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

However, this spillover might also occur in the opposite direction, affecting the diversity of semi-natural grasslands. This opposite spillover has got little attention in scientific literature even though generalist species penetrating into the grasslands can affect local biotic interactions, community composition and the conservation value of grassland habitats. In this study, we examined spillover effects from two different adjacent habitat types on carabid beetle assemblages in 20 semi-natural calcareous grasslands. The grasslands were either adjacent to a cereal crop field or to a coniferous forest. We found distinct differences in carabid beetle assemblages in calcareous grasslands depending on adjacent habitat type. Species richness and activity density were higher, but the evenness was lower in calcareous grasslands adjacent to crop fields compared with calcareous grasslands adjacent to coniferous forests. Further, we found a strong spillover of carabid beetles from adjacent crop fields after crop harvest, which may result in transiently increased predation pressure and resource competition in calcareous grasslands. Our results highlight that species composition, diversity and presumably ecosystem functions within semi-natural habitats are affected by the type and management of surrounding habitats. This needs to be considered by nature conservation measures, which aim to protect the unique insect communities of semi-natural European grasslands.","[Schneider, Gudrun; Krauss, Jochen; Boetzl, Fabian A.; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Bioctr, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Fritze, Michael-Andreas] Callistus Gemeinschaft Zool & Okol Untersuchungen, Dahlienstr 15, D-95488 Eckersdorf, Germany","Krauss, J (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Bioctr, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",gudrun.schneider@uni-wuerzburg.de; j.krauss@uni-wuerzburg.de; fabian.boetzl@freenet.de; fritze@callistus.de; ingolf.steffan@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Boetzl, Fabian A./J-2541-2019; Krauss, Jochen/C-6216-2014","Boetzl, Fabian A./0000-0001-5121-3370; Krauss, Jochen/0000-0003-2304-9117","FP 7 EU-project SCALES (Securing the Conservation of biodiversity across Administrative Levels and spatial, temporal and Ecological Scales) [226852]","We thank Harmen P.

In field experiments, I varied densities of one or both isopod species in enclosures in which food and virus presence were also manipulated. I estimated the effects of intra- and interspecific competition, additional food, and virus infection on both the survival of P. scaber and the prevalence of the virus. In uninfected populations, intraspecific and interspecific competition negatively affected isopod survival, although food resources had no effect. In infected treatments, interspecific competition produced higher levels of virus prevalence than did intraspecific competition. Virus infection and reduced food interacted to produce higher overall mortality in interspecific competition treatments than in intraspecific competition treatments. The lack of significant effect of food on competition suggests that interference interactions rather than resource competition predominated. This mechanism is supported by a laboratory study in which total food availability was controlled. These results indicate that competition and parasitism interacted to produce the observed mortality patterns, and that ignoring mortality due to the virus would produce apparent interspecific competition. The data suggest that the impact of P. laevis on P. scaber involves both direct and indirect effects.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720",,,,,,,,49,76,78,0,57,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1992,73,2,,,,,507,514,,10.2307/1940756,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HK464,WOS:A1992HK46400010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Much is unknown about the community-level implications of such complex interactions. Here, we study how they affect community dynamics differently from diffuse interactions (competing equally with all heterospecifics). We derive results for a model that applies to many forms of density dependence and also examine specific cases using a site-occupancy model of forest dynamics. The results indicate that nondiffuse competition produces three effects that will not occur under diffuse competition: first, the central niche effect-if a species has high niche overlap with several competitors, then its average fitness is reduced; second, the common competitor effect-if a species has high niche overlap with more common species, then its average fitness is reduced (these two effects are usually equalizing, because more favorable niches are likely to contain more species and more abundant species); and, finally, the community redistribution effect-when a species falls to low density, the relative abundance of its competitors will change, altering its ability to recover. The community redistribution effect usually undermines coexistence, because the community will usually become dominated by an invader's closest competitors. This study provides both instructions for measuring these effects in the field and a framework for analyzing how phylogenetic signal, trait-based niche axes, and other forms of nondiffuse competition affect coexistence.","[Stump, Simon Maccracken] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Stump, SM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",stumpsim@msu.edu,,,,,,61,13,13,2,37,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Amphibians often use ephemeral ponds and have been shown to experience priority effects from interspecific competition. Pesticide exposure can impact amphibian species interactions like competition, and has been linked to declines. We investigated whether insecticide exposure interacted with colonization history to impact priority effects in Bufo americanus and Rana pipiens. We predicted that exposure to the insecticide carbaryl and colonization history would affect tadpole metamorphosis independently and interactively. Our results indicated that Bufo time to metamorphosis experienced priority effects: Bufo introduced early reached metamorphosis sooner when Rana were absent, but Bufo introduced late reached metamorphosis sooner when Rana were also late. Insecticide exposure eliminated differences in Bufo time to metamorphosis due to Rana colonization history. Rana survival and mass at metamorphosis were affected by intraspecific colonization history. Bufo had significantly fewer survivors and Rana had more survivors in insecticide-exposed treatments. Bufo did better when reared without Rana, but Rana was unaffected by Bufo presence. The effects on anuran metamorphosis occurred without any effects on periphyton abundance. We suggest that the effects of insecticide exposure on amphibian metamorphosis are not related to colonization history, although each factor alone can have substantial impacts. These results preliminarily suggest that managing pesticide applications with sensitivity to amphibians may be less complex than implied by traditional food web theory, although more research is needed.","[Distel, Christopher A.] Schreiner Univ, Dept Biol, Kerrville, TX 78028 USA; [Distel, Christopher A.; Boone, Michelle D.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Distel, CA (corresponding author), Schreiner Univ, Dept Biol, 2100 Mem Blvd, Kerrville, TX 78028 USA.",cadistel@schreiner.edu,,,U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0717088]; Miami University,"We wish to thank Nick Webber, Sarah Distel, Jennifer Purrenhage, Holly Puglis, Tamara McPeek, Mark Mackey, and Rodney Kolb for their valuable help on the execution of this project.

Conversely, no studies were designed to investigate the role of competition for resources and predation in shaping crab distribution in mangroves, despite these biotic factors are recognised as key determinants for spatial patterns observed in the communities colonising rocky and sandy intertidal habitats. We studied floral and faunal assemblages in two zones of a Sri Lankan mangrove, a man-made upper intertidal level and a natural eulittoral, mid-shore one. Leaf choice experiments were designed to study both feeding rate and intra and inter-specific interactions for food of sesarmid crabs in the two habitats in order to better understand crab spatial distribution. Results: The two intertidal belts differed in terms of floral composition and crab species abundance. The eulittoral zone was strongly dominated by Neosarmatium smithi, while within the elevated littoral fringe four sesarmids (N. smithi, N. asiaticum, N. malabaricum and Muradium tetragonum) were more evenly distributed. At both levels, all sesarmids showed to collect significantly more Bruguiera spp. and Rhizophora apiculata leaves than Excoecaria agallocha ones. There was no temporal segregation in feeding activity among the four species, resulting in a high interference competition for leaves. Regardless of the habitat, N. smithi was always successful in winning inter-specific fights. Conclusions: Our results showed that the elevated littoral fringe was more crowded with crabs, but was less favourable in terms of food availability and environmental conditions. The dominance of N. smithi in gathering mangrove leaves suggests that this species may segregate the other sesarmids into less favourable habitats. The present data strongly suggest for the first time that interference competition for food can contribute to shape mangrove crab spatial distribution.","[Cannicci, Stefano] Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cannicci, Stefano] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cannicci, Stefano; Cimo, Filippo; Fratini, Sara] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Via Madonna del Piano 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Fusi, Marco] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div BESE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Syst Ecol & Resource Management, Av FD Roosevelt 50,CPi 264-1, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid] Vrije Univ Brussel, Mangrove Management Grp, Lab Plant Biol & Nat Management, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid; Fratini, Sara] IUCN Species Survival Commiss, Mangrove Specialist Grp, 28 Rue Mauverney, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland","Fratini, S (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Via Madonna del Piano 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.; Fratini, S (corresponding author), IUCN Species Survival Commiss, Mangrove Specialist Grp, 28 Rue Mauverney, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland.",sarafratini@unifi.it,"Cannicci, Stefano/N-8512-2019","Cannicci, Stefano/0000-0002-6544-0213; Fratini, Sara/0000-0002-5754-8830; DAHDOUH-GUEBAS, Farid/0000-0002-5906-8996",FIRB project (Italian MIUR) Mangrove fauna and flora: pattern of reproductive biology and dispersal mechanisms; Belgian National Science Foundation; Flemish Interuniversity Council (VLIR),"Funds are from a FIRB project (Italian MIUR) Mangrove fauna and flora: pattern of reproductive biology and dispersal mechanisms to Stefano Cannicci and from the Belgian National Science Foundation and from the Flemish Interuniversity Council (VLIR) to Farid Dahdouh Guebas.

Alternative food sources are particularly abundant in flower strips and other agri-environment schemes to promote biodiversity and may thus also benefit the invasive species. We investigated the effects of alternative food sources on the development and reproduction of H. axyridis. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that larvae of H. axyridis developed into adults and produced offspring when reared solely on aphids, lepidopteran eggs or maize pollen but not when they were fed only lepidopteran caterpillars or buckwheat flowers. When fed a combination of the latter two suboptimal food sources, however, some H. axyridis larvae developed into fertile adults. Flowering plant species differed in their food quality to sustain ladybird survival and development when fed alone or in combination with suboptimal prey. Differences in food quality of flower species were confirmed in field-cage studies where newly emerged adults were exposed for six days to different plant species and their energetic compartments were analyzed subsequently. Overall Fagopyrum esculentum and Centaurea cyanus provided a higher food quality than Calendula arvensis in those experiments and mixing flower species did not provide an additional benefit. The results show that the harlequin ladybird can sustain itself not only on optimal prey, but also utilize alternative, animal- and plant-derived diets. This could provide H. axyridis a competitive advantage over those native ladybird species that depend on aphids for their reproduction.","[Wolf, Sarah; Romeis, Joerg; Collatz, Jana] Agroscope, Res Div Agroecol & Environm, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland","Collatz, J (corresponding author), Agroscope, Res Div Agroecol & Environm, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jana.collatz@agroscope.admin.ch,,,Swiss expert committee for biosafety (SECB),"Mario Waldburger supported laboratory rearing of ladybirds, Felix Wettstein and Martin Zuber helped with analysis of energetic compartments.

Curiously, little attention has been paid to the qualitative and quantitative variation of the seed-stored molecules and on their ecological significance. Here, we analysed the oil content and oil composition of ca. 200 weed seed species from agricultural fields in France based on single seed accessions, concentrating on interspecies differences and ignoring within-species variation. The relationships between seed weight, oil %, fatty acids (FAs) and the energetic value of the seed and its antioxidant properties were also investigated. The antioxidant activity could contribute to protect the oily seed reserves from alteration over time. Among the species analysed, we found a considerable quantitative (oil%) and qualitative variation of FAs stored in the seeds. Such variation was largely related to the plant family of the different species, but intrafamily variation was also found. Heavier seeds contained less oil on a per gram basis than lighter seeds, suggesting a trade-off between seed weight and oil ratio in the seed and that oil storage strategy depends on seed size. Moreover, oily seeds contained more polyunsaturated FAs. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we did not found a higher antioxidant capability in oily seed extracts than in non-oily seeds, nor to the quantitative or to the qualitative variation of FAs in the seeds. Considering the role of these important trait variations on weed ecological strategies, such as germination period, seed predation rate and competition-colonisation trade-off, could improve the sustainable management of weed communities.","[Bretagnolle, F.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Biogeosci UMR6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Bretagnolle, F.] CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Matejicek, A.; Reboud, X.; Gaba, S.] INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, F-21065 Dijon, France; [Gregoire, S.] INRA, Ctr Sci Gout & Alimentat, UMR1324, Dijon, France","Bretagnolle, F (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Biogeosci UMR6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France.; Bretagnolle, F (corresponding author), CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",francois.bretagnolle@u-bourgogne.fr,"Gaba, Sabrina/H-5240-2018","Gaba, Sabrina/0000-0002-7145-6713",ANR SysterraFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [STRA-08-02 Advherb],The authors would like to acknowledge Emilie Cadet for the access on seed collection and Youssef Mouacha for seed lipid extraction and Michel Prost from the SPIRAL Society.

The latter in turn may force individuals to relocate to new sites for foraging or breeding, both of which presumably entails fitness costs due the trade-offs of finding and exploring new habitats. Species showing a high level of spatial foraging specialisation or nest site fidelity are expected to be most vulnerable. In this study, we explored the consequences of nest site loss on the reproductive investment of lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus), a site faithful seabird species breeding in an urban environment. We monitored a population of 1.173 colour-ringed gulls across 13 years, that involved several episodes of spatially restricted loss of breeding habitat. We found that birds which lost their breeding territories reduced their investment into the eggs as reflected in a decrease of the clutch volume. They relocated over larger distances compared to birds that relocated voluntarily. Moreover, the likelihood of skipping the subsequent breeding season increased after a forced relocation. These negative effects of forced relocation likely contribute to the decline in the number of breeding pairs in our urban population as observed during the last ten years, and highlights the importance of maintaining a stable breeding environment in urban areas for the conservation of this and potentially other colonial breeding seabird species.","[Salas, Reyes; Mueller, Wendt] Univ Antwerp, Behav Ecol & Ecophysiol BECO, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Salas, Reyes] Flemish Inst Sea Res VLIZ, Wandelaarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [Vercruijsse, Harry; Stienen, Eric] Herman Teirlinckgebouw, Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Havenlaan 88,Bus 73, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Lens, Luc] Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit TEREC, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Salas, R (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Behav Ecol & Ecophysiol BECO, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",reyes.salasfernandez@uantwerpen.be,"Stienen, Eric/ABC-1652-2020","Stienen, Eric/0000-0002-4315-0936; Muller, Wendt/0000-0001-7273-4095",Research Foundation Flanders [FWO]FWO [G0E1614N],"The authors would like to thank Hans Matheve (UGent), Hilbran Verstraete, Nicolas Vanermen, Marc Van de Walle and Wouter Courtens (INBO) for their support in the field, and the Port Authority of Zeebrugge, in particular PSA and APM for their permission to access their sites.

However, whether such patterns actually occur in wild animals is poorly examined. The following expectation, the larger sex suffers higher mortality, was primarily tested here for apparently native sea-run masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) in three populations in Hokkaido, Japan. Field surveys on sex ratios, body sizes, and ages of smolts and returning adults revealed that two of the three populations exhibited an expected pattern, a female-biased marine mortality and SSD, but one population demonstrated an unexpected co-occurrence of male-biased marine mortality and female-biased SSD. These female-biased SSDs were attributed to faster marine growth of females because of no sex difference in smolt body size. It has been previously suggested that breeding selection favoring large size generally act more strongly in females than in males in Japanese anadromous masu, as there is a weak sexual selection on adult males but universally intensive natural selection on adult females. Thus, this hypothesis explains female-biased SSDs well in all study populations. Interpopulation variation in sex-biased mortality found here might result from differences in marine predation and/or fishing pressures, given that selection driving female-biased SSD makes females forage more aggressively than males during the marine phase. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that evolutionary forces have shaped adaptive sex-specific foraging strategies under relationships between growth and mortality, resulting in co-occurrence patterns of sex-biased mortality and SSD within animal species.","Fisheries Res Agcy, Tohoku Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Shiogama 9850001, Japan","Tamate, T (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Agcy, Tohoku Natl Fisheries Res Inst, 3-27-5 Shinhama Cho, Shiogama 9850001, Japan.",tamate@affrc.go.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [20770011, 24570036]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24570036] Funding Source: KAKEN","I am indebted to Chitose Yamazaki, Ayako Kuroda, Koh Hasegawa, and Mari Kuroki for their help with the field survey and to Kazumasa Ohkuma, Kentaro Morita and Nobuyuki Nakano for their assistance during this study.

Many of these interactions are direct (e.g. predatorprey interactions or interference competition), but invasive species also can affect native community members indirectly, by influencing the abundances of intermediary species in trophic webs. Observational studies suggest that invasive plant species affect herbivorous arthropod communities and that these effects may flow up trophic webs to influence the abundance of predators. However, few studies have experimentally manipulated the presence of invasive plants to quantify the effects of plant invasion on higher trophic levels. Here, I use comparisons across sites that have or have not been invaded by the invasive plant Medicago polymorpha, combined with experimental removals of Medicago and insect herbivores, to investigate how a plant invasion affects the abundance of predators. Both manipulative and observational experiments showed that Medicago increased the abundance of the exotic herbivore Hypera and predatory spiders, suggesting positive bottomup effects of plant invasions on higher trophic levels. Path analyses conducted on data from natural habitats revealed that Medicago primarily increased spider abundance through herbivore-mediated indirect pathways. Specifically, Medicago density was positively correlated with the abundance of the dominant herbivore Hypera, and increased Hypera densities were correlated with increased spider abundance. Smaller-scale experimental studies confirmed that Medicago may increase spider abundance through herbivore-mediated indirect pathways, but also showed that the effects of Medicago varied across sites, including having no effect or having direct effects on spider abundance. If effects of invasive species commonly flow through trophic webs, then invasive species have the potential to affect numerous species throughout the community, especially those species whose dynamics are tightly connected to highly-impacted community members through trophic linkages.","[Lau, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Lau, JA (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",jenlau@msu.edu,,"Lau, Jennifer/0000-0002-8344-5421",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN-0206601]; UC Davis Center for Population Biology; UC Davis Biological Invasions IGERT NSF-DGENational Science Foundation (NSF) [0114432],"I thank C.

Highly complex habitats, for example, may reduce predation and competition, allowing more individuals living together in a certain area. However, the strength and direction of such interactions can differ strongly and are context dependent. Furthermore, as habitat characteristics are rapidly changing due to anthropogenic impacts, it becomes increasingly important to understand such interactions. Here, we studied the interactive effects of predation and competition on common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) recruitment, growth and survival under different habitat characteristics in the Wadden Sea, one of the world's largest intertidal ecosystems. In a predator-exclosure experiment, we manipulated cockle densities (100 vs. 1000 individuals m(-2)) and shorebird predation at two sites differing in habitat characteristics, namely at the wake of a blue mussel bed (Mytilus edulis) and at an adjacent sandy site. We found that recruitment was higher in the mussel-modified habitat, most likely due to reduction of hydrodynamic stress. Although bird predation strongly reduced recruit density, the combined effects still yielded more recruitment at the vicinity of the mussel bed compared to the sandy area. Furthermore, we found that high cockle densities combined with high densities of other potential prey (i.e. mussels) at the mussel-modified site, mitigated predation effects for adult cockles. Apart from these positive effects on adults, mussel-modified habitat reduced cockle growth, most likely by reducing hydrodynamics in the wake of the mussel bed and by increasing inter-specific competition for food. Our study experimentally underpins the importance of habitat characteristics, competition and predation in interactively structuring intertidal communities.","[de Fouw, Jimmy] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van der Zee, Els M.] Altenburg & Wymenga Ecol Res, Suderwei 2, NL-9269 TZ Veenwouden, Netherlands; [van Gils, Jan A.; van der Veer, Henk W.; Piersma, Theunis; van der Heide, Tjisse] Univ Utrecht, NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Eriksson, Britas Klemens; Olff, Han; Piersma, Theunis; van der Heide, Tjisse] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Weerman, Ellen J.] Univ Appl Sci, HAS Den Bosch, Onderwijsblvd 221, NL-5223 DE sHertogenbosch, Netherlands; [Donadi, Serena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources SLU Aqua, Stangholmsvagen 2, SE-17893 Drottningholm, Sweden","de Fouw, J (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.",j.defouw@science.ru.nl,"van der Heide, Tjisse/M-3000-2013; Eriksson, Britas Klemens/D-8601-2015","Eriksson, Britas Klemens/0000-0003-4752-922X; Donadi, Serena/0000-0002-8920-9630; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",NWO grant of the 'Nationaal Programma Zee-en Kustonderzoek' [839.08.310],"thank T.

Two species, Tubastraea coccinea Lesson, 1829 and Tubastraea tagusensis Wells, 1982 have been identified as non-indigenous and invasive to the tropical rocky shores of southeast Brazil. The aim of the current study was to investigate predator-prey interactions between a guild of native potential generalist predators and the non-indigenous corals using total exclusion and partial cages versus controls on a tropical rocky shore in the southwest Atlantic. Despite generalist predators being present in natural densities on the experimental system and substantial settlement occurring during the 2 year study (average density of Tubastraea spp. was 11.29 ind. 240 cm(-2)) no significant differences were found in density or size of corals between treatments. Dominant groups in the accompanying biological community (ABC) were encrusting calcareous and turf algae, the sponge Iotrochota sp. and barnacles but ABC height and biomass and sediment mass did not differ between treatments. Due to transport and invasion of new communities these corals are thought to have escaped from predation despite a diverse suite of native potential generalist predators. Both corals have been shown to possess bioactive chemicals which predatory fish avoid and this would seem to be the mechanism of predator avoidance.

It remains unclear how abiotic conditions like temperature combine with biotic factors such as consumer density or food quality to affect resource availability or influence species interactions. Using the large grasshopper Melanoplus bivittatus (Say) and a common wolf spider [Rabidosa rabida (Walkenaer)], we conducted manipulative field experiments in tallgrass prairie to examine how spider-grasshopper interactions respond to manipulations of temperature, grasshopper density, and food quality. Grasshopper survival was density dependent, as were the effects of spider presence and food quality in context-dependent ways. In high grasshopper density treatments, predation resulted in increased grasshopper survival, likely as a result of reduced intraspecific competition in the presence of spiders. Spiders had no effect on grasshopper survival when grasshoppers were stocked at low densities. Effects of the experimental treatments were often interdependent so that effects were only observed when examined together with other treatments. The occurrence of trophic cascades was context dependent, where the effects of food quality and spider presence varied with temperature under high-density treatments. Temperature weakly affected the impact of spider presence on Melanoplus bivittatus survivorship when all treatments were considered simultaneously, but different context-dependent responses to spider presence and food quality were observed among the three temperature treatments under highdensity conditions. Our results indicate that context-dependent species interactions are common and highlight the importance of understanding how key biotic and abiotic factors combine to influence species interactions.","[Laws, Angela N.; Joern, Anthony] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Joern, A (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",ajoern@ksu.edu,,,NSF Kansas EPSCoR Ecological Forecasting Consortium; Kansas State University Institute of Grassland Studies; Konza Prairie NSF/LTER; Kansas State University Division of Biology,"We are grateful to E.

Each predator species has a unique preferred patch (shelter and reproduction site) and travel for chasing prey. Its individuals are split into resident from the preferred patch and travelers. Further there is at most one resident predator species per patch. Depending on the availability of local anthropized resources not related to local prey on the preferred patch, one distinguishes between well-fed and starving predators. We assume prey species do not disperse at the predator scale. In this study we are interested in the number of persistent stationary states for the resulting ordinary differential equations model system. There exists at most one persistent predator-prey stationary state when there is exactly one starving resident predators per patch provided all functional responses to predation are Lotka-Volterra like or when a single starving resident predators is available. Else multiple persistent predator-prey stationary state are likely to exist. A specific emphasis is put on toy-model systems with 2 or 3 patches. Slow-fast dynamical methodology is also used for locally asymptotically stable purposes. Numerical experiments suggest that several scalings may govern the dynamics at stabilization.

Disturbance, interspecific competition between seedlings and between seedlings and adults, and access for potential predators were manipulated in the field after a fire to identify mechanisms to explain between- and within-habitat species coexistence. When soil surfaces are disturbed or seeds are buried, dry-heath species can establish in the wet heath. Under natural conditions, however, wet heath is rarely disturbed by animal foragers and lack of safe sites may preclude establishment of dry-heath species. In contrast, dry heath is often disturbed by ground foragers such as bandicoots and safe sites are plentiful for establishment of all heath species. Nevertheless, while wet-heath species can establish in dry heath, their seedlings are apparently unable to survive there due to the drier conditions. No evidence for competition among species was detected in either type of habitat during the first 3 years of the experiment, even at elevated seedling densities. Lack of early competition and unsaturated seed-banks may promote coexistence of species. Seedling predation from vertebrates was low and did not appear to influence patterns of coexistence within or between habitats. In terms of community theory we suggest that several interacting mechanisms are responsible for community structure in heaths after a fire. Chance and microsite disturbance are important during dispersal, while resources are critical during establishment and early survival of seedling populations. In these heath systems where fires burn extensive areas, seed-banks may be more important in temporal storage of species than patch or spatial storage as a mechanism for maintaining coexistence and plant diversity.","UNIV SYDNEY,SCH BIOL SCI,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA; UNIV SYDNEY,INST WILDLIFE RES A12,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA",,,"Clarke, Peter/D-6403-2012",,,,,23,9,9,0,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

We used predator-prey theory to predict outcomes of ecosystem experiments aimed at mitigating apparent competition by reducing primary prey. Simulations predicted declines in secondary prey following reductions in primary prey because predators consumed more secondary prey until predator numbers responded to reduced prey densities. Losses were exacerbated by a higher carrying capacity of primary prey and a longer lag time of the predator's numerical response, but a gradual reduction in primary prey was less detrimental to the secondary prey. We compared predictions against two field experiments where endangered woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) were victims of apparent competition. First, when deer (Odocoileus sp.) declined suddenly following a severe winter, cougar (Puma concolor) declined with a 1-2-year lag, yet in the interim more caribou were killed by cougars, and caribou populations declined by 40%. Second, when moose (Alces alces) were gradually reduced using a management experiment, wolf (Canis lupus) populations declined but did not shift consumption to caribou, and the largest caribou subpopulation stabilized. The observed contrasting outcomes of sudden versus gradual declines in primary prey supported theoretical predictions. Combining theory with field studies clarified how to manage communities to mitigate endangerment caused by apparent competition that affects many taxa.","[Serrouya, Robert; Boutin, Stan] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Wittmann, Meike J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [McLellan, Bruce N.] British Columbia Minist Forests, Res Branch, Darcy, BC V0N 1L0, Canada; [Wittmer, Heiko U.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","Serrouya, R (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",serrouya@ualberta.ca,"Wittmer, Heiko U/D-4172-2015","Wittmer, Heiko U/0000-0002-8861-188X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Alberta Ingenuity; Research Branch of the British Columbia Ministry of Forests,"We thank the many field technicians and researchers who helped us to collect caribou, moose, wolf, deer, and cougar data over the last 20 years.

However, at least two factors complicate this simple way of characterizing agricultural communities. First, agro-ecosystems are composed of several interacting species forming complicated food webs. Second, the structure of agricultural communities may vary in time. Efficient pest management approaches need to integrate these two factors to generate better predictions for pest control. In this work, we identified the food web components of an avocado agro-ecosystem, and unravelled patterns of co-occurrence and interactions between these components through field and laboratory experiments. This allowed us to predict community changes that would improve the performance of the naturally occurring predators and to test these predictions in field population experiments. Field surveys revealed that the food-web structure and species composition of the avocado community changed in time. In spring, the community was characterized by a linear food chain of Euseius stipulatus, an omnivorous mite, feeding on pollen. In the summer, E. stipulatus and a predatory mite, Neoseiulus californicus, shared a herbivorous mite prey. Laboratory experiments confirmed these trophic interactions and revealed that N. californicus can feed inside the prey nests, whereas E. stipulatus cannot, which may further reduce competition among predators. Finally, we artificially increased the coexistence of the two communities via addition of the non-herbivore food source (pollen) for the omnivore. This led to an increase in predator numbers and reduced populations of the herbivore. Therefore, the presence of pollen is expected to improve pest control in this system.","[Gonzalez-Fernandez, J.

However, the relationship between engineer density and engineering impact remains poorly understood. We used experiments and a mathematical model to examine the role of engineer density in a rocky intertidal community in northern California. In this system, the whelk Nucella ostrina preys on barnacles (Balanus glandula and Chthamalus dalli), leaving empty barnacle tests as a resource (favorable microhabitat) for other species. Field experiments demonstrated that N. ostrina predation increased the availability of empty tests of both barnacle species, reduced the density of the competitively dominant B. glandula, and indirectly increased the density of the competitively inferior C. dalli. Empty barnacle tests altered microhabitat humidity, but not temperature, and presumably provided a refuge from wave action. The herbivorous snail Littorina plena was positively associated with empty test availability in both observational comparisons and experimental manipulations of empty test availability, and L. plena density was elevated in areas with foraging N. ostrina. To explore the effects of variation in N. ostrina predation, we constructed a demographic matrix model for barnacles in which we varied predation intensity. The model predicted that number of available empty tests increases with predation intensity to a point, but declines when predation pressure was strong enough to severely reduce adult barnacle densities. The modeled number of available empty tests therefore peaked at an intermediate level of N. ostrina predation. Non-linear relationships between engineer density and engineer impact may be a generally important attribute of systems in which engineers influence the population dynamics of the species that they manipulate.","[Harley, Christopher D.

Biomass, diet overlap, prey selectivity, predation impact and stable isotope composition (C, N) of both species were assessed from June to September 2010. High biomass of C. harengus was found in June and July (wet weight 3.0 +/- A 1.8 g m(-3)) followed by a steep decline from August to September (wet weight 0.01 +/- A 0.01 g m(-3)), coinciding with a dramatic increase in M. leidyi biomass (wet weight 18.3 +/- A 16.1 g m(-3) during August). These two species showed a high overlap in their respective diets (copepods, meroplankton) during the study period. Predation impact of C. harengus on calanoid copepods was highest in June and July where 84 and 41 % of the standing stock were eaten per day in June and July, respectively. Predation impact of M. leidyi on calanoid copepods was highest in September (16 %). Based on stable isotope analysis C. harengus and M. leidyi were assigned to a trophic level of 3.08 and 2.47, respectively. Furthermore, we assessed the potential of competition between M. leidyi and C. harengus in a mesocosm experiment. Results indicated that at present zooplankton densities intraspecific competition in C. harengus seemed to be greater than interspecies competition with M. leidyi. Due to the low predation impact of M. leidyi and the reduced temporal overlap, competition between M. leidyi and C. harengus during the study period was estimated as low. Nevertheless, considering the high dietary overlap and the inter-annual variation in biomass and occurrence of both species and their zooplankton prey, competition in the Wadden Sea area cannot be excluded.","[Kellnreitner, Florian; Pockberger, Moritz; Asmus, Ragnhild; Asmus, Harald] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany","Kellnreitner, F (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, Hafenstr 43, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany.",florian.kellnreitner@web.de,"Asmus, Harald/O-2417-2017; Asmus, Ragnhild/O-2397-2017","Asmus, Harald/0000-0002-7772-1303; Asmus, Ragnhild/0000-0003-3300-6065",,,,76,6,6,1,78,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

There is mixed evidence from a limited number of studies, however, regarding how predator presence influences settlement of coral-reef fishes and it is unknown how other potentially mediating factors, including predator origin (native vs. nonnative) or interactions among con-specific recruits, mediate the non-consumptive effects of predators on reef fish settlement. During a field experiment in the Caribbean, approximately 52% fewer mahogany snapper (Lutjanus mahogoni) recruited to reefs with a native predator (graysby grouper, Cephalopholis cruentata) than to predator-free control reefs and reefs with an invasive predator (red lionfish, Pterois volitans) regardless of predator diet. These results suggest that snapper recruits do not recognize nonnative lionfish as a threat. However, these effects depended on the density of conspecific recruits, with evidence that competition may limit the response of snapper to even native predators at the highest recruit densities. In contrast, there was no effect of predator presence or conspecific density on the recruitment of bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus). These context-dependent responses of coral- reef fishes to predators during settlement may influence individual survival and shape subsequent population and community dynamics.","[Benkwitt, Cassandra E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Benkwitt, CE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",benkwitc@science.oregonstate.edu,,"Benkwitt, Cassandra/0000-0001-6756-7958",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); American Fisheries Society Steven Berkeley Marine Conservation Fellowship; Oregon State University Research Grants; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-12-33027],"Funding was provided by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship, American Fisheries Society Steven Berkeley Marine Conservation Fellowship, Oregon State University Research Grants, and Sigma Xi Grant-in-Aid of Research awarded to the author, and NSF grant OCE-12-33027 awarded to M.A. Hixon.

To examine prey selection, predation by Macrolophus pygmaeus (Heteroptera: Miridae) was recorded by providing a diet of either one or two prey species of Myzus persicae (third-instar nymphs), Aphis gossypii (fourth-instar nymphs), Trialeurodes vaporariorum (third-instar nymphs) and Ephestia kuehniella (eggs). In the experiments, prey mobility, prey quality and prey biomass were considered. The biomass consumed by the predator was dependent on the combination of prey species and the quantity of biomass offered. In choice experiments with diets mixed of two prey species at equal densities, the predation to A. gossypii was significantly reduced in the presence of E. kuehniella but the rate of consumption of M. persicae, T. vaporariorum and E. kuehniella was not significantly affected by the coexistence of any other species in the mixed prey diet. When equal amounts of biomass from two prey species were provided in combination, the total consumed biomass was significantly reduced in the mixed prey diets composed of E. kuehniella eggs and aphid nymphs. Thus, under the mixed-prey situation, prey selection by predators may be affected by interactions among prey species differing in traits such as quality, mobility and size.","[Maselou, Dionyssia A.; Fantinou, Argyro A.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Ecol & Environm Sci, Iera Odos 75, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Perdikis, Dionyssios Ch.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Agr Zool & Entomol, Athens, Greece","Maselou, DA (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Lab Ecol & Environm Sci, Iera Odos 75, GR-11855 Athens, Greece.",d.maselou@aua.gr,,,,,,60,1,1,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1343-8786,1479-8298,,ENTOMOL SCI,Entomol.

For each of these combinations, food consumption by predators was calculated assuming functional responses of either type 1, 2 or 3. Two levels of competition intensity were studied: low and high intensity, with food consumption decreased by 1% or 50% as compared to a situation without competition. The reproduction of prey was either slow or rapid, potentially increasing the number of prey at the end of a simulation by either 2* or 100* initial abundances. Prey reproduction was either exponential, influenced by intraspecific interaction or by both intra- and interspecific interactions between prey. All together, separate analyses of intra- and interspecific competition between different numbers of predator species combined with different numbers of available prey species, competition intensities, functional responses and rates and regulation of prey reproduction, gave 288 different types of models. For each of these, 100 simulations were run, with prey capture rates determined randomly for each predator-prey combination. The output data analysed were frequencies of increases and decreases in food niche overlap in response to interspecific competition and expansion and contraction in food niche width in response to either intra- or interspecific competition. All changes in niche parameters resulted from pure exploitative competition, without behavioural changes, short-term selection or evolutionary processes. The results were complex, with both increases and decreases in niche width and niche overlap as results of intra- and interspecific competition. Frequencies of increases and decreases were influenced by complex interactions between number of species of predators and preys, functional response of predators and reproduction rate and density dependence in prey population growth. The effect of one species on the niche width of another, as well as on their mutual niche overlap, sometimes changed with the intensity of competition. These results are in strong contrast to the niche dynamics theory frequently used as basis for interpreting field data, according to which species are assumed to generalise in response to intraspecific competition (niche expansion), and segregate and specialise in response to interspecific competition (decreased overlap and niche contraction [resource partitioning]). These variable results were derived from models which are very simple compared to the complexity of Nature, a complexity which is reasonable to assume increases the possibility for the development of complex niche dynamics. In my opinion, niche dynamics in Nature are thus very likely to be complex and great care must be taken before concluding from field data on food niche dynamics whether or not coexisting species compete.","UNIV STOCKHOLM,CTR MARINE RES,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","HANSSON, S (corresponding author), UNIV STOCKHOLM,DEPT SYST ECOL,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,85,10,13,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

We examined the correlation between habitat patch size and species richness and abundance of mammals and reptiles in a biodiversity hotspot in California. Within nine forest fragments standardized for age, topography, climate, and vegetation cover, we tested the effects of patch size and isolation on biodiversity. To measure species richness and abundance, we used wildlife cameras for meso-and-large vertebrates, mark-and-recapture analyses for small mammals, mark-and-resight analysis for reptiles, and standard dragging techniques for tick collections because they are frequent ectoparasites on vertebrates in oak woodland habitats. Our results show that meso-and-large vertebrate richness and abundance increase with patch area as does tick density. Surprisingly, small mammal species richness and abundance peak in intermediate-sized fragments. Resource limitation and competition at the smallest habitats and predation at the largest patches may be responsible for this pattern. Further, there is a significant decrease in invasive species richness with habitat patch size. We found that habitat destruction and fragmentation are acting upon species and communities in context-dependent ways that is critical to conservation planning, land use design, and ecosystem function.","[Lawrence, Alexandra] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [O'Connor, Kerry; Haroutounian, Vahe; Swei, Andrea] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA","Swei, A (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",aswei@sfsu.edu,"Swei, Andrea/AAD-9649-2021",,CSUPERB; ORSP; Bay Area Lyme Disease Foundation; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1427772]; Sigma-Xi,"We are grateful to Jordan Salomon, Tiffany Hong, Amani Rodriguez, Jonathan Bertram, Liliana Cerna, Enxhi Tahiraj, and Jessica Kwan for their field and laboratory assistance.

Reducing predators in a food chain with three trophic levels should permit herbivores to increase, thus reducing primary producers. In a manipulative experiment involving a molluscivorous fish (pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus), freshwater snails, and periphytic algae, we tested this prediction. With 10 cages (3 x 3 x 2 m) in each of two lakes in northern Wisconsin, we generated three treatments: exclosures (fishless), enclosures (three pumpkinseed sunfish), and cageless controls, both in Mann Lake, which had high natural densities of pumpkinseed sunfish (HDP), and in Round Lake, which had low densities (LDP). During a 16-mo experiment, we quantified snail and periphyton biomass on plastic flagging within treatments during summer at 3- and 6-wk intervals in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Predation by pumpkinseed sunfish reduced snail biomass on flagging, permitting periphyton biomass to increase, as compared to exclosures. As expected, periphyton biomass in cageless controls in Mann Lake (HDP) mirrored periphyton biomass in enclosures, whereas cageless controls in Round Lake (LDP) differed from exclosures. The periphyton assemblage changed dramatically with increasing grazing pressure. In enclosures (low grazing), filamentous algae and large, stalked diatoms dominated the periphyton assemblage, whereas in exclosures (high grazing), assemblages were dominated by small, adnate diatoms and a colonial, filamentous bluegreen alga (Gloeotrichia). In laboratory trials, snails preferentially fed on periphyton from enclosures (where grazing pressure had been low). Predation reduced snail density, but indirectly increased periphyton biomass, dramatically modifying species composition of the assemblage. Thus, in mesotrophic Wisconsin lakes, top-down interactions regulate the benthic, freshwater food chain.","OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,COLUMBUS,OH 43210","BRONMARK, C (corresponding author), UNIV LUND,DEPT ECOL,ECOL BLDG,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN.",,"Langerhans, R.

However, long-term analyses of size-dependent interactions within simpler network modules, for instance, competitive guilds, are scant. Here, we model the assembly dynamics of the largest breeding seabird community in the Mediterranean basin during the last 30 years. This unique data set allowed us to test, through a natural experiment, whether body size drove the assembly and dynamics of an ecological guild growing from very low numbers after habitat protection. Although environmental stochasticity accounted for most of community variability, the population variance explained by interspecific interactions, albeit small, decreased sharply with increasing body size. Since we found a demographic gradient along a body size continuum, in which population density and stability increase with increasing body size, the numerical effects of interspecific interactions were proportionally higher on smaller species than on larger ones. Moreover, we found that the per capita interaction coefficients were larger the higher the size ratio among competing species, but only for the set of interactions in which the species exerting the effect was greater. This provides empirical evidence for long-term asymmetric interspecific competition, which ultimately prompted the local extinction of two small species during the study period. During the assembly process stochastic predation by generalist carnivores further triggered community reorganizations and global decays in population synchrony, which disrupted the pattern of interspecific interactions. These results suggest that the major patterns detected in complex food webs can hold as well for simpler sub-modules of these networks involving non-trophic interactions, and highlight the shifting ecological processes impacting on assembling vs. asymptotic communities.","[Almaraz, Pablo] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante 33012, Spain; [Almaraz, Pablo] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Stable Isotope Biogeochem Lab, E-18008 Granada, Spain; [Almaraz, Pablo] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Oro, Daniel] IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Populat Ecol Grp, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain","Almaraz, P (corresponding author), Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Carretera Beniel,Km 3-2, Alicante 33012, Spain.",palmaraz@gmail.com,"Almaraz, Pablo/A-3683-2014; Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012","Almaraz, Pablo/0000-0003-1416-2695; Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007",Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya; ICONA (Spanish Ministry of the Environment); Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2009-08298],"We are grateful to all the people participating in the seabird monitoring at the Ebro Delta over the years, particularly to Albert Martinez-Vilalta, Meritxell Genovart, Albert Bertolero, Julia Piccardo, Jose Manuel Igual, and Antoni Curco, who contributed to organizing and executing the censuses.

Niche separation by means of exploitation or interference competition was investigated in two taxa of crop-inhabiting spiders that overlap in microhabitat use and have similar web design. Competition for prey and web sites was tested in microcosm experiments with the most common species that build sheet-webs: Enoplognatha gemina (Theridiidae) and Alioranus pastoralis (Linyphiidae). A field survey over the crop season provided data on spatial and temporal dispersion of Enoplognatha spp. (Theridiidae) and linyphiid spiders (Linyphiidae) and on availability of prey over the season. In the microcosm experiments, both taxa took springtails as prey, but only Enoplognatha fed on aphids. Differences in diet, however, could not be attributed to either exploitative or interference competition. Spatial separation of websites was attained by vertical displacement of webs in the vegetation (Enoplognatha) and by avoidance of patches occupied by conspecific or heterospecific individuals (linyphiids). In the field, densities of linyphiids and Enoplognatha were correlated negatively and webs were over-dispersed relative to a random distribution. Both taxa colonized the field at the start of the season; linyphiids colonized as adults, quickly reproduced, and had a second adult peak; Enoplognatha matured in the middle of the season and their numbers remained fairly constant over the season. The combined experimental manipulations and field data suggest that niche separation occurs at different scales. The hypothesis of competition for websites was partially supported, while prey preference (or tolerance) and temporal differences in life history stages also may explain the negative correlations between densities of the two taxa.","[Opatovsky, Itai] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Opatovsky, Itai] Reg Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Southern Branch Besor, IL-85400 Besor, Israel; [Gavish-Regev, Efrat] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Natl Nat Hist Collect, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel; [Weintraub, Phyllis G.] Agr Res Org, Dept Entomol, IL-85280 Gilat Res Ctr, Israel; [Lubin, Yael] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Opatovsky, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.; Opatovsky, I (corresponding author), Reg Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Southern Branch Besor, IL-85400 Besor, Israel.",itaiopa6@gmail.com,"Lubin, Yael D/F-1382-2012","Lubin, Yael D/0000-0003-3876-1668; Weintraub, Phyllis/0000-0003-0661-9499",Ministry of AgricultureGida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi [857-0578-09]; JNF (Emilio Sacerdote fund) [02-4682]; Sigma Xi; Ben-Gurion University,"We thank Z.

For organisms with complex life cycles, such as mosquitoes, different pressures are expected to act on communities due to behavioral and ecological partitioning of life stages. Adult females select habitats for oviposition, and resulting offspring are confined to that habitat until reaching adult stages capable of flight; outside-container effects (OCE) (i.e., spatial factors) are thus expected to act more strongly on species distributions as a function of adult dispersal capability, which should be limited by geographic distances between sites. However, larval community dynamics within a habitat are influenced by inside-container effects (ICE), mainly interactions with conspecifics and heterospecifics (e.g., through effects of competition and predation). We used a field experiment in a mainland-island scenario to assess whether environmental, spatial, and temporal factors influence mosquito prey and predator distributions and abundances across spatial scales: within-site, between-site, and mainland-island. We also evaluated whether predator abundances inside containers play a stronger role in shaping mosquito prey community structure than do OCE (e.g., spatial and environmental factors). Temporal influence was more important for predators than for prey mosquito community structure, and the changes in prey mosquito species composition over time appear to be driven by changes in predator abundances. There was a negligible effect of spatial and environmental factors on mosquito community structure, and temporal effects on mosquito abundances and distributions appear to be driven by changes in abundance of the dominant predator, perhaps because ICE are stronger than OCE due to larval habitat restriction, or because adult dispersal is not limited at the chosen spatial scales.","[Albeny-Simoes, Daniel] Univ Comunitaria Regiao Chapeco, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Ambientais, Chapeco, SC, Brazil; [da Silva, Pedro Giovani; Medina Hernandez, Malva Isabel] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [da Silva, Pedro Giovani] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Programa Posgrad Ecol Conservacao & Manejo Vida S, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Breaux, Jennifer Ann] New Orleans Mosquito Termite & Rodent Control Boa, New Orleans, LA USA","Albeny-Simoes, D (corresponding author), Univ Comunitaria Regiao Chapeco, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Ambientais, Chapeco, SC, Brazil.",danielalbeny@unochapeco.edu.br,"Breaux, Jennifer/ABG-6997-2020; da Silva, Pedro Giovani/F-7605-2014; Hernandez, Malva I.

The seeds were stuck into plasticine in small tin trays and exposed to beetle predation on surface of the ground. In the laboratory the effect of carabid (species, satiation) and seed (species, size) on the intensity of seed predation was investigated. The consumption of the generally preferred Cirsium arvense seed by 23 species of common carabids increased with body size. Seed of Capsella bursa-pastoris was preferred by small carabids and their consumption rates were not related to their size. The average daily consumption of all the carabid species tested (0.33 mg seeds.mg body mass(-1).day(-1)) was essentially the same for both kinds of seed. Because of satiation the consumption of seed of C. arvense provided ad libitum to Pseudoophonus rufipes decreased over a period of 9 days to 1/3-1/4 of the initial consumption rate. Preferences of P. rufipes (body mass 29.6 mg) and Harpalus affinis (13.4 mg) for the seeds of 64 species of herbaceous plants were determined. The small H. affinis preferred smaller seed than the large P. rufipes. Predation of seed present on the ground in the field was studied in 1999-2000, at Praha-Ruzyne (50degrees06' N 14degrees16' E). Seeds were placed in stands of different crops as in the laboratory experiments and vertebrate predation was excluded by wire mesh cages. Pitfall traps placed near the cages revealed that carabids were the only seed predators active in the area. Rates of removal of seed of 6 weed species varied with crop, season, seed and site. Average rate of removal in June-August was 2.5 seeds.day(-1).tray(-1) and was smaller before and after this period. The rates of removal increased with increasing activity density of the carabids and paucity of seed from naturally occurring weeds, which may have satiated the carabids. In stands of winter wheat, millet and soybeans there were significant differences in the rates of removal of the seed of 43 herbaceous species. The field preferences were correlated with those established in the laboratory. Predation of seed on the ground in arable fields can be as high as 1000 seeds.m(-2).day(-1) and may selectively influence the quantity of seed of particular herb species that enters the soil seed bank.

Researchers have frequently examined the roles of competition and predation in terrestrial or semi-aquatic communities of salamanders, but have rarely examined the influence of these factors between these communities. We conducted mesocosm and laboratory behavioral experiments (1) to test hypotheses, derived from by a previous laboratory study, in a semi-natural setting and (2) to formulate new hypotheses regarding novel species-pair combinations. Our mesocosm experiments did not support a previous hypothesis of predation by Desmognathus fuscus (a semi-aquatic species) on Plethodon cinereus (a terrestrial species), but did support a prediction that P cinereus would avoid D. fuscus. We predicted that behavioral experiments between pairs of semi-aquatic species would demonstrate predatory behavior by D. fuscus toward E. cirrigera and aggressive behavior by D. ochrophaeus toward Eurycea cirrigera; we did not find strong evidence for either predation or aggression. This finding was surprising given the similar activity patterns and dietary habits of these species. Although we predicted that Desmognathus might influence local distributions of heterogeneric salamanders through interspecific aggression in a manner similar to that seen within this genera, we found that both D. fuscus and D. ochrophaeus displayed much less aggression than expected. However, D. juscus, in particular, appears to induce avoidance behavior in both P. cinereus and E. cirrigera without evidence of predation or excessive aggression, indicating that interference competition may be an important factor in structuring plethodontid communities.","Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA","Ransom, TS (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Gilmer Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",tsr6a@virginia.edu,,,,,,48,8,8,0,14,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,NOV,2006,143,,11,,,,1357,1382,,10.1163/156853906778987524,,,26,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,127BR,WOS:000243560800004,,,,,2021-09-27,

Tadpoles of these species are morphologically indistinguishable, but both can develop omnivore and carnivore morphotypes. We tested the influence of species and morphotype on body mass of premetamorphic Spec tadpoles and the influence of land use (cropland vs. native grassland) and desiccation stress (water depth and daily rate of water-depth loss) on body mass of S. bombifrons carnivores and omnivores and on body mass of S. multiplicata and S. bombifrons omnivores. Spec bombifrons carnivores were larger than omnivores only in relatively deep playas. A decrease in water depth resulted in less body mass for carnivores, but omnivore body mass did not change. Spec bombifrons omnivores had larger body mass than did S. multiplicata omnivores at low and average playa depth. Spec bombifrons omnivores did not alter body size, whereas S. multiplicata omnivores were smaller when depth decreased. Generally, in average and deep playas, tadpoles were larger in cropland than grassland playas, but in shallow waters, cropland and grassland tadpoles had similar, smaller body mass. Also, cropland tadpoles had reduced body size, whereas grassland tadpoles had similar body mass when depth decreased. Our study documents body size divergence within the same morph in the two sympatric Spea species and species divergence within the omnivore morph depending on desiccation stress. Future studies should investigate whether these species may be mediating competition through both morph development and body size.","[Ghioca-Robrecht, D.

As requested by scientists and managers, our study aims at understanding the population ecology of mink in order to respond to conservation concerns. We studied the abundance of mink in different semi-aquatic habitats using live trapping (n = 1,320 trap nights) and sign surveys (n = 68 sites). With generalized linear models we evaluated mink abundance in relation to small-scale habitat features including habitats engineered by invasive beavers (Castor canadensis). Mink have colonized the entire island and signs were found in 79% of the surveys in all types of semi-aquatic habitats. Yet, relative population abundance (0.75 mink/km of coastline) was still below densities measured in other invaded or native areas. The habitat model accuracies indicated that mink were generally less specific in habitat use, probably due to the missing limitations normally imposed by predators or competitors. The selected models predicted that mink prefer to use shrubland instead of open habitat, coastal areas with heterogeneous shores instead of flat beaches, and interestingly, that mink avoid habitats strongly modified by beavers. Our results indicate need for immediate mink control on Navarino Island. For this future management we suggest that rocky coastal shores should be considered as priority sites deserving special conservation efforts. Further research is needed with respect to the immigration of mink from adjacent islands and to examine facilitating or hampering relationships between the different invasive species present, especially if integrative management is sought.","[Schuettler, Elke; Jax, Kurt] Tech Univ Munchen Weihenstephan, Lehrstuhl Landschaftsokol, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Schuettler, Elke; Jax, Kurt] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Conservat Biol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Schuettler, Elke; Tomas Ibarra, Jose; Rozzi, Ricardo; Jax, Kurt] Univ Magallanes, IEB, Puerto Williams, Antarctic Prov, Chile; [Schuettler, Elke; Tomas Ibarra, Jose; Rozzi, Ricardo; Jax, Kurt] Omora Fdn, Puerto Williams, Antarctic Prov, Chile; [Tomas Ibarra, Jose] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fauna Australis Wildlife Lab, Nat Resources Program, Sch Agr & Forestry Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Gruber, Bernd] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Rozzi, Ricardo] Univ N Texas, Dept Philosophy, Denton, TX 76201 USA","Schuttler, E (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munchen Weihenstephan, Lehrstuhl Landschaftsokol, Hochanger 6, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",eschuttler@gmx.de,"Rozzi, Ricardo/G-1047-2012","Rozzi, Ricardo/0000-0001-5265-8726; Jax, Kurt/0000-0002-1052-0195; Ibarra, Jose Tomas/0000-0002-7705-3974; Schuttler, Elke/0000-0001-9143-6237; Gruber, Bernd/0000-0003-0078-8179",German Academic Exchange Service ( DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Chilean Millennium Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity [PO2-051-F]; Magallanes University; Omora Foundation; German Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [FKZ 01LM0208],"We thank all the field assistants and in particular Melisa Ganan, Jose Llaipen, Julia and German Gonzales, and Francesca Pischedda.

In the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), the largest river system of Australia, more than half the native species are listed as rare or endangered. Active management is required to counteract reduction in population sizes, prevent local extinctions and to maintain genetic diversity. We describe the first comprehensive set of DNA barcodes able to discriminate between all 58 native and introduced species of freshwater fish recorded in the MDB. These barcodes also distinguish populations from those in adjacent basins, with estimated separation times as short as 0.1 million years ago. We demonstrate the feasibility of using DNA fingerprinting of ribosomal RNA (12S and 18S rRNA) genes and mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR) sequences to identify species from eggs, larvae, tissues and predator gut contents as well as differentiate populations, morphologically cryptic species and hybrids. The DNA barcode resource will enhance capacity in many areas of fish conservation biology that can benefit from improved knowledge of genetic provenance.

In an effort to distinguish these two types of effects, during the summer of 1994 I compared abundances, patterns of microhabitat use, and diets of P. maniculatus on four areas of shrub-dominated prairie in north-central Colorado to these characteristics on four similar sites where O. leucogaster was removed. The abundance of P. maniculatus decreased during the study on both control and removal sites, but The decline was greater on controls, where numbers of O. leucogaster increased. Declines in the abundance of P. maniculatus on individual study plots were correlated with abundances and recolonization rates of O. leucogaster. Only 6% of P. maniculatus present on controls during pre-removal trapping were captured 7 wk later, compared to 32% of those initially present on removal sites. Furthermore, changes in the number of P. maniculatus were inversely related to the amount of shrub cover on sites, suggesting that shrubs may have provided refuge from O. leucogaster, which rarely uses these microhabitats. Analyses of microhabitat use support this assertion; individual P. maniculatus increased their use of shrubs on control sites when O. leucogaster was abundant, but there were no shifts in microhabitat use on removal sites. The proportions of arthropods in the diets of the two species were similar prior to Onychomys removals, and although P. maniculatus consumed fewer arthropods as the experiment progressed, diets did not differ between control and removal sites. In addition, Ord's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii) increased slightly in number following removals, and western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis) colonized two removal sites. These results suggest that predatory or aggressive interference by O. leucogaster, rather than exploitative competition, was responsible for the observed changes in abundance and microhabitat use. Risk of aggression or predatory interference therefore may influence the local abundance and distribution of P. maniculatus and other small rodents on areas of shortgrass prairie where habitat characteristics permit coexistence.",,"Stapp, P (corresponding author), COLORADO STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,FT COLLINS,CO 80523, USA.",,,,,,,60,19,22,0,24,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1997,78,5,,,,,1519,1530,,,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XK929,WOS:A1997XK92900022,,,,,2021-09-27,

Models, of sex-specific mate-searching behavior predict single-sex searching, but the factors that determine which sex searches are not understood. In this study, we examine the effects of density and predation risk on mate-searching behavior in the fiddler crab Uca beebei. U. beebei is one of the few fiddler-crab species in which both sexes search for mates. In a field experiment conducted in Panama, we manipulated crab density and perceived predation risk in replicate plots. Females searched more and males searched less at high densities. At high levels of-perceived predation risk, both sexes similarly reduced their search rates. Observations of plots that naturally varied in crab density show that females were more likely to search for mates in areas of higher density, where there were more males. Females may preferentially search for mates in high-density areas because the abundance of nearby burrows, into which they can run to escape predators, decreases their costs of searching and because the abundance of males and male burrows facilitates comparisons and thus may increase their benefits from searching. Males at high densities decrease their mate-searching rate perhaps in response to the increase in female searching and to the corresponding increase in the intensity of their competitors' mate-attraction signals.","Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Unit 0948, APO, AA 34002 USA; Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","DeRivera, CE (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",deriverac@si.edu,"Backwell, Patricia RY/C-8883-2009",,,,,54,55,57,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Recent laboratory studies have reached opposite conclusions regarding the dominance relationship between these species, even documenting a reversal of roles as predator and prey. Interestingly, these contradicting results involved crab populations from different regions in Atlantic Canada (St. George's Bay in the Northumberland Strait and Passamaquoddy Bay in the Bay of Fundy), which are genetically different and presumed to be the result of different invasion events. In this study we housed juvenile lobsters and adult green crabs together in 3-m diameter flow-through tanks, and monitored their mortality, growth and behaviour from September through December 2009. The experiment involved five treatments, three experimental treatments with 2.5 lobsters/m(2) housed with an equal density of green crabs from one of three regions (Passamaquoddy Bay, St. George's Bay or Chedabucto Bay on the Scotian Shelf) and two control treatments with lobsters alone stocked at either 2.5 or 5 individuals/m(2). Chedabucto Bay was chosen as a third region as crabs there are genetically similar to conspecifics in St. George's Bay, but experience environmental conditions more similar to Passamaquoddy Bay. Green crabs had a significant and negative impact on lobster survival during the experiment, and the magnitude of this impact varied in relation to the green crabs' geographic origin, as mortality was significantly higher for lobsters paired with St. George's Bay and Chedabucto Bay crabs than Passamaquoddy Bay crabs. These differences in lobster mortality patterns lead to two important conclusions. First, the greater predatory impact of green crabs from St. George's Bay relative to Passamaquoddy Bay is consistent with the contrasting results recently reported in the literature, suggesting that these are of biological significance and not simply the result of procedural differences between studies. Second, the fact that the predatory impact of Chedabucto Bay green crabs was similar to that of conspecifics from St. Georges Bay, but greater than those from Passamaquoddy Bay, suggests that these differences in interspecific dominance patterns are correlated with genetic differences between green crab populations related to their invasion history in Atlantic Canada. The mechanisms underlying the effect of crab geographic origin on its interaction with juvenile lobster remain elusive, however, as no differences in crab behaviour or morphology were found that correlated with the pattern of lobster mortality.

Factor analysis and multiple linear regressions showed that 21.9% and 29.9% of the variance in rotifer density was explained by physicochemical factors and crustaceans, respectively. Larger rotifer density was possible in shallower lakes with higher concentration of inorganic nitrogen and less herbivorous crustaceans such as Sinocalanus dorrii and Daphnia. Redundancy analysis showed that the variances of rotifer species distribution explained by crustaceans and physicochemical factors were 26.9% and 31.0%, respectively. Further analysis demonstrated that the variances explained by pure crustaceans and pure physicochemical factors were 12.5% and 16.6%, respectively. However, these two percentages were not statistically different. Rotifer species distribution was strongly associated with Chl a and Moina micrura. Their coexistence with Crustaceans seemed to be determined by their defense against potential predators and competitors. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

As crosses between two distinct genotypes, hybrids might express fitness characteristics similar to either parent species, or they might produce unique phenotypic attributes that make them more or less than either parent species. We identified a potential hybrid zone among soft corals in a backreef community on Guam, where the broadcast- spawning species Sinularia maxima and S. polydactyla co- occur. Morphological and chemical traits con. rmed the intermediate and unique status of the putative hybrid. Laboratory cross- fertilization experiments using S. maxima and S. polydactyla gametes demonstrated that barriers to hybridization are absent and that the laboratory- reared hybrids developed specific characteristics identified in adult hybrid field populations. Changes in the populations of each parent species and the hybrid were monitored over a decade. While populations of the parent species declined significantly, the hybrid population doubled in percent cover over this period. We assessed responses to abiotic ( sedimentation) and biotic ( competition and predation) factors to determine whether the two parent species or the hybrids exhibited greater. tness. While sedimentation alone could not explain the decline in field populations of the parent species, sediment effects exact a significant cost to these soft corals over narrow spatial scales. Competition between the parent and hybrid soft corals explains some of the changes in the distribution and abundance of these species through time. The extracts of S. polydactyla had no effect against congeners, whereas those of S. maxima and the hybrid caused significant tissue necrosis. Field predation was significantly lower on the hybrid than on either parent species. Laboratory feeding assays demonstrated that the extracts of the hybrid were signi. cantly more deterrent than either S. maxima or S. polydactyla. Comparisons of the bioactive metabolites from the parent species, a hybrid compound, and a semi- purified mixture indicated that the hybrid is more deterrent than either of the parent species. Our results indicate that the hybrid Sinularia maxima3polydactyla exhibits greater. tness than the parent species and suggests that hybrid vigor may have implications for coral reef resilience.","[Slattery, Marc; Kamel, Haidy N.; Ankisetty, Sridevi] Univ Mississippi, Dept Pharmacognosy, University, MS 38677 USA; [Slattery, Marc; Gochfeld, Deborah J.] Univ Mississippi, Natl Ctr Nat Prod Res, University, MS 38677 USA; [Hoover, Cindi A.] Univ Delaware, Coll Marine & Earth Sci, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Thacker, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Slattery, M (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Pharmacognosy, University, MS 38677 USA.",slattery@olemiss.edu,,,,,,152,19,20,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Because these resources are more stable and predictable than those in a natural environment, animals that subsist on them are able to increase in numbers and expand their range, much to the detriment of their competitors and species they prey upon. In the Mojave Desert, common ravens (Corvus corax) have benefited from human-provided resources to increase in population size precipitously in recent years. This trend has caused concern because ravens prey on juvenile desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii), a federally threatened species. In this paper, I discuss management strategies to reduce raven predation on desert tortoises. The recommendations fall into three categories: (1) managing raven populations by reducing access to anthropogenic resources; (2) removing offending ravens or other birds in specially targeted tortoise management zones; and (3) continuing research on raven ecology, raven behavior, and methods of reducing raven predation on tortoises. I also recommend approaching the problem within an adaptive management framework: management efforts should first be employed as scientific experiments-with replicates and controls-to yield an unbiased assessment of their effectiveness. Furthermore, these strategies should be implemented in concert with actions that reduce other causes of desert tortoise mortality to aid the long-term recovery of their populations. Overall, the approaches outlined in this paper are widely applicable to the management of subsidized predators, particularly where they present a threat to a declining species of prey.","USGS Western Ecol Res Ctr, San Diego, CA 92123 USA","Boarman, WI (corresponding author), USGS Western Ecol Res Ctr, 5745 Kearny Villa Rd,Suite M, San Diego, CA 92123 USA.",william_boarman@usgs.gov,,,,,,63,73,76,1,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0364-152X,,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

Interactions among predators can disrupt, facilitate, or augment biological pest control. We estimated the relative strengths of cannibalism and interspecific predation in a maize-aphid-coccinellid predator system. We know from previous work that Adalia bipunctata females tend to oviposit at the top of the plant near large aphid aggregations and that Coleomegilla maculata females tend to oviposit at the bottom of the plant far from large aphid aggregations. We used this information to design experiments to estimate the relative strength of cannibalism and interspecific predation. At high aphid densities, eggs at the top of the plant, near aphids, were preyed upon more than eggs at the bottom of the plant, far from aphids. This result implies that A. bipunctata suffers greater egg mortality than C. maculata. Tn part, this was due to the foraging pattern of A. bipunctata and also the large populations of aphidophagous predators that develop as a result of the large aggregations of aphids at the top of the maize plant. In predator-enclosure experiments, A. bipunctata searched primarily near large aggregations of aphids and therefore fed more on eggs at the top of plants near large aggregations of aphids. C. maculata searched throughout, yet tended to feed on more eggs at the bottom of the plant. This demonstrated that for both species the effect of cannibalism was equal to or stronger than that of interspecific predation. These findings suggest that species-specific oviposition behaviors largely determined the relative strength of cannibalism and interspecific predation. Cannibalism and interspecific predation can be analyzed as interference competition. Using competition theory, we were able to make predictions about coccinellid species' joint impact on aphids and species dominance.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Ctr Community Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Schellhorn, NA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Schellhorn, Nancy/B-6716-2009",,,,,50,83,85,0,34,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The use of artificial refuge to promote coexistence between an invasive species and a native species has not been widely studied but may serve as a viable management option. Range expansion of the invasive western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, across the Barrens Plateau of Tennessee has contributed to local extirpations of the native Barrens topminnow, Fundulus julisia, from parts of its historic range. Recent laboratory and field observations suggest that young topminnows may be vulnerable to injury from, or predation by, mosquitofish in the wild. In this study, an artificial refuge was tested in the laboratory and in situ to determine if it could increase survival, growth, or recruitment of juvenile topminnows exposed to mosquitofish. Adult topminnows and small mosquitofish caused negligible mortality to juvenile topminnows regardless of refuge presence in the laboratory trial. However, topminnow 20-day survival in the presence of large mosquitofish was 13% when refuge was present and 7% when refuge was absent. Juvenile topminnow growth did not differ among treatments indicating that the addition of refuge or the type of potential antagonist did not significantly affect topminnow growth. Field trial results showed no statistical differences in the number of juvenile topminnows captured at sites with refuges and those without, except during July sampling. In both trials, juvenile topminnows were observed to use the refuges, but no evidence exists that would indicate refuges are a feasible management tool for promoting the coexistence of topminnows with mosquitofish.

Asynarchus larvae predominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and relatively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander-induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator-predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density-mediated and not trait-mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Limnephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a tradeoff between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus. This and previous work implicate salamanders as keystone predators that exert a major influence on the composition of benthic and planktonic assemblages in subalpine wetlands.","Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA; Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Wissinger, SA (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",swissing@alleg.edu,,,,,,86,86,88,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1999,80,6,,,,,2102,2116,,,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,233CQ,WOS:000082408300024,,,,,2021-09-27,

We studied the distribution of 5 species (the greater white toothed shrew Crocidura leucodon; the lesser white toothed shrew Crocidura suaveolens; the pigmy shrew Sorex minutus; the Appennine shrew Sorex samniticus and the Etruscan shrew Suncus etruscus) in a fragmented landscape in central Italy. Shrews were trapped with pitfall traps made from plastic water bottles, the number of traps increased with patch size. A total of 170 individuals, of 5 species of shrews were captured. Shrews were widely distributed in Our study area, however patch occupancy was determined mainly by vegetation and geometrical characteristics of the patches. Our data Supports the hypotheses that patterns of habitat selection and the dynamics of seasonal abundance (habitat and temporal partitioning between similarly sized species) reduce competitive pressure, thus allowing coexistence of shrews in relatively species-rich assemblages, for such small amounts of habitat. The most important outcome of our results is the crucial role played by vegetation structure in determining distribution patterns. These results strongly suggest that measurements of the vegetation structure of habitat patches should always be included as explanatory variables when studying the distribution of shrews in fragmented landscapes.

Populations of many species are increasingly becoming fragmented due to human impacts and active management is required to prevent further extinctions. Islands provide an ideal location to protect species from many mainland threatening processes such as habitat loss and fragmentation, disease and competition/predation from introduced species. However their isolation and small population size renders them prone to loss of genetic diversity and to inbreeding. This study examined two endemic and one introduced population of tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) on three islands in the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, Western Australia: East Wallabi (EWI), West Wallabi (WWI) and North Islands (NI). Nine autosomal and four Y-linked microsatellite loci, and sequence data from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region were used to examine the impact of long-term isolation (EWI and WWI) and small founder size (NI) on genetic diversity and inbreeding. This study found all three populations had low genetic diversity, high levels of effective inbreeding and increased frequency of morphological abnormalities. Isolation has also led to significant inter-population genetic differentiation. These results highlight the importance of incorporating genetic management strategies when utilising islands as refuges for declining mainland populations.","[Miller, Emily J.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Miller, Emily J.; Herbert, Catherine A.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Eldridge, Mark D.

Field experiments and observations in the Bahamas demonstrated that such population regulation occurs in the coral-reef fish Gramma loreto. I performed manipulative field experiments that identified mortality as the primary source of demographic density dependence among local populations. The causative mechanism involved a response in the behavior of predators, which both aggregated and spent more time hunting where prey fish densities were high. Spatially density-dependent mortality (i.e., density dependence among populations) led to between-generation temporal density dependence (i.e., density dependence within populations over time) indicative of population regulation. Over three years-roughly two generations-local populations followed regular annual cycles of abundance that stemmed from seasonal patterns of recruitment. Despite considerable natural and experimentally induced variability in the recruitment of new individuals, adult density remained nearly constant.

Body size is a fundamental trait that impacts many aspects of species biology and ecology. It is, in turn, influenced by a suite of environmental factors, and often decreases with warming. Although environmental conditions can also impact body shape, which is another functional trait that influences locomotion, resource acquisition and potentially physiological processes, such responses are poorly understood and rarely quantified. 2. We experimentally tested the independent and combined effects of environmental temperature, resource level and interspecific competition on the body shape and size responses of two model protist species. We also tested the degree to which these individual--level phenotypic responses are associated with population densities and species coexistence. 3. Body shape was strongly influenced by resource competition, whereas body size changes were mainly driven by environmental temperature. In both species, lower resource levels resulted in body shape elongation, suggesting that relatively more elongate individuals with potentially higher swimming speed were advantaged in the resource scarce environment. However, competition had contrasting influence on the body shape of the two species. Competition decreased the population densities of Blepharisma japonicum, which exhibited relative body shape elongation, similar to the response at low resource levels. In contrast, competition increased the population densities of Paramecium aurelia, which exhibited reduced elongation similar to body shape response at high resource levels. Hence, body shape responses could be indicative of changes in resource availability, aiding our understanding of competitive hierarchies and species interactions. 4. Coexistence was observed in all treatment combinations, likely because body size of both species decreased similarly under warming, potentially maintaining constant per capita competitive intensity. These findings, along with recent research on phytoplankton, diverse pelagic invertebrates, and birds highlight the importance of body shape and morphology across different taxonomic groups. Hence, we call for body size and shape to be considered in concert when investigating ecological consequences of climate warming.","[Tan, Hanrong; Kratina, Pavel] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [Hirst, Andrew G.] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell, England; [Hirst, Andrew G.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Ctr Ocean Life, Lyngby, Denmark; [Atkinson, David] Univ Liverpool, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","Kratina, P (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England.",p.kratina@qmul.ac.uk,"; Atkinson, David/D-4664-2009","Tan, Hanrong/0000-0002-0365-1592; Hirst, Andrew/0000-0001-9132-1886; Atkinson, David/0000-0002-9956-2454",Principal's Postgraduate Research Studentship,Principal's Postgraduate Research Studentship,,62,0,0,11,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Thus, the initial response of an arthropod assemblage to increased predator densities was increased interactions among predators, which caused decline in predator population densities in a shorter time than competition for prey would require. Predator avoidance behavior must be considered together with intraguild predation and competition when interpreting the outcome of predator manipulations. Shortterm experiments may be more valuable than longer term studies in detecting this effect.","WASHINGTON & LEE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,LEXINGTON,VA 24450; UNIV DELAWARE,SCH LIFE & HLTH SCI,ECOL PROGRAM,NEWARK,DE 19716",,,,,,,,34,53,54,1,15,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1994,98,3-4,,,,,269,273,,10.1007/BF00324214,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE432,WOS:A1994PE43200005,28313902,,,,2021-09-27,

These antagonistic interactions have been scarcely studied in coccinellids. Through a laboratory study we assessed aphid consumption, weight gain and reproduction when the invasive Harmonia axyridis, the alien Hippodamia variegata and the native Eriopis chilensis were alone, in conspecific and heterospecific groups, at low and high aphid densities. Under intraspecific competition, coccinellids were more voracious than when they were alone, particularly H. axyridis and H. variegata at high aphid density; H. axyridis and H. variegata gained more weight than E. chilensis, and H. axyridis barely reproduced at low aphid densities, even when alone, while in the other two species reproduction was not affected by the presence of conspecifics. Under interspecific competition, weight gain and reproduction results suggest that H. axyridis was responsible for most aphid consumption; H. variegata gained less weight and barely reproduced in heterospecific groups, but its reproduction was not affected. Eriopis chilensis weight gain and reproduction was low but not affected by the presence of the other species. The lack of negative effects of intraspecific competition on H. axyridis and its better performance in heterospecific groups suggests that this species is the stronger competitor, negatively affecting H. variegata, but not E. chilensis. Thus, exploitative interspecific competition is an important mechanism explaining the dominance of H. axyridis and the decline of some species following its invasion. Therefore, this interaction deserves more attention than what has been paid up to now.","[Zaviezo, Tania] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Casilla 306-22, Santiago, Chile; [Soares, Antonio Onofre] Univ Azores, Dept Biol, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal; [Grez, Audrey A.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Casilla 2-15, Santiago, Chile","Grez, AA (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Casilla 2-15, Santiago, Chile.",agrez@uchile.cl,"Zaviezo, Tania/AAM-5707-2020; Zaviezo, Tania/F-3099-2014; Soares, Antonio Onofre/M-4207-2013","Zaviezo, Tania/0000-0002-4993-0386; Zaviezo, Tania/0000-0002-4993-0386; Soares, Antonio Onofre/0000-0001-7922-6296","FONDECYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140662, 1180533]","Special thanks to Elizabeth Gazzano for her invaluable help with field collections, insect colonies and assistance during the laboratory experiments.

In Moorea, French Polynesia, surveys were used to quantify habitat association for juvenile Thalassoma hardwicke and 7 sympatric labroid species. Having identified the 3 species most similar to focal T. hardwicke in habitat association, a field assay was used to determine if the presence of larger individuals of these species adversely affected the survival of focal individuals. Finally, a field experiment was used to test how competition with larger residents and structural refuge interact to influence survival of transplanted T. hardwicke. Surveys demonstrated that Gomphosus varius, Pseudocheilinus hexataenia, and T. quinquevittatum were most similar to T. hardwicke in habitat association. In the field assay, the presence of T. quinquevittatum had the greatest negative effect on survival of T. hardwicke. The field experiment revealed that competition with T. quinquevittatum and structural refuge both altered T. hardwicke survival, although their effects were not interactive. Survival of T. hardwicke was 2.3 times greater in treatments without T. quinquevittatum relative to those with T. quinquevittatum, and 2.8 times greater in treatments with structural refuge relative to those without structural refuge. The additive effect may have occurred via the establishment of social dominance hierarchies between transplanted T. hardwicke and resident T. quinquevittatum independently of structural refuge, suggesting that it is important to account for interactions occurring independently of resources when examining resource competition.","Victoria Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Sch Biol Sci, POB 6140, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",shane.geange@vuw.ac.nz,,"Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; VUW; Fulbright-Ministry of Research, Science and Technology","C.

Here, we investigated the prey size selection of two invasive crabs (Hemigrapsus sanguineus and Hemigrapsus takanoi) recently invading European coasts and compared them with native shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) which are known to feed on similar prey species. In laboratory experiments, we offered different size classes of native blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) to different size classes of the crab species in an effort to identify the respective prey size preferences and potential overlap in prey size range of native and invasive crabs. In all three species, the preferred prey size increased with crab size reflecting general predator-prey size relationships. Prey size preference did not differ among the crab species, i.e. crabs showed similar mussel size preference in relation to carapace width. Given that additional morphological measurements showed that both of the invasive crab species have much larger claws relative to their body size compared with the native species, this finding was surprising and may relate to differential claw morphologies or structural strength. These results suggest that the invasive crabs exert predation pressure on the same size classes of native mussels as the native crabs, with potential effects on mussel population dynamics due to the high densities of the invaders. In addition, the overlap in prey size range is likely to result in resource competition between invasive and native crabs.","[Bouwmeester, Mark M.; Waser, Andreas M.; van der Meer, Jaap; Thieltges, David W.] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, Den Burg, Netherlands; [Bouwmeester, Mark M.; Waser, Andreas M.; van der Meer, Jaap; Thieltges, David W.] Univ Utrecht, Den Burg, Netherlands","Thieltges, DW (corresponding author), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, Den Burg, Netherlands.; Thieltges, DW (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Den Burg, Netherlands.",David.Thieltges@nioz.nl,"Waser, Andreas/J-2082-2016; Thieltges, David/E-5719-2015","Waser, Andreas/0000-0002-9455-4447; Bouwmeester, Mark/0000-0002-2574-4837",,,,49,1,1,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

However, few attempts have been made to evaluate indicators of population trends (i.e. population indicator species). Eradication of introduced mammals from offshore islands is a commonly used management technique for conservation of native taxa in New Zealand. Pacific rats and rabbits were eradicated from Korapuki Island in 1986/1987 enabling population recovery of native species that had been suppressed by predation or competition. However, the degree to which species' responses were correlated has not been evaluated. We investigated correlations among lizard population trends on Korapuki Island as a test of the population indicator species concept. Our dataset consisted of captures of the five resident lizard species (three skinks, two geckos) from biannual pitfall trapping over a 10 year period (1986-1995) immediately following rodent eradication. We used a Bayesian modelling approach to examine correlations in population trends (based on mean annual counts) between species. Population trends were positively correlated for all species pairs (substantively for 90 % of pairs) and we detected no negative correlations. Systematic searches for single lizard species may indicate correlated recovery of lizard populations following rodent eradication and provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional 'whole community' monitoring. Our findings support evidence-based use of the population indicator species concept in cases where a shared ecological driver can be identified.","[Monks, Joanne M.] Dept Conservat, Sci & Capabil Grp, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Monks, Adrian] Landcare Res, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Towns, David R.] Dept Conservat, Sci & Capabil Grp, Auckland 1145, New Zealand","Monks, JM (corresponding author), Dept Conservat, Sci & Capabil Grp, Private Bag 4715, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",jmonks@doc.govt.nz,,"Monks, Jo/0000-0001-9391-380X; Monks, Adrian/0000-0002-4782-810X","New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) as part of Science Investigations [3940, 3236]","We wish to thank Colin O'Donnell and Doug Armstrong for providing thoughtful discussions of the ideas presented, Chris Green, Ian McFadden and many others for field assistance, and Richard Earl for GIS support.

We assessed the degree to which the performance of recently recruited branching corals was influenced by corallivory, competition, sedimentation, and the interactions between these factors. We also explored whether the species-specific influence of these biotic and abiotic constraints helps to explain recent shifts in the coral community in lagoons of Moorea, French Polynesia. Population surveys revealed evidence of a community shift away from a historically acroporid-dominated community to a pocilloporid- and poritid-dominated community, but also showed that the distribution and abundance of coral taxa varied predictably with location in the lagoon. At the microhabitat scale, branching corals grew mainly on dead or partially dead massive Porites (bommies), promontories with enhanced current velocities and reduced sedimentation. A demographic study revealed that growth and survival of juvenile Pocillopora verrucosa and Acropora retusa, the two most common branching species of each taxon, were affected by predation and competition with vermetid gastropods. By 24 months of age, 20-60% of juvenile corals suffered partial predation by corallivorous fishes, and injured corals experienced reduced growth and survival. A field experiment confirmed that partial predation by corallivorous fishes is an important, but habitat-modulated, constraint for branching corals. Competition with vermetid gastropods reduced growth of both branching species but unexpectedly also provided an associational defense against corallivory. Overall, the impact of abiotic constraints was habitat-specific and similar for Acropora and Pocillopora, but biotic interactions, especially corallivory, had a greater negative effect on Acropora than Pocillopora, which may explain the local shift in coral community composition.","[Lenihan, Hunter S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lenihan, Hunter S.; Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.; Brooks, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coastal Res Ctr, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Lenihan, HS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",lenihan@bren.ucsb.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE0417412, OCE1026851]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation","We thank J.

Unlike terrestrial and freshwater systems, the impacts of an invading species have never been quantified on multiple trophic levels for a marine food web. We measured the impact of the nonindigenous green crab, Carcinus maenas, on a coastal marine food web in central California and found that this predator exerted strong top-down control, significantly reducing the abundances of several of the 20 invertebrate species monitored over a 9-yr period. Densities of native clams, Nutricola tantilla and Nutricola confusa, and native shore crabs, Hemigrapsus oregonensis, showed 5-fold to 10-fold declines within 3 yr of the arrival of green crabs. Field and laboratory experiments indicated that green crab predation caused these declines. We also tested for indirect responses of invertebrates and vertebrates to green crab predation. There were significant increases in the abundances of two polychaete taxa, Lumbrineris sp. and Exogene sp., and tube-building tanaid crustaceans, Leptochelia dubia, most likely due to the removal of cooccurring green crab prey. However, we observed no changes in shorebird abundances (13 species) over a 9-yr period suggesting that green crabs have had no bottom-up effect on shorebirds, which subsist on benthic invertebrate prey. We predict that such bottom-up control will occur as the local effects and geographic range of green crabs increase. The 2-yr temporal scale of direct and indirect responses of the invertebrates in this low energy, soft-substrate system was also in agreement with the results of perturbation experiments by others on rocky shores, which showed that most direct and indirect responses also occur within a 2-yr time frame.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA","Grosholz, ED (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Ruiz, Gregory/0000-0003-2499-441X",,,,114,288,301,3,124,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2000,81,5,,,,,1206,1224,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1206:TIOANM]2.0.CO;2,,,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,309XQ,WOS:000086795100003,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

The soybean aphid Aphis glycines can build up to high densities in young soybean, causing farmers to apply insecticides early in the season. The seasonal phenology of A. glycines was studied at 15 sites on Sumatra. Aphis glycines densities peaked in the vegetative plant stage and declined rapidly afterwards or towards the flowering stage of soybean. A clear statistical dependency of coccinellid predator densities on aphid densities was found. 2. Age-specific survival and reproduction of A. glycines were determined in clip-cages on plants 3, 5 and 7 weeks of age. The growth rate was highest on 3-week-old plants and declined linearly with plant age. 3, Predation rates were measured through direct observations of individual coccinellid and staphylinid predators in the field at different times during daylight hours, Predator observations were made at various field densities of A. glycines, and thus a functional response of predation rate to prey density was obtained for each predator type. 4. A simple deterministic model was developed to calculate population changes of A. glycines based on field-measured diurnal predation functions and aphid growth rates, The model was adopted to evaluate whether aphid population declines observed in the field could be ascribed to predation. 5. In young soybean crops (< 40 days), steep population declines of A, glycines that occurred after brief peak densities could not be ascribed to predation with our model. In older soybean crops (> 40 days), the observed population declines to low levels were attributable to predation. This pattern was observed on subsequent occasions in the same crop, and was observed concurrently in crops of three different ages planted in randomized blocks. 6, The influence of other mortality factors (competition and migration of A. glycines, rainfall, plant age) on A. glycines dynamics is discussed. 7. Coccinellid predators play a role in suppressing A. glycines in soybean. Therefore it is important that predators are conserved early in the season by avoiding unnecessary insecticide applications. Exercises developed from this study have been added to integrated pest management training curricula in Indonesia, in order that farmers learn to make more appropriate pest management decisions.","INT INST BIOL CONTROL,REG STN ASIA,FAO,IPM,JAKARTA 12540,INDONESIA; FOOD CROP PROTECT CTR 1,SUMATRA,INDONESIA; ANDALAS UNIV,PADANG,INDONESIA; FOOD CROP PROTECT CTR 2,W SUMATRA,INDONESIA","VandenBerg, H (corresponding author), INDONESIAN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT TRAINING PR,JALAN TAMAN MARGASATWA 61,PASSAR MINGGU,JAKARTA 12540,INDONESIA.",,,"van den Berg, Henk/0000-0002-9983-638X",,,,22,67,73,0,13,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The proposition that strong functional predator-prey links are associated wit compartments in food webs (Paine 1980) is examined for a large, well-documented web, the Ythan estuary. 2. A simple method for the detection and description of infrastructure within binary food webs is described and this is applied to 12 webs previously analysed by Pimm & Lawton (1980) and to the Ythan web. 3. There was evidence for significant compartmentation in several real webs, all of which are reasonably well documented, aquatic and benthic. However, there was no evidence of compartments in the Ythan web. 4. Manipulative field experiments on a range of avian, fish and invertebrate predators provided no evidence for strong functional interactions in the Ythan web. 5. It is concluded that the lack of both compartments and strong linkage is consistent with Paine's hypothesis, but that the proposition needs further testing for other well-described systems.","SOAFD, MARINE LAB, ABERDEEN AB9 8DB, SCOTLAND","RAFFAELLI, D (corresponding author), UNIV ABERDEEN, CULTERTY FIELD STN, ABERDEEN AB4 0AA, SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,49,67,69,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The effects of sea otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) on abalone (Haliotis spp.) is a salient example along North America's west coast where sea otters are recovering from 18th- and 19th-century fur trade while efforts are being made to recover abalone from more recent overfishing. To understand the direct and indirect effects of sea otters on northern abalone (H. kamtschatkana) and the relative influence of biotic and abiotic conditions, we surveyed subtidal rocky reef sites varying in otter occupation time in three regions of British Columbia, Canada. Sites occupied by sea otters for over 30 years had 16 times lower densities of exposed abalone than sites where otters have yet to recover (0.46 +/- 0.08/20 m(2) vs. 7.56 +/- 0.98/20 m(2)), but they also had higher densities of cryptic abalone (2.17 +/- 1.31/20 m(2) vs. 1.31 +/- 0.20/20 m(2)). Abalone densities were greater in deeper vs. shallower habitats at sites with sea otters compared to sites without otters. Sea otter effects on exposed abalone density were three times greater in magnitude than those of any other factor, whereas substrate and wave exposure effects on cryptic abalone were six times greater than those of sea otters. While higher substrate complexity may benefit abalone by providing refugia from sea otter predation, laboratory experiments revealed that it may also lead to higher capture efficiency by sunflower stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), a ubiquitous mesopredator, compared to habitat with lower complexity. Sea otter recovery indirectly benefitted abalone by decreasing biomass of predatory sunflower stars and competitive grazing sea urchins, while increasing stipe density and depth of kelp that provides food and protective habitat. Importantly, abalone persisted in the face of sea otter recovery, albeit at lower densities of smaller and more cryptic individuals. We provide empirical evidence of how complex ecological interactions influence the effects of recovering predators on their recovering prey. This ecosystem-based understanding can inform conservation trade-offs when balancing multifaceted ecological, cultural, and socio-economic objectives for species at risk.","[Lee, L. C.; Salomon, A.

The red fox is known to be one of the major threats to the persistence of small and medium-sized native vertebrates across the continent. Location Australia. Methods Indices of abundance were calculated from three independently collected datasets derived from bounty returns and field surveys. Data were analysed using univariate parametric, semi-parametric and nonparametric techniques. Results Predator abundance indices did not conform to a normal distribution and the relationships between dingo and fox abundance indices were not well described by linear functions. Semi-parametric and nonparametric techniques revealed consistently negative associations between indices of dingo and fox abundance. Main conclusions The results provide evidence that mesopredator suppression by a top predator can be exerted at very large geographical scales and suggest that relationships between the abundances of top predators and mesopredators are not linear. Our results have broad implications for the management of canid predators. First, they suggest that dingoes function ecologically to reduce the activity or abundance of red foxes and thus are likely to dampen the predatory impacts of foxes. More generally, they provide support for the notion that the mesopredator-suppressive effects of top predators could be incorporated into broad-scale biodiversity conservation programmes in many parts of the world by actively maintaining populations of top predators or restoring them in areas where they are now rare. Determining the population densities at which the interactions of top predators become ecologically effective will be a critical goal for conservation managers who aim to maintain or restore ecosystems using the ecological interactions of top predators.","[Letnic, Mike] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Nat Sci, Penrith 1797, Australia; [Greenville, Aaron; Denny, Elizabeth; Dickman, Christopher R.; Tischler, Max; Gordon, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Letnic, M (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Sch Nat Sci, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith 1797, Australia.",m.letnic@uws.edu.au,"Greenville, Aaron/G-9718-2013; Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019","Greenville, Aaron/0000-0002-0113-4778; Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730; Letnic, Michael/0000-0003-4191-8427",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0666574],"Tom Newsome, Peter Fleming and Guy Ballard provided field data and comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Daphnia galeata predominated near the dam site, and its abundance declined toward the headwaters. The abundance of other species increased away from the dam, and Bosmina longirostris was found abundantly at the site near the headwaters. Demographic analysis and field experiments demonstrated that D. galeata had the potential to depress the abundance of other species through exploitative competition and to predominate at sites near the headwaters as well as at the dam site. This potential was never realized, however, at a site near the headwater because of a high mortality rate that could not be explained by food abundance or physical and chemical conditions in the water. The invertebrate predator Leptodora kindtii was abundant at sites nearer the headwaters, but its occurrence was limited temporally. Trammel gill-net samples revealed that planktivorous fish, which prey selectively on the superior competitor D. galeata and the invertebrate predator L. kindtii, were distributed toward the headwaters in the warm-water season. The high mortality rate of D. galeata at the site near the headwaters apparently was attributable to predation by fish.

A reserve for native Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) was established in lower Hood Canal (Washington State, USA) more than a century ago but is now devoid of that species and dominated by native eelgrass (Zostera marina). This situation sets up a conservation conflict because management activities for one species are at odds with the protection of another. In experimental enhancement plots, Olympia oysters were outplanted at low density, which successfully maintained eelgrass density and production. One method was used in 2013 (seeded cultch, 8% cover) and two additional methods in 2015 (anchored cultch and single oysters, the latter at 4% cover). For all outplant methods, oysters experienced 99% annual mortality, associated with the attraction of non-native and native predators. Shell cover remained steady for a year and then declined rapidly, as shell accumulation did not exceed sedimentation rates. Eelgrass per se does not preclude Olympia oysters, given that the two species were observed to co-occur at a coastal estuarine site (Willapa Bay, Washington). However, even when socio-political constraints on restoration activities were overcome, ecological constraints remained from predation. Competition between these two protected species was avoided, but it may be the case that top-down control on oysters was particularly acute owing to low oyster density and/or the environmental conditions of eelgrass beds.","[Valdez, Stephanie R.; Ruesink, Jennifer L.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Peabody, Betsy; Allen, Brian] Puget Sound Restorat Fund, Bainbridge Isl, WA USA; [Blake, Brady] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Port Townsend, WA USA","Ruesink, JL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",ruesink@u.washington.edu,,", Stephanie/0000-0002-3497-751X",NOAA Restoration Center through Nature Conservancy [GMT-PSRF-052413]; Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; Skokomish Tribe,Funding for this project was provided by NOAA Restoration Center through a partnership with The Nature Conservancy (Project number GMT-PSRF-052413).

In systems where predators regulate prey abundance, it is reasonable to assume that differential patterns of habitat use by prey species represent adaptive responses to spatial variation in predation. However, patterns of habitat use also reflect interspecific competition over habitat. Collared (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) and brown (Lemmus trimucronatus) lemmings represent such a system and possess distinct upland tundra versus mesic meadow habitat preferences consistent with interspecific competition. Yet, we do not know whether this habitat preference might also reflect differences in predation risk or whether the two species differ in their behavioral tactics used to avoid predation. We performed experiments where we manipulated putative predation risk perceived by lemmings by increasing protective cover in upland and meadow habitats while we recorded lemming activity and behavior. Both lemming species preferentially used cover more than open patches, but Dicrostonyx was more vigilant than Lemmus. Both species also constrained their activity to protective patches in upland and meadow habitats, but during different periods of the day. Use of cover and vigilance were independent of habitat, suggesting that both species live in a fearsome but flattened landscape of fear at Walker Bay (Nunavut, Canada), and that their habitat preference is a consequence of competition rather than predation risk. Future studies aiming to map the contours of fear in multi-prey-predator systems should consider how predation and competition interact to modify prey species' habitat preference, patch use, and vigilance.","[Dupuch, Angelique] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Dupuch, Angelique; Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Halliday, William D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",Douglas.Morris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Canada's International Polar Year program Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable EcoSystems; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Department of Indian and Northern Affairs; Northern Scientific Training Program; Polar Continental Shelf Project (Natural Resources Canada)Natural Resources Canada,"We thank Canada's International Polar Year program Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable EcoSystems, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, Northern Scientific Training Program, and Polar Continental Shelf Project (Natural Resources Canada), for financial and logistical support.

In Argentine Patagonia, the exotic European hare has one of the highest numbers recorded worldwide and is now a widely consumed prey for many predators. We examine the potential relationship between abundance of this relatively new prey and the abundance and breeding spacing of one of its main consumers, the Black-chested Buzzard-Eagle (Geranoaetus melartoleucus). First we analyze the abundance of individuals of a raptor guild in relation to hare abundance through a correspondence analysis. We then estimated the Nearest Neighbor Distance (NND) of the Black-chested Buzzard-eagle abundances in the two areas with high hare abundances. Finally, we performed a meta regression between the NND and the body masses of Accipitridae raptors, to evaluate if Black-chested Buzzard eagle NND deviates from the expected according to their mass. We found that eagle abundance was highly associated with hare abundance, more than with any other raptor species in the study area. Their NND deviates from the value expected, which was significantly lower than expected for a raptor species of this size in two areas with high hare abundance. Our results support the hypothesis that high local abundance of prey leads to a reduction of the breeding spacing of its main predator, which could potentially alter other interspecific interactions, and thus the entire community.","[Barbar, Facundo; Ignazi, Gonzalo O.; Lambertucci, Sergio A.] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ecotono Lab, Grp Biol Conservac, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Hiraldo, Fernando] Estn Biol Donana CSIC Espana, Dept Biol Conservac, Seville, Spain","Barbar, F (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ecotono Lab, Grp Biol Conservac, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",facundo.barbar@gmail.com,"Hiraldo, Fernando/AAA-8314-2019","LAMBERTUCCI, SERGIO/0000-0002-2624-2185",,,,86,6,6,0,3,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2167-8359,,,PEERJ,PeerJ,MAY 10,2018,6,,,,,,,,e4746,10.7717/peerj.4746,,,17,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,GF5OE,WOS:000432016600002,29761058,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-27,

Among these native biotas the land snails are especially recognized not only for their high diversity and high levels of endemism but also for being under severe threat, with many species already extinct. Many non-indigenous snail species are being introduced, leading to a homogenization of land snail faunas across the Pacific. Field survey work in American Samoa in 1998 recorded 19 of the 32 previously known native land snail species, 11 of the 12 alien species, and three of the six cryptogenic (unknown origin) species previously known from American Samoa. Eight species were recorded from American Samoa For the first time: three described species that are presumed to be native, four non-indigenous species; and one cryptogenic species. Two undescribed and presumed endemic species were discovered, as was one unidentified and perhaps undescribed species. One species, previously thought to be extinct was rediscovered, although in very small numbers. The known island by island distributions of 11 species (five native, five alien, one cryptogenic) were extended. Comparisons with surveys undertaken predominantly in the 1920s and 1930s, 1975, and 1992 showed that: the majority of native species are declining; some native species may be stable or even increasing, with one species abundant; only seven of the non-indigenous and cryptogenic species are declining or probably declining, while six are increasing, and for others no trend was assessed; some non-indigenous species are extremely abundant. Threats to the fauna include: alien predators, predominantly rats and predatory snails introduced in attempts to control the giant African snail; possible competitors, including non-indigenous snail species; invasive plants and habitat modification; development, including recreational, agricultural, and domestic/urban development. A review should be undertaken of the IUCN and US Fish and Wildlife Service listings of endangered land snail species in American Samoa. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The threespine stickleback is a common species in temperate aquatic ecosystems that could serve such a role. Question: Does the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) modulate the impact of human-induced eutrophication on ecological communities? If so, what are the pathways and mechanisms? Methods: Review of studies investigating the influence of eutrophication on the dynamics and characteristics of stickleback populations, and how changes to the population mediate and modify the impact of eutrophication on other species. Results: Eutrophication influences the abundance and characteristics of stickleback, which impacts other species through density- and trait-mediated effects on species interactions and the habitat. The effects can be complex and include feedback loops, and extend far beyond the stickleback population through the myriad of linkages among species. The changes can interact with other changes to the ecosystem, such as species invasions and climate change, and further alter the impact of ecological disturbances. Conclusions: The threespine stickleback modulates the effects of eutrophication on communities and alters ecological and evolutionary processes. However, relatively little is known about the ultimate effects on ecosystems. Thus the complexity of ecological network architecture needs to be considered by combining experimental investigations of linkages among species with whole-ecosystem studies.","[Candolin, Ulrika] Univ Helsinki, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Candolin, U (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",ulrika.candolin@helsinki.fi,,"Candolin, Ulrika/0000-0001-8736-7793",,,,169,6,6,0,5,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

Fish were collected principally by mid-water trawl 20 July-12 August 1995, 5-14 October 1995, and 7-13 November 1994. Prey fields were assessed fi-om zooplankton samples in 1995. During the summer, the principal prey of allopatric pollock and herring was small calanoids and diet overlap was high (R-0>0.76). During the autumn, diets were composed of large calanoids, larvaceans, and euphausiids. Diet overlap between sympatric species was greater in November 1994 (R(0)less than or equal to0.94) than in October 1995 (R(0)less than or equal to0.69). The seasonal diet shift to larger prey coincided with larger fish size and with decreased abundance and proportions of the principal zooplankter, small calanoids, and increased abundance and proportions of large calanoids and larvaceans in zooplankton tows. However, feeding decreased in autumn, compared with summer, especially for herring. Sympatric fish had higher rates of nonfeeding than allopatric fish, and subtle differences in prey selection existed between the aggregations, but sampling variation could explain these feeding differences. The similarity in diets of YOY pollock. and herring indicate the potential for competition, These species are important to commercial fisheries and as forage for marine birds and mammals. An understanding of their trophic interactions could help to explain shifts in fish community structure and bird predation.

Maxon (P.c.) and P. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) (P.a.), thrive dominantly in habitats extending from near the sea level to the Andean alpine zone around 3000 m altitude. The scope of sources of stress associated with elevation-has three main components: plant competition for resources, activity of herbivores/pathogens, and climate. The contribution of each component varies greatly from place to place and bracken must respond with considerable physiological/genetic plasticity to maintain its dominant status in all these habitats. Phenolic compounds have a number of properties for plant adaptation to evolutionary selective forces of biotic and climatic nature, in particular with reference to their protective role against excessive solar radiation. We have examined the second of these properties by studying the dynamics of low (LMP) and high (HMP) molecular weight phenolics in neotropical bracken ferns in two groups of field experiments: (1) their variation during the phenologic development of blades in sympatric populations of both bracken species to examine the synthesis and allocation of these materials under similar conditions of competition, predation and solar UV-B radiation; (2) the contents of LMP and HMP in six bracken populations of Re. along its typical altitudinal range [1180-2140 m above sea level (asl)] and six additional populations of P. a. (1880-3190 m as]), which grows at higher elevations in the western Andes of Venezuela, to investigate the phenolics' response to the ecological gradients associated with elevation in these plants. From series (1), we recorded the progressive accumulation of both types of phenolics with frond expansion, and hence increased surface of lamina exposed to sunlight, in Re. and P.a. However, phenolics in mature blades of P.a. were 1.6 (LMP) and 3.26 (HMP) greater in amount than in Re. From series (2), synthesis and accumulation of LMP was found to be independent of altitude, except for the subalpine population of P. a. at 3190 m asl, where a 167% increment of the average contents was recorded. By contrast, the levels of HMP correlated positively with elevation in both bracken species. The independent response of both types of phenolics to solar radiation may be interpreted as either more effective and metabolically cost-effective protection of HMP against UV-B light than LMP or differential light activation of key steps in the biosynthesis of HMP and LMP in bracken.

However, most empirical evidence for TMIIs comes from studies that are either conducted in laboratory or mesocosm venues or are restricted to simple food webs involving lower trophic-level animals. Here, I quantified the direct and indirect effects of interactions between high-level vertebrate predators on their vertebrate prey using a field experiment. Specifically, I tested how varying densities of a large-bodied, top predator (Nassau grouper; Epinephelus striatus) affected persistence, growth, and behavior of two smaller-bodied, intermediate predators (coney and graysby groupers; Cephalopholis fulva and C. cruentata) on 20 isolated patch reefs in the Bahamas. Large-bodied groupers are capable of consuming their smaller-bodied counterparts, and previous observational studies have indicated that local abundances of these groupers are negatively correlated. I measured the effects of interactions among groupers on lower trophic-level prey by quantifying recruitment of coral-reef fishes to the reefs. The field experiment demonstrated a strong trophic cascade that was entirely mediated by modified behavior of the intermediate predators. These results indicate that indirect, nonlethal interactions in natural systems can have strong cascading effects even at high trophic levels and in high-diversity food webs. Incorporating the complexity of such indirect effects into fisheries management may improve the sustainability of. shed populations and strengthen marine conservation efforts; however these results also indicate that the effects of fishing are complex and difficult to predict.","[Stallings, Christopher D.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Stallings, CD (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Coastal & Marine Lab, St Teresa, FL 32358 USA.",stallings@bio.fsu.edu,,"Stallings, Christopher/0000-0002-3410-4540",,,,36,96,97,1,78,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2008,89,8,,,,,2090,2095,,10.1890/07-1671.1,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,334QN,WOS:000258236400003,18724719,,,,2021-09-27,

Over the last few decades concerns have been raised about its invasiveness in those areas where it has been introduced. A test was carried out to investigate the ability of H. axyridis to survive, grow and reproduce at higher temperatures (30 degrees C) than the recorded optimum of 25 degrees C. In a preliminary experiment, the temperature of 35 degrees C was also tested, but was subsequently excluded, because all eggs were dehydrated. The eggs placed at 30 degrees C hatched, but at a considerably lower rate compared with the control eggs. This temperature resulted in faster larval and overall development compared with the control temperature. Adult weight and reproductive parameters were adversely affected at 30 degrees C. In particular, fecundity and fertility were dramatically lower for the females reared and maintained at 30 degrees C. The higher temperature tested had thus an overall negative impact on H. axyridis development and performance. A second experiment was designed to test the effects of a pyrethroid insecticide (lambda-Cyhalothrin) on H. axyridis in comparison with Adalia bipunctata (L.), a species commonly found in Europe. Larval mortality suggested that H. axyridis was less susceptible than A. bipunctata to lambda-Cyhalothrin. Further studies are needed to better evaluate the impact of this and other pesticide treatments on the exotic vs. native ladybirds, also under field conditions, where other factors may play a key role.","[Benelli, Maurizio; Francati, Santolo; Marchetti, Elisa; Dindo, Maria Luisa] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Agr Entomol, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Leather, Simon R.] Harper Adams Univ, Dept Crop & Environm Sci, Newport, Shrops, England","Benelli, M (corresponding author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Agr Entomol, Viale G Fanin 42, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",marialuisa.dindo@unibo.it,"Leather, Simon R/H-7921-2019; Dindo, Maria Luisa/AAV-3256-2020","Leather, Simon R/0000-0003-3007-8514; BENELLI, MAURIZIO/0000-0003-0195-0158; DINDO, MARIA LUISA/0000-0001-9936-2666","Italian Ministry of Education and Research (PRIN)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR); Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna",This research was funded by the Italian Ministry of Education and Research (PRIN Project 2010-2011: Insects and globalization: sustainable control of exotic species in agro-forestry ecosystems GEISCA).

One transition occurs between third- and fourth-order streams. Cambarus chasmodactylus is the dominant species in third-order tributaries. Orconectes cristavarius is the dominant species in the fourth-order South Fork of the New River. While adult C. chasmodactylus are present in the South Fork, the young-of-the-year (YOY) of this species are absent despite evidence of reproduction. In this study we evaluated the factors that may be responsible for the absence of C. chasmodactylus YOY from the South Fork. A field experiment was used to evaluate the role of abiotic factors and competition with YOY O. cristavarius. There was no significant effect of either of these factors on mortality or growth of C. chasmodactylus YOY. The growth rate of O. cristavarius was 3x faster than that of C. chasmodactylus in this experiment. Since neither abiotic factors nor competition appeared responsible for the exclusion of C. chasmodactylus YOY from the South Fork we evaluated the potential importance of selective predation by rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), a fish species that is common in the South Fork but virtually absent in the tributaries. In a laboratory experiment, C. chasmodactylus YOY experienced significantly higher mortality than O. cristavarius YOY in the presence of rock bass. Field observations and a laboratory experiment suggest that the two crayfish species differ in their anti-predator behaviors. Cambarus chasmodactylus was less likely to swim when initially disturbed and swam shorter distances than O. cristavarius. The differences in escape behavior and growth rate may contribute to the differences in the vulnerability of the two species to rock bass predation. Our results suggest that intense predation pressure exerted by the rock bass may contribute to the virtual exclusion of C. chasmodactylus YOY from the fourth-order South Fork.","Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA","Fortino, K (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.",kfortino@email.unc.edu,"Fortino, Kenneth/ABD-1379-2020",,,,,59,22,22,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN,2007,575,,,,,,301,314,,10.1007/s10750-006-0378-7,,,14,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,112DG,WOS:000242505000024,,,,,2021-09-27,

The Santa Monica Mountains (California, U.S.A.), situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, is an area of conservation concern due to climate change, urbanization, and the introduction of non-native species. We examined the effect of non-native crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) on an existing native predator, dragonfly nymphs (Aeshna sp.), and their mosquito larvae (Anopheles sp.) prey. We used laboratory experiments to compare the predation efficiency of both predators, separately and together, and field data on counts of dragonfly nymphs and mosquito larvae sampled from 13 local streams. We predicted a lower predation efficiency of crayfish compared with native dragonfly nymphs and a reduced predation efficiency of dragonfly nymphs in the presence of crayfish. Dragonfly nymphs were an order of magnitude more efficient predators than crayfish, and dragonfly nymph predation efficiency was reduced in the presence of crayfish. Field count data showed that populations of dragonfly nymphs and mosquito larvae were strongly correlated with crayfish presence in streams, such that sites with crayfish tended to have fewer dragonfly nymphs and more mosquito larvae. Under natural conditions, it is likely that crayfish reduce the abundance of dragonfly nymphs and their predation efficiency and thereby, directly and indirectly, lead to higher mosquito populations and a loss of ecosystem services related to disease vector control.","[Bucciarelli, Gary M.; Shaffer, H.

We examined the distribution of a non-territorial apex carnivore relative to foraging habitat to assess the effect of two types of interference: competitive asymmetries in predatory ability and conspecific predation risk. Location Beaufort Sea, Canada. Methods The quality of foraging habitat was modelled using resource selection functions to relate the locations of seals killed by polar bears (Ursus maritimus) to attributes of the sea ice. We used estimated seal biomass as a sample weight to reflect the energetic return of different sizes of kills. To test the effect of sample weighting, locations at which polar bears were captured were used to compare habitat quality modelled with kills weighted equally and kills weighted by their biomass. The distributions of different demographic classes of polar bears were then compared with the general predictions of unequal-competitor models. Results Polar bear distribution was correlated with the quality of the foraging habitat as determined by the kill biomass model (r(s) = 0.90, P = 0.04), but not in the unweighted design (P = 0.75). No difference was detected in use of the highest-quality foraging habitat by subadults and adults. Females with cubs-of-the-year used lower-quality foraging habitat relative to the rest of the population. Main conclusions Weighting the habitat model with biologically relevant information improved its fit to species distribution, and suggested that density of use alone was insufficient to define habitat quality. Intraspecific competition had a varying influence on the distribution: unequal competitors coexisted, while the avoidance of conspecific predation risk resulted in semi-truncation.","[Pilfold, Nicholas W.; Derocher, Andrew E.; Richardson, Evan] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Richardson, Evan] Environm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Wildlife Res Div, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada","Pilfold, NW (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",pilfold@ualberta.ca,"Pilfold, Nick/J-1376-2012; Derocher, Andrew/J-4469-2012","Derocher, Andrew/0000-0002-1104-7774",ArcticNet; Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums; Canadian Wildlife Federation; Canadian Circumpolar Institute's Boreal Alberta Research; Environment CanadaCGIAR; Hauser Bears; Inuvialuit Game Council; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Northern Scientific Training Program of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada; Northwest Territories Department of Environment and Natural Resources; Polar Continental Shelf ProjectNatural Resources Canada; Polar Bears International; Quark Expeditions; United States Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; World Wildlife Fund (Canada and International),"We are grateful to Ian Stirling and Dennis Andriashek for sharing data they collected.

Here we quantitatively assess the relative importance of different coral species in structuring fish communities and evaluate whether sampling scale and coral colony size affect the perceived strength of fish-habitat relationships. Fish communities present on colonies of eight coral species (Porites cylindrica, Echinopora horrida, Hydnophora rigida, Stylophora pistillata, Seriatopora hystrix, Acropora formosa, A. tenuis and A. millepora) were examined in the Lizard Island lagoon, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Additionally, the differences in fish communities supported by three coral species (P. cylindrica, E. horrida, H. rigida) were investigated at three spatial scales of sampling (2x2 m, 1x1 m, 0.5x0.5 m). Substantial differences in fish communities were observed across the different coral species, with E. horrida and H. rigida supporting the most fish species and individuals. Coral species explained more of the variability in fish species richness (20.9-53.6%), than in fish abundance (015%). Most coral species supported distinctive fish communities, with dissimilarities ranging from 50 to 90%. For three focal coral species, a greater amount of total variation in fish species richness and fish abundance was evident at a larger scale of sampling. Together, these results indicate that the structure of reef fish communities is finely tuned to coral species. Loss of preferred coral species could have profound effects on reef fish biodiversity, potentially more so than would be predicted on the basis of declining coral cover alone.","[Komyakova, Valeriya; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Monday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Komyakova, Valeriya; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Monday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Komyakova, Valeriya] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Komyakova, Valeriya] Inst Marine Res, Pelag Grp, Bergen, Norway","Komyakova, V (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia.; Komyakova, V (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia.; Komyakova, V (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.; Komyakova, V (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, Pelag Grp, Bergen, Norway.",Valeriya.Komyakova@gmail.com,"Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Komyakova, Valeriya/H-4632-2013","Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; Komyakova, Valeriya/0000-0003-3755-1546",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council [CE0561342]; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council,"This research was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (CE0561342) (www.coralcoe.org.au).

A fast- and slow-growing morph was identified that reaches commercial size (50.8 mm shell length) in 4 y and 5 y, respectively. Fast-growing individuals were selected as broodstock, and conditioned to spawn at the Downcast Institute. The fate and growth of cultured juveniles was followed for 5 mo beginning in July 2006 at 4 stocking-densities (2,500-10,000 animals/m(2) floating, nylon window screen-lined tray; n = 20) at a coldwater field nursery approximately 60 km east of Trenton, in the town of Beals, ME (Washington County). Survival was nearly 100%, and growth was density dependent, with animals attaining a final mean shell length +/-95% confidence interval of 8.4+/-0.13 nun and 7.6+/-0.218 mm in the lowest and highest density treatments, respectively. In November 2006, cultured seed was separated into 2 sizes (large, 8.7+/-0.2 mm; small, 5.1+/-0.2 mm) and overwintered in window-screen bags (0.2 m(2)) at densities ranging from 0.6-1.6 kg (large) and 0.5-1 kg (small), representing approximate densities ranging from 3,360-15,510 individuals per bag. Bags were placed on horizontal shelves within modified lobster traps (overwintering containers) that were Lidded to a 35,000-L tank receiving ambient seawater for 177 days until May 2007. Seawater temperatures during this interval ranged from -1-10 degrees C. Survival rates exceeded 99%, and no negative effects resulting from stocking density were observed. Hatchery seed was transplanted in May 2007 to the lower intertidal at Goose Cove and a second intertidal location approximately 30 kin east of Beals at Duck Brook Flat, in the town of Cutler, and the fate and growth of these juveniles was followed for 6-7 mo. Survival was independent of planting densities (330-1320 individuals/m(2)), and predator netting did not enhance Survival compared with controls without netting. Growth was seasonal, with the greatest incremental shell increases occurring between early July and late September. Growth rates varied between planting locations, with clams adding approximately 10 mm shell length at Goose Cove between May and December (initial shell length, 8.2 mm; final shell length, 17.9 mm) and approximately 5 mm shell length at Duck Brook Flat between June and November (initial shell length, 9.3 mm, final shell length, 14.3 mm). Hard clam farming in eastern Maine may help to diversify a wild shellfish industry that is currently in decline for most species except lobsters; however, additional efforts are needed to explore alternative grow-out sites and methods to enhance growth rates.","[Beal, Brian F.] Univ Maine, Machias, ME 04654 USA; [Beal, Brian F.; Protopopescu, George; Yeatts, Katy] Downeast Inst Appl Marine Res & Educ, Beals, ME 04611 USA; [Porada, Joseph] Egypt Bay Seafarms, Winterport, ME 04614 USA","Beal, BF (corresponding author), Univ Maine, 9 OBrien Ave, Machias, ME 04654 USA.",bbeal@maine.edu,,,Maine Technology Institute [SG2679]; University of Maine at Machias,"This work was funded by a seed grant from the Maine Technology Institute (SG2679) and the University of Maine at Machias.

Ecological differences among co-occurring taxa are often invoked as an explanation for the maintenance of biodiversity. Whether these differences facilitate coexistence, which allows unequal competitors to remain in systems and thus maintain biodiversity, is still unclear. 2. Here, we used observational and experimental studies to test for ecological partitioning in ways that would promote coexistence among three co-occurring damselfly genera. We evaluated two necessary conditions for coexistence: (i) that the damselfly genera differ in their abilities to engage in interactions with other damselfly genera and environmental conditions such that their relative abundances covary differently along environmental gradients and (ii) that an increase in intra-generic abundance is more detrimental to performance-related demographic features of each genus than increases in intergeneric abundances. 3. Observational studies across 40 lakes showed that relative abundances of each genus covaried differently along an environmental gradient of lake abiotic and biotic features consistent with ecological partitioning. Field experiments in which we manipulated both intra-and intergeneric densities demonstrated that per capita growth rates of each genus are negatively density-dependent and are only limited by increases in intra-not intergeneric densities. 4. Collectively, these results show a clear signature of ecological partitioning among each genus, which should prevent competitive exclusion and maintain each genus in this system. The results do not guarantee local coexistence among the three genera but are consistent with criteria that should promote their coexistence. Our results also suggest that a food web model coupling keystone predation and apparent competition is likely necessary to explain the ecological dynamics of persistence among these genera.","[Siepielski, Adam M.; Mertens, Andrew N.; Wilkinson, Brianna L.; McPeek, Mark A.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",Mark.McPeek@Dartmouth.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0714782],We thank K.

Intraguild predation and competition often occur simultaneously, and ontogenetic shifts in competitive strength can dictate the magnitude and direction of species interactions. The recent introduction of the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus to the Atlantic coast of North America has resulted in the potential for considerable intraguild interactions with juvenile American lobsters Homarus americanus, with which it now co-occupies rocky intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. We present data from 5 yr of monthly (May-October) field sampling revealing a significant decline in lobster density as H. sanguineus density increased in the low intertidal. To investigate potential mechanisms behind this pattern, we conducted three mesocosm experiments designed to examine whether competitive interactions between H. americanus and H. sanguineus are size- or density-dependent. Larger early benthic phase lobsters (16-34 mm CL) outcompeted H. sanguineus for both food and shelter resources. These lobsters fed faster and more in the presence of H. sanguineus, effectively defended shelter, were responsible for the majority of agonistic interactions, and, in multiple instances, killed and consumed H. sanguineus. Effects on sheltering and agonstic interactions by these lobsters were independent of H. sanguineus density; however, prior shelter residency increased lobster agonistic behavior towards crabs. In contrast, H. sanguineus outcompeted smaller, early benthic phase lobsters (7.2-11.2 mm CL) for shelter, and these interactions were density dependent. Displacement of lobsters from shelter by crabs and cumulative agonistic interactions instigated by crabs towards lobsters scaled positively with H. sanguineus density. Given the similarity of the invasion documented here and others occurring globally, these experiments demonstrate the importance of considering how factors such as ontogeny, density-dependence, and primacy influence the outcomes of interactions between intraguild predators. Disentangling how these factors structure intraguild interactions between invasive and endemic species will both advance our fundamental understanding of community ecology and enhance efforts to conserve and manage natural resources.","[Baillie, Christopher J.; Grabowski, Jonathan H.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA","Baillie, CJ (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.",baillie.c@husky.neu.edu,,"Grabowski, Jonathan/0000-0003-4711-5481",,,,95,2,2,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2018,99,9,,,,,2067,2079,,10.1002/ecy.2432,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GS3WV,WOS:000443558200015,29920682,,,,2021-09-27,

Here, we present the results of a baseline study designed to assess the status of this exotic species in northeastern Ohio and to explore its potential impacts on local ant communities and the extent to which it has been incorporated into the diet of a native predator, the red-backed salamander. At the sites where N. flavipes occurred, we found a sixfold increase in total ant abundance, with 87% of all ants collected being N. flavipes. The high numerical dominance of N. flavipes did not lead to observable changes in the species richness and abundance of the native ant community. At baits, N. flavipes did not engage in interspecific combat and did not exhibit aggression towards native ants. Thus, aggression and interference competition are not likely factors explaining the high local abundance of N. flavipes. Red-backed salamanders have incorporated N. flavipes into their diet, but further research is needed to understand the interactions of N. flavipes within the forest-floor food web. Although we did not detect changes in the local ant communities in the presence of N. flavipes, we argue that this species' high local abundance and ability to forage at cooler temperatures may give it a competitive advantage and thereby affect native ants through exploitative competition.","[Ivanov, Kaloyan] Cleveland Museum Nat Hist, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Lockhart, Owen M.; Walton, B.

However, studies of such competition across large-scale space are conversely mere 'snapshots' in time. The current study aimed at measuring interference-competition at multiple scales in space and time. Different aspects of interference-competition were measured in a model community (encrusters of boulder communities, e.g. ascidians, bryozoans, polychaetes and sponges) at 3 tropical, 3 temperate and 2 polar sites at intervals of days, weeks, months and years. The 3 aspects of competition measured-transitivity (hierarchicalness), number of clades involved, prevalence of interspecific encounters-varied non-significantly with time (from days to years) but significantly in space (from the tropics to the poles). Thus the strong differences observed in space are robust along ecological time-scales; boulder communities may be highly dynamic at local scales, but overall measures of interference-competition amongst their encrusters seem to vary little within a region. Why low- and high-latitude encrusting communities should differ may be linked to past selection pressures-to survive spatial competition in the more stable warm seas and to be able to recolonise from local ice-scour and regional ice sheets in the high temperate and polar realms. The results of the current study suggest that, despite being 'snapshots', the many point-in-time studies of competition in the literature are likely to be valid on ecological time-scales and thus useful for meta-analyses.","British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",dkab@bas.ac.uk,,,"Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [dml011000, bas010008] Funding Source: researchfish",,,52,7,7,0,8,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

It is not clear, however, if spiders can effectively suppress pest populations, and if so, by what mechanisms. In a microcosm experiment, we examined the consumption of the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi L. (Homoptera: Aphididae), a pest species in wheat fields, by three spider species that differ in their hunting methods. We then tested the effect of additional prey type on the ability of erigonid spiders to reduce aphids. In a 48-h experiment Mermessus denticulatus (Banks) (Araneae: Linyphiidae; Erigoninae) consumed more aphids than did Enoplognatha gemina Bosmans and Van Keer (Araneae: Theridiidae) and Bathyphantes cf. extricatus (O center dot P.-Cambridge) (Araneae: Linyphiidae; Linyphiinae). This difference may be due to the ability of erigonids to forage actively on the vegetation in addition to using their webs to catch prey. In a 7-week experiment, we provided springtails (Collembola) in high and low densities as additional prey to mated erigonids, prior to aphid introduction. Spiders in the low-density springtail treatment built more webs on the vegetation, and caused a 50% reduction in aphid populations. There were significantly fewer aphids in the low-density springtail treatment, but not in the high-density treatment, in comparison to the control (high-density springtails without spiders). The results suggest that additional prey density affects predatory interactions between M. denticulatus and R. padi and that erigonids, which occur in high densities in wheat fields in the Negev desert, may be involved in aphid suppression in these agroecosystems.","[Gavish-Regev, Efrat] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Rotkopf, Ron] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Lubin, Yael] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Coll, Moshe] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Entomol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Gavish-Regev, E (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",efratg@bgu.ac.il,"Rotkopf, Ron/E-6303-2015; Lubin, Yael D/F-1382-2012","Lubin, Yael D/0000-0003-3876-1668; Rotkopf, Ron/0000-0001-9503-7348","American Arachnology Society (AAS) Research Fund; Mitrani Department of Desert Ecology; FPVI of the European CommissionEuropean Commission; Taxonomic Facility Consortia; SYNTHESYS; RBINS, Brussels, Belgium","We thank G.

In benthic marine environments, where some of the classic examples of competition were described, there is a strong emphasis on interference competition: marine invertebrates are assumed to compete fiercely for the limiting resource of space. Much of our understanding of the dynamics of this system is based on this assumption, yet empirical studies often find that increases in density can reduce performance despite free space being available. Furthermore, the assumption that space is the exclusively limiting resource raises paradoxes regarding species coexistence in this system. Here, we measure the availability of oxygen in the field and in the laboratory, as well as the tolerance of resident species to low-oxygen conditions. We show that oxygen can be the primary limiting resource in some instances, and that exploitative competition for this resource is very likely among benthic marine invertebrates. Furthermore, growth form (and the associated risk of oxygen limitation) covaries with the ability to withstand oxygen-poor conditions across a wide range of taxa. Oxygen availability at very small scales may influence the distribution and abundance of sessile marine invertebrates more than is currently appreciated. Furthermore, competition for multiple resources (space and oxygen) and trade-offs in competitive ability for each may promote coexistence in this system.","[Ferguson, Nick; White, Craig R.; Marshall, Dustin J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4079, Australia; [Marshall, Dustin J.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Ferguson, N (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4079, Australia.",dustin.marshall@monash.edu,"White, Craig R/F-9062-2010; Marshall, Dustin/C-3450-2016","White, Craig R/0000-0002-0200-2187; Marshall, Dustin/0000-0001-6651-6219",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"The authors thank East Coast Marina for access to their field site, Rebecca Taggart and Scott Burgess for assistance in the field and laboratory.

Predators with differing foraging modes may have different effects on prey behavior, and these effects may be transmitted differently through food webs. Here we test the hypothesis that shifts in the type of predator present in a food web indirectly affect the prey's resource independent of changes in the density of prey. We assessed the importance of predator identity in mediating the grazing effects of the freshwater snail Physa integra on its periphyton resources using field and mesocosm studies. Field observations showed that Physa used covered habitats more in ponds containing fish than in ponds containing crayfish or no predators at all. A field experiment confirmed that snail behavior depended on predator identity. Physa placed near caged pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) selected covered habitats, but Physa placed near caged crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) moved to the surface of the water. The effects of predator identity on periphtyon were then examined in a mesocosm experiment, using caged predators. Habitat use of Physa was similar to their habitat use in the field experiment. In the presence of caged sunfish, periphyton standing crop in covered habitats was reduced to 34% of the standing crop in the presence of crayfish. In contrast, periphyton in near-surface habitats was 110% higher in the presence of fish than in the presence of crayfish. Thus, the effects of predator identity on Physa behavior cascaded through the food web to affect the abundance and spatial distribution of periphyton.","Clar Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16412 USA","Bernot, RJ (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, 232 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

The metric that we used to assess the density-dependent effects was based on consumptive allometry and predator-prey theory. We demonstrate that the interactions among size classes were asymmetrical, favoring larger-bodied individuals. Descriptions of diet and spatial resource use, measures of prey availability, and risk to intra-specific interactions allowed assessment of the relative contributions of exploitative and interference competitive interactions among size classes. Growth of the larger classes was strongly density-dependent and driven primarily by exploitative competition. Growth of the smallest size class was controlled by a combination of exploitative competition within and among size classes and interference competition with larger-bodied conspecifics. This combination of interactions among size classes within populations resulted in a body-size-based asymmetry favoring the larger size classes. Survival of all size classes was positively related to both body size and growth rate. We speculate that the net result of these processes within size-structured populations is compensatory, leading to stable population dynamics.","Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Div Ecol, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, British Columbia Minist Fisheries, Fisheries Res & Dev Sect, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Post, JR (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Div Ecol, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",jrpost@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,109,186,187,0,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Microhabitat selection of Calopteryx splendens and Erythromnia najas was further examined in the laboratory, individually at different larval densities and in the presence of the other species and a predator. - E. najas, Ischnura elegans and Platycnemis pennipes showed significant preferences for particular aquatic macrophytes compared to others in the field, whereas C. splendens did not discriminate between the investigated plant species. Only limited spatial separation was apparent between the larvae of different species, as preferences for the same macrophyte species were found. - When kept separate and at low densities, larvae of C. splendens and E. najas inhabited significantly different microhabitats in the laboratory. At high intraspecific abundances, spatial overlap between the two species became apparent as both increasingly occupied less preferred substrata, which is in concurrence with the ideal free distribution model of habitat selection. E. najas showed no change in perch selection in the presence of C. splendens at high densities. - In this instance, intraspecific competition therefore appeared to be more important than interspecific competition with other Zygoptera in determining the microdistribution of E. najas.

I used two distinct size classes of the snails (mature and immature) to determine if the effects of competition on dispersal differed between developmental stages of a consumer. Dispersal attempts were measured within enclosure pens by counting snails climbing the sides of the enclosure. The influence of snail density per se and resource levels (which were set by snail densities) on dispersal rates were separated by comparing responses of snails to density before and after resources became depleted. For large snails of both species, dispersal increased as resource levels decreased, supporting the hypothesis that competition influences dispersal rates. Small snails of both species, in contrast, always dispersed at relatively higher rates than larger individuals, but were not influenced by variation in resource levels. This result corroborates other studies that have shown reduced competition in these species at smaller size, and suggests that another mechanism, such as genetically coded behavior to disperse when young, influences their behavior. Previous experiments demonstrated Batillaria's superior resource conversion efficiency; therefore, I had hypothesized that for any given resource level, Cerithidea would disperse more, because it was more affected by resource availability. Adult Batillaria, however, responded more sensitively to resource levels (i.e., dispersed more at any given resource level) than Cerithidea. This counterintuitive result illustrates the potential importance of genetic limitations on behavioral responses available to a species. Constraints on behavioral responses may have been accentuated since Batillaria is a non-indigenous species whose evolved behavioral responses are not necessarily adapted to its present, non-native environment.

During two years of offshore sampling in the late winter to early spring, sixteen chaetognath species were identified, four of which had not previously been reported in the waters of the United States South Atlantic Bight. Offshore samples were dominated by Sagitta enflata Grassi, 1881, one of the larger species, which contributed >61% of total chaetognath abundance while dominant coastal species were S. tenuis Conant, 1896 and S. hispida Conant, 1895. Abundances, body sizes and spatial distributions were determined for the most abundant chaetognath species along with the overall abundance of three common co-occurring larval fish species (spot, Atlantic croaker and Atlantic menhaden). In addition, laboratory feeding experiments were conducted using S. tenuis and S. hispida to estimate the potential impact of chaetognath predation on representative North Carolina larval fish which spawn offshore and subsequently migrate into local estuaries. Feeding rates (no. prey items day(-1)) varied with prey type and the condition (starved/fed) of the chaetognath. Weight specific daily rations (SDR) were found to vary inversely with chaetognath size, decreasing exponentially with an increase in chaetognath length. The observed abundance and distribution data indicate that wintertime chaetognath populations in offshore waters of Onslow Bay, North Carolina have the potential to interact with recently spawned larval fish and may simultaneously act as competitors, predators, or prey. Furthermore, calculations using published values of chaetognath abundance, zooplankton standing crops, and our SDR estimates indicate that chaetognaths in a representative North Carolina estuary would require a minimum of 5.96 cal m(-3) day(-1) to sustain their biomass. Allowing for the reported spatial and temporal variability in zooplankton abundance in these systems, chaetognaths should consume 4.4%-20.9% of the estimated total zooplankton production day(-1). This further emphasizes the role of chaetognaths not only as predators, but also as competitors with larval fish for zooplankton food stocks in southeastern United Sates estuaries.

A key abiotic feature of forests is regular canopy disturbances that create temporary patches, or gaps, of above-average light availability. Co-occurring in lowland primary forest of Korup National Park (Cameroon), Microberlinia bisulcata and Tetraberlinia bifoliolata are locally dominant, ectomycorrhizal trees whose seeds share predator guilds in masting years. Here, we experimentally tested the impact of small mammal predators upon seedling abundance, growth, and survivorship. In 2007, we added a fixed density of seeds of each species to exclosures at 48 gap-understory locations across 82.5 ha within a large Microberlinia grove, and at 15 locations outside it. For both species, small mammals removed more seeds in gaps than in understory, whereas this was reversed for seeds killed by invertebrates. Nonetheless, Microberlinia lost twice as many seeds to small mammals, and more to invertebrates in exclosures, than Tetraberlinia, which was more prone to a pathogenic white fungus. After six weeks, both species had greater seedling establishment in gaps than understory, and in exclosures outside compared to exclosures inside the grove. In the subsequent two-year period, seedling growth and survivorship peaked in exclosures in gaps, but Microberlinia had more seedlings' stems clipped by animals than Tetraberlinia, and more than twice the percentage of leaf area damaged. Whereas Microberlinia seedling performance in gaps was inferior to Tetraberlinia inside the grove, outside it Microberlinia had reduced leaf damage, grew taller, and had many more leaves than Tetraberlinia. No evidence was found for apparent mutualism in the understory as seedling establishment of both species increased away from (>25 m) large stems of either species, pointing to apparent competition instead. In gaps, Microberlinia seedling establishment was lower near Tetraberlinia than conspecific adults because of context-dependent small mammal satiation. Stage-matrix analysis suggested that protecting Microberlinia from small mammals could increase its population growth rate by 0.06. In the light of prior research we conclude that small mammals and canopy gaps play an important role in promoting species coexistence in this forest, and that their strong interaction contributes to Microberlinia's currently very poor regeneration.","[Norghauer, Julian M.; Newbery, David M.] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland","Norghauer, JM (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, 21 Altenbergrain, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",julian.norghauer@ips.unibe.ch,"Newbery, David McClintock/I-2379-2013","Newbery, David McClintock/0000-0002-0307-3489; Norghauer, Julian/0000-0002-6484-6879",,,,110,14,16,1,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Lotka-Volterra equations (LVEs) are known to be the most popular model, and they are mainly applied to the systems of predation and competition. However, LVEs often fail to catch the population dynamics of mutualism; the population sizes of species increase infinitely under certain condition (divergence problem). Furthermore, LVEs never predicts the Allee effect in the systems of obligate mutualism. Instead of LVEs, several models have been presented for mutualism; unfortunately, they are rather complicated. It is, therefore, necessary to introduce a simpler theory for mutualism. In the present paper, we apply the lattice gas model which corresponds to the mean-field theory of the usual lattice model. The derived equations are cubic and contain only essential features for mutualism. In the case of obligate mutualism, the dynamics exhibits the Allee effect, and it is almost the same as in the male-female systems. In our model, the population sizes never increase infinitely, because our model contains not only intra- but also interspecific competitions. If the density of one species increases disproportionately in respect of its mutual partners, then this might imply downward pressure on the population abundance of the mutual partner species and such feedback would eventually act as a controlling influence on the population abundance of either species. We discuss several assumptions in our model; in particular, if both species can occupy in each cell simultaneously, then the interspecific competition disappears. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Ponto-Caspian gobies are a good example of a territorial species, which can have negative impact on native species with similar biology due to competitive interactions. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential impact of the invasive Ponto-Caspian western tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris on the native stone loach Barbatula barbatula through shelter competition. We used male and female gobies in their reproductive season to test whether they would be more aggressive towards native stone loach, accounting for different light conditions in a limited shelter competition scenario. The results of our study showed that both tested species occupied the shelter mostly during the daylight. Only male goby reduced the shelter occupancy of stone loach despite the fact that interspecific aggressive acts were very rare. It was associated with the nest guarding by male gobies, considering that the study was conducted during their reproductive season. Based on our results, it is possible that, under natural conditions, male tubenose goby would force stone loach to stay away from the shelter, especially in late spring and early summer, when gobies are in reproductive state. This might affect stone loach populations by devoiding them of optimum sites and increasing their exposure to predators.","[Blonska, Dagmara; Grabowska, Joanna] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Ul Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland","Grabowska, J (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Ul Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",joko@biol.uni.lodz.pl,"Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Grabowska, Joanna/K-8305-2013","Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Grabowska, Joanna/0000-0001-9924-0650; Blonska, Dagmara/0000-0002-2200-3347","University of Lodz [5811/E-345/M/2015, 5811/E-345/M/2016]","The study was supported by an internal grant from the University of Lodz (5811/E-345/M/2015, 5811/E-345/M/2016).

Many species that live in ephemeral habitats are relatively more active, grow faster, and metamorphose sooner than those in more permanent habitats, thus enabling them to survive by escaping drying ponds. Species with high activity levels are shown to be superior competitors in temporary ponds, but are at greater risk of predation by visually cued predators. We take a comprehensive approach to testing if the activity-predation paradigm drives community assembly of a four-species guild of larval anurans through field surveys and a series of laboratory experiments quantifying their activity level, anti-predatory responses, swim performance, and escape behavior. Activity level was a good predictor of susceptibility to predation and habitat association for most species in our study, but not all species fit the pattern. Secondary anti-predator mechanisms contributed to differences in susceptibility to predation. Some species were more capable of avoiding predation through swim performance and escape behavior, thus allowing them to occupy a greater range of the water permanency continuum than was predicted by activity level alone. Because performance traits are deeply rooted, evolutionary history plays a major role in determining tadpole performance and life-history traits. Whole-organism performance traits (e.g., swim performance, escape behavior) have not generally been considered in the classic activity-predation paradigm. Our results show that accounting for individual and species-level performance reveals the understudied, yet important role of species-specific performance traits in disentangling the mechanisms driving community assembly.","[Saenz, Daniel] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, Nacogdoches, TX 75965 USA; [Baum, Kristen A.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Fitzgerald, Lee A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX USA; [Fitzgerald, Lee A.] Texas A&M Univ, Biodivers Res & Teaching Collect, College Stn, TX USA; [Schalk, Christopher M.] Stephen F Austin State Univ, Arthur Temple Coll Forestry & Agr, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA","Saenz, D (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, Nacogdoches, TX 75965 USA.",dan.saenz@usda.gov,,,USDA National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"We thank Nancy Koerth for assistance on statistical analyses and critical review of the manuscript.

We conducted the first explicit experimental test of this hypothesis by investigating the organization of positive interactions on New England cobblestone beaches. In this midintertidal community, wave-generated substrate instability and solar stress largely limit marine organisms to the shelter of cordgrass beds. Cordgrass, which can establish and persist without the aid of other foundation species, facilitates a dense assemblage of inhabitants ( e. g., mussels, snails, seaweeds) with roots/rhizomes that stabilize substrate and a dense canopy that baffles waves and provides shade. Within the cordgrass bed community, ribbed mussels further enhance physical conditions and densities of other species ( e. g., amphipods, barnacles) by providing crevice space and hard substrate. We conclude that cordgrass bed communities are hierarchically organized: secondary interactions ( e. g., facilitation by ribbed mussels) play a key role within an assemblage dependent on primary facilitation by the independently successful foundation species cordgrass. Our results identify emergent indirect positive interactions in the form of facilitation cascades, have broad implications for conservation, and help unify existing models of community organization that were developed without considering the fundamental role of positive interactions.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Altieri, AH (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.",altieri@neu.edu; brs@ufl.edu; mark_bertness@brown.edu,"Altieri, Andrew H/P-1738-2017","Altieri, Andrew/0000-0001-7439-8742; Silliman, Brian/0000-0001-6360-650X",,,,71,129,130,0,95,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

In central Oklahoma, these sit-and-wait arthropod predators are restricted by abiotic factors to sheltered cliff bases. A high-density ant lion zone forms an effective ''minefield'' of predation for local ant assemblages. The density of ant-nest entrances and the number of pitfall-trap captures of ant foragers were significantly lower in the ant lion zone than in the adjacent forest or grassland. Differences in ant abundance could not be attributed to differences in thermal microhabitat within and outside the ant lion zone. Over a 24-h period, ants foraged continuously at tuna-fish baits placed on the forest floor, but never utilized baits placed within the ant lion zone. Field behavioral tests with individual ant foragers confirmed that the risk of predation from ant lions was high for common ant species in the assemblage. Among species, predation risk was negatively correlated with worker body mass. Manipulative field experiments tested whether ants use biotic or abiotic cues to avoid ant lion aggregations. Ants foraged readily at baits on the forest floor and baits placed in the center of experimental sand patches, but they avoided baits placed in sand patches that contained ant lions. Ant foraging was also substantially lower in parches from which ant lions had been removed 3 h prior to the start of the experiment. Ant foraging was slightly reduced in patches with artificial ant lion pits that had never contained predators.

Such impacts can affect local biodiversity, relative abundance of host species and structuring of communities and ecosystems. Despite having a firm theoretical basis for the potential effects of parasites on ecosystems, there is a scarcity of experimental data to validate these hypotheses, making our inferences about this topic more circumstantial. To quantitatively test parasites' role in structuring host communities, we set up a controlled, multigenerational mesocosm experiment involving four sympatric freshwater crustacean species that share up to four parasite species. Mesocosms were assigned to either of two different treatments, low or high parasite exposure. We found that the trematode Maritrema poulini differentially influenced the population dynamics of these hosts. For example, survival and recruitment of the amphipod Paracalliope fluviatilis were dramatically reduced compared to other host species, suggesting that parasites may affect their long-term persistence in the community. Relative abundances of crustacean species were influenced by parasites, demonstrating their role in host community structure. As parasites are ubiquitous across all communities and ecosystems, we suggest that the asymmetrical effects we observed are likely widespread structuring forces.","[Friesen, Olwyn C.; Poulin, Robert; Lagrue, Clement] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Goellner, Sarah] Heidelberg Univ, Ctr Integrat Infect Dis, Neuenheimer Feld 344, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Lagrue, Clement] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, CW 405,Biol Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Friesen, OC (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand.",olwynfriesen@gmail.com,,"Friesen, Olwyn/0000-0003-4274-3868; Goellner, Sarah/0000-0002-3300-4273","Department of Zoology, University of Otago","Financial support for this project was provided by the Department of Zoology, University of Otago.",,97,5,5,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,FEB,2020,147,2,,,,,182,193,PII S0031182019001483,10.1017/S0031182019001483,,,12,Parasitology,Parasitology,KR0TU,WOS:000517334000005,31679526,,,,2021-09-27,

Interactions with classical predators (e.g., those not competing for shared resources) can strongly influence nest-site selection, but whether intraguild predation also influences this behavior is unknown. We tested whether risk of predation from an intraguild predator [the diurnal scincid lizard Eutropis (Mabuya) longicaudata] influences nest-site selection by its prey (the nocturnal gecko Gekko hokouensis) on Orchid Island, Taiwan. These two species putatively compete for shared resources, including invertebrate prey and nesting microhabitat, but the larger E. longicaudata also predates G. hokouensis (but not its hard-shelled eggs). Both species nested within a concrete wall containing a series of drainage holes that have either one (closed-in) or two openings (open). In allopatry, E. longicaudata preferred to nest within holes that were plugged by debris (thereby protecting eggs from water intrusion), whereas G. hokouensis selected holes that were open at both ends (facilitating escape from predators). When we experimentally excluded E. longicaudata from its preferred nesting area, G. hokouensis not only nested in higher abundances, but also modified its nest-site selection, such that communal nesting was more prevalent and both open and closed-in holes were used equally. Egg viability was unaffected by the choice of hole type, but was reduced slightly (by 7%) in the predator exclusion area (presumably due to higher local incubation temperatures). Our field experiment demonstrates that intraguild predators can directly influence the nest density of prey by altering maternal nest-site selection behavior, even when the predator and prey are active at different times of day and the eggs are not at risk of predation.","[Huang, Wen-San] Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Taichung, Taiwan; [Pike, David A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Huang, WS (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Taichung, Taiwan.",wshuang@mail.nmns.edu.tw,"Pike, David A/B-2032-2012","Huang, Wen-San/0000-0003-0073-3557","Kuo Wu Hsiu Luan Culture and Education Foundation; National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC96-2621-B-178-002-MY3]; National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan [NMNSHP97-002]","We are grateful to C.

Prey species sharing an enemy (predator or parasitoid) can be linked by apparent competition, but it is unknown whether this process is strong enough to be a community-wide structuring mechanism that could be used to predict future states of diverse food webs. Whether species abundances are spatially coupled by enemy movement across different habitats is also untested. Here, using a field experiment, we show that predicted apparent competitive effects between species, mediated via shared parasitoids, can significantly explain future parasitism rates and herbivore abundances. These predictions are successful even across edges between natural and managed forests, following experimental reduction of herbivore densities by aerial spraying of insecticide over 20 hectares. This result shows that trophic indirect effects propagate across networks and habitats in important, predictable ways, with implications for landscape planning, invasion biology and biological control.","[Frost, Carol M.; Peralta, Guadalupe; Varsani, Arvind; Tylianakis, Jason M.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Rand, Tatyana A.] ARS, USDA, Northern Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA; [Didham, Raphael K.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Didham, Raphael K.] CSIRO Land & Water, Ctr Environm & Life Sci, Underwood Ave, Floreat, WA 6014, Australia; [Varsani, Arvind] Univ Canterbury, Biomol Interact Ctr, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Varsani, Arvind] Univ Cape Town, Struct Biol Res Unit, Dept Clin Lab Sci, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Varsani, Arvind] Univ Florida, Dept Plant Pathol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Varsani, Arvind] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Tylianakis, Jason M.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Frost, Carol M.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Peralta, Guadalupe] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Invest Zonas Aridas, CC 507, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina","Frost, CM; Tylianakis, JM (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.; Tylianakis, JM (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",carol7frost@gmail.com; jason.tylianakis@canterbury.ac.nz,"Peralta, Guadalupe/AAF-2319-2019; Tylianakis, Jason/B-6634-2011","Varsani, Arvind/0000-0003-4111-2415; Tylianakis, Jason/0000-0001-7402-5620",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Education New Zealand; University of Canterbury; Marsden FundRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ) [UOC-0802]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT100100040]; National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa; Rutherford Discovery Fellowship,"We thank Nelson Forests Ltd., Merrill & Ring, Hancock Timber Resource Group, M.

(1980) that the abundance of red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) in western New South Wales is solely due to lack of dingoes (Canis (lypus dingo), and vice versa for neighbouring South Australia. A Dingo Barrier Fence divides the two different ecological systems, which have sheep in New South Wales and cattle in South Australia. This paper re-examines in particular whether there is an environmental gradient across the Fence that was dismissed by Caughley et al. This paper concludes to the contrary, that there is a strong environmental gradient. Our aerial surveys demonstrate significantly that habitats favouring red kangaroos are prevalent in New South Wales today, but are very scarce or absent in South Australian landscapes. Aerial surveys were used in both studies, but designs differed. Caughley et al, flew at right angles across the Fence on paths 28 km apart. Flights would have crossed the south-westerly stream lines rarely. Our flight lanes followed streamlines looking for floodouts, the favourite habitat of red kangaroos. Return lanes went between streamlines sampling other habitats. Counts of red kangaroos seen were made every 1.75 km, with the specific habitat also identified. Three extra factors are invoked in our study. One is that the low annual rainfalls translate into intrinsically low survival rates of pouch-young of red kangaroos, contrary to their abundance in New South Wales today. The other two are related to that current abundance also. There is now evidence for greatly increased run-off of rainfall from catchments onto the open plains in New South Wales. Also present is a very large shallow basin lying between catchments and the Dingo Barrier Fence. Streamlines enter it but none flow past its western rim. The above conclusions were confirmed during subsequent ground surveys over three years. OF eleven species of medium and large vertebrates seen in New South Wales, live were absent in South Australia. Three were kangaroos, and the others were feral pigs and goats. Emus are more abundant in New South Wales also. All of those species would be targets for dingoes, especially as alternate pre)? to rabbits that generate huge eruptions every decade or so. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were: in lower abundance in South Australia with dingoes present, as expected with meso-predator interactions. Feral cats (Felis catus) were in similar numbers on both sides of the Fence for unknown reasons. Competition between rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and sheep for food in New South Wales was shown to significantly reduce rabbit numbers in drought. That rabbits are perennially in lower densities there: than in South Australia mag be due to the higher densities of foxes than in South Australia. Historically, red Kangaroos were rare in the region in the mid-1800s. Their abundance has arisen since European occupation, The species was rare on those open plains, and permanent water was scarce. Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease reached the study-area in 1995. Its impact reduced rabbit populations to a rarity that prevails today on both sides of the Dingo Fence. Predation from dingoes, foes and feral cats may assist continuance of low numbers of rabbits. Pastures, seedling trees and livestock will benefit. as will the kangaroos.","CSIRO, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Newsome, AE (corresponding author), CSIRO, GPO 284, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",alan.newsome@cse.csiro.au,,,,,,50,78,82,0,61,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1036-9872,1834-7541,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2001,23,1,,,,,71,98,,10.1071/RJ01015,,,28,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,450QJ,WOS:000169754400007,,,,,2021-09-27,

Nasonovia ribisnigri (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) are two common pests in Mediterranean lettuce crops, where they occur alongside alternative prey (e.g. Collembola). A semi-field experiment was conducted in an experimental lettuce plot where hoverfly predation on N. ribisnigri, F. occidentalis and Collembola was studied by conventional PCR and qPCR using specific primers, as well as by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in order to reveal other potential trophic interactions. RESULTSTrophic linkages between hoverflies and N. ribisnigri were the strongest both in spring and summer. F. occidentalis and Collembolans were also detected in both seasons, but with less frequency. qPCR detected a higher frequency of consumption than conventional PCR when both tests were run at optimal conditions. NGS analyses showed intraguild predation on other hoverfly species, as well as on anthocorids, spiders and even aphid parasitoids. CONCLUSIONSConventional PCR and qPCR provided important insights into Mediterranean hoverfly species predation on target pest and non-pest prey. NGS gave a complementary approach revealing a broader diet of these predators within the studied ecosystem.

We hypothesized that the willow's response following herbivory affects the entire arthropod community structure on the tree due to changes in plant quality. To examine this hypothesis, we investigated arthropod communities on three willow species, Salix gilgiana, Salix eriocarpa and Salix serissaefolia. In our common garden, cuttings were established in 2003 and experimental treatments were applied in 2005. Damage by a boring caterpillar of a swift moth (Endoclita excrescens) and artificial cutting of 25% stems were applied as partial herbivory within individual trees, and 100% cutting of stems was applied to represent severe herbivory to whole individual trees. These treatments stimulated lateral shoot production depending on damage intensity, resulting in full compensation for biomass loss. Positive relationships were detected between within-tree variation in foliar nitrogen content and overall abundance/species richness of herbivores. Moth boring and 25% cutting increased herbivore abundance and species richness relative to controls. However, we found no significant differences in herbivore abundance and species richness between 100% cut and control trees. Community composition of herbivore species was significantly different between the following three groups: (i) bored and 25% cut; (ii) 100% cut; and (iii) control trees. Changes in community structure of herbivores were likely due to changes in plant quality depending on the intensity of damage. Although total predator abundance and species richness were not significantly different among treatments, community composition of predator species was significantly different among treatments. These results indicate that herbivore-induced willow responses can largely determine the entire arthropod community structure of multitrophic levels due to changes in plant quality. We suggest that heterogeneous resource conditions induced by herbivory within and among plant individuals increase the species diversity of arthropods.","[Utsumi, Shunsuke; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nakamura, Masahiro] Hokkaido Univ, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan","Utsumi, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",shun@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Utsumi, Shunsuke/0000-0003-1558-8073","COEMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","The authors thank A.A.

However, due to anthropogenic degradation of their habitats and predation by or competition with introduced species, most members of the family are now extinct or severely endangered. Based on limited and sporadic collections, the endodontid fauna of the raised coral island of Makatea in the western Tuamotu Archipelago was known to consist of four valid species, Mautodontha (Mautodontha) daedalea (Gould, 1846), Kleokyphus callimus Solem, 1976, K. hypsus Solem, 1976 and Pseudolibera lillianae Solem, 1976, the last three of which were endemic. To these, we add 18 new species based on a reappraisal of museum collections and analysis of abundant new material collected in 2005: M. (M.) domaneschii, M. (M.) virginiae, M. (M.) harperae, M.

The recently collected material also revealed new information on the morphology, intraspecific variation and distribution of the four previously known species, which are here revised and re-described. With 22 recognized taxa, the radiation of endodontids in Makatea is second in species richness only to that of Rapa Iti in the Austral Islands, from where 24 endodontids have been described. Despite intensive field work in Makatea in 2005, only M. (M.) daedalea was found alive. All other Makatean endodontids were represented solely by empty and worn shells and are probably extinct.","[Sartori, Andre F.; Gargominy, Olivier; Fontaine, Benoit] Museum Natl Hist Nat, F-75005 Paris, France","Sartori, AF (corresponding author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, 55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",andrefsartori@gatesscholar.org; gargo@mnhn.fr; fontaine@mnhn.fr,,"Gargominy, Olivier/0000-0001-7807-944X; Sartori, Andre/0000-0003-0682-1646",ANR 6eme extinctionFrench National Research Agency (ANR); Delegation a la Recherche of the government of French Polynesia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"This study is part of project LOSERS, funded by ANR 6eme extinction and by the Delegation a la Recherche of the government of French Polynesia.

Further, the resulting sexual dimorphism can differ between populations adapted to different environments, or among individuals developing under different environmental conditions. In the nine-spine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), males perform nest building, courtship, territory defence and parental care, whereas females perform mate choice and produce eggs. Also, predation-adapted marine and competition-adapted pond populations have diverged in a series of ecologically relevant traits, including the level of phenotypic plasticity. Here, we studied sexual dimorphism in brain size and architecture in nine-spined stickleback from marine and pond populations reared in a factorial experiment with predation and food treatments in a common garden experiment. Males had relatively larger brains, larger telencephala, cerebella and hypothalami (6-16% divergence) than females, irrespective of habitat. Females tended to have larger bulbi olfactorii than males (13%) in the high food treatment, whereas no such difference was found in the low food treatment. The strong sexual dimorphism in brain architecture implies that the different reproductive allocation strategies (behaviour vs. egg production) select for different investments into the costly brains between males and females. The lack of habitat dependence in brain sexual dimorphism suggests that the sex-specific selection forces on brains differ only negligibly between habitats. Although significance of the observed sex-specific brain plasticity in the size of bulbus olfactorius remains unclear, it demonstrates the potential for sex-specific neural plasticity.","[Herczeg, G.] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Behav Ecol Grp, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Herczeg, G.; Valimaki, K.; Gonda, A.; Merila, J.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Helsinki, Finland; [Valimaki, K.] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Monitoring Team, Helsinki, Finland","Herczeg, G (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Behav Ecol Grp, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",gaborherczeg@caesar.elte.hu,"Herczeg, Gabor/AAZ-1661-2021; Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008; Herczeg, Gabor/AAF-9978-2020","Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X; Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072; ","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [128716, s 250435, 263722, 265211]; Hungarian Scientific Research FundOrszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA) [OTKA-K 105517]; Hungarian Academy of SciencesHungarian Academy of Sciences; Finnish Graduate School in Population Genetics; Ella & Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Eemil Aaltonen Foundation; Finnish School in Wildlife Biology, Conservation and Management","We are highly indebted to Goran Englund, Jacquelin DeFaveri, Jenni Hamalainen, Lotta Kvarnemo, Tuomas Leinonen, Pia Rannanen and Pirkko Siikamaki for their help in obtaining the samples, and Mirva Turtiainen, Linda Uoti, Maarit Haataja, Nurul Izza Ab Ghani, Riikka Kaartinen, Joona Lehtomaki and Marika Lilja for their help in fish maintenance.

In the third year the interactions between herbivory and competition were analysed as well. Pre-dispersal seed predation of seed heads was investigated in three adjacent old-fields abandoned for one (P1), 15 (P15) and 40 yr (P40) in the region of Montpellier, France. Fields differed in vegetation cover and floristic composition and also in density acid above-ground biomass of Picris hieracioides plants (from 246 g per plant in P1, 13.3 g in P15, down to 3.3 g in P40, for the first year of study). The cumulative rainfall between January and July, the period of Picris growth, decreased from 1992 to 1994, Moreover, in 1992, three times as much rainfall occurred in May and June - the period of stem elongation - as in 1993 and 1994. As a consequence, environmental stress increased during the study period. Herbivorous invertebrates had a negative effect on the growth and reproduction of individual plants of Picris hieracioides in P15. The effect was not constant with time, being apparent in only two years out of three. These two years (1992 and 1994) had contrasting climatic characteristics, whereas the year with no apparent effect (1993) was climatically intermediate. When herbivory had effects on growth, the insecticide-treated plants had a significantly higher aboveground biomass and produced twice as many seed heads as the control plants. There was no interaction between herbivory and competition. The percentage of damaged seed heads was significantly lower in the Pi-field than in the P40-field. The P15-field had intermediate levels of predation. Predation on seed heads increased whereas biomass and reproductive output decreased between 1992 and 1994 in the three old-fields. Therefore, the results on seed predation (but not for above-ground biomass and reproduction) tend to confirm 'the environmental stress hypothesis' of Mattson & Haack (1987) that states that plants under stress are more liable to be attacked by grazers.","CEFE, CNRS, UPR 9056, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Escarre, J (corresponding author), CEFE, CNRS, UPR 9056, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",escarre@cefe.cnrs-mop.fr,"Serra, F.

We used multiple approaches to assess the role of predation by indigenous whelks in regulating this expansion. B. glandula abundance and distribution were monitored annually while field observations and laboratory experiments assessed the relative predation pressure on B. glandula and the native barnacle Notomegabalanus algicola. In the mid-shore, the whelks Trochia cingulata and Burnupena lagenaria fed on N. algicola most often despite the alien B. glandula covering a mean of 86% of the shore at this site. Lower on the shore, the same feeding pattern was evident, although N. algicola was spatially dominant. Feeding experiments revealed that small (mean +/- SD shell length: 13.9 +/- 0.3 mm) and large (19.6 +/- 0.5 mm) T. cingulata consumed up to 70% more N. algicola than B. glandula, displaying a significant avoidance of the alien. While small (15.5 +/- 0.5 mm) B. lagenaria displayed the same pattern, large individuals (27.7 +/- 0.4 mm) consumed equal numbers of the 2 barnacles. The avoidance of B. glandula may be explained by this species possessing thicker shell and opercular plates than N. algicola, while a narrow margin of vulnerable soft tissue around the circumference of the opercular plates makes the native an attractive prey choice. This study demonstrates that predation-driven biotic resistance has not contained the expansion of B. glandula along the South African coast.","[Robinson, Tamara B.; Pope, Haley R.; Hawken, Lara; Binneman, Carlene] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Robinson, TB (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",trobins@sun.ac.za,"Robinson, Tamara B/I-1806-2019","Robinson, Tamara B/0000-0001-5515-1445","DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion BiologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Stellenbosch University; Department of Botany and Zoology, Stellenbosch University","Funding from the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology is gratefully acknowledged.

In eight 12-ha experimental landscapes, we examined how corridors affect the impact of invertebrate, rodent, and avian seed predators on pokeweed, Phytolacca americana. Over 13 months in 2000 and 2001, we quantified the effects of patch shape, connectivity, and predator type on the number of seeds germinating in the field (germinants), seed removal, and the viability of remaining seeds. Corridors did not affect the number of P. americana germinants in experimental exclosures or the viability of seeds remaining in exclosures. However, corridors affected the removal of seeds in a predator-specific manner: invertebrates removed more seeds in unconnected patches, whereas rodents removed more seeds in connected patches. Seed removal by birds was similar in connected and unconnected patches. Total seed removal by all seed predators was not affected by corridors, because invertebrates removed more seeds where rodents removed fewer seeds, and vice versa. Overall, seed predation significantly reduced the number and viability of remaining seeds, and reduced the number of germinants in 2000 but not in 2001. The abundance of naturally occurring P. americana plants in our experimental patches in 2000 decreased with increasing seed removal from exclosures but was not related to viability or germinants in 2000, suggesting that seed removal may shape the distribution and abundance of this species. Complementary patterns of seed removal by rodents and invertebrates suggest that corridors alter the effects of these predator taxa by changing the relative amounts of edge and core (nonedge) habitats in a patch. Because invertebrates and rodents do not completely overlap in the seeds they consume, corridors may change predation pressure on seeds that are primarily consumed by one predator type, with potential consequences for the composition of plant and seed predator communities.","Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Interdept Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Orrock, JL (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Interdept Grad Program, 124 Sci 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",jorrock@iastate.edu,,,,,,65,69,77,0,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2003,84,10,,,,,2589,2599,,10.1890/02-0439,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,743XR,WOS:000186599300010,,,,,2021-09-27,

In nature, however, stream pools often contain not just sunfish and water striders, but also smaller fish such as minnows. Here, we used factorial experiments in seminatural streams to document the direct and indirect effects of sunfish and fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, on water strider survival and behavior. Sunfish, minnows and gerrids all consume surface prey (here, crickets); thus these three species are potential food competitors. Sunfish eat minnows. Accordingly, the presence of sunfish caused minnows to increase their schooling behavior and shift their activity from the surface toward the bottom substrate. The presence of sunfish was also associated with an increase in the number of missing gerrids, whereas minnows caused relatively little gerrid disappearance. Most interestingly, the presence of minnows decreased the effect of sunfish on gerrid disappearance rates; that is, minnows apparently had an indirect positive effect on water strider survival. We suggest that this indirect positive effect reflects the fact that minnows are alternative prey for sunfish. The effects of sunfish and minnows on gerrid mortality explained the influence of these fish on gerrid behavior. Sunfish caused decreases in male gerrid activity, female availability, mating activity, mating frequency and mating duration. Larger males had a mating advantage over smaller males only in pools with sunfish and no minnows. Sunfish also caused a borderline significant decrease in the large female mating advantage. These results were all observed in previous studies and can be viewed as adaptive responses to predation risk. These patterns were not consistent with the expected effects of sunfish as food competitors with water striders. In contrast, minnows had relatively Little influence on water strider behavior and the few significant effects were the opposite of those of sunfish. Minnows caused increases in female activity and in mating duration, a decrease in the large male mating advantage and an increase in the large female mating advantage. These patterns fit the view that minnows caused an increase in gerrid hunger, i.e., that minnows acted as food competitors with gerrids. Finally, planned contrasts against controls showed that, in the presence of both sunfish and minnows, water striders showed no significant behavioral responses to fish (i.e., gerrid behavior in pools with sunfish and minnows did not significantly differ from behavior in fishless pools). The most likely mechanism explaining this pattern is a dilution of sunfish predation risk due to the presence of minnows serving as alternative prey for sunfish.",,"Sih, A (corresponding author), UNIV KENTUCKY,TH MORGAN SCH BIOL SCI,CTR ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV,LEXINGTON,KY 40506, USA.",,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,42,26,26,0,6,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1996,105,2,,,,,179,188,,10.1007/BF00328544,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TV593,WOS:A1996TV59300006,28307080,,,,2021-09-27,

The aim of this study is to understand if the exotic crayfish acts as river shrimp predator and if both species share the same type of microhabitat. We performed laboratory experiments to study predation and conducted field work in the river Sorraia to verify the microhabitat distribution of both species. Laboratory experiments demonstrated significant predation on river shrimp for crayfish with a cephalothorax length (CT) over 24 mm. The average daily consumption increases with crayfish CT to a maximum of 0.8 shrimps at 44 mm. Field work confirmed that both species share the same microhabitats although with small differences e. g. on the water quality variables such as conductivity and the percentage of oxygen saturation. These microhabitats are shallow pools with abundant aquatic vegetation with no preference for the type of substrate. In the field, both crayfish density and its cephalothorax length are negatively correlated with shrimp densities. In conclusion, P. clarkii can predate A. desmarestii and the major impacts are expected at high densities of large sized crayfish.","[Banha, F.; Anastacio, P.

Using data from real-world experiments to inform a simulation, individual behaviors are linked to density-dependent population processes. The prominent emergent property is density-dependent exposure to predation. Depending on the population size and the availability of refugia, different aspects of the competitive behaviors drive the density-dependent effect.

The percentage of time spent foraging was higher when a Great Tit was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species rather than with another Great Tit or a member of the dominant species. When a bird was solitary, time spent foraging was less than when it was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species, and greater than when it was with one belonging to the dominant species. The proportion of time spent vigilant did not differ between Great Tits that foraged with an individual from a dominant species or a subordinate species or with a conspecific, but was higher for solitary birds. Vigilance time of solitary Great Tits, Nuthatches, and three other Parus species was not negatively correlated with interspecific dominance status. In these small passerines, vigilance does not seem to be directed towards the detection of a competitor species.

We review and formalize several patch-use models from which we derive predictions for how the degree of coupling (from the predators' perspective) between nesting guilds (defined as species nesting within a vegetation stratum) affects the outcome of shared predation. We then determine which model best applies to nest predation on woodland songbirds and artificial nests by a natural population of raccoons. Using artificial nests, we showed that increasing the density of nests placed either in shrubs or on the ground increased overall predation (i.e., proportion of nests) on both types. We also tested for apparent competition between American robin and wood thrush, two coexisting woodland songbirds that commonly nest within the shrub stratum. Nest predation increased for wood thrushes but not robins as the combined density of robin and thrush nests within two individual substrate types, Lonicera and Rhamnus, increased. Thus, we documented apparent competition both within and among nesting guilds. We discuss the possible relevance of this interaction in determining species diversity, particularly in the light of increasing generalist nest predators through anthropogenically driven changes in human-altered landscapes.","Univ Illinois, Dept Sci Biol, Lisle, IL 60532 USA; Morton Arboretum, Lisle, IL 60532 USA","Schmidt, KA (corresponding author), Inst Ecosyst Studies, Box AB, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA.",,"Whelan, Christopher J/H-4856-2019","Whelan, Christopher J/0000-0001-7511-2603",,,,46,58,60,0,32,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5801 S ELLIS AVENUE, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

However, experimental studies examining the importance of apparent competition in the field are sparse, especially in plant-herbivore systems. In this study, I examined the role of a beetle herbivore, Ery-nephala maritima, in mediating the indirect effects of an abundant host plant, Salicornia europaea, on a less common host species, Atriplex patula var. hastata, in New England salt marshes. To examine these relationships, I manipulated plant density (plants with vs. without neighbors) and composition (conspecific neighbors vs. Salicornia neighbors) surrounding focal Atriplex plants, as well as the presence or absence of herbivores in a field experiment. Densities of both beetle eggs and larvae were significantly greater in plots with Salicornia, suggesting that its presence increases patch location or selection by herbivores. Higher insect densities resulted in significantly higher levels of herbivore damage to Atriplex within Salicornia-addition plots compared with high- and low-density Atriplex plots. Thus the identity, and not just density, of neighboring plants is important in determining levels of herbivory. Increased herbivore damage in Salicornia-addition plots resulted in a concomitant decrease in Atriplex survival and reproductive output. Furthermore, the negative effect of Salicornia on Atriplex survival and fruit production only occurred in the presence of herbivores, indicating that competitive effects are indirect rather than direct. Thus, Salicornia has a strong apparent competitive effect on Atriplex. Cross-site surveys suggested that the pattern of increased herbivore damage to Atriplex associated with increases in local Salicornia density is common and widespread. Overall, the results suggest that the apparent competitive effect of Salicornia is likely a major determinant of patterns of Atriplex abundance both between habitat patches and across marsh zones.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Rand, TA (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",,,,,,,46,51,53,0,46,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2003,84,6,,,,,1517,1526,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1517:HACBTS]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,706KB,WOS:000184451900021,,,,,2021-09-27,

It has been proposed that their presence is necessary for positively shaping the structure and functioning of ecosystems. We evaluated this hypothesis using the case of the world's largest parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), a globally imperiled species. We used direct observation, animal tracking, and computer simulations to examine the diverse routes through which B. muricatum affects the diversity, dispersal, relative abundance, and survival of the corals that comprise the foundation of reef ecosystems. Our results suggest that this species can influence reef building corals in both positive and negative ways. Field observation and simulation outputs indicated that B. muricatum reduced the abundance of macroalgae that can outcompete corals, but they also feed directly on corals, decreasing coral abundance, diversity, and colony size. B. muricatum appeared to facilitate coral advancement by mechanically dispersing coral fragments and opening up bare space for coral settlement, but they also damaged adult corals and remobilized a large volume of potentially stressful carbonate sediment. The impacts this species has on reefs appears to be regulated in part by its abundancethe effects of B. muricatum were more intense in simulation scenarios populated with high densities of these fish. Observations conducted in regions with high and low predator (e.g., sharks) abundance generated results that are consistent with the hypothesis that these predators of B. muricatum may play a role in governing their abundance; thus, predation may modulate the intensity of the effects they have on reef dynamics. Overall our results illustrate that functionally unique and threatened species may not have universally positive impacts on ecosystems and that it may be necessary for environmental managers to consider the diverse effects of such species and the forces that mediate the strength of their influence.

Functional genetic work in IGP is even more limited, but its application can help answer a range of questions related to ultimate and proximate causes of this behavior. Here, we integrate behavioral assays and transcriptomic analysis of facultative predation in a blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) to evaluate the prevalence, effect, and correlated gene expression of facultative predation by the invasive species Chrysomya rufifacies. Field work observing donated human cadavers indicated facultative predation by C. rufifacies on the native blow fly Cochliomyia macellaria was rare under undisturbed conditions, owing in part to spatial segregation between species. Laboratory assays under conditions of starvation showed predation had a direct fitness benefit (i.e., survival) to the predator. As a genome is not available for C. rufifacies, a de novo transcriptome was developed and annotated using sequence similarity to Drosophila melanogaster. Under a variety of assembly parameters, several genes were identified as being differentially expressed between predators and nonpredators of this species, including genes involved in cell-to-cell signaling, osmotic regulation, starvation responses, and dopamine regulation. Results of this work were integrated to develop a model of the processes and genetic regulation controlling facultative predation.","[Pimsler, Meaghan L.; Saenz, Sunday; Tomberlin, Jeffery K.; Tarone, Aaron M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Pimsler, Meaghan L.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Box 870344, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Sze, Sing-Hoi] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, College Stn, TX USA; [Saenz, Sunday] FAA, Fed Govt Off, Tulsa, OK USA; [Fu, Shuhua] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Fu, Shuhua] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, St Louis, MO USA","Pimsler, ML (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Box 870344, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",mlpimsler@gmail.com,"Pimsler, Meaghan L/U-2765-2018","Tarone, Aaron/0000-0003-0965-7634; Pimsler, Meaghan/0000-0002-3783-8777",National Institute of Justice [2012-DN-BX-K024]; Texas AgriLife Genomics Seed grants; Texas AAMP;M AgriLife Research; Whole Systems Genomics Initiative Catalyst,"National Institute of Justice, Grant/Award Number: 2012-DN-BX-K024; Whole Systems Genomics Initiative Catalyst; Texas AgriLife Genomics Seed grants; Texas A&M AgriLife Research funding",,77,3,3,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Feeding rates (FRs) of different instars of C. pengoi on Eurytemora affinis, a dominant copepod species, were determined experimentally. The FRs of C. pengoi varied from 0.7 to 4.8 prey predator(-1) d(-1) and were significantly higher in older instars. Based on the experimental results and long-term zooplankton abundance data from the Gulf of Finland, we estimated the in situ predation rates. Our results imply that at maximum abundance, the C. pengoi population feeding in dense prey patches could consume as many as 10(5) E. affinis m(-3) d(-1). This could explain the observed drastic decrease in copepod abundances in the eastern Gulf of Finland, the region with the highest C. pengoi abundance after the expansion of this species. Such a decline may strengthen food competition between other zooplanktivores, i.e. planktivorous fish and mysids, feeding on the same copepod prey in regions where C, pengoi may reach high abundances. In the Gulf of Finland, especially in the eastern parts, a collapse of E. affinis, a key species in the pelagic system, would cause major changes in virtually all trophic levels, because the food web structure is simple with only a few species of zooplankton, planktivores, and piscivores.","[Lehtiniemi, Maiju] Finnish Inst Marine Res, Helsinki 00561, Finland; [Gorokhova, Elena] Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Lehtiniemi, M (corresponding author), Finnish Inst Marine Res, POB 2, Helsinki 00561, Finland.",maiju.lehtiniemi@fimr.fi,"Lehtiniemi, Maiju/AAN-6012-2020","Gorokhova, Elena/0000-0002-4192-6956",,,,34,23,26,0,14,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In particular, nest attendance has several benefits associated with relatively higher survival rates, lower vulnerability to predation and parasitism, and faster development rates. The quality of shelters matters, and adults of many species have to compete for suitable shelters. Here, we studied whether shelter type for brooding and egg protection from predation could be a determinant of competition among adults in the cephalopod Octopus tehuelchus. To this end, we (1) assessed the abundance of different types of shelters and preference under field and laboratory conditions, (2) tested the effect of intraspecific competition for shelters, (3) estimated density of potential sources of embryo mortality, and (4) determined the role of female protection in egg survival against predators. We found that in areas where shelters for development are scarce, females compete with males for the most suitable shelters. Fecundity depends on the female size, and shelters with higher volume are preferably selected by females. Excluding the brooding female from shelters resulted in increased egg mortality due to predation by octopus males and removal by chitons. We suggest that, in this species, shelter availability poses a constraint to brooding and affects total parental investment in reproduction and predation risk on eggs. This constraint may also take place in other marine invertebrates with similar life history traits, especially in areas where shelter is limited.","[Narvarte, Maite; Alberto Gonzalez, Raul; Storero, Lorena] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Narvarte, Maite; Alberto Gonzalez, Raul; Storero, Lorena] Univ Nacl Comahue, Escuela Super Ciencias Marinas, Inst Biol Marina & Pesquera Almirante Storni, RA-8520 San Antonio Oeste, Argentina; [Fernandez, Miriam] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Estn Costera Invest Marinas de Las Cruces, Santiago, Chile; [Fernandez, Miriam] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile","Narvarte, M (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Av Rivadavia 1917,C1033AAJ, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mnarvarte@gmail.com,,"Storero, Lorena Pia/0000-0001-5304-6203",Universidad Nacional del Comahue; Fisheries Directorate of Rio Negro province,"We thank the many colleagues who helped us in our study: I.

While several studies have reported on predator aggregations following disturbance events, few studies have investigated the mechanisms and interactive effects of predation and physical disturbance on prey survival in shallow soft-sediment habitats. In this study the interactive effects of sediment resuspension and predation by two contrasting epibenthic predator species were tested on the survival of the amphipod Corophium volutator in a laboratory experiment. The shrimp Crangon crangon and juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa were used as predators, both numerical dominants in shallow soft sediments on the Swedish west coast. In addition we quantified epibenthic predator aggregation in the field following small-scale disturbances. In the laboratory, synergistic negative effects of predation and non-lethal disturbance on Corophium survival were found with both predator species, and rapid aggregation of several mobile epibenthic predator species following disturbance was demonstrated in the field. Abundances of C. crangon, the numerically dominant predator in the field, were doubled in disturbed patches within 2 min following disturbance. Our study emphasises the importance of considering episodic small-scale disturbances when interpreting predation effects and trophic interactions in shallow soft-sediment systems.

Both fish species fed on Daphnia pulex in 1980 and growth was rapid; prey biomass per gram of fish was 2-12 times higher for white perch than for yellow perch. In 1987, white perch consumed up to three times more prey biomass than yellow perch, but the subsequent disappearance of D. pulex caused both fish species to switch to macroinvertebrates and growth of both species declined. Between 1977 and 1987, mean weights and specific growth rates of white perch exceeded yellow perch by October in all years, and weights of white perch were closely tied to the density of D. pulex in late summer-early fall (Spearman's rank correlation = 0.58, P = 0.07). Diet overlap for age-0 white and yellow perch was high when D. pulex was present, and the potential for interspecific competition was greatest when these fish were similar in length. Because of a prolonged spawning period, age-0 white perch had a wide range in lengths, which enabled them to feed on a broad size range of prey. As a result, predation on D. pulex by white perch was exerted over a wider size range than was exerted by yellow perch. Such circumstances may allow daphnids to persist when age-0 white perch are abundant. Consequently, competitive interactions between young white and yellow perch appear to be assymmetric, because the ability of large cohorts of yellow perch to collapse Daphnia pulex populations has greater effect on white perch growth than large cohorts of white perch have on yellow perch growth.","CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NAT RESOURCES, BIOL FIELD STN, 900 SHACKELTON POINT RD, BRIDGEPORT, NY 13030 USA",,,,,,,,33,57,58,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

On the one hand, increasing evidence suggests that many plant populations are seed limited, implying that seed predators could reduce plant abundance. On the other hand, it is generally uncertain Whether the Magnitude of seed limitation imposed by granivores is strong enough to overcome density-dependent processes that could compensate for seed loss at later stages. We examined the impact of seed predation by small mammals, primarily deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), Oil seedling recruitment and Subsequent plant establishment of two perennial grassland forbs in western Montana, USA: Lupinus sericeus (Fabaceae) and Lithospermum ruderale (Boraginaceae). The experiment combined graded densities of seed addition for each species with it small-mammal exclusion treatment. Seedling recruitment and plant establishment were monitored in the experimental plots for Lip to three years. For both species, small-mammal exclusion increased the total number of seedlings that emerged, and these effects were still significant three years after seed addition, resulting ill greater numbers of established plants inside exclosures than in control plots. We also found evidence of seed limitation, with increasing density of seeds added leading to increased numbers of seedlings. Results from seed addition and small-mammal exclusion experiments ill later years also revealed significant impacts of small mammals on seedling emergence. These results Suggest that granivores can have potentially important impacts in limiting forb abundance in grasslands communities.","[Bricker, Mary; Pearson, Dean; Maron, John] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA","Bricker, M (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",mary.bricker@mso.umt.edu,,,"NSF EPSCoRNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [EPS0346458]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [GK-12 (03-38165)]; National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-35101-16040]; Mclntire-Stennis; Bureau of Land Management","We thank the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management For allowing us to conduct experiments on their protected sites.

In coastal Newfoundland, Canada, capelin (Mallotus villosus), a key forage fish, migrates inshore to spawn during the summer, resulting in a dramatic shift in prey availability. During July-August 2015-2017, we examined the numerical and behavioral responses of procellarid (Great Shearwater [Ardenna gravis], Sooty Shearwater [A. grisea], Northern Fulmar [Fuimarus glacialis]), and gull species (Herring Gull [Larus argentatus], Great Black-backed Gull [L. marinus]) to fish offal under varying capelin availability as well as flock size and composition using an at-sea experiment on the northeast Newfoundland coast. The experiment consisted of providing offal every 30 s (10-min experimental period), along with 10-min control periods before and after. We recorded the species-specific number of birds on the water, the number of birds simultaneously attempting to capture offal, and the number of successful attempts (foraging success). The number of birds on the water was lower during high capelin availability for all species, except for Northern Fulmar. The number of conspecifics simultaneously attempting to capture offal increased with the number of conspecifics on the water, but plateaued at different numbers (4-17) for most species. The species-specific proportion of successful attempts (i.e. foraging success) varied with flock size and composition (i.e. number of conspecifics, heterospecifics, species). Foraging success of Herring Gulls and fulmars were moderately affected by flock size and composition, suggesting that they may be dominant competitors. Findings suggest that seabirds rely more heavily on supplemental food sources, such as fisheries discards and offal, when natural prey availability declines, potentially resulting in a higher risk of by-catch during fisheries activities as forage fish stocks decline.","[Maynard, Laurie D.; Carvalho, Paloma C.; Davoren, Gail K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada","Maynard, LD (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",maynardl07@gmail.com,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2014-06290, 470195-2015, 486208-2016, 501154-2017]; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program grants (2015-2017); Manitoba Graduate Fellowship; Science without Border, CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel [001203/2013-04]","This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (2014-06290) to G.K.D.; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Ship Time Grants (470195-2015, 486208-2016, 501154-2017) to G.K.D.; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program grants (2015-2017) to G.K.D.; Manitoba Graduate Fellowship to L.D.M., and Science without Border, CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (001203/2013-04) to P.C.C.",,44,4,4,2,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0004-8038,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,JAN,2020,137,1,,,,,,,,10.1093/auk/ukz062,,,13,Ornithology,Zoology,LQ7PY,WOS:000535192600003,,Bronze,,,2021-09-27,

Models predict that coexistence of prey species with different competitive abilities can be achieved if inferior resource competitors are less susceptible to predation and if productivity and/or predation pressure are at intermediate levels. Hence, predator effects on prey diversity are predicted to be highly context dependent: enhancing diversity from low to intermediate levels of productivity or predation and reducing diversity of prey at high levels of productivity or predation. While several studies have examined the interactive effects of herbivory and productivity on primary producer diversity, experimental studies of such effects in predator-prey systems are rare. We tested these predictions using an aquatic field mesocosm experiment in which initial density of the zooplankton predator Notonecta undulata and productivity were manipulated to test their interactive effects on diversity of seven zooplankton, cladoceran species that were common in surrounding ponds. Two productivity levels were imposed via phosphorus enrichment at levels comparable to low and intermediate levels found within neighboring natural ponds. We used open systems to allow for natural dispersal and behaviorally-mediated numerical responses by the flight-capable predator. Effects of predators on zooplankton diversity depended on productivity level. At low and high productivity, prey species richness declined while at high productivity it showed a unimodal relationship with increasing the predator density. Effects of treatments were weaker when using Pielou's evenness index or the inverse Simpson index as measures of prey diversity. Our findings are generally consistent with model predictions in which predators can facilitate prey coexistence and diversity at intermediate levels of productivity and predation intensity. Our work also shows that the functional form of the relationship between prey diversity and predation intensity can be complex and highly dependent on environmental context.","[Asgari, Mitra; Steiner, Christopher F.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 5047 Gullen Mall, Detroit, MI 48202 USA","Asgari, M (corresponding author), Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 5047 Gullen Mall, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",mitra.asgari@wayne.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354063],This research was supported by NSF grant DEB-1354063 to CFS.

Although there is clear evidence supporting the existence of trophic cascades, the mechanisms driving this important dynamic are less clear. Trophic cascades could arise through direct population-level effects, in which predators prey on herbivores, thereby decreasing the abundance of herbivores that impact plant trophic levels. Trophic cascades could also arise through indirect behavioral-level effects, in which herbivore prey shift their foraging behavior in response to predation risk. Such behavioral shifts can result in reduced feeding time and increased starvation risk, again lowering the impact of herbivores on plants. We evaluated the relative importance of these two mechanisms, using field experiments in an old-field system composed of herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores, and spider predators. We created two treatments, Risk spiders that had their chelicerae glued, and Predation spiders that remained unmanipulated. We then systematically evaluated the impacts of these predator manipulations at behavioral, population, and food web scales in experimental mesocosms. At the behavioral level, grasshoppers did not distinguish between Risk spiders and Predation spiders. Grasshoppers exhibited significant shifts in feeding-time budget in the presence of spiders vs. when alone. At the grasshopper population level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments caused the same level of grasshopper mortality, which was significantly higher than mortality in a control without spiders, indicating that the predation effects were compensatory to risk effects. At the food web level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments decreased the impact grasshoppers had on grass biomass, supporting the existence of a trophic cascade. Moreover, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments produced statistically similar effects, again indicating that predation effects on trophic dynamics were compensatory to risk effects. We conclude that indirect effects resulting from antipredator behavior can produce trophic-level effects-that are similar in form and strength to those generated by direct predation events.",,"Schmitz, OJ (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH FORESTRY & ENVIRONM STUDIES,370 PROSPECT ST,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511, USA.",,"Beckerman, Andrew P/D-3020-2011","Beckerman, Andrew P./0000-0002-4797-9143",,,,78,588,596,6,359,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1997,78,5,,,,,1388,1399,,,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XK929,WOS:A1997XK92900011,,,,,2021-09-27,

Lifetime food consumption per individual (i.e., foraging success) strongly correlated with mean body size of adult females and mean fecundity in populations. Also, there was a positive correlation between foraging success and population density. Since foraging success reflected potential prey availability in the habitat, food resource appeared to be a limiting factor for populations in this spider. Mean fecundity per individual correlated with population density of the following year, suggesting that decreased reproduction is a major component of food limitation on population density. Consistent differences in mean body size between particular sites were observed over years, while such difference was less obvious in density. Thus, ranking of food abundance among habitats seems to be predictable between years.

Indirect effects, as when antagonistic or mutualistic interactions restrict geographic range and thereby elevate extinction risk, are probably widespread and may flow in both directions, as when species- or organismic-level factors increase extinction risk or speciation probabilities. Apparent contradictions across scales and levels have been neglected, including (1) the individualistic geographic shifts of species on centennial and millennial timescales versus evidence for fine-tuned coevolutionary relationships; (2) the extensive and dynamic networks of interactions faced by most species versus the evolution of costly enemy-specific defenses and finely attuned mutualisms; and (3) the macroevolutionary lags often seen between the origin and the diversification of a clade or an evolutionary novelty versus the rapid microevolution of advantageous phenotypes and the invasibility of most communities. Resolution of these and other cross-level tensions presumably hinges on how organismic interactions impinge on genetic population structures, geographic ranges, and the persistence of incipient species, but generalizations are not yet possible. Paleontological and neontological data are both incomplete and so the most powerful response to these problems will require novel integrative approaches. Promising research areas include more realistic approaches to modeling and empirical analysis of large-scale diversity dynamics of ostensibly competing clades; spatial and phylogenetic dissections of clades involved in escalatory dynamics (where prey respond evolutionarily to a broad and shifting array of enemies); analyses of the short- versus long-term consequences of mutualistic symbioses; and fuller use of abundant natural experiments on the evolutionary impacts of ecosystem engineers.","Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Jablonski, D (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",djablons@uchicago.edu,,,,,,392,170,172,4,117,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,APR,2008,62,4,,,,,715,739,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00317.x,,,25,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,283MS,WOS:000254640900001,18387075,,,,2021-09-27,

The vast stretch of intertidal habitat opens up during the low tide, and is monopolized by a single naticid species which preys extensively on intertidal taxa. The predator, Natica tigrina, wades through the soft sediments and ambushes on epi- or infaunal prey. There were reports on naticid subaerial hunting, where the workers made vivid observations, but only in few instances quantified different aspects of predation. Detailed quantitative analyses of the present study revealed that N. tigrina attacks opportunistically on all infaunal and epifaunal intertidal bivalve and gastropod prey taxa. Drilling frequencies ranged from 9.70% to 67.67% with no apparent relation with relative abundances of the taxa. High drilling frequency on conspecific predation perhaps suggested elimination of the potential competitor as well as a profitable prey. Behavioral data of predation, i.e., stereotypy of site and size of drillholes on prey shells and low prey effectiveness indicated that the predator was highly efficient. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Competition-defence trade-offs have long been thought to promote plant coexistence and increase species diversity. However, insights from modern coexistence theory clarify that such trade-offs alone cannot sustain coexistence. Coexistence also requires stabilising niche differences and the ability of competitor populations to persist under consumer pressure. Despite the breadth of potential consequences of competition-defence trade-offs, we have little mechanistic understanding of how they affect diversity in natural communities. 2. We investigated the effects of seed harvesting by ants on coexistence in an annual plant community. We parameterised a model of plant competitive population dynamics with data from two field experiments: (a) plant demographic rates and competition coefficients determined by growing plants alone and against intra- and interspecific competitor density gradients; (b) plant fitness losses to ant consumers determined by measuring seed removal from experimental depots. We tested for a trade-off between a plant species' demographic potential and its susceptibility to consumption and then determined the bounds of ant effects on pairwise and multispecies coexistence by comparing mod& projections with and without seed consumption. 3. Ants harvested seeds of all plant species, but they strongly preferred the competitively superior large seeded species, inducing a competition-defence trade-off. Unequal seed loss to ants changed competition-based fitness hierarchies, affecting both the number and identities of plant species pairs that were predicted to coexist compared to a scenario without ants. The trade-off most often prevented coexistence by severely disadvantaging the superior competitor or excluding species directly through overconsumption, and a simulated reduction in the overall consumption rate opened few additional opportunities for coexistence. Ant exacerbation of average fitness differences was particularly disruptive to multispecies coexistence, where niche differences were insufficient to stabilise the coexistence of plant triplets and quadruplets. 4. Synthesis. Our results show that the presence of a competition-defence trade-off in a community with stabilising niche differences does not always increase diversity. Instead, the full range of diversity outcomes-positive and negative changes in species number and changes in the identity of the dominant-are possible. Taken together, our results support the emerging paradigm that consumers have wide ranging impacts on plant diversity and suggest that variation in consumer pressure may be an important driver of large-scale diversity patterns.","[Petry, William K.; Levine, Jonathan M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kandlikar, Gaurav S.; Kraft, Nathan J.

The commercial glyphosate-based herbicide Accord is approved for use in wetlands and ponds because it is designed to be safer to aquatic wildlife than other herbicide formulations (e.g., Roundup or Atrazine); however, field experiments are needed to determine whether there are direct, indirect, or sublethal effects on amphibians or effects on wetland community structure. We conducted a replicated field experiment in constructed ponds to test for both the effects of Accord and predator (Tiger Salamanders, Ambystoma tigrinum) density on amphibians and aquatic invertebrates. Herbicide treatment had significant density-dependent effects on Tiger Salamander growth, development, and survival. The survival of anurans and aquatic invertebrates was also affected by herbicide treatment and predator density. At certain Tiger Salamander densities, the community structure was altered such that some species became more common with herbicide treatment, whereas others became less common. Behavior assays of salamander larvae suggest that herbicide treatment alters predator-prey relationships in the experimental pond communities. These results suggest that competition and predation may mediate indirect effects of this herbicide on the aquatic fauna.

Understanding the community-wide distribution of interaction strengths is vital, given that communities dominated by weak interactions may be more stable and resistant to invasion. In the oceans, previous studies have reported log-normal distributions of per capita interaction strength. We estimated the distribution of predator-prey interaction strengths within a subtidal speciose herbivore community (45 species). Laboratory experiments were used to determine maximum per capita interaction strengths for eight species of herbivores (including amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and sea urchins) that graze on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) microscopic stages. We found that maximum per capita interaction strength saturated as a function of individual herbivore biomass, likely caused by predator/prey size thresholds. Incorporating this nonlinearity, we predicted maximum per capita interaction strength for the remaining herbivore species. The resulting distribution of per capita interaction strengths was bimodal, in striking contrast to previous reports from other communities. Although small herbivores often had per capita interaction strengths similar to larger herbivores, their tendency to have greater densities in the field increased their potential impact as grazers. These results indicate that previous conclusions about the distributions of interaction strength in natural communities are not general, and that intermediate-sized predators can under realistic circumstances represent the most effective consumers in natural communities.","Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Sala, E (corresponding author), Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,,"Graham, Michael/0000-0003-0731-1111",,,,44,123,128,0,38,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Autotomy, or the voluntary shedding of body parts, is an extreme antipredator behaviour used by species in more than 100 animal families. Despite the long-standing observation that the propensity for autotomy can vary extensively among populations, how ecology might drive such variation is still poorly understood. 2. We tested the hypothesis that the variation in this extreme behaviour reflects the balance between costs and benefits determined by the local ecological environment. We focused on three ecological factors that can influence the cost-benefit dynamics of autotomy: predation, male-male competition, and food abundance. 3. Using tail autotomy in lizards as the study system, we first built an individual-based model to show that environments with high predation, high food abundance, and low male-male competition favoured individuals that autotomized more readily. Moreover, predation likely maintained the ability to autotomize, whereas male-male competition and food abundance fine-tuned the propensity for autotomy. 4. We used field data from five side-blotched lizard populations to verify model results, as well as to test the explanatory power of our model. Field data supported simulation results regarding the roles predation, male-male competition and food abundance. Our model also successfully explained the variation in the propensity for tail autotomy among those five lizard populations. Our approach can be easily extended to examine how ecology might drive adaptive variation in autotomy in other taxa, as well as any traits that share similar cost-benefit dynamics.","[Kuo, Chi-Yun; Irschick, Duncan J.] Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Irschick, Duncan J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Kuo, Chi-Yun] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Kuo, CY (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.; Kuo, CY (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",kuochiyun@gmail.com,"Kuo, Chi-Yun/AAI-9708-2020; Kuo, Chi-Yun/AAL-2829-2020","Kuo, Chi-Yun/0000-0002-8533-9358",Natural History Collections Grant from the University of Massachusetts Amherst; Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant from the University of Massachusetts Amherst; Human Frontiers Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program,"We offer sincere thanks to Daniel Moen, Teri Orr, Casey Gilman and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

Depending on the successional stage at which a new species arrives, it can either rapidly colonize in large numbers or its colonization success might be suppressed by resident species. In order to assess the roles of (i) initial colonization and (ii) subsequent species interactions on community development, we examined the succession of fouling assemblages that established on artificial substrata during two different seasonal periods, i.e. austral winter/spring and spring/summer. At 16 weeks of age communities that were initiated in different seasons varied significantly in composition and diversity. During each period (winter/spring and spring/summer), multispecies fouling consortia of different ages (hereafter termed old and young) were reciprocally transplanted between two neighbouring study sites and their succession was documented. After 8 weeks of transplantation communities of different ages maintained their differences in diversity even in the face of environmental change. However, during winter/spring the spreading of the dominant species P. chilensis caused more rapid convergence between all communities at both sites. During the spring/summer period, the high initial abundances of the weak competitor Bugula neritina led to the maintenance of differences between resident and transplanted assemblages within each site. Later colonizers, including the dominant competitor P. chilensis, however, could recruit onto B. neritina and started to spread in the communities. These results suggest that the early and intermediate succession of fouling communities in highly productive marine environments such as the Humboldt Current System is driven by the temporal and spatial variability of propagule supply, while the long-term stability of these communities depends on the identity of colonizers and their competitiveness.

When exotic herbivores invade new environments, they have the potential to interfere with native predator-prey relationships. This interference can be indirect, via changes induced in native host plants, and may have cascading consequences at the community level. Here, we investigate the impact of the presence of an exotic generalist insect herbivore, the African cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis, on the outcome of native tritrophic interactions between the plant Brassica rapa, the herbivore Pieris brassicae and its parasitoid Cotesia glomerata. 2. In olfactometer choice tests, plants damaged by S. littoralis and plants damaged by both S. littoralis and P. brassicae were consistently less attractive to the parasitoid than plants damaged by P. brassicae alone. Chemical analyses revealed that B. rapa volatiles typically induced by S. littoralis dominated the headspace in case of dual herbivore infestation. 3. In behavioural observations in petri dishes, C. glomerata wasps mistakenly attacked S. littoralis larvae significantly more often when P. brassicae was present, and attacks on both herbivores were comparable in terms of time (attack duration) and energy investment (number of eggs injected). Successful parasitism of S. littoralis was never observed, but larvae exposed to C. glomerata for 24 h exhibited reduced survivorship, possibly as a result of failed parasitism attempts. 4. In tents with herbivore-infested B. rapa plants, the presence of S. littoralis did not have an effect on the parasitism rates of P. brassicae by C. glomerata, regardless of whether the two species were on the same or on different plants. Field experiments in newly invaded environments are necessary to evaluate the realized impact of S. littoralis. 5. Synthesis. Our study illustrates that exotic herbivores can impact native tritrophic interactions associated with Brassica rapa, even if they cannot be used as prey by native natural enemies. The mechanisms behind such effects, in particular chemical interference with foraging cues via changes in herbivore-induced plant volatiles, have the potential to be quite general, and their long-term effects on native communities should not be underestimated.","[Chabaane, Yosra; Laplanche, Diane; Turlings, Ted C.

Multiple factors are known to directly influence breeding success in territorial songbirds. For example, greater food availability and fewer predators can have direct effects on breeding success. However, many of these same habitat factors can also result in higher conspecific density that may ultimately reduce breeding success through density dependence. In this case, there is a negative indirect effect of habitat on breeding success through its effects on conspecific density and territory size. Therefore, a key uncertainty facing land managers is whether important habitat attributes directly influence breeding success or indirectly influence breeding success through territory size. We used radio-telemetry, point-counts, vegetation sampling, predator observations, and insect sampling over two years to provide data on habitat selection of a steeply declining songbird species, the Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis). These data were then applied in a hierarchical path modeling framework and an AIC model selection approach to determine the habitat attributes that best predict breeding success. Canada Warblers had smaller territories in areas with high shrub cover, in the presence of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), at shoreline sites relative to forest-interior sites and as conspecific density increased. Breeding success was lower for birds with smaller territories, which suggests competition for limited food resources, but there was no direct evidence that food availability influenced territory size or breeding success. The negative relationship between shrub cover and territory size in our study may arise because these specific habitat conditions are spatially heterogeneous, whereby individuals pack into patches of preferred breeding habitat scattered throughout the landscape, resulting in reduced territory size and an associated reduction in resource availability per territory. Our results therefore highlight the importance of considering direct and indirect effects for Canada warblers; efforts to increase the amount of breeding habitat may ultimately result in lower breeding success if habitat availability is limited and negative density dependent effects occur.","[Flockhart, D.

These decisions are influenced by environmental variation at spatial scales ranging from landscapes to local foraging patches. In a field experiment, the effects of seed patch variation across three spatial scales on seed removal by western harvester ants Pogonomyrmex occidentalis were evaluated. At the largest scale we assessed harvesting in different plant communities, at the intermediate scale we assessed harvesting at different distances from ant mounds, and at the smallest scale we assessed the effects of interactions among seed species in local seed neighborhoods on seed harvesting (i.e. resourceconsumer interface). Selected seed species were presented alone (monospecific treatment) and in mixture with Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass; mixture treatment) at four distances from P. occidentalis mounds in adjacent intact sagebrush and non-native cheatgrass-dominated communities in the Great Basin, Utah, USA. Seed species differed in harvest, with B. tectorum being least preferred. Large and intermediate scale variation influenced harvest. More seeds were harvested in sagebrush than in cheatgrass-dominated communities (largest scale), and the quantity of seed harvested varied with distance from mounds (intermediate-scale), although the form of the distance effect differed between plant communities. At the smallest scale, seed neighborhood affected harvest, but the patterns differed among seed species considered. Ants harvested fewer seeds from mixed-seed neighborhoods than from monospecific neighborhoods, suggesting context dependence and potential associational resistance. Further, the effects of plant community and distance from mound on seed harvest in mixtures differed from their effects in monospecific treatments. Beyond the local seed neighborhood, selection of seed resources is better understood by simultaneously evaluating removal at multiple scales. Associational effects provide a useful theoretical basis for better understanding harvester ant foraging decisions. These results demonstrate the importance of ecological context for seed removal, which has implications for seed pools, plant populations and communities.","[Ostoja, Steven M.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Yosemite Field Stn, Oakhurst, CA 93644 USA; [Schupp, Eugene W.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Schupp, Eugene W.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Klinger, Rob] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Yosemite Field Stn, Bishop, CA 93514 USA","Ostoja, SM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Yosemite Field Stn, Oakhurst, CA 93644 USA.",sostoja@usgs.gov,"Schupp, Eugene W/F-1834-2010","Schupp, Eugene/0000-0002-1258-503X","Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, US Dept of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2001-52103-11322]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station (UAES), Utah State Univ.

Ecological release predicts that loss of a limiting factor, such as a dominant competitor or predator, can release a species from control, thus allowing increases in its size, density, and/or distribution. The 2014 sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS) outbreak decimated populations of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus along the Oregon coast, USA. This event provided an opportunity to test the predictions of ecological release across a broad spatial scale and determine the role of competitive dynamics in top predator recovery. We hypothesized that after P. ochraceus loss, populations of the subordinate sea star Leptasterias sp. would grow larger, more abundant, and move downshore. We based these predictions on prior research in Washington State showing that Leptasterias sp. competed with P. ochraceus for food. Further, we predicted that ecological release of Leptasterias sp. could provide a bottleneck to P. ochraceus recovery. Using field surveys, we found no clear change in density or distribution in Leptasterias sp. populations post-SSWS, and decreases in body size. In a field experiment, we found no evidence of competition between similar-sized Leptasterias sp. and P. ochraceus. Thus, the mechanisms underlying our predictions were not in effect along the Oregon coast, which we attribute to differences in habitat overlap and food availability between the 2 regions. Our results suggest that response to the loss of a dominant competitor can be unpredictable even when based in theory and previous research.","[Sullivan-Stack, Jenna; Menge, Bruce A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA","Sullivan-Stack, J (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.",jenna.sullivan@oregonstate.edu,,,"Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Reserves Scholarship; Ocean Science Innovation Fund in Integrative Biology at Oregon State University; Oregon Society of Conchologists; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE17-35911, DEB15-50742]; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; Kingfisher Foundation; Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation; David and Lucille Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation","Thanks to Dr Elizabeth CernyChipman for data on Leptasterias sp. vertical distributions from 2014 and 2015.

We have studied the seasonal expression of these two interaction types within a two-species, boreal small mammal system. Seasons differ by resource availability, individual breeding state and intraspecific social system. Live-trapping methods were used to monitor space use and reproduction in 14 experimental populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in large outdoor enclosures with and without a dominant competitor, the field vole Microtus agrestis. We further compared vole behaviour using staged dyadic encounters in neutral arenas in both seasons. Survival of the non-breeding overwintering bank voles was not affected by competition. In the spring, the numbers of male bank voles, but not of females, were reduced significantly in the competition populations. Bank vole home ranges expanded with vole density in the presence of competitors, indicating food limitation. A comparison of behaviour between seasons based on an analysis of similarity revealed an avoidance of costly aggression against opponents, independent of species. Interactions were more aggressive during the summer than during the winter, and heterospecific encounters were more aggressive than conspecific encounters. Based on these results, we suggest that interaction types and their respective mechanisms are not either-or categories and may change over the seasons. During the winter, energy constraints and thermoregulatory needs decrease direct aggression, but food constraints increase indirect resource competition. Direct interference appears in the summer, probably triggered by each individual's reproductive and hormonal state and the defence of offspring against conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Both interaction forms overlap in the spring, possibly contributing to spring declines in the numbers of subordinate species.","[Eccard, Jana A.] Univ Potsdam, Unit Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Fey, Karen] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Caspers, Barbara A.] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Behav Biol, Res Grp Mol Ecol & Behav, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Unit Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",eccard@uni-potsdam.de,"Caspers, Barbara/C-5573-2011","Caspers, Barbara/0000-0002-4380-0476",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank the staff of the Konnevesi Research Station for maintaining the facilities and caring for animals, as well as researchers and field helpers.

The second and third stages evaluated the effects of Daphnia and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) on the calanoid-cyclopoid interaction. Cyclopoid predation initially caused a 50-70% reduction in calanoid abundance. After a few months, however, cyclopoids caused > 300% increases in calanoid abundance, apparently by preventing calanoid overexploitation of the phytoplankton. The presence of calanoids depressed cyclopoid abundance by up to 70-90%, presumably by diminishing the availability of edible phytoplankton to cyclopoid nauplii and of prey, such as rotifers, to cyclopoid adults. The presence of Daphnia depressed calanoid abundance, probably by reducing the phytoplankton abundance, but did not affect cyclopoid abundance, perhaps because cyclopoid adults could feed on items other than phytoplankters. Coequality (i.e., similarity in abundance) of closely related taxa was in 4 of 5 cases favored by the addition of a more distantly related taxon. Thus the addition of cyclopoids favored the coequality of two Diaptomus species (D. clavipes, D. siciloides), the addition of these Diaptomus species favored the coequality of two cyclopoid genera (Mesocyclops, Microcyclops), and the addition of Daphnia favored coequality of cyclopoids and calanoids and coequality of the two Diaptomus species, but the dominance of Microcyclops over Mesocyclops. Effects of Gambusia included a drastic reduction of Daphnia populations, moderate reduction of calanoid populations, and negligible effects on cyclopoid populations.","SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,SAN DIEGO,CA 92182",,,,,,,,58,56,61,0,21,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9615,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Throughout much of their ranges, California mussels are far more abundant than are gooseneck barnacles and previous investigators have cited morphologic constraints and interactions between these species to explain this disparity. Surfbirds Aphriza virgata (Gmelin) and gulls, primarily western gull Larus occidentalis Audubon and glaucous-winged gull Larus glaucescens Naumann, occur each winter in flocks of greater-than-or-equal-to 40-100 individuals along the coast of California. On their wintering grounds, they feed almost exclusively in the intertidal zone and consume large numbers of gooseneck barnacles. A bird-exclusion experiment showed that winter feeding by shorebirds and gulls significantly reduced the abundance of Pollicipes barnacles in plots accessible to birds compared to plots from which birds had been excluded. However, predation by birds was found to be both spatially and temporally patchy. Predation by birds may account for the distribution and abundance of gooseneck barnacles along the coast of northern California.

Here, we examined how one of Japan's endemic crustaceans, Daphnia tanakai, which has been found only in alpine lakes and pools in high mountain moors, is adapted to the alpine environment and what restricts its distribution only to the alpine environment. Lab experiments on UVB tolerance and growth rate under different pH and temperature based on the field survey for pools in mountain moors revealed that D. tanakai was differentiated from two low-altitude species (Daphnia dentifera and Daphnia pulicaria) by its tolerance to low pH such as 4.5, which is equal to the mean pH of pools in the high mountain moors occupied by D. tanakai. The growth rate at pH 4.5 was, however, significantly lower than that at higher pH, suggesting that low pH was not necessarily an optimal condition, and that other factors restrict the distribution to alpine lakes. Vulnerability to invertebrate predators such as Chaoborus was suggested as such a factor by additional experiments on swimming activity and predation and the fact that D. tanakai has only been found in pools without Chaoborus. Because it is known that the pH of alpine lakes is tightly linked with temperature, global warming may diminish the advantage of D. tanakai and allow invasion of alpine lakes by unwelcome predators and competitors from lower altitudes.","[Iwabuchi, Tsubasa; Okubo, Saki; Tsuchiyama, Yuka] Toyo Univ, Fac Life Sci, Itakura, Gunma, Japan; [Togashi, Hiroyuki] Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res & Dev Agcy, Tohoku Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Fisheries Oceanog & Resources Dept, Shiogama, Miyagi, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Hiroko; Hidema, Jun; Urabe, Jotaro] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Dept Environm Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Iwabuchi, Tsubasa] BirdLife Int Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","Iwabuchi, T (corresponding author), Toyo Univ, Fac Life Sci, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.; Iwabuchi, T (corresponding author), BirdLife Int Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",iwa283@gmail.com,"Urabe, Jotaro/A-6256-2012; Hidema, Jun/AAH-5124-2019; Urabe, Jotaro/ABI-7692-2020","Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X; Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16H02522]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H02522] Funding Source: KAKEN",We are grateful to Mika Teranishi for her valuable advice about the experiment on DNA damage by UV light and its repair.

However, studies on interactions between these two natural enemies and how they might affect CGM biological control are lacking. We determined in screenhouse experiments the effects of single and combined releases of N. tanajoae and T. aripo on CGM suppression. In the single natural enemy treatment, both T. aripo and N. tanajoae significantly reduced CGM densities, but the results of the predator (T. aripo) are more quickly measurable than those of the pathogen (N. tanajoae) in our short-term experiment. The level of CGM suppression in the combined natural enemy treatment was reduced considerably compared with T. aripo-alone, but only slightly when compared with N. tanajoae alone, with a simultaneous reduction in T. aripo and N. tanajoae abundance or prevalence. In a laboratory experiment, T. aripo fed more on N. tanajoae-infected CGM than on healthy CGM and its oviposition and survival were reduced when fed on the former compared with the latter, which can help in explaining the reduction in numbers of T. aripo and consequently the considerable loss in suppression of CGM in the combined natural enemy treatment in the screenhouse experiment. Together, the screenhouse and the laboratory experiments predicted negative interactions between the two natural enemies with negative consequences for CGM biological control. Long-term field observations and rigorous field experiments that simultaneously manipulate T. aripo and N. tanajoae abundance and prevalence are needed to validate the prediction of this study.","[Agboton, Bonaventure Vidjannagni; Hanna, Rachid; Onzo, Alexis] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin; [Agboton, Bonaventure Vidjannagni; von Tiedemann, Andreas] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Div Plant Pathol & Crop Protect, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Vidal, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Div Agr Entomol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Agboton, BV (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr, 08 BP 0932, Cotonou, Benin.",bogboton@yahoo.fr,"Vidal, Stefan/AAC-3130-2020","Vidal, Stefan/0000-0002-1673-4055; von Tiedemann, Andreas/0000-0002-1085-9607",International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); University of Gottingen in Germany,"We are grateful to H.

On rocky shores, communities are two dimensional, with biotic factors such as competition and predation setting the lower bound of a zone, whereas abiotic factors such as desiccation set the upper bound. In soft sediment communities, these patterns persist, but with a dynamic three-dimensional ecosystem occupied by mobile infaunal organisms, zonation can be more difficult to quantify and detect. Hemichordate worms, however, deposit fecal casts at the surface, which can be easily identified and counted, making them a potential model system for identifying zonation in soft-sediment systems. Here, we describe the intertidal zonation of hemichordate worms at two sites in Maine and Virginia. In Virginia, Saccoglossus kowalevskii occurs in the mid-intertidal at densities up to 500 individuals per square meter, whereas a tube-building polychaete, Spiochaetopterus oculatus, dominates the lower intertidal. In Maine, two hemichordate species, Saccoglossus bromophenolosus and Protoglossus graveolens, co-occur at densities up to 100 individuals per square meter in the mid-intertidal, whereas hermit crabs and errant polychaetes are numerically dominant in the low intertidal. Despite known chemical defenses, crustaceans readily consumed hemichordates in lab assays, although polychaetes did not. In a field tethering experiment, loss rates of hemichordate-flavored agarose pellets increased as tidal height decreased, suggesting that the lower bound of the hemichordate zone could be set by biotic forces such as crustacean predation. Additionally, a field transplant experiment found low survivorship of hemichordates transplanted to the upper intertidal, suggesting that desiccation may set their upper bound. These results are broadly consistent with prior studies of zonation in soft sediments, and expand our limited understanding of basic hemichordate ecology.","[Schrage, Kharis R.; Tupik, Juselyn D.; Allen, Jonathan D.] William & Mary, Dept Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Schrage, Kharis R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Tupik, Juselyn D.] Virginia Tech, Dept Biomed Sci & Pathobiol, Virginia Maryland Coll Vet Med, Blacksburg, VA USA","Allen, JD (corresponding author), William & Mary, Dept Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",jdallen@wm.edu,,,NSF Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1257039]; William and Mary Biology Department; College of William and Mary's Charles Center,"NSF Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/ Award Number: 1257039; William and Mary Biology Department; The College of William and Mary's Charles Center",,68,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1077-8306,1744-7410,,INVERTEBR BIOL,Invertebr.

However, few studies have examined the relative importance of predation during early life-history stages on long-term community composition. Using a sessile marine community, we conducted a manipulative experiment to measure the effect of timing and extent of predator exposure. Every month over a 5 month period we assessed taxa composition, dominance and taxa richness in each of the following five treatments: 1) never predated, 2) always predated, 3) early predated (during the first month of community development), 4) late predated and 5) uncaged panels. Predation was very important in determining taxa identity and dominance, reducing spatial monopolization by ascidians and increasing the area occupied by bryozoans, but overall predation did not result in a more diverse community. The localized extinction of ascidians in predation treatments was compensated by an increase in the diversity of bryozoans and barnacles. Interestingly, predation during the early stages of community development had only short-term effects on the taxa richness and composition. After 5 months, predator exclusion during the early life-history stages had no effect on community composition and only current levels of predation determined differences in composition. Our results show that predation can cause changes in community composition, directly and indirectly, without necessary changing the total number of co-occurring taxa. More important, we demonstrate to our study system that although predation during the early life-history stages can be strong and have important short-term effects, predation during the adult stages determines long-term community composition.

We focussed on the mechanisms by which an increase of a mutant with a higher growth rate and/or lower mortality leads to decreases in original phenotypes, with a particular emphasis on ''predator-mediated (apparent) competition''. The bacterial population was cultured together with the protozoan population over a long period of time. These were contrasted with single-species control cultures of E. coli (i.e., without predator) experiencing high density-independent mortality from continual dilution of the population, and also a population with strong density-dependent regulation arising from intraspecific competition. The long-term cultures of predator and prey revealed the following changes: predator density increased for some time after inoculation; correspondingly, the specific growth rate of prey increased, and mutants with the long-cell form (which experience low predation rate) appeared and increased in frequency in the population. Comparison of these results with results from control cultures, suggests that predator-mediated competition existed between mutants and the original types in the predator-prey system, i.e., increases in densities of mutants with higher growth rate and/or lower predation rate in the prey population enhanced the predator equilibrium density, which in turn exerted higher predation pressure on the original prey which then decreased in abundance.","TOHOKU UNIV,INST BIOL,DEPT SCI,AOBA KU,SENDAI,MIYAGI 980,JAPAN",,,,,,,,44,12,12,2,9,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1994,71,1,,,,,24,34,,10.2307/3546168,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PQ835,WOS:A1994PQ83500003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Eight individuals (2 females, 6 Males) were radio-tracked for one week in August. Field voles were shown to exhibit a marked preference for meadow and the ecotone between grassland and habitats with common reed, while avoiding alder forest and proper reedbeds. No significant differences between night and day in habitat-use of voles were noted. The results suggest that, at the end of the breeding season, it was food resources, rather than the risk of predation, played an important role in the votes' utilisation of space. The home ranges of males were larger and more diverse than those of females; their sizes being correlated with body mass, such that heavier males had larger home ranges. This further suggests that intra-sexual competition exists between males for females. The low number of females influenced their spatial behaviour, as females had completely exclusive home ranges. Four males (out of six) had overlapping home ranges with other males; three of the overlaps were of less than 20%. Attributes of promiscuity (such as a 3.5:1 operational sex ratio of males to females, intra-sexual competition between males and the territorial exclusivity of females) influenced the social system. However, the period of radio-tracking during this study was too short to define accurately the social system in the field vole population.","Forestry Res Inst Warsaw, Sect Wildlife Management, PL-00973 Warsaw, Poland","Borowski, Z (corresponding author), Forestry Res Inst Warsaw, Sect Wildlife Management, Bitwy Warszawskiej 1920 R 3, PL-00973 Warsaw, Poland.",Z.Borowski@ibles.waw.pl,"Borowski, Zbigniew/AAF-5230-2020; Borowski, Zbigniew/AAI-6571-2020; Borowski, Zbigniew/AAL-6483-2021","Borowski, Zbigniew/0000-0003-4109-5205; ",,,,31,19,20,2,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0001-7051,,,ACTA THERIOL,Acta Theriol.,SEP,2003,48,3,,,,,325,333,,10.1007/BF03194172,,,9,Zoology,Zoology,729KH,WOS:000185772000004,,,,,2021-09-27,

While the presence of aphid-tending ants can change the distribution of aphids among host plants, the role of mutualistic ants has not been fully explored to understand coexistence of multiple aphid species in a community. The tansy plant (Tanacetum vulgare) hosts three common and specialized aphid species, with only one being tended by ants. Often, these aphids species will not coexist on the same plant but will coexist across multiple plant hosts in a field. In this study, we aim to understand how interactions with mutualistic ants and predators affect the coexistence of multiple species of aphid herbivores on tansy. We show that the presence of ants drives community assembly at the level of individual plant, that is, the local community, by favoring one ant-tended species, Metopeurum fuscoviride, while preying on the untended Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria and, to a lesser extent, Uroleucon tanaceti. Competitive hierarchies without ants were very different from those with ants. At the regional level, multiple tansy plants provide a habitat across which all aphid species can coexist at the larger spatial scale, while being competitively excluded at the local scale. In this case, ant mutualist-dependent reversal of the competitive hierarchy can drive community dynamics in a plant-aphid system.","[Mehrparvar, Mohsen; Zytynska, Sharon E.; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Ctr Food & Life Sci Weihenstephan, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Balog, Adalbert] Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transylvania, Dept Hort, Fac Tech & Human Sci, Targu Mures, Romania; [Mehrparvar, Mohsen] Grad Univ Adv Technol, Dept Biodivers, Inst Sci & High Technol & Environm Sci, Kerman, Iran","Zytynska, SE (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Ctr Food & Life Sci Weihenstephan, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",sharon.zytynska@tum.de,"Zytynska, Sharon/C-9089-2011; Balog, Adalbert/O-9649-2019; Adalbert, Balog/AAR-4097-2021; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014","Zytynska, Sharon/0000-0002-0174-3303; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Mehrparvar, Mohsen/0000-0002-6051-5845","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [WE 3081/25-1]; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology of Iran; Institute of Science and High Technology and Environmental Sciences, Kerman, Iran; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Technical University of Munich (TUM)","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: WE 3081/25-1; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology of Iran and Institute of Science and High Technology and Environmental Sciences, Kerman, Iran; German Research Foundation (DFG); Technical University of Munich (TUM)",,48,2,2,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, it is not clear if the nonindigenous clam is the one directly responsible for these predominance patterns. Within this context, the main goal of the present study was to analyze the competitive interaction between the nonindigenous Manila clam and the native carpet shell clam to determine whether this interaction could impact directly growth and mortality of the native clam populations. The effect of exposure to predators on both species was also examined. For this purpose, between May 2010 and May 2011 a field experiment was conducted on an intertidal area in the Bay of Santander (N Spain) where both species coexist without an extreme predominance of the introduced species. Relative density of clam species was manipulated in a randomized block experimental design. The results obtained show that (i) the increased density of Manila clam simulating species expansion scenario does not affect growth or mortality of the native clam; and (ii) for densities of Manila clam substantially higher than observed in the field, predation plays an essential role in regulating both species populations, limiting their density increase. Moreover, Manila clam appears to be more negatively impacted by predation compared to the native clam. Overall, our results indicate that predation has a more significant effect on both populations when compared to competitive interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Size-dependent performance is particularly important for iteroparous species with overlapping cohorts, determining the ability of new cohorts to invade habitats with older, larger conspecifics. We conducted two mesocosm experiments to examine the role of size and size structure in shaping growth and survival in tadpoles of the red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas), a tropical species with a prolonged breeding season. First, we used a response surface design to quantify the competitive effect and response of two tadpole size classes across three competitive environments. Large tadpoles were superior per capita effect competitors, increasing the size difference between cohorts through time at high resource availability. Hatchlings were better per biomass response competitors, and maintained the size difference between cohorts when resource availability was low. However, in contrast to previous studies, small tadpoles never closed the size gap with large tadpoles. Second, we examine the relationship between body size, size structure, and predation by dragonfly nymphs (Anax amazili) on tadpole survival and growth. Hatchlings were more vulnerable to predation; predator and large competitor presence interacted to reduce hatchling growth. Again, the size gap between cohorts increased over time, but increased marginally more with predators present. These findings have implications for understanding how variation in resources and predation over the breeding season will shape population size structure through time and the ability of new cohorts to invade habitats with older conspecifics.","[Asquith, Christopher M.; Vonesh, James R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA","Vonesh, JR (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 W Cary St,POB 842012, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",jrvonesh@vcu.edu,"Vonesh, James/I-1573-2013","Vonesh, James/0000-0003-2481-9988",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717200]; Sigma Xi,"We thank the Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente de Panama for permission to conduct this research in Panama (Permiso No. SE/A-41-08) and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for use of its facilities and logistical support.

In mesocosm experiments, bivalves were offered to predator as single prey, and as multiple choice of prey. Bivalve prey showed behavioral responses when exposed to short-term hypoxia. Under normoxia, prey were consumed in almost equal numbers when offered separately, but when choice was offered to the predator R. venosa showed a marked preference for S. inaequivalvis. Short-term hypoxia increased the vulnerability of T. philippinarum, and, consequently, rapa whelks modified their predatory behavior and switched their preference to T. philippinarum. We hypothesize this to be a case of environmentally-mediated, non-reciprocal indirect interaction between the two non-native prey species, whose causes are based upon differences in specific traits of prey. Hypoxia may facilitate the coexistence of the two non-native bivalves via predator switching. The native cockle seems the net loser of the game. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The abundance and distribution of these two salamanders were independent among ponds, with A. talpoideum more numerous and widespread than S. intermedia. Both species were more likely to be found in ponds near other intermittent wetlands. Within a pond, captures of these two species were negatively correlated, and a held experiment showed that paedomorphic A. talpoideum avoided traps containing S. intermedia. An experiment in artificial ponds confirmed that interactions between these two species were highly asymmetrical; S. intermedia reduced the growth and recruitment of A. talpoideum without experiencing reciprocal, positive or negative effects. These results suggest that S. intermedia competes with and is an intraguild predator of A. talpoideum, limiting its growth and controlling its recruitment.","Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA","Fauth, JE (corresponding author), Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA.",,,,,,,47,12,15,0,7,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0173-5373,,,AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,Amphib.

However, the simultaneous assessment of the relative importance of both types of factors is rarely performed for multiple traits of a population, such as body size and abundance. Comparisons among different demographic rates are necessary for teasing apart the importance of species interactions and/or environmental conditions on both population and community structure. We tested whether biotic (e.g., larval competition) or abiotic factors influenced larval salamander density and body size in natural populations of two known salamander competitors, Ambystoma talpoideum and A. maculatum. Over six years, we surveyed 33 ponds where these species co-occur in western Kentucky, USA. We found that larval densities between species were positively correlated, and that habitat features had contrasting, species-specific effects. Larval sizes for each species showed negative intra-and interspecific relationships with larval densities of each species, but larval A. maculatum generally exerted the stronger relative interspecific effect. Overall, our study highlights that different characteristics of a population (i.e., body size or abundance) may be differentially affected by abiotic and biotic factors, even for ecologically similar, sympatric species. Understanding which traits are regulated by each component will advance our knowledge on how populations and communities are structured.","[Anderson, Thomas L.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.; Hartman, Bradley A.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, 2112 Biol Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Mott, Cy L.] Eastern Kentucky Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Moore 349, Richmond, KY 40475 USA; [Hartman, Bradley A.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 2112 Biol Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA.; Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, 2112 Biol Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA.",anderstl@gmail.com; cy.mott@eku.edu; bhartman@murraystate.edu; hwhiteman@murraystate.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354787]; Watershed Studies Institute; American Museum of Natural History Theodore Roosevelt Grant,"The authors thank C.

In a boulder shore habitat, accumulation of boulder layers increases shade and the number of interstices. This study examined whether experimental shade increased the density of mobile animals and modified the community structure at 2 intertidal zones on a moderately sheltered boulder shore in Amakusa, Japan. Artificial shade reduced Light intensity and surface temperature of boulders, and subsequently increased microalgal abundance. Mobile animals were sampled quanitatively at 2 zones (high and mid) for 4 treatments: single layer boulders without a roof as a control, double layer boulders without a roof, single layer boulders shaded by a roof for 6 wk and for 2 wk. Statistical analyses (MANOVA and ANOVA) showed strong effects of treatments on community diversity and the density of 15 abundant species in both tidal zones. Generally, the diversity was lower in the single layer boulders than the double layer boulders and increased with the experimental shade. Two carnivorous species (Hemigrapsus sanguineus and Japeuthria cingulata) and some herbivorous species (e.g. Nerita japonica and Nipponacmea nigrans) increased in density with the shade, while other herbivores (e.g. Monodonta labio and Littorina brevicula) were unaffected. In conclusion, a reduction of environmental stress produced by the shade increased community diversity on the boulder shore, but the responses of mobile animals were species specific. As these responses to a change in the environment occurred within a very short period (<2 wk), migration may play an important role in the short-term variation of community structure on boulder shores.","Seilai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Ishigaki Trop Stn, Okinawa 9070451, Japan","Takada, Y (corresponding author), Seilai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Ishigaki Trop Stn, Okinawa 9070451, Japan.",yotak@snf-its.affrc.go.jp,"Takada, Yoshitake/B-5288-2008","Takada, Yoshitake/0000-0001-9782-1195",,,,39,41,47,1,25,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Theoretical research has predicted two possible paths to stability in intraguild systems: intermediate predators either outcompete higher-order predators for shared resources or select habitat based on security. The effects of intraguild predation on intermediate mammalian predators such as swift foxes ( Vulpes velox) are not well understood. We examined the relationships between swift foxes and both their predators and prey, as well the effect of vegetation structure on swift fox-coyote ( Canis latrans) interactions, between August 2001 and August 2004. In a natural experiment created by the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in southeastern Colorado, USA, we documented swift fox survival and density in a variety of landscapes and compared these parameters in relation to prey availability, coyote abundance, and vegetation structure. Swift fox density varied significantly between study sites, while survival did not. Coyote abundance was positively related to the basal prey species and vegetation structure, while swift fox density was negatively related to coyote abundance, basal prey species, and vegetation structure. Our results support the prediction that, under intraguild predation in terrestrial systems, top predator distribution matches resource availability ( resource match), while intermediate predator distribution inversely matches predation risk ( safety match). While predation by coyotes may be the specific cause of swift fox mortality in this system, the more general mechanism appears to be exposure to predation moderated by shrub density.","Utah State Univ, Dept Forest Range & Wildlife Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Utah State Univ, USDA, Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr,Dept Forest Range & Wildlif, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Thompson, CM (corresponding author), Inst Wildlife Studies, POB 584, Bass Lake, CA 93604 USA.",thompson@iws.org,"Gese, Eric M/B-4578-2011",,,,,73,77,78,1,88,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2007,88,2,,,,,334,346,,10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[334:FWAIPC]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,156SA,WOS:000245668400008,17479752,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

Relationships between ER and water temperature, Secchi depth, population density, food resources, and potential competitors and predators were studied by single correlation and multiple regression analyses. Low values of ER were concurrent with low and decreasing numbers of the edible phytoplankton fraction and with the increasing number of the inedible fraction suggesting food limitation. ER was significantly correlated inversely with population density and positively with free bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates. No significant correlations were found with abiotic factors and competitors and predators. Significant multiple regression models with the best predictive variables highlighted the importance of intraspecific interactions on ER. Thus, intraspecific interactions and food resources emerged as the main controls acting on the summer ER dynamics of K. cochlearis in this reservoir.","Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Expt, Dept Biol, Lab Zooplancton, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Expt, Dept Biol, Lab Microbiol Acuatica, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; Univ Veracruzana, Ctr Reservoir & Aquat Syst Res, Dept Biol, Ctr Invest Trop,Lab Limnol, Waco, TX 76798 USA; Baylor Univ, Ctr Reservoir & Aquat Syst Res, Dept Biol, Limnol Lab, Waco, TX 76798 USA","Lopez, C (corresponding author), Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Expt, Dept Biol, Lab Zooplancton, Apdo 526, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",clopez@luz.edu.ve,"Lopez, Carlos/AAS-4155-2021",,,,,53,9,11,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP,2007,589,,,,,,175,185,,10.1007/s10750-007-0737-z,,,11,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,192UI,WOS:000248228300015,,,,,2021-09-27,

Therefore, herbivore densities will not only be determined by direct predator-prey interactions and direct and indirect defence of plants against herbivores, but also by other direct and indirect interactions such as apparent competition, intraguild predation, resource competition, etc. Although these interactions have received considerable attention in theory and experiments, little is known about their impact on biological control. In this paper, we first present a review of indirect food web interactions in biological control systems. We propose to distinguish between numerical indirect interactions, which are interactions where one species affects densities of another species through an effect on the numbers of an intermediate species and functional indirect interactions, defined as changes in the way that two species interact through the presence of a third species. It is argued that functional indirect interactions are important in food webs and deserve more attention. Subsequently, we discuss experimental results on interactions in an artificial food web consisting of pests and natural enemies on greenhouse cucumber. The two pest species are the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae and the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. Their natural enemies are the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, which is commonly used for spider mite control and the predatory mites Neoseiulus cucumeris and Iphiseius degenerans and the predatory bug Orius laevigatus, all natural enemies of thrips. First, we analyse the possible interactions between these seven species and we continue by discussing how functional indirect interactions, particularly the behaviour of arthropods, may change the significance and impact of direct interactions and numerical indirect interactions. It was found that a simple food web of only four species already gives rise to some quite complicated combinations of interactions. Spider mites and thrips interact indirectly through resource competition, but thrips larvae are intraguild predators of spider mites. Some of the natural enemies used for control of the two herbivore species are also intraguild predators. Moreover, spider mites produce a web that is subsequently used by thrips to hide from their predators. We discuss these and other results obtained so far and we conclude with a discussion of the potential impact of functional indirect and direct interactions on food webs and their significance for biological control.

As a result, landscape-level documentations of trophic cascades that alter entire communities are scarce. Islands invaded by animals provide natural experiment opportunities both to measure general trophic effects across large spatial scales and to determine the trophic roles of invasive species within native ecosystems. Studies addressing the trophic interactions of invasive species most often focus on their direct effects. To investigate both the presence of a landscape-level trophic cascade and the direct and indirect effects of an invasive species, we examined the impacts of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) introduced to the Aleutian Islands on marine bird densities and marine rocky intertidal community structures through surveys conducted on invaded and rat-free islands throughout the entire 1,900-km archipelago. Densities of birds that forage in the intertidal were higher on islands without rats. Marine intertidal invertebrates were more abundant on islands with rats, whereas fleshy algal cover was reduced. Our results demonstrate that invasive rats directly reduce bird densities through predation and significantly affect. invertebrate and marine algal abundance in the rocky intertidal indirectly via a cross-community trophic cascade, unexpectedly changing the intertidal community structure from an algae- to an invertebrate-dominated system.","[Kurle, Carolyn M.; Croll, Donald A.; Tershy, Bernie R.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Kurle, CM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 100 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",kurle@biology.ucsc.edu,"Bond, Alexander L/A-3786-2010",,,,,41,71,74,0,84,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

A stream simulator was used to test the effects of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) (fork length range 66-115 mm) on habitat use of inanga (Galaxias maculatus) (fork length range 51-100 mm) during autumn. The stream simulator consisted of a single run-riffle-pool sequence lined with gravel and cobble substrates, and c. 8 m(3) of untreated artesian water was recirculated through the stream simulator at a rate of 3 litres s(-1). Stream invertebrates were introduced into the stream simulator to provide food for the fish. Four experiments were run, each consisting of three 1-day trials using either 10 inanga, 20 inanga, or 10 inanga and brown trout. Counts of inanga visible in each of 12 designated habitat zones were made throughout the day, and proportions of visible inanga were used in repeated measure ANOVAs to test whether the proportion of fish visible varied according to the time of day, the density of inanga, or the presence of trout. Our experiments showed that neither the presence of juvenile brown trout nor the density of inanga had significant influence on inanga habitat use in the stream simulator. We conclude that in New Zealand streams any influence of brown trout on inanga is more likely to result from predation and/or competition for food by larger brown trout.","Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand; Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 1, New Zealand","Bonnett, ML (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd, POB 8602, Christchurch, New Zealand.",m.bonnett@niwa.co.nz,"McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011","McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813",,,,32,10,10,1,13,SIR PUBLISHING,WELLINGTON,"PO BOX 399, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND",0303-6758,,,J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL,J.

We hypothesize that positive interactions are maintained not only because of the recruitment benefits for the facilitated plants but also because of fitness benefits for the nurse plant. We tested this hypothesis by comparing seed production, seed predation and seed viability of a dominant nurse plant species (Mimosa luisana) when growing alone and in patches surrounded by its facilitated species. We also tested whether fitness of the nurse species is dependent on the phylogenetic neighborhood formed by their facilitated species using an analysis that accounted for the abundance and pairwise phylogenetic similitude of all species in each patch. Nurses growing associated to their facilitated species produced more seeds (1.86 times) and these seeds were more viable (1.47 times) than those of nurses growing alone. Seed predation did not alter these fitness differences. Seed number and viability increased in phylogenetically diverse neighborhoods. We conclude that distantly related partners are more likely to cause reciprocal increases in fitness, and that such effects contribute to species coexistence.

The endangered Pacific pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris pacificus) is being reintroduced to parts of its former range where multiple species of native rodents have overlapping diets. The granivorous species in this foraging guild compete for seeds exploitatively and through direct interference interactions, and pocket mice are the smallest and least dominant species in the guild. Repeated aggressive interactions from resident heterospecifics could lower the chances of reintroduced pocket mice establishing burrows during the post-release settlement period. As such, temporarily reducing the density of competing species through exclusionary fencing might be an advisable reintroduction strategy, in combination with other interventions, such as predator exclusion. The presence of other members of the seed-foraging guild, however, could have a net benefit for pocket mice, if the pocket mice pilfer from the other species' seed caches more than the other species pilfer from their caches. To test the frequency of cache pilfering between species, we conducted a field experiment with fluorescent dyed seeds. Two of 10 pocket mice pilfered from heterospecifics, but only 1 of 33 heterospecifics pilfered from pocket mice. In a field-enclosure experiment, we could not conclude that any of the 4 species tested used heterospecific scent to find (or avoid) seed caches, and pocket mice were less efficient in pilfering from artificial caches, recovering fewer seeds than the larger species. We did not find strong evidence that Pacific pocket mice benefit from living in sympatry with larger, dominant species. Although further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between heterospecific density and the prevalence of cache pilfering, a conservative reintroduction approach would be to select receiver sites with low densities of known competitors to benefit pocket mice during the critical post-release establishment phase.","[Chock, Rachel Y.; Grether, Gregory F.; Shier, Debra M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 612 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Chock, Rachel Y.; Shier, Debra M.] San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, Recovery Ecol, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA","Chock, RY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 612 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Chock, RY (corresponding author), San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, Recovery Ecol, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA.",rchock@sandiegozoo.org,"Grether, Gregory F./F-6286-2011",,"United States Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and California Department of Fish and Wildlife; United States Department of Education Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need Fellowship; Los Angeles (UCLA), a UCLA Pauley Fellowship, a UCLA Chancellor's Prize; Animal Behavior Society; Center for California Conservation Science, Sea and Sage Audubon, Santa Monica Bay Audubon; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology","We thank J.

In the intertidal salt marshes of Samborombon Bay (36 degrees 19 ' 20 '' S. 56 degrees 46 ' 26 '' W; mouth of la Plata River; Argentina). there is a new non-indigenous oyster species, Crassostrea sp., which settles on the dominant smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. Here, we analyzed if the oyster affects S. alterniflora. Sampling showed that density of live plant was similar across intertidal levels, but there were higher density of dead plant stems at low intertidal levels. This pattern coincides with higher density and larger shell size of Crassostrea sp. at the low intertidal where oysters are attached to the basal part of the plant stems. An experiment manipulating oysters attached to S. alterni flora stems and oyster mimics shows that Crassostrea sp. can indeed increase mortality of S. alterniflora. The negative effect of bivalves on plant could be because several oysters settle around the Spa rtina stem, and by growing during the year, strangle the plants increasing their mortality rate. Together, all these evidences strongly suggest that these non-indigenous oysters can control the lower intertidal level of plant distribution in this system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Until the 1990s, it was considered the main pest of major crops such as soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, particularly in southern Brazil and southern USA, as well as Argentina, Uruguay, and other countries. In the past 15+ years, a dramatic population decrease was observed to the point of now being considered a secondary pest in these referred countries. In this article, we list and discuss possible reasons which explain the decline in N. viridula population in the Americas. These factors include the following: (1) the steady increase of herbicides used in no-tillage/multiple cropping systems affecting potential hosts such as weeds in crop fields and nearby natural vegetation; (2) the change in cultivation systems, mostly in the Neotropics, favoring other species more adapted to exploit crops in modern day agriculture; (3) competition among several species of stink bugs that colonize major crops; (4) the growing impact of several species of egg parasitoids, some of them laboratory reared and released in crop fields, and other natural enemies (parasitoids and predators); and (5) the impact of global climate change affecting its distribution and biology.","[Panizzi, A.

Past research has indicated that numerous factors may influence salamander distributions, including competition, predation, and abiotic factors. We conducted a field removal experiment to investigate potential interactions among salamanders across the steam-woodland ecotone and to determine the effects of such interactions on community structure. We used removals of a terrestrial salamander, Plethodon cinereus, and/or several species of semi-aquatic salamanders of the genus Desmognathus to investigate potential interactions between these genera and the semi-aquatic salamander Eurycea cirrigera. Although removals did not significantly decrease numbers of P. cinereus or Desmognathus on plots, distribution of E. cirrigera shifted unexpectedly closer to streams in response to removals of P. cinereus. Eurycea cirrigera may have been responding to demographic shifts of P. cinereus, as average snout-vent length and mass of P. cinereus decreased significanfly on removal plots. Our results indicate that interactions among salamander species across the stream-forest ecotone influenced intergeneric responses in a complex fashion.","[Ransom, Tami S.; Jaeger, Robert G.] Univ SW Louisiana, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA","Ransom, TS (corresponding author), Univ SW Louisiana, Dept Biol, Box 42451, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",tsr6a@virginia.edu,,,,,,50,2,2,0,11,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,LAWRENCE,"C/O ALLEN PRESS, PO BOX 7065, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0018-0831,1938-5099,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,MAR,2008,64,1,,,,,20,31,,10.1655/06-28.1,,,12,Zoology,Zoology,281AC,WOS:000254467300003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Several attempts have been made to mitigate its multiple impacts but none was successful. Among the different methods proposed, the use of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) as an indigenous predator is promising but the available information about its predatory ability on crayfish is to date scanty. To fill this gap in knowledge, we ran three experiments in wetlands and irrigation ditches in Italy. The first experiment, in the laboratory, was aimed at quantifying the extent of predation by eels on crayfish, the second, in enclosures, the size classes of crayfish mainly preyed and the possible effect of the eels on P. clarkii behaviour, and the third, in the field, its ability to effectively reduce crayfish populations. Results showed that eels prey on small-sized or soft crayfish, attacking them from the back; an indirect effect was to reduce crayfish trophic activity, which in turn might increases crayfish mortality due to starvation and decreases impact on the community. However, as shown in the field, the use of eels should be appropriately calibrated to the context of application. Taken together, our results show that eels might be used as a complement to the traditional trapping method. However, additional studies are necessary to understand the adequate number of eels to be introduced and to develop appropriate methods for quantifying such effects.","[Aquiloni, Laura; Brusconi, Sara; Cecchinelli, Elena; Tricarico, Elena; Mazza, Giuseppe; Paglianti, Annalisa; Gherardi, Francesca] Univ Florence, Dept Evolutionary Biol, I-50125 Florence, Italy","Aquiloni, L (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Via Romana 17, I-50125 Florence, Italy.",laura.aquiloni@unifi.it,"Mazza, Giuseppe/Y-9504-2019","Mazza, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6644-1429",Province of Pistoia (Tuscany); Consorzio di Bonifica Parmigiana Moglia-Secchia (Emilia-Romagna),"Experiments 1 and 2 were financed by the Province of Pistoia (Tuscany) and Experiment 3 by Consorzio di Bonifica Parmigiana Moglia-Secchia (Emilia-Romagna).

Experimental reefs were constructed with either healthy (100% live) or degraded (10% live) Acropora longicyathus coral, stocked with varying densities of these two fish species, and monitored for two months. On healthy habitat, the mortality of C. parasema was density dependent, and increased substantially in the presence of the dominant interspecific competitor D. melanurus. In contrast, on reefs where habitat was degraded, C. parasema mortality was highly variable, density independent, and was no longer influenced by the presence of dominant competitor D. melanurus. Behavioral observations revealed that agonistic interactions for both species increased with density on degraded habitat, but not on healthy habitat. In addition, on degraded reefs, both species displayed a reduced association with reef habitat and ventured further away from shelter with increasing densities of the dominant competitor D. melanurus. These results suggest that reduced habitat quality can have such a profound effect on reef fishes, that it eliminates density-dependent mortality and competitive dominance hierarchies, thereby substantially altering the mechanisms that structure reef fish communities.","[Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Bonin, Mary C.; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Bonin, Mary C.; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Bostrom-Einarsson, L (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",lisa.bostromeinarsson@my.jcu.edu.au,"Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/B-5436-2015; Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011; Bonin, Mary/H-3433-2012","Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/0000-0003-4814-9552; Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498; Bonin, Mary/0000-0001-7249-0887","Australian Research Council through the Center of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; College of Marine and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia","We are grateful to E.

Signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in Sagehen Creek were associated with reduced growth rates and gut fullness of Paiute sculpin (Cottus beldingi) in earlier experiments. This paper assesses potential behavioral mechanisms of competition between the two species. I conducted experiments to determine crayfish effects on sculpin behavior and habitat use in a stream observation facility at the Sagehen Research Station, California, USA. Sculpin reduced their use of refuges and pools, shifted into higher-velocity microhabitats, and spent more time fleeing in the presence of crayfish. Crayfish used refuges, pools, and low-velocity habitats more than sculpin in either treatment. Both species were notably nocturnal, with most activity at dusk and night observations, although crayfish were more strongly so than sculpin. Detailed field surveys of lower Sagehen Creek found that potential refuges (unembedded rocks) were closely associated with total crayfish and sculpin numbers, suggesting that cover is at least sometimes limiting under natural conditions. By displacing sculpin from refuges and pools and increasing their activity rate, crayfish may increase the likelihood of predation on sculpin. Behavioral shifts in sculpin appear to be at least partly responsible for the reduced growth rates of sculpin in the presence of crayfish.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Light, T (corresponding author), Shippensburg Univ, Dept Biol, Shippensburg, PA 17257 USA.",tsligh@ship.edu,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,53,32,34,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.
