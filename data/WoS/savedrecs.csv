In the sciences of population biology, however, the laboratory is often seen as a poor approximation of what occurs in nature. Results obtained in the field are usually more convincing. This raises special problems: it is much more difficult to obtain stable, repeatable results in the field, where environmental conditions vary out of the experimenter's control, than in the laboratory. We examine here how this problem affected an influential experimental research tradition in community ecology, the study of the ecology of the rocky seashores. In the 1960s, a handful of North-American ecologists, most notably Joseph Connell, Robert Paine and Paul Dayton, made the rocky seashores a model study system for experimenting in the field. Their experiments were deceptively simple: they removed species living on the seashore and described the resulting effects on the local ecology. These experiments exerted a deep influence on community ecology. They provided evidence for speculative developments concerning the theory of interspecific competition, the factors responsible for species richness and the ecology of food webs. They also stimulated novel conceptual developments. In particular, Paine developed the predation hypothesis, which states that the presence of predators can favour species richness, before introducing the keystone species concept, according to which some species exert disproportionate effects on ecological systems. More broadly, these experiments gave support to a methodological trend in favour of field experimentation. Only controlled perturbations in the field, it seemed, provided a reliable method to get insights into the structure of ecological communities. However, as experiments were continued in time and repeated in different sites, divergent results appeared. We analyse here how intertidal researchers coped with the variability of environmental conditions and tried to stabilize their results. In the process, they reconsidered not only their early conclusions, but also the exclusive status given to field experiments. Expanding on this case study, we discuss some significant differences between laboratory and field experiments.","[Grodwohl, Jean-Baptiste; Porto, Franco; El-Hani, Charbel N.] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Hist Philosophy & Biol Teaching Lab LEFHBio, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Grodwohl, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cambridge, England; [Porto, Franco; El-Hani, Charbel N.] Univ Fed Bahia, Natl Inst Sci & Technol Interdisciplinary & Trans, Salvador, BA, Brazil","Grodwohl, JB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Hist Philosophy & Biol Teaching Lab LEFHBio, Salvador, BA, Brazil.; Grodwohl, JB (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cambridge, England.",jb.grodwohl@gmail.com,"El-Hani, Charbel/Q-1364-2019","grodwohl, jean-baptiste/0000-0003-1445-8277",,,,61,2,2,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0391-9714,1742-6316,,HIST PHIL LIFE SCI,Hist.

Incorporating interspecific interactions in predictive models is common in ecology, yet most methods do not adequately account for indirect interactions (where an interaction between two species is masked by their shared interactions with a third) and assume interactions do not vary along environmental gradients. Markov random fields (MRF) overcome these limitations by estimating interspecific interactions, while controlling for indirect interactions, from multispecies occurrence data. We illustrate the utility of MRFs for ecologists interested in interspecific interactions, and demonstrate how covariates can be included (a set of models known as Conditional Random Fields, CRF) to infer how interactions vary along environmental gradients. We apply CRFs to two data sets of presence-absence data. The first illustrates how blood parasite (Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and nematode microfilaria spp.) co-infection probabilities covary with relative abundance of their avian hosts. The second shows that co-occurrences between mosquito larvae and predatory insects vary along water temperature gradients. Other applications are discussed, including the potential to identify replacement or shifting impacts of highly connected species along climate or land-use gradients.

Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Using a new factorial metaanalysis technique, we combined the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments to ask whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects and to compare the average effects of competition and predation. Across all studies, the effects of competition in the presence of predators were less than in the absence of predators, and the interaction between competition and predation for most response variables was statistically significant. Removal of competitors had much more positive effects on organisms' growth and mass than did exclusion of predators. Predator exclusion had much more beneficial effects on organisms' survival than did competition. The mean effects of competition and predation on density did not differ from one another. The results differed among trophic levels. Further understanding would benefit greatly from more field experiments that manipulate both competition and predation, that focus on a wider range of organisms and environments, that focus on population-level parameters such as density, and that report results more completely, including data such as sample sizes and variances.","SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Coll New Jersey, Dept Biol, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Gurevitch, J (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",,"Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008","Hedges, Larry/0000-0002-7531-0631",,,,76,296,309,5,193,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

We conducted field research and an experiment to elucidate direct and indirect interactions among micro- and filamentous algae, their consumers (fingernail clams and water fleas consume the former and chironomids the latter), and loaches that prey on water fleas and chironomids. The experiment examined the effects loaches and fingernail clams have on algae biomass. Fingernail clams reduced microalgae biomass by filter feeding, while loaches increased it by feeding on water fleas. Loach predation on water fleas increased the biomass of microalgae indirectly, which might have led to an increased density of fingernail clams. Filter feeding on microalgae by fingernail clams increased the density of filamentous algae, a potential competitor of microalgae, suggesting that fingernail clams increase the density of chironomids by enhancing their diet, which may then increase the density of the loaches that prey on chironomids. Field research revealed a positive spatial association between loaches and fingernail clams, attributable to their mutual food resource facilitation.","[Takayanagi, Haruki; Yasuda, Hironori] Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, 1-23 Wakaba Machi, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan; [Takayanagi, Haruki; Nishida, Takayoshi] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, 2500 Hassaka Cho, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan","Takayanagi, H (corresponding author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, 1-23 Wakaba Machi, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan.; Takayanagi, H (corresponding author), Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, 2500 Hassaka Cho, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan.",zn56htakayanagi@ec.usp.ac.jp,,"Takayanagi, Haruki/0000-0003-3204-0640",,,,36,0,0,2,4,JAPAN SOC APPL ENTOMOL ZOOL,TOKYO,"1-43-11 KOMAGOME TOSHIMA-KU, TOKYO, 170, JAPAN",0021-4914,1347-6068,,JPN J APPL ENTOMOL Z,Jpn.

We set up 3 types of experimental plots in the paddy fields where D. major predominated. The two plots contained single species of either D. japonicus or D. major, respectively, and one plot had both species in equal number. We compared the development and the reproductive performance between plots in each species. In D. japonicus, the number of eggs and early instar nymphs were significantly smaller in the plots containing both species than in the monospecific plots. However, the numbers of late instar nymphs and newly emerged adults were not significantly different between plots. The proportions of starved nymphs in both plots were larger than those in the D. japonicus's natural habitats. The final densities of adults in both plots were lower than those in the natural habitats. These results suggest that lower density of D. japonicus in these paddy fields is due to the lack of available food for nymphs rather than the effects of interspecific competition with D. major. In D. major, significant differences were not found in the number of eggs, each instar nymphs and adults. These results suggest that the effects of interspecific competition did not affect the reproductive performance of D. major.","OKAYAMA COLL SCI,FAC AGR,APPL ENTOMOL LAB,OKAYAMA 700,JAPAN",,,,,,,,12,2,3,0,1,SOC POPULATION ECOLOGY,KYOTO,"SHIMOTACHIURI OGAWA-HIGASHI KAMIKYO-KU, KYOTO 602, JAPAN",0034-5466,,,RES POPUL ECOL,Res.

We placed paired germinated and ungerminated acorns of Quercus mongolica on 30-cm high platforms to exclude potential interspecific competition of the predominant larder hoarders Apodemus peninsulae and Myodes rufocanus, to investigate seed dispersal by a predominant scatter-hoarder, Tamias sibiricus, in the field in north-eastern China. Our results showed that T. sibiricus ate more acorns in situ in the absence of interspecific competition. In the presence of interspecific competition of A. peninsulae and C. rufocanus, however, more acorns were scatter-hoarded by T. sibiricus. Regardless of interspecific competition, germination of acorns showed no significant effects on seed dispersal patterns, inconsistent with the seed perishability hypothesis that animals avoid hoarding seeds with high perishability. Exclusion of interspecific competition, though relatively increasing the per capita seed abundance, appears to reduce seed dispersal, scatter-hoarding and seedling establishment. Therefore, we propose that moderate interspecific competition rather than competition exclusion may benefit seed scatter-hoarding and seedling establishment.","[Deng, Yinhua; Yi, Xianfeng] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Ju, Mengyao; Yi, Xianfeng] Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qufu, Shandong, Peoples R China","Yi, XF (corresponding author), Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",ympclong@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31760156]; Young Talents Invitation Program of Shandong Provincial Colleges and Universities,Funding for this study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31760156) and the Young Talents Invitation Program of Shandong Provincial Colleges and Universities.

We report findings from such experiments assessing competitive interactions among three species of parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Aplielinidae) of the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia argentifolii Bellows & Perring (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), a pestiferous species of worldwide importance. The parasitoids used in the study (Encarsia pergandiella Howard, Eretmocerus mundus Mercet, and Encarsia formosa Gahan) encompass the range of life histories found within Aphelinidae, and they exhibit a high degree of niche overlap. The objectives of our studies were ( I) to investigate the occurrence of interspecific competition among the whitefly parasitoids, (2) to quantify shifts in resource utilization patterns as influenced by experimental manipulations of the parasitoid assemblage and (3) to assess the impact of interspecific competition on the ability of the parasitoids to suppress their host populations. Field cages enclosing cotton plants were inoculated with whitefly by releasing adults at either a high or a low rate followed by releases of all possible combinations of the parasitoid species (including a no-parasitoid release control). The treatments were replicated three and four times each in 1996 and 1997. The presence of interspecific competitors reduced population growth rates of E. formosa and E. pergandiella but not the population growth rate of E. mundus. The spatial distribution of parasitism by E. pergandiella along the vertical axis of cotton plants differed in the multiple species treatments compared to the single species treatments. Changes in parasitoid activity in the presence of competitors may reduce potentially adverse effects of competition and promote species coexistence. Only releases of E. formosa together with E. pergandiella resulted in lower levels of host mortality than would be expected based on observed mortality by individual species. Our results demonstrate competitive interactions among three parasitoids of B. argentifolii under field manipulations but indicate that, in most cases, competitive interactions among parasitoids do not affect host population suppression.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, Biol Control Lab, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; USDA, APHIS PPQ, Mission Plant Protect Ctr, Mission, TX 78573 USA","Bogran, CE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, Biol Control Lab, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,96,76,82,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2002,83,3,,,,,653,668,,10.2307/3071871,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,523QY,WOS:000173967500008,,,,,2021-09-23,

Fluctuating densities and dietary overlap may account for massive ecological and evolutionary changes in fish communities. We sampled a mixed juvenile (0+ stages, being younger than 1 year of age) fish community at the Lower Rhine over three consecutive years, including native and newly established species (similar to 64,000 captured individuals and similar to 4200 dissected fish). Our aim was to develop a new approach in which data on density, individual consumption rates, and diet overlaps (both intra- and interspecific) solely originating from the natural environment, were used and combined to estimate species-specific competitive strengths within and between seasons and species. The juvenile fish community at the food-limited Rhine was dominated by invasive gobies. Species-specific consumption rates decreased depending on the dietary overlap with other juveniles. Two invasive gobies (Neogobius melanostomus and N. fluviatilis) showed the greatest competitive abilities, followed by a third invasive Gobiid species (Ponticola kessleri) and the native Aspius aspius, a species utilizing an exclusive food source. Both other native species (Perca fluviatilis and Sander lucioperca) had the lowest estimates of food-related competitive strength, indicating that these species are forced into a juvenile competitive bottleneck by the invasive gobies, before they finally can develop into successful predators on gobies later in life. Our new analytical approach to measure dietary competitive strength among individuals provides a powerful tool to empirically study eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics in the field.","[Borcherding, Jost; Heubel, Katja; Storm, Svenja] Univ Cologne, Dept Gen Ecol, Inst Zool, Ecol Field Stn Rees, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Borcherding, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Dept Gen Ecol, Inst Zool, Ecol Field Stn Rees, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",Jost.Borcherding@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011; Heubel, Katja/J-4060-2012","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861; Heubel, Katja/0000-0002-7946-5542","Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia; Volkswagen foundationVolkswagen [92 002]","We thank Pavel Jurajda (Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno) and the members of his team for their help during several fishing campaigns, as well as numerous students from the University of Cologne who helped with field assistance.

The leeches, Erpobdella octoculata, Glossiphonia complattata and Helobdella stagnalis, and their prey were manipulated inside experimental enclosures, matched by controls, erected on the stony shore of an eutrophic, English lake. 2. Five separate manipulations were performed: the addition of tubificid oligochaetes, the addition of snails, the increase in numbers of G. complanata and H. stagnalis, the increase in numbers of E. octoculata, and the reduction in numbers of all three leech species. All invertebrates were sampled, using trays buried in the substratum, in early March, prior to leech reproduction, in July and in late October/early November when breeding had ceased. Leech manipulations were executed immediately after the first sampling of invertebrates, when food addition, at fortnightly intervals, also commenced. 3. The addition of tubificids resulted in significantly greater numbers and biomasses of E. octoculata and H. stagnalis in the experimental compared to the control sites in the autumn sample, i.e. after breeding. The same was true for G. complanata when snails were added. When the numbers of leeches were either decreased or increased, no significant differences in numbers or biomass of the manipulated species were obtained in the autumn. 4. Elevation or readjustment of leech numbers appeared to be achieved through changes in juvenile mortality and to a lesser extent through fecundity. 5. Current results, together with previous findings, provide evidence for food limitation, with a high mortality of recruited young (up to 98%) which is linked to food supply. There is also some evidence for interspecific competition for food, though the occurrence of food refuges, the temporal separation of breeding peaks, and differences in feeding behaviour, involving body size and foraging strategies, between the glossiphoniids reduce the intensity of interactions.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Dual-guild herbivory also can muddle plant signals used by specialist natural enemies to locate prey, further complicating the net impact of herbivore-herbivore interactions in naturally diverse settings. While dual-guild herbivore communities are common in nature, consequences for top-down processes are unclear, as chemically mediated tri-trophic interactions are rarely evaluated in field environments. Combining observational and experimental approaches in the open field, we test a prediction that chewing herbivores interfere with top-down suppression of phloem feeders on Brassica oleracea across broad landscapes. In a two-year survey of 52 working farm sites, we found that parasitoid and aphid densities on broccoli plants positively correlated at farms where aphids and caterpillars rarely co-occurred, but this relationship disappeared at farms where caterpillars commonly co-occurred. In a follow-up experiment, we compared single and dual-guild herbivore communities at four local farm sites and found that caterpillars (P.rapae) caused a 30% reduction in aphid parasitism (primarily by Diaeretiella rapae), and increased aphid colony (Brevicoryne brassicae) growth at some sites. Notably, in the absence of predators, caterpillars indirectly suppressed, rather than enhanced, aphid growth. Amid considerable ecological noise, our study reveals a pattern of apparent commensalism: herbivore-herbivore facilitation via relaxed top-down suppression. This work suggests that enemy-mediated apparent commensalism may override constraints to growth induced by competing herbivores in field environments, and emphasizes the value of placing chemically mediated interactions within their broader environmental and community contexts.","[Blubaugh, Carmen K.] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29678 USA; [Blubaugh, Carmen K.; Asplund, Jacob S.; Philips, Christopher R.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.; Morra, Matthew J.; Popova, Inna E.] Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Soil & Entomol Sci, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Reganold, John P.] Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.] Univ Idaho, Dept Entomol Nematol & Plant Pathol, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Morra, Matthew J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Soil & Water Syst, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29678 USA.; Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",cblubau@clemson.edu,"Morra, Matthew/P-1216-2019; Morra, Matthew J/B-1723-2008","Morra, Matthew/0000-0003-3842-1575; Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102; Popova, Inna/0000-0002-2004-1411",USDA NIFA ORG award [2015-09273],"We are grateful to Elizabeth Magill and Sabrina Judson for field and lab assistance, to Olivia Smith for helping with figures, and to Paul Nabity, Ian Kaplan, Adrienne Godschalx, and Robert Schaeffer for comments on previous drafts of this manuscript.

Naturally established populations of these two species were studied intensively over two consecutive years (2010 and 2011) in an old field in southeastern Virginia, to compare life history features relevant to how they coexist, or whether one or the other of them is likely to be more successful in the same habitat. Populations of both species declined about 50% from 2010 to 2011 (adults from 47 to 21 for T. a. sinensis; 37 to 20 for T. angustipennis), but T. a. sinensis oviposited 10 oothecae and T. angustipennis only one in 2011. Tenodera a. sinensis was more abundant in the study site in both years, hatched earlier, and matured and oviposited earlier than T. angustipennis. Fewer females of both species survived to maturity in 2011 than in 2010, possibly indicating a reduction in prey or habitat suitability in 2011. We suggest that T. angustipennis will always be at a disadvantage as a result of its smaller body size, because of interspecific predation (and potentially competition) from its congener, lower clutch size, and susceptibility to egg parasitism. Further, environmental variability across field habitats and years profoundly affects populations of both species in successional old fields.","[Gall, Cory A.; Rose, Robert K.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Gall, Cory A.] Washington State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Hurd, Lawrence E.] Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA","Hurd, LE (corresponding author), Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",cgall@vetmed.wsu.edu; brose@odu.edu; hurdl@wlu.edu,,,Old Dominion University Department of Biological Sciences; Washington and Lee University; John T.

The hypothesis of competition with Skylark (Alauda arvensis) was tested by analysis of territoriality and agonistic behaviour as well as foraging-sites behaviour. The possible indispensability of perches was investigated by an artificial perch experiment. Flight behaviour was tested in comparison with the Skylark. Woodlark and Skylark showed neither interspecific territoriality nor a high level of interspecific agonistic interactions. Even though some perches were used frequently, Woodlarks did not change territories in grassland areas because of the artificial perches. On closer examination of anti-predation-strategies it became clear that forest edge is not a factor of woodlark-territories but the habitat of that species. As Skylarks try to escape by overflying or hiding in grass, Woodlarks mostly flew to the forest. Together with morphological and singing aspects both nest type and flight-behaviour show obvious adaptations to field-forest ecotones.","Max Planck Gesell, Forschungsstelle Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell, Germany","Schaefer, T (corresponding author), Max Planck Gesell, Forschungsstelle Ornithol, Vogelwarte Radolfzell,Schlossallee 2, D-78315 Radolfzell, Germany.",,,,,,,48,15,15,0,13,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-8375,,,J ORNITHOL,J.

The research presented here uses a survey, foraging observations, and a manipulative field experiment that test the included-niche competition hypothesis as a mechanism structuring the distribution of a generalist grasshopper, Melanoplus femurrubrum, along a food-resource gradient. A field survey of 10 old fields revealed a step-like reduction in M. femurrubrum abundance as the proportion of grass cover in the fields exceeded 60%. Furthermore, M. femurrubrum abundance and the abundance of a potential competitor, the grass specialist Chorthippus curtipennis, were negatively correlated among the fields. Experimental foraging observations showed that M. femurrubrum was a polyphagous feeder that preferred grass and consumed less grass in the presence of C. curtipennis. The pattern of grasshopper distribution and foraging data support an included-niche competition hypothesis. However, in a field experiment that manipulated C. curtipennis presence and absence and the composition of vegetation in which competition might occur, growth and mortality rates in M. femurrubrum did not respond to C. curtipennis competition. Performance was predicted to be lowest in grass-dominated conditions, those corresponding to the locations when M. femurrubrum does not exist. Instead, growth rates were highest and mortality rates were lowest in grass-only treatments. While the survey and foraging observations support the included-niche hypothesis, the experiments suggest that interspecific competition in adult grasshoppers is not the cause of the grasshopper distribution pattern. Similar experiments in western North American prairies indicate that interspecific competition can be important and that foraging ecology can be a good indicator of the interaction. This study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge about interspecific competition's role in organism distributions. It demonstrates that geographic similarity in natural history need not lead to a similar importance of limiting factors.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Beckerman, AP (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Inst Biol Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",a.p.beckerman@stirling.ac.uk,"Beckerman, Andrew P/D-3020-2011","Beckerman, Andrew P./0000-0002-4797-9143",,,,54,25,28,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,948,957,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0948:COOICB]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500007,,,,,2021-09-23,

We compared the mortality and weight gain of larvae of both species in field cages that enclosed one or both species with corn plants containing high or low aphid numbers. We did not find a significant effect of the presence of H. axyridis on the survival or weight gain of C. maculata, but H. axyridis larvae weighed more when kept with C. maculata for 5 days than when kept with equal numbers of conspecifics. This suggests that intraspecific competition was stronger for H. axyridis than the interspecific competition with C. maculata. The spatial distribution of C. maculata over the plants differed between single-species and two-species treatments in a manner that suggested that this species avoided interactions with H. axyridis.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Hoogendoorn, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",hoog0012@umn.edu,,,,,,48,41,42,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

We analyzed the effects of competition on the biomass of organisms belonging to 93 species in a wide variety of habitats. Competition had a large effect overall, with a great deal of heterogeneity in that effect among organisms. There were large differences among trophic levels in competitive effects, but the relative magnitude of competition at different trophic levels was contrary to the predictions of ecological theory. Primary producers and carnivores displayed small to medium effects. In these two groups, interspecific effects did not differ from intraspecific effects, nor did effects differ in terrestrial versus aquatic habitats. The effects of competition on herbivores ranged from large effects on anurans and lotic arthropods, to medium effects on marine mollusks and echinoderms, to effects that were not statistically distinguishable from zero for terrestrial arthropods. Interspecific competitive effects among these herbivore groups were generally less than intraspecific effects. Among primary producers, the effects of competition were not different in high- and low-productivity habitats. Across all taxa, large organisms did not experience greater competitive effects than small organisms, and competitive effects did not depend on the size attained in the absence of competitors. The effects of competition were weakly density-dependent in cases in which it was possible to examine the effects of the density of neighbors. Experiments conducted on caged organisms resulted in greater competitive effects than those with free-roaming and unenclosed organisms.

We examined interactions among a pair of early season grasshopper species (May-June; Arphia conspersa and Pardalophora apiculata) and a late season pair (July-August; Melanoplus femur-rubrum and Melanoplus bivittatus). Each grasshopper species was placed in cages by itself and with another grasshopper species. Grasshoppers generally survived at higher density in fertilized cages and they reduced plant abundance relative to empty cages, suggesting that grasshoppers may be food limited at these densities. In unfertilized plots, early season grasshoppers preferred grasses (Schizachyrium scoparium and Poa pratensis) and favored the growth of forbs (especially Solidago spp.). However, late in summer, Melanoplus spp. preferred Solidago spp. and favored the growth of grasses. The pattern of grasshopper survivorship and plant reduction within these experimental environments provide preliminary support for some of the predictions of resource competition theory. Grasshoppers exhibited interspecific competition only if they significantly reduced plant biomass. If two species competed, a grasshopper species was eliminated only if the superior competitor, when living by itself, could reduce plant biomass to a significantly lower level than the inferior competitor. Competitors persisted only if they did not differ in their ability to reduce plant biomass or reduced the abundance of different plant species.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA","RITCHIE, ME (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,40,48,48,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1992,89,4,,,,,524,532,,10.1007/BF00317159,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL791,WOS:A1992HL79100011,28311883,,,,2021-09-23,

Whilst habitat preferences, interspecific and intraspecific interactions are factors affecting patterns of heterogeneity, these are moderated by mobility. A field investigation of small-scale (cm to m) mobility was carried out on the Ythan estuary, Aberdeenshire, during immersion and after the ebb of the tide. Observations on immigration to, emigration from and activity within small areas of sediment indicated that mobility is low, but animals that do move are adult males which crawl over the sediment rather than swim. These individuals moved only short distances and they frequently re-used existing burrows. This movement is probably related to reproductive behaviour. The low mobility and the short distances moved indicated that mobility has little impact on at least large and intermediate scale heterogeneity, but shows that small-scale patterns are constantly dynamic in time and space.","Univ Aberdeen, Dept Zool, Culterty Field Stn, Ellon AB41 6AA, Aberdeen, Scotland","Lawrie, SM (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Zool, Culterty Field Stn, Ellon AB41 6AA, Aberdeen, Scotland.",,,,,,,21,15,15,0,3,GORDON BREACH SCI PUBL LTD,READING,"C/O STBS LTD, PO BOX 90, READING RG1 8JL, BERKS, ENGLAND",0091-181X,,,MAR FRESHW BEHAV PHY,Mar.

The distributions of the two species are sometimes defined with a small overlapping zone (called a 'sympatric area') which generally shifts. Exclusion is necessary to explain the persistence and shift of such a spatial pattern. Field studies are carried out to identify the type of interaction that leads to the required exclusion. This is usually achieved by estimating competition and predation parameters to define the type of interaction strong enough to imply exclusion. But interaction parameters are estimated by quantitative methods which require prolonged observation (5-10 years). These estimations are thus difficult to obtain and are open to criticism because of the spatial and temporal variations in the biotic context. Now the study of these variations requires estimation of several other interaction parameters (for different times and sites); therefore, we are unable to discuss these criticisms from a study of realistic duration. We have, therefore, developed a faster study method using the spatial properties of the sympatric: area (width and velocity). We used a between-species competition and a predation model, spatially extended with coupled map lattice formalism (CML), to generate substitution waves corresponding to the 'moving sympatric area' and to study their spatial properties (asymptotic width and velocity). The relationships between the asymptotic width and the interaction level had different shapes with competition and predation parameters. We used this difference to define a rapid study method that does not use quantitative estimations of the interaction parameters. This method is more reliable than the usual method with respect to the above criticisms. These findings may have considerable consequences for field studies of parapatry.

The wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) Hogna helluo (Walckenaer) and Pardosa milvina Hentz co-occur in soybean fields of south-west Ohio, U.S.A. As adults, Hogna is the larger species and has the competitive advantage in most interactions; due to differing phenologies, however, their size-classes frequently overlap and as such there is potential for shifts in competitive ability and intra-guild predation. The hypothesis that competitive interactions and intra-guild predation will favour Pardosa when Pardosa is similar-sized, or has a size advantage over Hogna, was tested in laboratory and field experiments. 2. Studies in laboratory arenas, pairing similar-sized individuals of these species and Hogna spiderlings with larger spiders of both species, revealed that intra-guild predation seldom occurs with similar-sized Hogna and Pardosa, however Pardosa will consume small Hogna individuals in laboratory arenas. 3. Field experiments involved stocking high densities (50 m(-) (2)) of Pardosa and Hogna in enclosures placed in soybean fields. In experiments with spiders of similar size, no interspecific effects were uncovered, but an intraspecific effect was found for Pardosa as its survival and weight gain were lower in the presence of more conspecifics. Large Hogna or Pardosa had no effect on the survival or weight gain of Hogna spiderlings. 4. Although Hogna is a better competitor as an adult, it has no advantage over Pardosa when their size-classes overlap, and Pardosa effects on Hogna may be inconsequential under field conditions. Therefore, the co-existence of these species is fostered by the fact that there are few negative interspecific interactions during their ontogeny.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Rypstra, AL (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 1601 Peck Blvd, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA.",,"Walker, Sean E/A-4722-2008","Walker, Sean/0000-0001-9310-3305; Buddle, Christopher/0000-0002-7494-9732",,,,40,41,43,0,13,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

We studied in experimental enclosures how closely related species, the sibling vole (Microtus levis Miller, 1908) and the field vole (Microtus agrestis (Linnaeus, 1761)), adjust their habitat use when facing either the competing species or simultaneously competition and predation risk. The species responded differently in their proportional use of two habitat types, a low cover (productive but riskier) and a high cover (safer but poorer). When alone, field voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability at low densities, but decreased its use with increasing density. Sibling voles, however, avoided the low-cover habitat in single-species populations. Under interspecific competition, the habitat-use patterns switched between species: sibling voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability, with decreasing use as densities increased. Sibling voles responded to predation risk by showing a stronger density-dependent decrease in the use of low-cover habitat. Field voles, initially using mostly high cover, did not change behaviour under risk of predation. Our results highlight the importance of considering both predation risk and interspecific competition when interpreting patterns of habitat selection among coexisting species.","[Koivisto, E.; Hoset, K.

The responses of Moina micrura (Cladocera) to slight salinity increases (up to 6.0) were evaluated through laboratory manipulative experiments and field observations at Cabiunas lagoon (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). From the field data, a positive relationship between M. micrura density and salinity was observed, whereas the opposite was found for other co-occurring microcrustaceans. Life-table observations from laboratory experiments showed better performance of individuals exposed to control conditions (no salt addition) and 1.0 and 2.0 of salinity. The difference between field and laboratory results may be explained considering possible direct and indirect effects of salinity on M. micrura populations. Salinity may have direct negative physiological effects in individuals. However, under natural conditions, M. micrura might benefit from reduced invertebrate predation and interspecific competition. This balance between negative and positive effects of salinity is probably more positive under natural conditions, explaining the success of M. micrura in Cabiunas lagoon under mild salinity conditions. Although salinity negatively affects many species living in freshwater systems, slight increases may be beneficial for some species under natural conditions.","[Santangelo, Jayme M.; Bozelli, Reinaldo L.; Rocha, Adriana de M.; Esteves, Francisco de A.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Esteves, Francisco de A.] Nucleo Pesquisas Ecol & Desenvolvimento Socioambi, BR-28970 Macae, RJ, Brazil","Bozelli, RL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Av Carlos Chagas Filho 373,POB 68020, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",bozelli@biologia.ufrj.br,"Santangelo, Jayme M/B-5922-2011; Bozelli, Reinaldo/S-6414-2019; Bozelli, Reinaldo L/G-1805-2012","Bozelli, Reinaldo L/0000-0001-9916-1629",CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CNPq-PeldConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); PetrobrasFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Amapa (FAPEAP)Petrobras; Pronex; FaperjFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ),"The authors thank the staff of the Laboratorio de Limnologia da UFRJ and NUPEM/UFRJ, especially Joao Marcelo Souza for field assistance.

Terrestrial seminatural habitats, such as hedgerows and grassy field margins, can enhance the abundance and diversity of spiders in adjoining fields, whereas the potential of riparian margins has rarely been studied. We compared the effects of hedgerows and riparian margins on aerial web-building spiders in adjacent cereal fields. While species richness and overall abundance did not significantly respond to distance from or type of field margin, each of the four dominant species responded differently. The abundance of Tetragnatha cf. montana Simon 1874 increased towards both hedgerows and riparian margins. Tetragnatha extensa (Linnaeus 1758) differentiated between field margin types and abundances increased only towards riparian margins. By contrast, Phylloneta impressa (L. Koch 1881) abundances decreased from field centers towards the field margins irrespective of the type. Type of field margin and distance showed an interactive effect on Mangora acalypha (Aralckenaer 1802) abundances, which decreased from field centers towards hedgerows but changed only little towards riparian margins. Increasing spider densities towards field margins can be explained by the preference of spiders for adjoining seminatural habitats (overwintering, food availability, microclimate, vegetation structure), whereas increases towards field centers might be caused by interspecific competition and enhanced predation pressure near seminatural habitats and high prey numbers in crop fields. Overall, our study demonstrates that aerial web-building spider species respond differently to hedgerows and riparian margins.","[Pfister, Sonja C.; Schafer, Ralf B.; Schirmel, Jens; Entling, Martin H.] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany","Pfister, SC (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, Fortstr 7, D-76829 Landau, Germany.",pfister@uni-landau.de,"Schafer, Ralf Bernhard/E-1926-2011; Entling, Martin H/C-6953-2008; Schirmel, Jens/I-3467-2012","Schafer, Ralf Bernhard/0000-0003-3510-1701; Pfister, Sonja C./0000-0001-5362-3330",,,,57,10,13,0,29,AMER ARACHNOLOGICAL SOC,COLLEGE PARK,"UNIV MARYLAND, DEPT ENTOMOLOGY, 4112 PLANT SCIENCES BLDG, COLLEGE PARK, MD 20742-4454 USA",0161-8202,1937-2396,,J ARACHNOL,J.

Spatial variability includes short-range neighbour-dependent interactions and small-scale spatial structure, such asclusteringwhere individuals aggregate together, andsegregationwhere individuals are spaced apart from one another. Yet, a large class of mathematical models aimed at representing these processes ignores these factors by making a classical mean-field approximation, where interactions between individuals are assumed to occur in proportion to their average density. Such mean-field approximations amount to ignoring spatial structure. In this work, we consider an individual-based model of a two-species community that is composed ofconsumersandresources. The model describes migration, predation, competition and dispersal of offspring, and explicitly gives rise to varying degrees of spatial structure. We compare simulation results from the individual-based model with the solution of a classical mean-field approximation, and this comparison provides insight into how spatial structure can drive the system away from mean-field dynamics. Our analysis reveals that mechanisms leading to intraspecific clustering and interspecific segregation, such as short-range predation and short-range dispersal, tend to increase the size of the resource species relative to the mean-field prediction. We show that under certain parameter regimes these mechanisms lead to the extinction of consumers whereas the classical mean-field model predicts the coexistence of both species.","[Surendran, Anudeep; Simpson, Matthew J.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Plank, Michael J.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Math & Stat, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Plank, Michael J.] Te Punaha Matatini, Auckland, New Zealand","Simpson, MJ (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",anudeep.surendran@hdr.qut.edu.au; michael.plank@canterbury.ac.nz; matthew.simpson@qut.edu.au,"Surendran, Anudeep/ABF-5218-2020","Surendran, Anudeep/0000-0003-0777-4642",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170100474]; New Zealand Centre of Research Excellence,"This work is supported by the Australian Research Council (DP170100474).

This edge habitat facilitates invasion of exotic species into remaining fragments. The ability of native species to resist invasion varies and may depend on intrinsic variables such as dispersal and reproductive rates as well as external factors such as rate of habitat change and the density of populations of introduced species in edge habitat. We examined the distributional and competitive relationships of two members of the class Chilopoda, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus, a centipede native to the eastern US, and Lithobius forficatus, an exotic centipede introduced from Europe. We found that L. forficatus was most abundant in edge habitat and S. sexspinosus was most abundant in the interior habitat at our field sites. Although L. forficatus was present in habitat interiors at 11 of 12 sites, there was no correlation between fragment size and numbers of L. forficatus in interior habitat. The native centipede was rarely found occupying fragment edges. We used laboratory microcosms to examine potential competitive interactions and to indirectly assess prey preferences of the two species. In microcosms both species consumed similar prey, but the native centipede, S. sexspinosus, acted as an intraguild predator on the introduced centipede. Native centipedes were competitively superior in both intraspecific and interspecific pairings. Our results suggest that intraguild predation may aid native centipedes in resisting invasion of introduced centipedes from edge habitat.","Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA","Hickerson, CAM (corresponding author), Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",chickerson2@msn.com,"Hickerson, Cari-Ann/A-8013-2008",,,,,61,25,26,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2005,146,1,,,,,110,119,,10.1007/s00442-005-0197-y,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,977HZ,WOS:000232795400012,16041613,,,,2021-09-23,

We conducted a field experiment in western Finland to evaluate the relative roles of these mechanisms in inducing spatial synchrony among cyclic populations of field voles Microtus agrestis. The study was conducted during the increase and peak phases of a vole population cycle on four agricultural field sites situated 1.5-7.0 km apart. Each field contained two 0.5-ha fenced enclosures and one 1-ha unfenced control area. One enclosure per field allowed access by small mustelid predators and the other by avian predators; all enclosures prevented the dispersal of voles. The unfenced control areas allowed access by all predators as well as dispersal by voles. Enclosed vole populations were in a treatment-wise asynchronous phase before the predator access treatments were applied. The growth rates of all enclosed populations were tightly synchronized during the course of the experiment. Conversely, synchrony both among the unfenced populations and between the fenced and unfenced populations was practically non-existent. During winter, in the increase phase of the cycle, vole populations in all treatments declined to low densities due to a seasonal effect of winter food depletion. During summer, in the peak year of the vole cycle, all populations fluctuated in synchrony. At this time, both small mustelids and birds of prey appeared to be abundant enough to induce synchrony. Dispersal was identified as a potential contributor to synchronization, but the magnitude of its effects could not be reliably discerned. Our results indicate that no single mechanism can account for the observed patterns of spatial synchrony among cyclic northern vole populations. Rather, spatial synchronization is induced by different mechanisms, namely seasonality and predation, acting successively during different seasons and phases of the vole cycle.","Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Huitu, O (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",ohuitu@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,83,25,26,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2005,109,3,,,,,583,593,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13476.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,907MO,WOS:000227722400017,,,,,2021-09-23,

However, despite its deep historical roots, classic and current approaches to this topic are highly diverse. Here, we combine historical and contemporary perspectives on the study of ecological interactions in macroevolution, synthesizing ideas across eras to build a zoomed-out picture of the big questions at the nexus of ecology and macroevolution. We discuss the trajectory of this important and challenging field, dividing research into work done before the 1970s, research between 1970 and 2005, and work done since 2005.

Ants interact with a diversity of organisms. These interactions, coupled with their abundance, cause ants to have ecologically important effects across multiple trophic levels. 2. Empirical study of ant nutritional ecology has led to the prediction that a macronutrient imbalance will affect ant behaviour and interspecific interactions that underlie these broad-scale effects. Excess carbohydrate relative to protein is predicted to increase ant aggressiveness, predatory tendency and foraging activity, and to decrease collection of hemipteran honeydew and plant nectar. 3. In field experiments conducted in 2009 and 2010, captive colony fragments of a native ant, Formica podzolica (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), were provided with either simulated prey or carbohydrate solution ad libitum. Foraging behaviours and interactions with flowers, myrmecophilous aphids and aphid natural enemies on wild-grown plants were documented. 4. Strong effects of macronutrient imbalance on foraging manifested quickly and consistently across colonies; in accordance with predictions, prey-fed foragers collected both honeydew and floral nectar, whereas carbohydrate-fed ants ceased collecting these resources. Counter to predictions, carbohydrate-fed ants dramatically lowered their activity levels and did not prey upon aphids. 5. Ants had no effect on aphid enemies in 2009, when the latter were relatively rare, but decreased their abundance in 2010. Despite this protection, the net effect of ants on aphids was negative (measured only in 2009). Prey-fed ants demonstrated a strong preference for honeydew over floral nectar, thus demonstrating that a macronutrient imbalance may lead to different interactions with similar resources. 6. This study links ant nutrition and community ecology by demonstrating the rapid, asymmetric and multitrophic consequences of nutritionally mediated behaviour.","[Petry, William K.; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92617 USA; [Petry, William K.] Truman State Univ, Dept Biol, Kirksville, MO USA; [Perry, Kayla I.] Baldwin Wallace Coll, Dept Biol & Geol, Berea, OH USA; [Perry, Kayla I.] Ohio State Univ, Ohio Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Entomol, Wooster, OH 44691 USA","Petry, WK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92617 USA.",wpetry@uci.edu,,"Petry, William/0000-0002-5230-5987",National Science Foundation through Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) [DBI-0753774]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919178]; RMBL; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0919178] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by National Science Foundation grants DBI-0753774 to WKP and KIP through the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) and DEB-0919178 to KAM and a RMBL Ehrlich Fellowship to KAM.

However, the mechanisms underlying environmental changes, such as a decrease in the relative abundance of native species, are poorly understood. Since the introduction of the ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), in Chile in the 1970s for biological control of aphids, a reduction in the relative abundance of the native ladybird beetle Eriopis connexa (Germar) has been noticed. To explore the role of cannibalism, intraguild predation (IGP) or competition as possible mechanisms that might increase dominance of H. variegata over E. connexa, several laboratory experiments were carried out. The native and the exotic species were very similar in their voracity and biotic interactions. Although H. variegata was able to maintain constant reproductive performance, E. connexa reproduction decreased at lower densities of aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The impacts of cannibalism, IGP, and competition exerted by these species were very symmetrical in both larvae and adults. We conclude that these biotic factors may not fully explain the increase in relative abundance of H. variegata. The higher sensitivity of E. connexa to prey patch size, along with other factors such as chemical-mediated negative interspecific interactions may be operating in alfalfa fields, changing the composition of associated coccinellid assemblages.","[Grez, A.

In order to test whether the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) holds in less exposed shores comprised exclusively of smaller rocks (cobbles) we measured 1) the size frequency distribution of cobbles (mass and basal surface area), 2) the incidence of barnacle encrustation as an indirect measure of cobble disturbance, 3) the abundances of the dominant macroinvertebrates occurring beneath cobbles (the crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus, the chiton Sypharochiton pelliserpentis and the snail Diloma zealandica), and 4) macroinvertebrate fidelity beneath a range of cobble sizes. Only large cobbles were found to be encrusted with barnacles, indicative of their greater resistance to physical disturbance by waves and currents. Mark and relocate experiments indicated fidelity to a given cobble over two tidal cycles was 11-14% for crabs and did not vary with cobble size. In contrast, fidelity to medium and large cobbles was higher for chitons (26-45%) and snails (17-31%) and generally increased with increasing cobble size. In contrast to the predictions of the IDH, there was a positive correlation between increasing cobble size and increasing species diversity of organisms found under the cobbles. This pattern is not simply attributable to greater space available beneath large cobbles as there was a significantly greater density of macroinvertebrates beneath medium and large, compared to the small cobbles. Increasing species diversity with increasing cobble size appears to be independent of patterns of species recolonization associated with small cobbles being subject to high disturbance or interspecific competitive hierarchies associated with low disturbance beneath large cobbles. Instead, factors such as aggregative behaviors, and reducing vulnerability to predators and desiccation stress are likely to explain the relationship between cobbles and their associated macroinvertebrate communities.

Because spring peepers are believed to be poor competitors, I hypothesized that competition from green frog larvae limits the distribution of spring peeper larvae. I stocked field enclosures with a constant density of spring peeper larvae, and one of four densities of green frog larvae (a ''target-neighbor'' design). Increased green frog density had a small effect on metamorphic size and no effects on survivorship, larval period or growth rates of spring peepers. In contrast to these small interspecific effects, green frogs had a large effect on their own performance. Intraspecific competition resulted in a 50% decline in growth rate and an 11% decline in metamorphic size. These results suggest that the species are segregated in resource use, or that compared with green frogs, spring peepers are better able to cope with depressed resource densities. In either case, this field experiment provides no evidence that interspecific competition from green frogs limits distributions of spring peepers. Other factors such as predation and breeding site choice by adults may contribute to the absence of spring peeper larvae from many semipermanent and permanent ponds.",,"SKELLY, DK (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,NJ-15,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.",,"Skelly, David/D-3878-2013",,,,,39,28,33,0,15,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1995,103,2,,,,,203,207,,10.1007/BF00329081,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RN783,WOS:A1995RN78300010,28306774,,,,2021-09-23,

We analysed data collected during a 3-year predator reduction experiment to find out the effects of predators on population structure, reproductive parameters, and individual quality of Microtus voles (the field vole M. agrestis and the sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis) in western Finland. Voles were collected by snap trapping in April, June, August, and October during 1997-1999. The yearly reduction of predators from April to October had a clear positive effect on the abundance of sibling voles but did not significantly affect the densities of field voles. Predator reduction apparently also affected the age ratio and mean body size in late summer, as well as pancreatic weights of voles. However, all observed differences between predator reduction and control areas, except those in abundance, were small and may mainly reflect a generally higher survival leading to higher densities of voles in predator reduction areas. Our results also indicated a relative lack of high quality food at population peaks but not because of reduced foraging activity in the presence of predators. We conclude that the indirect effects of vole-eating predators on the population growth of main prey are small compared to the detrimental direct effects on prey survival. In the case of less preferred prey, indirect effects of predation through reduced interspecific competition may play a role at high densities.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Norrdahl, K (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",kainor@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X",,,,63,20,20,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2004,105,2,,,,,312,324,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12684.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,805RJ,WOS:000220383100011,,,,,2021-09-23,

I performed two experiments in an early-successional site in two consecutive years. In the first experiment I tested the effects of litter and competition, and their interaction, on establishment and growth of tree seedlings. In the second experiment I studied the effect of insecticide application in combination with litter and herb competition on seedling establishment and growth, and on arthropod abundance. In the absence of competition, litter had no significant effect on the biomass of woody seedlings, though it delayed seedling emergence. Herb competition reduced the growth of the woody seedlings, but the addition of leaf litter reduced the density and biomass of the herbs, indirectly improving the growth of the woody seedlings. Litter increased both invertebrate damage to seedling cotyledons and seedling mortality. The application of insecticide increased seedling emergence and reduced seedling mortality, and more so in the presence of litter. The total number of arthropods and the number of plant-chewing arthropods were increased by the addition of litter and reduced by application of insecticide. Thus, litter had, simultaneously, a positive indirect effect on individual biomass through reduced competition, and a negative indirect effect on the number of individuals through increased seed and/or seedling predation, and a negative direct effect on seedling mortality.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,POB 1059,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855; NEW YORK BOT GARDEN,INST ECOSYST STUDIES,MARY FLAGLER CARY ARBORETUM,MILLBROOK,NY 12454",,,,"Facelli, Jose/0000-0002-0408-0082",,,,52,154,167,2,53,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,,,,,1727,1735,,10.2307/1939632,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,WOS:A1994PE26700020,,,,,2021-09-23,

After 7 months the experiment ended and reef sites were resurveyed. Gray triggerfish decreased on both treatments, while the mean number of red snapper did not differ between treatments; however, there were significantly more small (<400 mm total length) red snapper on reefs where gray triggerfish were removed. In seven laboratory growth trials (30 to 35 days each), red snapper held with gray triggerfish had significantly lower growth rates and numerous bite marks compared with red snapper alone.

I manipulated levels of simulated folivory on branches within eight trees of Quercus emoryi in a complete randomized block design. Survival and causes of mortality, including attack by natural enemies, of a dominant leafminer, Cameraria sp. nov., were monitored over two growing seasons. Survival varied significantly among trees but not among treatments. Causes of mortality also varied significantly among trees. Death from premature leaf abscission increased significantly with increasing levels of branch damage, while mortality from other causes, including death from bacterial and fungal attack, declined significantly with increasing levels of damage. However, neither of these changes in mortality was sufficient to cause changes in overall survival. Leaf damage did not influence attack by macroscopic natural enemies (hymenopteran parasitoids or vertebrate and invertebrate predators). By far, the most important factor affecting survival and causes of mortality within trees was the presence of co-occurring larvae on leaves (i.e., intraspecific competition). Simulated folivory in the first growing season did not affect folivory by Cameraria or other folivorous arthropods in the next season. Colonization, survival, rate of attack by natural enemies, and amount of herbivory by other arthropods in the second growing season were not affected by levels of leaf damage in the first one. Neither survival nor causes of mortality of Cameraria in the second growing season were associated with folivory by endemic leafchewing arthropods. Simulated folivory in the first growing season did, however, reduce leaf production in the second season. These results do not support the hypothesis that insect species compete interspecifically via induced plant responses and their effects on the third trophic level (natural enemies of the herbivores). The effects of simulated (first growing season) and insect (second growing season) folivory via induced plant responses on the Cameraria population was negligible relative to intraspecific interactions. Further, my results do not support the notion that folivore-induced responses are defensive and that plants have evolved these responses to manipulate the third trophic level. In natural settings, other factors that influence population dynamics of phytophagous insects, such as intraspecific competition and interactions with microparasites, may obscure any negative effects of herbivore-induced plant responses on interactions among herbivore species and their macroscopic natural enemies.",,"FAETH, SH (corresponding author), ARIZONA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA.",,,,,,,62,46,47,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1992,73,5,,,,,1802,1813,,10.2307/1940031,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP740,WOS:A1992JP74000028,,,,,2021-09-23,

Field experiment 1 tested which species has a competitive advantage as larvae developing in water-filled tires. Densities and al availability of resources (leaf litter, which is a substrate for microorganisms fed upon by larvae) were manipulated in a factorial design. Contrary to previous laboratory experiments, A. albopictus was clearly the superior competitor in this tire environment, maintaining positive population growth at higher combined density and lower per capita resource availability than did A. aegypti. The primary determinant of success in this experiment was survivorship to adulthood, and A. aegypti only survived well in this environment when raised alone at low density, with high resource availability. Field experiment 2 tested whether this advantage for A. albopictus resulted from apparent competition mediated by shared protozoan parasites in the genus Ascogregarina. In field experiment 2, A. albopictus larvae had moderate to high levels of parasitism, but A. aegypti larvae were virtually free from Ascogregarina in all experimental tires, implying that Ascogregarina played little or no role in producing the advantage for A. albopictus in field experiment 1. Thus, apparent competition does not appear to be necessary to account for the replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus. As a first step toward understanding variation in the outcome of this invasion, numbers of Aedes immatures and masses of adults from field collected pupae (indicators of the intensity of competition) were compared for three sites with known histories of invasion by A. albopictus ana decline or A. aegypti. Differences among sites in both number of Aedes per container and masses of adults of both species were consistent with the hypothesis that intensity of competition varies among sites, and suggest that A. aegypti persists only at sites where interspecific competition is less intense. Resource competition among larvae appears to be sufficient to account for replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus in suburban and rural areas of South Florida, which may have been marginal habitats for A. aegypti.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Grp, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Juliano, SA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Grp, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",,,,57,276,279,1,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1998,79,1,,,,,255,268,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0255:SIARAM]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YR740,WOS:000071525500023,,,,,2021-09-23,

However, studies of such competition across large-scale space are conversely mere 'snapshots' in time. The current study aimed at measuring interference-competition at multiple scales in space and time. Different aspects of interference-competition were measured in a model community (encrusters of boulder communities, e.g. ascidians, bryozoans, polychaetes and sponges) at 3 tropical, 3 temperate and 2 polar sites at intervals of days, weeks, months and years. The 3 aspects of competition measured-transitivity (hierarchicalness), number of clades involved, prevalence of interspecific encounters-varied non-significantly with time (from days to years) but significantly in space (from the tropics to the poles). Thus the strong differences observed in space are robust along ecological time-scales; boulder communities may be highly dynamic at local scales, but overall measures of interference-competition amongst their encrusters seem to vary little within a region. Why low- and high-latitude encrusting communities should differ may be linked to past selection pressures-to survive spatial competition in the more stable warm seas and to be able to recolonise from local ice-scour and regional ice sheets in the high temperate and polar realms. The results of the current study suggest that, despite being 'snapshots', the many point-in-time studies of competition in the literature are likely to be valid on ecological time-scales and thus useful for meta-analyses.","British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",dkab@bas.ac.uk,,,"Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [dml011000, bas010008] Funding Source: researchfish",,,52,7,7,0,8,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The focus of the observations was a simple isolated rock, 0.9 m2 in area with an inclination of 75-degrees. The pulmonate homing limpet Siphonaria sirius responded by fleeing from its home in response to the whelk Thais clavigera and by clamping tightly to its home scar in response to the starfish Coscinasterias acutispina. Both behaviours were successful for avoiding predation. After a whelk moved far away, limpets returned to their homes. The patellid limpet Cellana toreuma showed mantle folding behaviour or fled for an average distance of 8 cm vertically upwards in response to the whelk and for an average distance of 21 cm vertically upwards in response to the starfish. The amount of time predators spent foraging increased in the low intertidal zone relative to the mid and high zones, and most predator attacks were observed during the limpets' resting periods (submersion in late afternoon or nighttime). The upward directional flight displayed by C. toreuma was related to the upward orientation of the limpets' heads when they are in a resting position. Half of the limpets observed fleeing downward away from a starfish, a movement elicited by a downward attack, received a second attack. These limpets were preyed upon at the second encounter 67% of the time. The upward fleeing behaviour of C. toreuma resulted in the shifting of its resting site higher up the study site where fewer attacks occurred and where the mortality rate was at its lowest. It is suggested that the homing behaviour of S. sirius and the upward fleeing behaviour of C. toreuma are mechanisms by means of which interspecific competition between limpets is reduced and coexistence on a small rock surface is maintained.",,"IWASAKI, K (corresponding author), KYOTO UNIV,FAC SCI,DEPT ZOOL,KYOTO 606,JAPAN.",,,,,,,70,39,39,1,20,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Core processes operating at local scales, such as species-environment matching and species interactions, shape observed assemblages. Artificial habitats (simplified structure) are useful systems for assessing the main factors affecting community composition and disentangling their assembly rules. Drinking troughs (brickwork tanks for free-ranging cattle watering) are widespread in Italy and represent a suitable aquatic habitat for colonization by various aquatic organisms. Dragonflies larvae are usually found in drinking troughs and often exhibit strong species interactions and striking community assembly patterns. Our primary aim was to search for Odonata communities exhibiting non-random cooccurrence/segregation patterns in drinking troughs. We performed null-model analyses by measuring a co-occurrence index (C-score) on larval Odonata assemblages (13 species from 28 distinct troughs). Overall, we found a non-random structure for the studied dragonfly assemblages, which, given their fast generation time, must have been generated by short-term ecological processes (i.e. interspecific interactions). We thus analyzed potential competition/predation among and within ecological guilds. From the field data, we speculated that interactions within the sprawlers' guild is likely among the main drivers structuring the studied assemblages, especially the effect of intraguild predation between C. erythraea and Sympetrum spp larval stages. We then experimentally tested these interactions in laboratory and demonstrated that intraguild predation among larvae at different development stages may result in an effective exclusion/negative impact on density pattern, representing one of the processes to take into consideration when studying dragonfly assemblages.","[Cerini, Francesco; Bologna, Marco A.; Vignoli, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale G Marconi, Rome, Italy","Vignoli, L (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale G Marconi, Rome, Italy.",leonardo.vignoli@uniroma3.it,"Vignoli, Leonardo/F-2663-2011; Cerini, Francesco/AAO-8613-2020","Vignoli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1599-092X; Cerini, Francesco/0000-0002-1367-1239","Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza) [COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016]","The Grant to the Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza, ARTICOLO 1, COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016) is gratefully acknowledged.",,42,8,8,1,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 21,2019,14,6,,,,,,,e0214127,10.1371/journal.pone.0214127,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,IW3PT,WOS:000484894700003,31226119,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-23,

While immature individuals and large-sized adults of H. tridens occurred over the intertidal areas, the young adults of H. tridens were found only in the upper part of the intertidal area. This difference in the pattern of distribution between the young adults and the immature individuals of H. tridens seemed to be derived from interspecific competition or intraguild predation between H. tridens and H. japonica and/or intraspecific interactions within each species. These two species have the same of detritivore and carnivore food habits, and conspecific predation within and/or intraguild reciprocal predation between them were frequently observed in the field. In the present study, we performed field caging experiments to examine the dependence of predation ability on size between the two species. When individuals were <= 7.0 mm carapace width (CW), H. japonica had a higher ability to prey on members of H. tridens of the same size than H. tridens had on those of H. japonica. When individuals were >= 8.0 mm CW, there was no difference between the two species in terms of predatory ability, and the predation rate itself decreased. Therefore, H. japonica can exclude H. tridens from the lower habitats. However, the large sized individuals of H. tridens may intrude into the lower part of the intertidal area from the upper part. They can be against H. japonica, and can prey on the small sized individuals of H. japonica. However, thick sediment set in the cages increased the survival rate of the small individuals of H. japonica, because burrows dug in the sediment could be refuges for those of H. japonica from the intraguild predation by the large sized individuals of H. tridens. These refuges for the small individuals of H. japonica can be refuges also for those of H. tridens. However, burrows cannot be refuges from intraguild predation between similar-sized individuals of two species of the genus Helice. We can conclude that intraguild predation by H. japonica excluded the immature individuals of H. tridens in the lower habitat and restricted the young adults of H. tridens to the upper habitats in the estuary.","Ehime Univ, Ctr Marine Environm Studies, Matsuyama, Ehime 790, Japan","Omori, K (corresponding author), Ehime Univ, Ctr Marine Environm Studies, 2-5 Bunkyo Cho, Matsuyama, Ehime 790, Japan.",ohmori@mserv.sci.ehime-u.ac.jp,,,,,,37,3,4,0,5,CRUSTACEAN SOC,SAN ANTONIO,"840 EAST MULBERRY, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78212 USA",0278-0372,,,J CRUSTACEAN BIOL,J.

All species are food limited and there is considerable overlap in the diets of these triclads and leeches. This paper investigates interactions between the two groups using field and laboratory experiments to try to identify the mechanism of their co-existence. Triclad and leech numbers were manipulated inside experimental enclosures, matched by controls, erected on the stony shore of an eutrophic English lake. Increasing the numbers of P. tenuis and D. polychroa prior to the reproductive season in spring resulted in a significant decrease in the numbers and body size of G. complanata and H. stagnalis compared with control populations in the summer months, and vice versa. However, increases and decreases were temporary with a readjustment of numbers and body size to control levels in the autumn after reproduction had ceased. It is suggested that increasing the numbers of either group elevated the severity of both intra- and interspecific competition for food. The ''condition'' of prey may, in part, determine the strength of competition, and this was examined in laboratory experiments in which different densities and ratios of P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were offered either live of recently crushed Asellus aquaticus. In monospecific controls, growth rates of P. tenuis were greater when fed on crushed than live Asellus, but there was no significant difference in the growth of H. stagnalis fed either live or crushed prey. In mixed cultures of predators, P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were the superior competitors when fed on crushed and live Asellus, respectively. However, when competitive pressure was low, at low densities of predators, the presence of H. stagnalis in mixed cultures fed on live prey was beneficial to the growth of P. tenuis. These results are explained in terms of the greater ability of triclads to detect damaged prey, leaking body fluids, due to their sophisticated chemosensory system, and the ability of leeches to capture live prey due to the presence of suckers. It is concluded that co-existence of the two groups in British lakes is assisted by the partitioning of food on a live or damaged basis.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,21,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1996,106,4,,,,,544,550,,10.1007/BF00329714,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UT331,WOS:A1996UT33100019,28307456,,,,2021-09-23,

In a laboratory experiment, we evaluated the relative importance of competition and predation from juvenile and adult brown trout, respectively, on foraging performance of groups of three stone loaches. We observed loach consumption rate, time spent inactive, and aggressive interactions between juvenile trout and loach in artificial stream sections. The controlled experiments were complemented by examining stone loach population densities in natural systems as functions of juvenile and adult trout. In the laboratory experiments, increasing numbers of competitors decreased prey availability, which ultimately led to lower consumption rates for loach. Loach responded to predation risk by increasing time being inactive, thereby decreasing consumption rates. However, there were no effects of juvenile trout competitors on loach consumption rates in treatments with adult trout presence, suggesting no additive effect of predation and competition on loach foraging success. Partial regressions of loach and trout densities in natural streams revealed a positive relationship between juvenile trout and loach, and a negative relationship between adult trout and loach. Our laboratory and field data thus suggest that predation is a limiting factor for loach success, and predator presence could mediate species coexistence at high interspecific densities.","[Nilsson, Erika; Persson, Anders; Nilsson, P.

Indirect interactions between competition and predation, such as keystone predation, can influence both invasion success and the impact of an invasive species on resident competitors. The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald) has been established within the North American range of the indigenous competitor Aedes triseriatus (Say) and indigenous mosquito predator Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett). The effects of Tx. rutilus predation on competition between Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus were tested in laboratory microcosms. Consistent with a prior study, there was minimal evidence of competitive asymmetry between Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus, with similar effects of intraspecific versus interspecific interactions on both species. Tx. rutilus predation caused high mortality of both Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus, and minimized the effects of density-dependent competition. Ae. japonicus females that survived predation had larger adult body sizes than those in treatments without predators. Ae. triseriatus females that survived Tx. rutilus predation were larger and developed quicker than individuals in treatments without predators. Intraspecific competition and predation negatively affected the finite rate of population increase for Ae. j. japonicus, but only affected individual fitness correlates for Ae. triseriatus, indicating that the overall population performance of the invader ismoresensitive to these interactions than the native species. Based on these results, we predict that predation is likely to be an important barrier to the establishment and spread of Ae. j. japonicus in tree holes in North America.","[Freed, T.

The treatment that involved only the introduction of crustaceans had no significant effect on mosquito larval populations, while treatment with Bti alone caused only a significant reduction in the abundance of mosquito larvae in the short-term (within 310 days after treatment). In contrast, the combined treatment rapidly reduced the abundance of mosquito larvae, which remained low throughout the entire observation period of 28 days. Growth of the introduced crustacean communities was favored by the immediate reduction in the abundance of mosquito larvae following Bti administration, thus preventing recolonization of ponds by mosquito larvae at the late period (days 1428 after treatment).

Theoretical studies suggest that such reproductive interference may have strong effects on species interaction. For example, the inferior resource competitor can survive if its disadvantage is counterbalanced by superiority in reproductive interference. Two field cricket species, Teleogryllus occipitalis (Audinet-Serville) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) and Loxoblemmus equestris Saussure (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), cooccur in the same habitat. A previous study has shown that L. equestris is an inferior species to T. occipitalis in terms of resource competition. Therefore, we predicted that mate location and choice behavior of female T. occipitalis would be negatively affected by the acoustic signals of L. equestris and tested this with a series of playback experiments.The mate choice behavior of female T. occipitalis was not significantly affected by the calling song of L. equestris.

Following its recent invasion of eastern Asia, the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) co-inhabits maize fields with native lepidopteran herbivores, such as the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura. Here, drawing upon laboratory and field studies, we demonstrate how late-instar S. frugiperda larvae directly prey upon S. litura immature stages and competitively displace them from the maize whorl. Individual maize plants did not mediate the above interactions, with herbivore-damaged leaves not affecting the development rate of either species. In the field, ecological niches of S. frugiperda and S. litura overlapped, with species-specific occupancy rates of whorl-stage leaves (vegetative phase) and ears or tassels (reproductive phase) exceeding 70% and 90%, respectively. Field cage trials showed that S. frugiperda larvae either preyed upon or repelled S. litura larvae from maize plants, routinely resulting in more than 90% mortality of the latter. Field visits and cage studies in Yunnan (SW China) also revealed how-within an approx. 1-year time period-S. frugiperda has become a dominant species in local maize fields and co-infestation of both herbivores on the same plant is rare. Overall, our work shows how the invasive S. frugiperda exhibits a clear competitive advantage over native lepidopterans and could replace certain species within local agroecosystems. This study not only unveils the mechanistic causes of rapid ecological shifts within S. frugiperda-invaded cropping systems, but may also guide subsequent monitoring and management interventions.","[Song, Yifei; Wyckhuys, Kris A.

The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus has established in the North American range of the competitively superior resident congener, Aedes albopictus, and the predatory native mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus. We tested predictions for two hypotheses of invasion success and species coexistence: keystone predation and spatial partitioning. We tested competition between A. japonicus japonicus and A. albopictus with or without T. rutilus in laboratory microcosms, and measured abundances of A. japonicus japonicus, A. albopictus, other resident competing mosquito species, and the presence of T. rutilus among tree holes and tires in metropolitan Washington, DC. In laboratory microcosms, A. albopictus was competitively dominant over A. japonicus japonicus, which is consistent with the few prior studies of competition between these two Aedes species. T. rutilus predation severely lowered performances of both Aedes species but more severely lowered A. japonicus japonicus performance than A. albopictus performance when all three species co-occurred, thus yielding no evidence for keystone predation. Consistent with the spatial partitioning hypothesis, A. japonicus japonicus was negatively correlated and independently aggregated with A. albopictus and all combined resident mosquito competitors and was not associated with T. rutilus among field containers. These results suggest that predation from T. rutilus and competition from A. albopictus are barriers to the spread of A. japonicus japonicus, but that A. japonicus japonicus may escape these interspecific effects by utilizing spatially partitioned container habitats.","[Freed, T.

Recent models examining the ways in which spatial pattern in the landscape will influence the outcome of species interactions assume a trade-off between colonization ability and competitive ability in the interacting species. We tested for differential colonization and competitive ability in two interacting species of wolf spider (Hogna helluo and Pardosa milvina) which co-occur in agricultural and early successional habitats in the eastern USA. We conducted our research in replicated experimental soybean plots in which we created islands of enhanced habitat by supplementing natural litter and enhancing weed growth. Our experimental manipulations were repeated once for each of the two spider species: (1) spiders added, (2) prey attractants (composted vegetable waste) added, (3) spiders and prey attractants added, and (4) one control, for a total of eight subplots. We replicated the experiment six times, three times each in conventionally tilled fields and conservation tilled fields. We censused these plots at the end of the summer and found that conspecific addition significantly elevated numbers of one species (H. helluo) but not the other (P. milvina). These findings were consistent with our predictions that H. helluo is limited in colonization ability when compared to P. milvina, The addition of prey attractants significantly elevated numbers of both species, but the effect was far stronger for the superior colonist (P. milvina). This indicates that P. milvina is able to track resource abundance (both habitat structure and prey), a trait correlated with colonization ability. We found no strong evidence for a negative effect of H. helluo addition on numbers of P. milvina, as would be predicted if H. helluo strongly competed with or significantly preyed upon P, milvina. Body condition of P, milvina was lowest in subplots with higher numbers of H. helluo, indicating that H. helluo may have influenced the foraging success of P. milvina. We also found a strong and unexpected effect of the context of the plots (background tillage regime) on numbers of P. milvina, with there being approximately twice the P. milvina in the subplots in conventionally tilled fields.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Marshall, SD (corresponding author), Hiram Coll, Dept Biol, JH Barrow Field Stn, Hiram, OH 44234 USA.",marshallsd@hiram.edu,"Walker, Sean E/A-4722-2008","Walker, Sean/0000-0001-9310-3305",,,,36,56,58,0,37,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2000,81,12,,,,,3341,3349,,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,387QZ,WOS:000166134400008,,,,,2021-09-23,

Such bi-directional predation can be important during the establishment and spread of an invading species, but its role remains poorly understood. Using a combination of laboratory and mesocosm experiments and field introductions, we demonstrate that guppies, Poecilia reticulata, prey on juvenile killifish, Rivulus hartii, and thereby facilitate their establishment in the habitat of a potential predator. Laboratory studies found that mature guppies can consume larval Rivulus, and experimental stream studies showed that guppies reduced the number of Rivulus surviving from eggs. Growth trials found that interspecific competition, while significant, cannot account for the declines in the survival of juvenile Rivulus seen in field surveys. Finally, a field experiment, in which guppies were introduced into previously guppy-free stream reaches, resulted in a marked reduction in the abundance of juvenile Rivulus relative to guppy-free controls. Together, these results indicate that reducing the native Rivulus population represents an important mechanism promoting guppy invasion success.","[Fraser, Douglas F.] Siena Coll, Dept Biol, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA; [Lamphere, Bradley A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Fraser, DF (corresponding author), Siena Coll, Dept Biol, 515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA.",fraser@siena.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0108365, EF-0623632]","We thank Ronnie Hernandez (Simla research station), Daren Bhawanie of Ramdeen Estate (Ramdeen Stream), and our laboratory and field assistants: Sarah Beaudin, Dave Herasimtchuck, Pierson Hill, Ramon and Jose Rodriguez, Ephraim Farfan, and Kelley Malchan.

Here, the effects of the interaction between American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) and decapod crayfish on native amphibians have been investigated. Introduced American bullfrog populations were studied at two sites in central Italy (Rome, Latium), with their selection based on the presence or absence of the alien Procambarus clarkii. The pattern emerging from the fieldwork was then verified by a worldwide literature review on the trophic niche of the American bullfrog. Both field surveys and global diet analysis showed that the abundance of native amphibians in the American bullfrog diet was reduced when introduced crayfish occurred in both native and non-native ranges. Thus, an alternative invasion model can be proposed in which the occurrence of one invader (P. clarkii) may reduce the negative effect of an alien predator (L. catesbeianus) on native species. The present findings suggest that the removal of invaders may not always be the best solution for protecting native prey, especially when alien species are interspersed with other introduced species. In such cases, multispecies operations, sequenced appropriately or undertaken simultaneously, would be preferable. Moreover, the identification of mechanisms facilitating the coexistence of native species with invaders can offer important management options.","[Bissattini, Alessandra Maria; Buono, Vincenzo; Vignoli, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Sci, Viale Guglielmo Marconi, I-44600146 Rome, Italy","Bissattini, AM (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dept Sci, Viale Guglielmo Marconi, I-44600146 Rome, Italy.",alessandramaria.bissattini@uniroma3.it,"Vignoli, Leonardo/F-2663-2011","Vignoli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1599-092X",,,,103,10,10,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

However, in the case of introduced predators, prey populations might lack the behavioural traits to escape predation. We studied responses of native voles to removal of an alien predator, the American mink (Mustela vison), on small islands in the outer archipelago of the Baltic Sea, SW Finland. Voles were live-trapped on 10 manipulation and 10 control islands in a grid of 50 traps per island. Microhabitat characteristics around trap locations were classified to four types reflecting risks of mink predation and suitability for foraging: grassy patches, juniper bushes, berries and open habitats. Microhabitat use of voles was analysed in relation to microhabitat availability. Field voles (Microtus agrestis) responded to the presence of mink with a microhabitat shift from open grassy habitats to juniper bushes. Bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), however, avoided juniper in the presence of mink and were significantly more often captured in juniper in removal areas. Use of open habitats by bank voles was also affected by their own density on islands. These divergent results may reflect species-specific differences in the social system, diet selection and escape behaviour of voles, but provide novel evidence for a rnicrohabitat shift of native prey aninials induced by an alien predator.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Fey, K (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",karen.fey@utu.fi; p.banks@unsw.edu.au; erkki.korpimaki@utu.fi,,"Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495",,,,56,13,14,0,9,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,UNIV HELSINKI,"P O BOX 26, FI-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND",0003-455X,1797-2450,,ANN ZOOL FENN,Ann.

I quantified the effects of predation and competition on the growth and survival of two temperate reef fishes, Lythrypnus dalli and Coryphopterus nicholsii, in field experiments in which I manipulated the densities of the two species and the abundance of predators (using exclosure cages) on small replicate patch reefs. I also evaluated the influence of predators on the behavior of the two species to help interpret the mechanisms of any predatory influences on growth or survival. Predation was much more important than competition (inter- or intraspecific) in Lythrypnus. For Corphopterus, neither competition nor predation were particularly important. Behaviorally, both species responded to predators by reducing foraging rate and hiding. This altered behavior, however, had no repercussions for growth or survival of Coryphopterus!. In contrast, Lrthrypnus grew more slowly and suffered greater mortality when exposed to predators. Interspecific competition did not significantly influence either species. Intraspecific competition did not affect the growth of Coryphopterus, but survival tended to be lower at high densities. Growth of Lythrpnus was depressed by intraspecific competition, but survival was not, except that, in the presence of predators, survival was density dependent. In contrast to the historical emphasis placed on the role of competition, this study indicates that predation can be more important than competition in determining patterns of abundance of some reef fishes. For example, predators not influenced foraging of both Lythrpnus and Coryphopterus us, but they also reduced growth and survival of Lythrpnus and therefore appear to help maintain the marked habitat segregation between the two species. only.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Biol Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Steele, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol, 621 Circle Dr S,Box 951606, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",masteele@ucla.edu,,"Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917",,,,51,39,40,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,222,232,,10.1007/s004420050511,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700028,28308456,,,,2021-09-23,

Accipiter gentilis and their effects on buzzard breeding success and brood defence with a two-year field experiment using dummies and playback calls. A priori I showed through an extensive nest site analysis that there is considerable nesting habitat overlap between the two species and hence potential for interspecific competition for prime nesting habitat, Buzzards had a significantly lower breeding success when presented with a goshawk dummy compared to control broods but there was no effect of buzzard dummies on reproductive success, Buzzards failing with their breeding attempt tended to select another nest site while successful buzzards more frequently used the same nest again. Buzzard pairs were less often attacked by common crows Corrus corone while exposed to goshawk dummies compared to buzzard dummies. The decision to desert a nest seems to be a trade-off between predation risk on the one hand and protection against crows on the other. Goshawks probed far more aggressive against an intraspecific dummy than buzzards. Buzzards adjusted their level of brood defence against both intra- and interspecific dummies according to the age of offspring but not offspring number, with an increasing brood defence level with increasing offspring age. Thus the behaviour of buzzards towards goshawks is a result of a complex system of trade-offs between predation risk. competition for prime nesting habitat and protection from crows on which brood value acts as a temporal modifier.","Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany","Kruger, O (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",ok212@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,72,45,48,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2002,96,3,,,,,441,452,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.960306.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543QG,WOS:000175112200006,,,,,2021-09-23,

We conducted preliminary field experiments to determine whether Orconectes eupunctus were displaced from their former range and whether interspecific competition with O. neglectus chaenodactylus was responsible for the displacement. To determine whether Orconectes eupunctus were displaced from their former range by negative biotic interactions with other species we placed single adult male O. eupunctus in cages at two sites: an upstream site where O. eupunctus was formerly abundant and a downstream site where it is currently abundant. Orconectes neglectus chaenodactylus were additionally paired alongside O. eupunctus at the upstream site. We also conducted a field competition experiment with treatments consisting of (1) 3 O. eupunctus, (2) 6 O. eupunctus, and (3) 3 O. eupunctus and 3 O. neglectus chaenodactylus at a site where both species occur. In the first experiment, O. eupunctus gained significantly more weight at the downstream site than the upstream site during 2003, but not during 2002.

In the competition experiment, O. neglectus chaenodactylus did not significantly reduce the growth or survival of O. eupunctus. These results suggest that O. eupunctus have been displaced from their former range by biotic interactions, but interspecific competition between adult male O. eupunctus and O. neglectus chaenodactylus does not appear to be the mechanism responsible for this displacement.

Traditionally, spatial segregation is predicted to occur when species differ in the habitat in which they are either superior at competing for resources or less susceptible to predation. However, predictions from a behavioural model demonstrate that spatial segregation and coexistence can also occur in the absence of such interspecific trade-offs in competitive ability and vulnerability to predation. Unlike other models of competitor coexistence this model predicts that when species rank both habitat productivity and 'riskinesses' similarly, but differ slightly in their habitat-specific vulnerabilities to predators, they will tend to segregate across habitats, with the species experiencing the higher ratio of mortality risk across the habitats occurring primarily in the safer habitat. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that intraspecific trade-offs between resource availability and mortality risk can lead to spatial segregation of competing species by (1) documenting the spatial (i.e. intertidal) distribution of two marine snails, Littorina sitkana and L. subrotundata and (2) performing field experiments to quantify growth and mortality rates of each species at 'low' and 'high' intertidal heights. Our results indicate that both species agree on the rankings of habitat riskiness and productivity, experiencing higher predation and higher growth in low- than in high-intertidal habitats. However, L. sitkana and L. subrotundata experienced differences in their habitat-specific mortality risks and growth rates. Despite both species being similarly at risk of predation in high-intertidal habitats (where mortality was lower), L. subrotundata was subject to significantly higher mortality than L. sitkana at the low-intertidal height. In contrast, growth rate differences between habitats were greater for L. sitkana than for L. subrotundata. Whereas both species grew at the same rate at the high-intertidal level (where growth was lower), L. sitkana individuals grew more rapidly than L. subrotundata snails at the low-intertidal level. As predicted by the behavioural model, the species that experienced the higher ratio of mortality across habitats (i.e. L. subrotundata) occurred exclusively in the safer, high-intertidal habitat.

Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo, body mass approximate to 2700 g), Ural Owls (Strix uralensis, 900 g), and Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus, 130 g) coexist in Fennoscandia and feed mainly on small rodents. Predation may play an important role in interactions among these owl species, because Eagle Owls and Ural Owls can kill Tengmalm's Owls but cannot enter the small entrance hale of Tengmalm's Owl nest boxes. We asked (i) whether predation risk and interspecific competition due to Eagle Owls and Ural Owls reduced breeding density and fitness of Tengmalm's Owls, and (ii) whether these interactions increased intraspecific competition for safe nesting sites among Tengmalm's Owls. We manipulated breeding densities of potentially competing owls by erecting nest boxes, the control being boxes in areas where breeding attempts of competing owl species were absent. Control nest boxes in areas with no Eagle Owl and Ural Owl territories, and nest boxes within Eagle Owl territories, were used by breeding Tengmalm's Owls more than nest boxes within Ural Owl territories. Most breeding attempts of Tengmalm's Owls near Ural Owls failed during the courtship period. The observational data revealed that breeding frequency of Tengmalm's Owls was reduced and the mean start of egg laying was delayed by 11 d within 2 km of Ural Owl nests. In addition, male Tengmalm's Owls at these nests were younger and paired more often with short-winged (i.e., young and generally subdominant) females than when farther away from Ural Owl nests. Our results suggest that inexperienced male Tengmalm's Owls are forced to establish their territories in the vicinity of Ural Owls where they often paired with subdominant females. The areas near Ural Owl nests are suboptimal habitats fdr Tengmalm's Owls, whereas those near Eagle Owls are not. We conclude that predatory and competitive interactions from Ural Owls decrease the breeding population size of Tengmalm's Owls by reducing the suitable habitats. This is the first experimental demonstration that such interactions may decrease fitness of raptors.",,"Hakkarainen, H (corresponding author), TURKU UNIV,DEPT BIOL,ECOL ZOOL LAB,FIN-20500 TURKU,FINLAND.",,,,,,,72,104,109,0,45,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1996,77,4,,,,,1134,1142,,10.2307/2265582,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UN894,WOS:A1996UN89400016,,,,,2021-09-23,

K. deyrolli nymphs and the predator Laccotrephes japonensis (Nepidae: Heteroptera) adults coexist in rice paddy fields. It was predicted that the difference in tadpole density may influence the K. deyrolli nymph survival rate. We first compared survival rates of the first instar nymphs of K. deyrolli in June (high tadpole density period) and July (low tadpole density period). Secondly, we investigated the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs at different tadpole densities and under the presence or absence of L. japonensis adults to examine whether higher tadpole density moderates predation pressure from L. japonensis adults to K. deyrolli nymphs, e.g., density-mediated indirect effects. As a result of the comparison, the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs in June was higher than that in July. For the field experiment, the slopes between the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs and tadpole density were positive under both predator presence and absence. However, the slope under the presence of a predator was steeper than that under absence of the predator (predator-by-tadpole density interaction was significant). These results suggest that a higher tadpole density in June provides an abundant food resource for K. deyrolli nymphs and also moderates predation pressure from L. japonensis.","Okayama Univ, Lab Insect Ecol, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Ohba, S (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Lab Insect Ecol, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",oobah8ag@yahoo.co.jp,"Ohba, Shin-ya/M-5406-2019","Ohba, Shin-ya/0000-0003-3854-0902",,,,33,6,8,0,10,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

It has been suggested that E. willamettei may be beneficial in vineyards because it may have a negative impact: an the more damaging T, pacificus through their shared predator or through some form of interspecific competition, We conducted field and greenhouse experiments to determine the relative effects of these interactions between the two herbivores on the population dynamics of T, pacificus in 'Thompson Seedless' grape vineyards. We also used the field data to generate a functional relationship for the combined impact of E. willamettei and M. occidentalis on T, pacificus. 2, Predation and predator-mediated apparent competition were the only factors affecting T, pacificus densities in the field experiment, The addition of the predatory mite M, occidentalis alone resulted in a significant reduction in T, pacificus densities, while the addition of E, willamettei alone had little impact on T, pacificus densities. The greatest reductions in T. pacificus densities occurred in plots where both the predatory mite M, occidentalis and E, willamettei were added, The predatory mite occurred earliest and increased at the greatest rate in plots where it was released along with E. willamettei. From April to June, M. occidentalis abundance was positively correlated with E. willamettei abundance while T. pacificus abundance in July and August was negatively correlated with M. occidentalis abundance in the period April to June. 3, Under greenhouse conditions, the addition of E. willamettei to T. pacificus vines resulted in a marked decrease in T pacificus population growth rate. In contrast, doubling T. pacificus abundance in the absence E willamettei did not affect T. pacificus population growth rate, indicating that interspecific competition is more important than intraspecific competition in determining T. pacificus abundance, 4, Contrary to the greenhouse data and other studies in 'Zinfandel' vineyards, we found no evidence that E, willamettei competed with T, pacificus in the absence of predation in a Thompson Seedless vineyard. We suggest that the outcome of interactions between E, willamettei and T. pacificus may be affected by grape cultivar, growing region, a combination of cultivar and region-specific differences, or size and timing of vine infestations with E, willamettei. 5, In Thompson Seedless vineyards, ville infestation with E, willamettei would be most useful in increasing the effectiveness of the predatory mite M. occidentalis in controlling T, pacificus, primarily through an elevated predatory mite abundance prior to the development of large T, pacificus populations.",,"Hanna, R (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,"Wilson, Lloyd T/E-9971-2011",,,,,40,28,28,0,14,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

In field experiments, I varied densities of one or both isopod species in enclosures in which food and virus presence were also manipulated. I estimated the effects of intra- and interspecific competition, additional food, and virus infection on both the survival of P. scaber and the prevalence of the virus. In uninfected populations, intraspecific and interspecific competition negatively affected isopod survival, although food resources had no effect. In infected treatments, interspecific competition produced higher levels of virus prevalence than did intraspecific competition. Virus infection and reduced food interacted to produce higher overall mortality in interspecific competition treatments than in intraspecific competition treatments. The lack of significant effect of food on competition suggests that interference interactions rather than resource competition predominated. This mechanism is supported by a laboratory study in which total food availability was controlled. These results indicate that competition and parasitism interacted to produce the observed mortality patterns, and that ignoring mortality due to the virus would produce apparent interspecific competition. The data suggest that the impact of P. laevis on P. scaber involves both direct and indirect effects.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720",,,,,,,,49,76,78,0,57,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1992,73,2,,,,,507,514,,10.2307/1940756,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HK464,WOS:A1992HK46400010,,,,,2021-09-23,

We tested whether a subsidy of allochthonous prey enhanced an asymmetric competition between invasive bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and two native cyprinid fish, that is, stone moroko (Pseudorasbora parva) and tamoroko (Gnathopogon elongatus elongatus). A field experiment was conducted using enclosures wherein the strength of interspecific competition and the presence/absence of allochthonous prey were manipulated. The experiment revealed that allochthonous prey alleviated the limitation of fish growths caused by a severe competition for aquatic prey resources. However, the importance of allochthonous prey differed considerably between invasive bluegill and the two native cyprinids. Individual bluegills grew faster when the allochthonous prey was supplied, whereas no difference in growth was observed in the two cyprinids whether or not allochthonous prey was supplied. Interestingly, the importance of allochthonous prey on the total amount of bluegill growth varied depending on the numerical abundance of native cyprinid competitors, and this importance increased when the native cyprinids were abundant. These findings indicated that allochthonous prey provides an asymmetric growth benefit to invasive bluegills over the two native cyprinids by alleviating asymmetrically the competition strength in a Japanese pond, especially under the conditions of severe interspecific resource competition and a limitation in the utilization of in situ prey resources.","[Yonekura, Ryuji] Gifu Prefectural Res Inst Freshwater Fish & Aquat, Gifu 5016021, Japan; [Yonekura, Ryuji; Yamanaka, Hiroki; Ushimaru, Atushi; Matsui, Kazuaki; Uchii, Kimiko; Maruyama, Atsushi] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Yonekura, R (corresponding author), Gifu Prefectural Res Inst Freshwater Fish & Aquat, Gifu 5016021, Japan.",yonekura@fish.rd.pref.gifu.jp,"Yamanaka, Hiroki/D-4221-2012; Uchii, Kimiko/J-8236-2019; Ushimaru, Atushi/D-7036-2013; Matsui, Kazuaki/S-1473-2019","Uchii, Kimiko/0000-0002-1375-3875; Ushimaru, Atushi/0000-0002-2051-1233; Matsui, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1563-3308",Nippon Life Insurance FoundationNippon Life Insurance Foundation,"We express our thanks to I.

These species were chosen based on their high abundance and overlapping diets. Juvenile mosquitofish and sailfin mollies, at a range of densities matching field estimates, were maintained in the presence of adult mosquitofish, sailfin mollies, and bluefin killifish to test for effects of competition and predation on juvenile survival and growth. The mesocosms held 1,200 1 of water and all conditions were set to simulate those in Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park (ENP), USA. We placed floating mars of periphyton and bladderwort in each tank in standard volumes that matched field values to provide cover and to introduce invertebrate prey. Of 15 possible intra- and interspecific age-structured interactions, we found 7 to be present at the densities of these fish found in Shark River Slough marshes. Predation by adult mosquitofish on juvenile fish, including conspecifics, was the strongest effect observed. We also observed growth limitation in mosquitofish and sailfin molly juveniles from intra- and interspecific competition. When maintained at high densities, juvenile mosquitofish changed their diets to include more cladocerans and fewer chironomid larvae relative to low densities. We estimated size-specific gape limitation by adult mosquitofish when consuming juvenile mosquitofish and sailfin mollies. At high field densities, intraspecific competition might prolong the time period when juveniles are vulnerable to predation by adult mosquitofish. These results suggest that path analysis, or other techniques used to document food-web interactions, must include age-specific roles of these fishes.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; USGS Biol Resources Div, Everglades Nalt Pk Field Stn, Homestead, FL 33034 USA","Taylor, RC (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, POB 42451, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",,"Trexler, Joel C/I-5265-2012",,,,,47,38,40,1,30,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2001,127,1,,,,,143,152,,10.1007/s004420000575,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,413UA,WOS:000167629200016,28547165,,,,2021-09-23,

But conspicuous signals are also open to exploitation by eavesdropping predators and should also pose a threat to other sympatric prey species. In western Finland, sibling voles Microtus rossiameridionalis and field voles M. agrestis compete for food and space, and both species rely upon scent marks for intraspecific communication. Both vole species are prey to a range of terrestrial scent hunting predators such as least weasels, however, the competitively superior sibling voles are taken preferentially. We tested in large out-door enclosures whether field voles eavesdrop on the signals of its competitor, and whether they behave as though this eavesdropping carries a risk of predation. We presented field voles with scent marks from unknown conspecifics and sibling voles and measured their visitation, activity and scent marking behaviours at these scents under high (weasel present) and low (weasel absent) predation risk. Field voles readily visited both field and sibling vole scents under both high and low predation risk; however their activity at sibling vole scent marks declined significantly under increased predation risk. In contrast, predation risk did not affect field voles' activity at conspecific scents. Thus, field voles were compelled to maintain eavesdropping on heterospecific scents under an increased risk of predation, however they compensated for this additional risk by reducing their activity at these risky scents. Scent marking rates declined significantly under high predation risk. Our results therefore reveal a hidden complexity in the use of social signals within multi-species assemblages that is clearly sensitive to the potential for increased predation risk. The predation risks of interspecific eavesdropping demonstrated here represents a significant generalisation of the concept of associational susceptibility.","[Hughes, Nelika K.] N Head Sanctuary, Australian Wildlife Conservancy, Sydney, NSW 2095, Australia; [Hughes, Nelika K.; Banks, Peter B.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Hughes, NK (corresponding author), N Head Sanctuary, Australian Wildlife Conservancy, Sydney, NSW 2095, Australia.",nelika@unsw.edu.au,,"Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495","Finnish Government (Centre for International Mobility, Ministry of Education, Finland CIMO)","We wish to thank H.

Although the two species have similar diets, the jackal is about three times larger than the red fox. The current evidence for interspecific competition between these two canids is circumstantial and indirect. In this study we aimed to measure experimentally the response of red foxes to increasing exposure to the presence of the golden jackal. Our field experiments comprised three stimuli: urine as a scent stimulus, a mounted specimen and urine as a static animal-image stimulus, and a caged pet animal as a live animal stimulus. The treatment and control were placed near food trays, and the behaviour of foxes around these trays was documented by video recorders. In most cases, the presence of scent or cast of a golden jackal did not alter the behaviour of the foxes. However, foxes avoided the test arena when a live jackal was present. This finding provides strong evidence that red foxes fear jackals, and shows that foxes are more concerned when a live jackal is present.

Herein, we explore how fish predation and competition interact to drive this change in crayfish species composition. In outside pools, we conducted selective predation experiments exposing crayfish to largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, to quantify patterns of crayfish vulnerability. To determine how interactions among crayfish influence susceptibility, we quantified shelter use and behavioral interactions among crayfish in aquaria and outside pools. At equal size, O, virilis was more susceptible to fish predation than either of the invaders, O. rusticus and O. propinquus; the two invaders were equally susceptible to predation. However, sizes of these crayfish in the field are O. virilis > O. rusticus > O. propinquus. Because fish predators prefer small crayfish, at unequal size, small O. propinquus were more vulnerable to predation than large O. rusticus. Thus, O. rusticus can replace O. propinquus due to natural size differences. Although O. virilis grows larger than the invaders, it was more susceptible even when 3 mm larger. We hypothesized that O. virilis, although large, participated in behaviors that increased its risk to predation. When provided with unlimited shelters, all three species increased refuge use under predatory risk. When shelters were limiting and fish present, O. virilis was excluded from shelters by invaders. O. virilis also participated in risky behaviors, such as increased activity and swimming. Both agonistic interactions with congeners and approaches by largemouth bass increased risky behaviors in O. virilis. In addition, O. virilis was innately less aggressive than invaders. Given these behaviors, O. virilis was consumed at high rates and would be eventually replaced in lakes. In northern Wisconsin lakes, fish predation and crayfish-crayfish competition interact to influence crayfish replacements. Based on our results, largemouth bass predation modifies the outcome of interference competition among the three crayfishes and, in turn, competitive interactions among the crayfishes influence susceptibility to fish predation.

The field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the sibling vole (M. rossiaemeridionalis) are sympatric close relatives which compete for similar resources. Previous non-experimental studies suggest that the smaller sibling vole is a superior competitor, yet more vulnerable to predation than the larger field vole. We studied the effects of coexistence on population densities, reproductive parameters, and survival in these two species by means of experimentation in large, predator-free outdoor enclosures. While populations of both species reached higher densities in the absence of the other, field voles appeared to suffer more from interspecific competition than sibling voles. The proportion of young individuals in the population was higher in the sibling vole than in the field vole at the end of the experiment. The presence of a coexisting species reduced the survival of field voles. Sibling voles, on the other hand, appeared to suffer more from intraspecific competition than interspecific competition. On a population level, the sibling vole seems to be a superior competitor in the absence of predators due to better survival and possibly a higher reproductive capacity. However, predation probably has a profound influence on the interspecific dynamics of these two species indicating that in natural surroundings apparent competition (i.e. competition via shared predators) is stronger than direct competition.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Koivisto, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",elanko@utu.fi,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509",,,,46,10,11,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2007,116,1,,,,,156,162,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15254.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,125AJ,WOS:000243413600015,,,,,2021-09-23,

By causing large reductions in native prey, invasive predators may modify native species interactions. I conducted a manipulative field experiment in The Bahamas to investigate the possibility that the invasive Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) alters competition between planktivorous fairy and blackcap basslets (Gramma loreto and Gramma melacara, respectively). Competition between these coral-reef fishes is known to have symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species, whereby the feeding positions under reef ledges and growth rates of these individuals are hindered. Following baseline censuses of local populations of competing basslets, I simultaneously manipulated the abundance of lionfish on entire reefs, and the abundance of basslets in local populations under isolated ledges within each reef, resulting in three treatments: unmanipulated control populations of both basslets, reduced abundance of fairy basslet, and reduced abundance of blackcap basslet. For eight weeks, I measured the change in biomass and feeding position of 2-5cm size classes of each basslet species and calculated the growth rates of similar to 2cm individuals using a standard mark-and-recapture method. Experimental populations were filmed at dusk using automated video cameras to quantify the behavior of lionfish overlapping with basslets. Video playback revealed lionfish hunted across all ledge positions, regardless of which basslet species were present, yet lionfish differentially reduced the biomass of only juvenile (2cm) fairy basslet. Predation reduced the effects of interspecific competition on juvenile blackcap basslet as evidenced by corresponding shifts in feeding position toward coveted front edges of ledges and increases in growth rates that were comparable to the response of these fish in populations where competition was experimentally reduced. Thus, an invasive marine predator altered the outcome of interspecific competition via differential predation, which tipped the balance of competition between native prey species from symmetrical to asymmetrical effects on juveniles. This study reveals a newly demonstrated context in which predation can indirectly facilitate prey, further broadening our understanding of the interactive effects of predation and competition in the context of invasive species.","[Kindinger, Tye L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Kindinger, Tye L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.; Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",tkinding@ucsc.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-08-51162, OCE-12-33027]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This study is a chapter from the author's doctoral dissertation (committee: M.

We examined these processes in and among populations of field voles, sibling voles, bank voles and common shrews in western Finland, using spatially replicated trapping data collected four times a year during two vole cycles (1987-1990 and 1997-1999). Populations of the four species exhibited relatively strong interspecific temporal synchrony in their multiannual fluctuations. During peak phases, we observed slight deviations from close temporal synchrony: field vole densities peaked at least two months earlier than those of either sibling voles or bank voles, while densities of common shrews peaked even earlier. The growth rates of all four coexisting small mammal species were best explained by their own current densities. The growth rate of bank vole populations was negatively related to increasing densities of field voles in the increase phase of the vole cycle. Apart from this, no negative effects of interspecific density, direct or delayed, were observed among the vole species. The growth rates of common shrew populations were negatively related to increasing total rodent (including water voles and harvest mice) densities in the peak phase of the vole cycle. Sibling voles appeared not to be competitively superior to field voles on a population level, as neither of these Microtus voles increased disproportionately in abundance as total rodent density increased. We suggest that interspecific competition among the vole species may occur, but only briefly, during the autumn of peak years, when the total available amount of rodent habitat becomes markedly reduced following agricultural practices. Our results nonetheless indicate that interspecific competition is not a strong determinant of the structure of communities comprised of species exhibiting cyclic dynamics. We suggest that external factors, namely predation and shortage of food, limit densities of vole populations below levels where interspecific competition occurs. Common shrews, however, appear to suffer from asymmetric space competition with rodents at peak densities of voles; this may be viewed as a synchronizing effect.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Huitu, O (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,62,46,51,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2004,27,2,,,,,197,206,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2003.03684.x,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,808DK,WOS:000220549600008,,,,,2021-09-23,

Least weasels (Mustela nivalis) hunt in dense plant cover, whereas kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) hunt in habitats with sparse plant cover. Field voles (Microtus agrestis), the main food of weasels and kestrels, prefer open country with a high grass layer. We simulated a multipredator environment in an aviary (3.0 x 4.8 x 2.2 m) to find out whether predator facilitation plays a role in the interactions between voles, small mustelids, and raptors. In each replicate, we placed a field vole in a pen including sides of high and low grass layers (cover and open). In a predator-free situation, voles preferred cover but shifted to open when a weasel was introduced to cover. In the presence of a kestrel, voles occupied cover and decreased their mobility In the presence of a kestrel plus a kestrel, voles behaved as under the kestrel risk alone. Therefore, in these aviary circumstances, voles perceived the kestrel risk as greater than the weasel risk.

Strategies should be different for indirect resource competition (exploitation, e.g., foraging and avoidance behaviour) than for direct interspecific interference (e.g., aggression, vigilance, and nest guarding). We studied the effects of resource competition and nest predation in sympatric small mammal species using semi-fossorial voles and shrews, which prey on vole offspring during their sensitive nestling phase. Experiments were conducted in caged outdoor enclosures. Focus common vole mothers (Microtus arvalis) were either caged with a greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) as a potential nest predator, with an herbivorous field vole (Microtus agrestis) as a heterospecific resource competitor, or with a conspecific resource competitor. Results: We studied behavioural adaptations of vole mothers during pregnancy, parturition, and early lactation, specifically modifications of the burrow architecture and activity at burrow entrances. Further, we measured pre- and postpartum faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) of mothers to test for elevated stress hormone levels. Only in the presence of the nest predator were prepartum FCMs elevated, but we found no loss of vole nestlings and no differences in nestling body weight in the presence of the nest predator or the heterospecific resource competitor. Although the presence of both the shrew and the field vole induced prepartum modifications to the burrow architecture, only nest predators caused an increase in vigilance time at burrow entrances during the sensitive nestling phase. Conclusion: Voles displayed an adequate behavioural response for both resource competitors and nest predators. They modified burrow architecture to improve nest guarding and increased their vigilance at burrow entrances to enhance offspring survival chances. Our study revealed differential behavioural adaptations to resource competitors and nest predators.","[Liesenjohann, Monique; Liesenjohann, Thilo; Eccard, Jana Anja] Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med, Dept Nat Sci Biochem, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","Liesenjohann, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",monique.liesenjohann@uni-potsdam.de,"Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008","Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [ec361/4-1],"We thank Prof. Fritz Trillmich for providing his laboratory at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, for the FCM extractions and Elke Hippauf for technical support with the extractions.

Curiously, little attention has been paid to the qualitative and quantitative variation of the seed-stored molecules and on their ecological significance. Here, we analysed the oil content and oil composition of ca. 200 weed seed species from agricultural fields in France based on single seed accessions, concentrating on interspecies differences and ignoring within-species variation. The relationships between seed weight, oil %, fatty acids (FAs) and the energetic value of the seed and its antioxidant properties were also investigated. The antioxidant activity could contribute to protect the oily seed reserves from alteration over time. Among the species analysed, we found a considerable quantitative (oil%) and qualitative variation of FAs stored in the seeds. Such variation was largely related to the plant family of the different species, but intrafamily variation was also found. Heavier seeds contained less oil on a per gram basis than lighter seeds, suggesting a trade-off between seed weight and oil ratio in the seed and that oil storage strategy depends on seed size. Moreover, oily seeds contained more polyunsaturated FAs. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we did not found a higher antioxidant capability in oily seed extracts than in non-oily seeds, nor to the quantitative or to the qualitative variation of FAs in the seeds. Considering the role of these important trait variations on weed ecological strategies, such as germination period, seed predation rate and competition-colonisation trade-off, could improve the sustainable management of weed communities.","[Bretagnolle, F.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Biogeosci UMR6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Bretagnolle, F.] CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Matejicek, A.; Reboud, X.; Gaba, S.] INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, F-21065 Dijon, France; [Gregoire, S.] INRA, Ctr Sci Gout & Alimentat, UMR1324, Dijon, France","Bretagnolle, F (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Biogeosci UMR6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France.; Bretagnolle, F (corresponding author), CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",francois.bretagnolle@u-bourgogne.fr,"Gaba, Sabrina/H-5240-2018","Gaba, Sabrina/0000-0002-7145-6713",ANR SysterraFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [STRA-08-02 Advherb],The authors would like to acknowledge Emilie Cadet for the access on seed collection and Youssef Mouacha for seed lipid extraction and Michel Prost from the SPIRAL Society.

Habitat segregation seems to be the major factor contributing to the coexistence of these two species: I. baltica is the dominant species among surface drift weed, whereas I. emarginata occurs mainly on the sea bed among accumulations of broken decaying algae. In laboratory cultures with food in excess, there is intense intra- and interspecific competition through direct interference. Single species cultures of both species thrive and rapidly attain an equilibrium population size which is about four times greater in I. emarginata than in I. baltica. In mixed-species cultures, I. baltica lacks a 'realized niche'; independent of starting densities, I. baltica is competitively excluded by I. emarginata within a short period of time. The crucial behavioural mechanism of interference is cannibalism (intraspecific competition) and mutual predation (interspecific competition). Both intra- and interspecific interference occur mainly through density-dependent control of juvenile mortality by cannibalistic /predatory adults. Experiments on the relative strengths of intra- and interspecific interference revealed strong asymmetries in competitive relationships: Intraspecific inhibitory effects in I. baltica are much greater than in I. emarginata; I. emarginata exerts much more inhibition on I. baltica than on itself, whereas I. baltica exerts much more inhibition on itself than on its congener I. emarginata. These asymmetries account for a complete competitive dominance of I. emarginata over I. baltica, and (according to the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition) inevitably result in competitive exclusion of I. baltica by I. emarginata. All types of asymmetry are due to the fact that juveniles of I. emarginata are much better protected from being cannibalized and preyed upon by conspecifics and heterospecifics, respectively, than juveniles of I. baltica. This protection is probably based on an active chemical defense mechanism that becomes ineffective immediately after death. The possibility is discussed that current interference competition is an important factor in maintaining habitat segregation in I. baltica and I. emarginata in the field. Extrapolation of the laboratory results to the field suggests an essentially unidirectional effect, with I. emarginata itself being largely unaffected by I. baltica but competitively excluding the latter from zones of potential overlap.

In laboratory tests, young larvae of S. nigrolineata were more vulnerable to interspecific predation than those of the rock-pool species, and older larvae proved to be less efficient predators. In rock pools, there are no environmental factors preventing successful reproduction by S. nigrolineata. However, competition and predation by the two other rock-pool species seem to prevent successful reproduction. Dispersal in S. nigrolineata is too slow for efficient colonization of rapidly changing rock-pool environments.","UNIV HELSINKI,DEPT APPL CHEM & MICROBIOL,SF-00014 HELSINKI,FINLAND","PAJUNEN, VI (corresponding author), UNIV HELSINKI,DEPT ZOOL,DIV ECOL,POB 17,SF-00014 HELSINKI,FINLAND.",,,,,,,18,10,10,1,17,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1993,95,2,,,,,220,225,,10.1007/BF00323493,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LV564,WOS:A1993LV56400009,28312945,,,,2021-09-23,

We addressed this question in a temporary-pond community where the broken-striped newt Notophthalmus viridescens doralis is known to act as a keystone predator on larval anurans. We independently manipulated the initial density of adult Notophthalmus (two or four) and the presence or absence of one adult Siren intermedia in a set of 20 artificial ponds to determine if this additional predator affected the ability of Notophthalmus to function as a keystone predator. Each pond received a diverse assemblage of larval anuran prey: a spring-breeding assemblage of 275 Rana utricularia, 100 Pseudacris crucifer and 25 Bufo americanus tadpoles, and a summer assemblage of 200 Hyla chrysoscelis and 150 Gastrophryne carolinensis tadpoles. Two additional ponds received neither predator, to assay the outcome of competition among the tadpoles. The effect of the salamander Siren on Notophthalmus survival and fecundity depended on the density of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren had no effect on survival, but at high newt density competition reduced the survival and growth rates of Notophthalmus. The density of Notophthalmus and the presence of Siren interacted to determine the fecundity of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren reduced Notophthalmus reproductive success by preying on larvae. At high newt density Siren indirectly enhanced reproductive success by reducing survival of adults, thus releasing larvae from intraspecific competition and cannibalism. Notophthalmus density had no effect on adult Siren survival or growth rate in this experiment, but other evidence indicates that competition with Notophthalmus reduces the growth rates of Siren. Notophthalmus acted as a keystone predator on the assemblage of spring-breeding anurans; it increased the number of metamorphs of the weak competitor Pseudacris crucifer by releasing them from interspecific competition. Siren preyed on tadpoles in a nonselective manner. An additive model was sufficient to describe the effects of Siren and initial density of Notophthalmus on the structure of the tadpole assemblage. In our system of experimental ponds, the strong interaction between Siren and Notophthalmus density did not extend its effects to lower trophic levels, and the direct and indirect effects of Siren did not alter the role of Notophthalmus as a keystone predator.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,,,,,,49,73,76,0,27,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1991,72,3,,,,,827,838,,10.2307/1940585,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FM084,WOS:A1991FM08400007,,,,,2021-09-23,

In single species rearing, the number of larvae of both species decreased during the latter developmental stages, mainly due to cannibalism. When prey was abundant, the survival of both species improved; however, in mixed species rearing, the mortality of C. septempunctata brucki due to cannibalism or intraguild predation was higher than in single species rearing, whereas the mortality was lower in H. axyridis. Consequently, the survival of C. septempunctata brucki decreased while that of H. axyridis improved. In addition, in the 18 intraguild predation events observed, H. axyridis was always the intraguild predator and C. septempunctata brucki was its prey. Thus, when these two species co-exist in the field, H. axyridis is likely to be an important intraguild predator of C septempunctata brucki. In addition, when prey is scarce, it is likely that cannibalism and intraguild predation become more important factors in the intra and interspecific relationships of these two species.","[Sato, Satoru; Shinya, Katsuhiro; Yasuda, Hironori] Yamagata Univ, Dept Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan; [Kindlmann, Pavel] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Dixon, Anthony F.

Arvicoline rodents have a typical, season-dependent, bimodal, age distribution of breeding individuals within a population. This distribution may influence population fluctuations. In this study, we measured effects of interspecific competition from field voles (Microtus agrestis) on various fitness components of female bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) in an age-structured breeding population in large (0.25 ha) outdoor enclosures. We monitored survival, reproduction, and space use of experimental bank vole populations with females from two different age groups. Within the enclosures we manipulated the presence and absence of field voles. When coexisting with field voles, the year-born bank vole females had lower survival rates than the over-wintered ones did. Home ranges of bank voles were smaller in the presence of field voles than in their absence. Characteristics of litters of breeding females were not affected by the competition treatment. Reproduction of the youngest of the year-born females stopped earlier in the season than for over-wintered females although both age groups had reproduced prior to the trial. We did not observe indications of senescence, such as lower reproduction or survival of the over-wintered females in late summer. An earlier cessation of breeding in the younger females suggests an age-specific trade-off of summer reproduction and winter. survival for parous females. Inter- and intraspecific competition seemed to work additively on the year-born, females through direct interference. By selectively reducing survival of younger breeders, interspecific competition could influence age distribution and population growth of breeders toward the end of the breeding season. Because old, over-wintered females are not surviving to the next noribreeding season, the lower survival of young breeders through interspecific competition might impact greatly the structure of the breeding population at the start of the next breeding season, thus altering population growth patterns.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",,,,,,,57,14,17,1,24,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2003,84,12,,,,,3284,3293,,10.1890/02-0220,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,762LN,WOS:000187973500018,,,,,2021-09-23,

Because snails share similar diets, these interactions have been interpreted as the result of exploitative competition, but they could also result from intraguild predation. Here we present three experiments aimed at testing the hypothesis that interspecific interactions among three species of freshwater gastropod (Helisoma trivolvis, Physa acuta and Stagnicola elodes) are mediated by intraguild egg predation. Foraging trials, conducted in a laboratory, showed that some snails readily prey on eggs, but the extent of egg predation depended on both the identity of the snail predator and the identity of the egg mass. Of the three species considered, Stagnicola had the largest effect on egg mortality and Physa had no effect on egg mortality. Foraging trials also showed that the eggs of Physa were the most vulnerable to predators and that the eggs of Stagnicola were largely invulnerable. A study conducted in large outdoor mesocosms assessed the occurrence of egg mortality in an environment of more extensive spatial scale and complexity. The results largely mirrored those of the laboratory study, with Stagnicola being the most voracious predator and the eggs of Physa being most vulnerable to predation. The reproductive success of Physa and Stagnicola raised in sympatry and allopatry was assessed in a mesocosm study conducted over three months. Recruitment of both species was depressed in sympatry, but patterns of growth in the survivors suggest contrasting mechanisms of suppression: Physa suppressed Stagnicola via exploitative competition, but Stagnicola suppressed Physa via egg predation. These experiments support the hypothesis that freshwater snail assemblages are structured by strong interspecific interactions and that a rich interplay of egg predation and interspecific competition underlie interactions among the members of this guild.","Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA","Turner, AM (corresponding author), Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA.",aturner@clarion.edu,,,,,,41,23,23,0,14,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2007,116,11,,,,,1895,1903,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15883.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,236BT,WOS:000251278700012,,,,,2021-09-23,

We investigated nesting behavior, food habits, and interspecific interactions of Short-eared Owls (Asio flammeus) within an arctic tundra raptor community on Herschel Island and Komakuk Beach, northern Yukon, Canada. Short-eared Owls were the least common nesting raptor. We found only three nests, all on Herschel Island. All nests were on relatively elevated sites with fairly substantial vegetative cover. All nests failed in the egg stage, from a combination of human disturbance and possible predation by Arctic Fox (Vulpes lagopus) or Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes). Short-eared Owls nested only in years when small rodent densities were at least 4 to 5 individuals per hectare in the spring. Short-eared Owls ate Northern Collared Lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), Brown Lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus), and Tundra Voles (Microtus oeconomus) almost exclusively, without clear selectivity. Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) killed two adult Short-eared Owls. In northern Yukon, the Short-eared Owl remains an uncommon summer resident and uses the region as a migration route. Spring rodent densities and interspecific predation are prominent limiting factors, and human disturbance also limits nesting success. We recommend restricting access to most tundra areas during periods when the birds are mating, initiating nesting, and incubating eggs. We recommend that human infrastructure be designed so that it cannot support novel nesting (and therefore local range expansion) by other nesting raptors that compete with and prey on Short-earned Owls.","[Reid, Donald G.] Wildlife Conservat Soc Canada, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 5T2, Canada; [Doyle, Frank I.] Wildlife Dynam Consulting Ltd, Smithers, BC V0J 2N0, Canada; [Kenney, Alice J.; Krebs, Charles J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Reid, DG (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc Canada, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 5T2, Canada.",,,,Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada; Inuvialuit Final Agreement Wildlife Implementation Fund; Wildlife Conservation Society Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service (Environment Canada); Western Arctic Field Unit of the Parks Canada Agency,"This research was funded under the International Polar Year Program (Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable Ecosystems) by Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada (now Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada), the Inuvialuit Final Agreement Wildlife Implementation Fund, and Wildlife Conservation Society Canada.

We experimentally examined interactions between two microparasites (entomopathogenic nematodes) isolated from sandy grassland soils of coastal California: Heterorhabditis marelatus (Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema feltiae (Steinernematidae). Heterorhabditis marelatus drives trophic cascades by attacking root- and stem-boring ghost moth caterpillars (Hepialus californicus, Hepialidae), thereby indirectly protecting bush lupine shrubs (Lupinus arboreus, Fabaceae). Extensive field surveys demonstrated sympatric overlap in microhabitat use under lupine canopies and similar mean prevalence of the two nematode species. Using a response-surface design in the laboratory, we varied relative and absolute microparasite densities to test for competitive outcomes within an evolutionary naive host, larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae), and within the native host Hepialus californicus. Independent of conspecific or interspecific density, S. feltiae dominated as expected over H. marelatus within the naive Galleria, but S. feltiae infected hosts at low frequency and showed lower reproductive fitness than H. marelatus within native Hepialus hosts. Contrary to studies that demonstrate the pairwise dominance of steinernematid over heterorhabditid species in laboratory hosts, host resistance to S. feltiae may provide a mechanism for coexistence of multiple microparasite species. We hypothesize that the ubiquitous field prevalence and rapid life history of S. feltiae imply its use of widespread, abundant but small-bodied hosts and indicate the lack of direct competition with H. marelatus in the Hepialus-Lupinus trophic cascade.","[Gruner, Daniel S.; Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kolekar, Arunima] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [McLaughlin, John P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Gruner, DS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",dsgruner@umd.edu,"Gruner, Daniel S./A-5166-2010","Gruner, Daniel S./0000-0002-3153-4297",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0620475],"We thank Evan Preisser, Karthik Ram, the Gruner lab, and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on the manuscript; Betsy Harbert and Wei-Chen Hsu for technical assistance; and the National Science Foundation for financial support (DEB-0620475).

We analysed nest-site characteristics, breeding success and competitive interactions between two apex predator populations. Whereas the Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus has nested in the Judean Foothills (Israel) for a long time, the Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus has only invaded the nesting habitat of the Short-toed Eagle during their breeding season in the last two decades. These two recently sympatric species have similar nesting ecology and frequently use the same nests. They are therefore expected to compete over nesting sites and territories. We analysed interspecific interactions between these two species by combining information from comprehensive observational, experimental, GIS analysis and remote sensing data, deriving 65 variables to characterize the nest- sites used and the breeding success in 381 breeding attempts over four consecutive breeding seasons. To assess interspecific and intraspecific territorial behaviour and aggressiveness, stuffed Long-legged Buzzards and Short-toed Eagles were presented close to nests. Nestsite characteristics overlapped substantially between species, and Long-legged Buzzards occupied 21% of all Short-toed Eagle nests. Intraspecific aggression rates among Long-legged Buzzards were higher than their interspecific aggression rates with Short-toed Eagles and also higher than intraspecific aggression among Short-toed Eagles. Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle breeding densities (1.59 +/- 0.11 and 2.96 +/- 0.11 pairs per 10 km(2), respectively) are likely to be the highest across their respective breeding distributions, with a maximum productivity of 0.96 +/- 0.01 and 0.56 +/- 0.05 (young fledged/breeding pair) for Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle, respectively. Intraspecific interactions among both species play an important role in determining their breeding success and the spatial distribution of nesting sites. Our results suggest that interspecific competition over nesting sites and territories between both species, and the potential dominance of Long-legged Buzzard, has both direct and indirect impacts on the spatial and demographic distribution of Short-toed Eagles due to the recent establishment of Long-legged Buzzard territories in the Judean breeding area.","[Friedemann, Guilad; Leshem, Yossi; Kerem, Lior] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Bar-Massada, Avi] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, Qiryat Tivon, Israel; [Izhaki, Ido] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Fac Nat Sci, Haifa, Israel","Friedemann, G (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.",gilad.fridman@gmail.com,"Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019","Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683",Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF); Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel); Smaller-Winnikow Foundation; Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA); Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI); Rieger Foundation (USA); Raptor Research Foundation (RFF); International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel); Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel),"This research was supported by the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel), Smaller-Winnikow Foundation, Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI), Rieger Foundation (USA), Raptor Research Foundation (RFF), The International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel) and Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel).

Although recently resurrected as an organizing force in arthropod communities on plants, there is still general agreement that resource competition among herbivores is reduced by predators. Here we show the reverse: predators induce interspecific resource competition among herbivores. We found that thrips larvae (Frankliniella occidentalis) use the web produced and inhabited by the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a refuge from predation by the phytoseiid mite Neoseiulus curumeris. Thrips larvae prefer clean plant parts, but move into the web upon perceiving volatile cues associated with thrips and predators. This behaviour leads to lower predation risk, but also to reduced developmental rate and lower production of thrips larvae due to competition with spider mites. In addition, thrips larvae consume spider-mite eggs. Thus, predators induce interspecific competition and intraguild predation among herbivores within refuge space, even when host plants have an overall green appearance.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Systemat & Populat Biol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Pallini, A (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Anim, BR-36571000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545",,,,30,61,65,2,31,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We performed field-cage experiments to detect the presence of both intra- and interspecific competition among adults of two common, grass-feeding grasshoppers, Ageneotettix deorum (Scudder) and Amphitornus coloradus (Thomas). Based on increased mortality and lowered fecundity at higher densities, strong evidence for intraspecific competition exists for both species. Interspecific competition was weaker than intraspecific competition in this study. When interspecific competition existed, it was asymmetric in its effect, with the larger species (A. coloradus) negatively impacting the smaller one (A. deorum). Although there was little evidence for interspecific effects on mortality, egg production was impacted in a size-dependent, asymmetric manner between the two species. Significant density-dependent depression of available food was observed for A. coloradus, the larger species. Experiments were run at high densities (10-30 individuals per square meter), levels only irregularly reached under natural conditions (either in sporadic patches or overall about every 10-12 yr).

Interactions among predators may influence the total efficiency of a predator complex. The effect of intra- and interspecific interactions of the generalist predators Orthotylus marginalis (Heteroptera: Miridae) and Anthocoris nemorum (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) was investigated in a laboratory experiment. Outcomes of the interactions were determined by comparing predation rates on eggs and larvae of the blue willow beetle Phratora vulgatissima of single individuals with those of two individuals of the same or different species. 2. A non-additive, antagonistic effect on predation rates due to intraspecific interactions was found between individuals of A. nemorum. No such effect was found in O. marginalis. These results are as expected as a consequence of differences in behaviour of the two predator species: A. nemorum is a much more active and mobile predator than O. marginalis. 3. Contrary to expectation, interspecific interactions between A. nemorum and O. marginalis did not affect the total predation rate. 4. An observation from the field corroborated the results obtained in the laboratory study; there was no negative relationship between the densities of the two predator species, indicating that the two species do not interact negatively in the field at their natural densities. 5. It is concluded that the additive effect of multiple predator species is of potential value in biological control.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Bjorkman, C (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, POB 7044, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",christer.bjorkman@entom.slu.se,,,,,,22,13,13,1,21,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Delaying introduction of T. sinensis relative to normal egg hatch phenology reduced mortality for T. angustipennis, but did not affect its rate of development.

However, both the study and management of invasive prey have historically overlooked indirect effects. In southern California estuaries, introduction of the Asian nest mussel Arcuatula senhousia has been linked to profound changes in native bivalve assemblages, but the mechanisms of these interactions remain unclear. We performed three field experiments to assess the mechanisms of competition between Arcuatula and native bivalves, and evaluated the potential for Arcuatula to indirectly mediate native predator-prey dynamics. We found that Arcuatula reduces the diversity, abundance, and size of native bivalve recruits by preemptively exploiting space in surface sediments. When paired with native shallow-dwelling clams (Chione undatella and Laevicardium substriatum), Arcuatula reduces adult survival through overgrowth competition. However, Arcuatula also attracts native predators, causing apparent competition by indirectly increasing predation of native clams, especially for poorly defended species. Therefore, invasive prey can indirectly increase predation rates on native competitors by changing the behavior of shared native predators, but the magnitude of apparent competition strongly depends on the vulnerability of natives to predation. Interestingly, our results indicate that the vulnerability of invasive prey to predation can greatly exacerbate impacts on their native competitors. Our findings suggest that consideration of both direct and indirect effects of invasive prey, as well as native predator-prey relationships, should lead to more effective invasive species management.","[Castorani, Max C.

Generalist predator interactions, such as intraguild predation (IGP) and competition, can alleviate predation pressure and weaken top-down control that predators have on lower trophic levels. Centipedes (Chilopoda) and carabid beetles (Coleoptera) are common deciduous forest floor generalist predators that may interact by competing for resources beneath rocks and logs on the forest floor, especially during dry periods when prey become confined to such microhabitats. We used laboratory and field studies to determine whether the carabid beetle, Pterostichus stygicus (Say), and the centipede, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus (Say) co-occur under artificial cover. Additionally, a laboratory mesocosm experiment was used to examine competitive interactions in intra- and interspecific trials. There was significant negative co-occurrence of beetles and centipedes beneath cover objects in the field and laboratory. Pairings of S. sexspinosus and P. stygicus within mesocosms resulted in high mortality of P. stygicus, and reciprocal but asymmetric IGP. Centipedes maintained weight within solitary, intra- and interspecific mesocosm treatments, however, beetles lost mass in all treatments. Scolopocryptops sexspinosus responded more favorably to intra- and interspecific competition than did P. stygicus. Analysis of the leaf litter mesofauna indicated that these predators consumed similar prey in laboratory mesocosms. Our results suggest that species with very different trophic morphology have the potential to compete for shared microhabitat and prey.","[Julian, Michele E.; Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.; Anthony, Carl D.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA; [Julian, Michele E.] Front Range Community Coll, Dept Sci, 2190 Miller Dr, Longmont, CO 80501 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,,,"John Carroll University, University Heights, Ohio; Faculty Summer Research Fellowship","We would like to thank Harry Lee for helping with beetle identification and for being a valuable resource for information about ground beetles.

Effects on predators and competitors could, however, be a concern as Anopheles gambiae s.l. is preyed upon in all life stages. We overview the literature and assess the strength of the ecological interactions identified. Most predators identified consume many other insect species and there is no evidence that any species preys exclusively on any anopheline mosquito. There is one predatory species with a specialisation on blood-fed mosquitoes including An. gambiae s.l.. Evarcha culicivora is a jumping spider, known as the vampire spider, found around Lake Victoria. There is no evidence that these salticids require Anopheles mosquitoes and will readily consume blood-fed Culex. Interspecific competition studies focus on other mosquitoes of larval habitats. Many of these take place in artificial cosms and give contrasting results to semi-field studies. This may limit their extrapolation regarding the potential impact of reduced An. gambiae numbers. Previous mosquito control interventions are informative and identify competitive release and niche opportunism; so while the identity and relative abundance of the species present may change, the biomass available to predators may not.","[Collins, C.

Within antagonist interactions, predation refers to a predator attacking and feeding on a prey while competition is an interaction where individuals compete for a common resource. Worldwide distributions of long-finned pilot whales and killer whales rarely overlap, and they are not known to feed on the same preys. However, in this study, we described the interactions between long-finned pilot whales and killer whales in the Strait of Gibraltar. The former was seen pursuing away the latter in all observations. The main hypotheses for the cause of these interactions are predation or competition. To test both hypotheses, movement patterns and isotopic niches of both species were investigated in the Strait of Gibraltar through satellite tagging and stable isotopes, respectively. Satellite tracks showed no overlap between one tagged pilot whale and one tagged killer whaler's distributions during 21 days. Similarly, Euclidian distances between centroids of Bayesian standard ellipse areas of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were significantly different from zero, showing different isotopic niches for each species. This shows that no competition for the resources should exist between both species in the Strait of Gibraltar and that they do not feed on each other, suggesting that the interactions would not be related to predation. A possible historical presence of marine mammal-eating killer whales in the area, today disappeared, could explain the antipredator defense mobbing-like behavior of pilot whales observed in the Strait.","[De Stephanis, R.; Gimenez, J.] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, GEMA, Seville 41092, Spain; [Esteban, R.; Gauffier, P.; Verborgh, P.] CIRCE Conservat Informat & Res Cetaceans, Cadiz 11390, Spain; [Garcia-Tiscar, S.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, Madrid, Spain; [Sinding, M-H.

We tested experimentally for interactions between mosquito larvae, Culiseta longiareolata, and green toad immatures, Bufo viridis, the two most abundant macrospecies of temporary pools in the Negev Desert, Israel. Since both appear to feed largely on periphyton, and since they co-occur in extremely high densities, competition for food may occur. 2. In artificial outdoor pools, we followed the fate of first-instar Culiseta larvae (50 per litre) and early-stage tadpoles (5 per litre) in the presence or absence of the other species over 1 month. These densities were well within the range of densities found in natural pools. We replicated each treatment five times. 3. Survival of neither species was affected by the other species. However, time to pupation in Culiseta was longer and pupal size was smaller in the presence of Bufo tadpoles. Similarly, tadpole weights were lower and the percentage of Bufo reaching metamorphosis by the end of the experiment was lower in the presence of Culiseta larvae. We attribute these mutual negative effects upon each other to interspecific competition. 4. Late-stage Culiseta larvae also preyed upon Bufo hatchlings in both field enclosure and laboratory experiments. This is the first demonstration of a mosquito larva as a natural predator of a vertebrate. The high predation rates indicate that Culiseta affects Bufo populations significantly via predation in nature. 5. These two surprising roles of a mosquito larva-a competitor and predator of a vertebrate-emphasize that how communities are organized may be misinterpreted by presuming particular roles for species based on taxonomic affiliation.","BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,DEPT BIOL,BIOL CONTROL LAB,IL-84105 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL; UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,COMMUNITY ECOL LAB,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL","BLAUSTEIN, L (corresponding author), UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,COMMUNITY ECOL LAB,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,58,53,63,2,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Yet this pattern of patch use also can be caused by dominant interspecific competitors. We develop a simple theory of this form of apparent predation risk that describes the patch use of an optimal forager confronted with dominant individuals. The theory predicts that subordinate animals should increase their use of safe foraging patches as the density of nearby dominants increases. We tested the theory with meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We used dyadic encounters to confirm that meadow voles are dominant over red-backed voles. We then evaluated their respective foraging patterns in pairs of covered and open patches in 4 adjacent subgrids in an old-field enclosure. Subordinate red-backed voles foraged indifferently between covered and open patches when few meadow voles were present. Red-backed voles increased their use of both patches as the number of nearby meadow voles increased. Giving-up densities were lowest, and harvesting efficiency highest, in covered patches when the number of nearby meadow voles was high. These results document competition between the 2 species and suggest that vigilance toward dominant meadow voles magnifies the risk experienced by red-backed voles in open patches. Investigators assessing foraging behavior between safe and risky patches might misinterpret the competitive effect as predation risk unless they 1st account for competition among foraging individuals.","[Halliday, William D.; Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Halliday, William D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Lakehead University,"We thank M.

Programs to control invaders are common but gauging the effectiveness of such programs using carefully controlled, large-scale field experiments is rare, especially at higher trophic levels. Experimental manipulations coupled with long-term demographic monitoring can reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of interspecific competition among apex predators and suggest mitigation options for invasive species. We used a large-scale before-after control-impact removal experiment to investigate the effects of an invasive competitor, the barred owl (Strix varia), on the population dynamics of an iconic old-forest native species, the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Removal of barred owls had a strong, positive effect on survival of sympatric spotted owls and a weaker but positive effect on spotted owl dispersal and recruitment. After removals, the estimated mean annual rate of population change for spotted owls stabilized in areas with removals (0.2% decline per year), but continued to decline sharply in areas without removals (12.1% decline per year). The results demonstrated that the most substantial changes in population dynamics of northern spotted owls over the past two decades were associated with the invasion, population expansion, and subsequent removal of barred owls. Our study provides experimental evidence of the demographic consequences of competitive release, where a threatened avian predator was freed from restrictions imposed on its population dynamics with the removal of a competitively dominant invasive species.","[Wiens, J.

Intraguild interactions between predators have significant implications for how multiple predators impact on their prey. Carabid assemblages are not generally thought to be structured by interspecific competitive interactions, species relative abundances instead being determined mainly by abiotic factors. However, several field studies report negative associations between the abundance of certain carabid species and the presence of wood ants. 2. Replicated laboratory experiments were used to monitor the behaviour of individual female Abax parallelepipedus (Piller & Mitterpacher) in the presence of a range of wood ant (Formica rufa L.) densities (including ant-free controls) over 23 h. Carabids did not feed when wood ants were present. Running and defence activities were high at low ant densities but decreased with increasing ant density. At the highest ant density, all carabids were killed within the first 2 h of the experiment, but the ants did not consume the carabids after they had killed them. Carabid diurnal activity increased at the higher wood ant densities. 3. Female A. parallelepipedus and Pterostichus madidus (F.) maintained individually in the presence of five wood ants had significantly lower mean body weights and carried fewer eggs after 21 days compared to control beetles that had been kept without ants. 4. The results help to explain the reduced abundance of these two carabid species under field conditions when wood ants are present. We interpret these findings to mean that the interaction between wood ants and carabids is one of asymmetric aggressive interference competition rather than predation.","[Hawes, Cathy; Evans, Hugh F.] Alice Holt Lodge, Forest Res, Surrey, England; [Hawes, Cathy] James Hutton Inst, Dundee, Scotland; [Evans, Hugh F.] Rhodfa Padarn, Forest Res, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Stewart, Alan J.

In this study, we show that there is variation in competitive ability between two clones of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, both of which out-compete a clone of the vetch aphid, Megoura viciae, in the laboratory. We tested whether this variation in competitive ability would alter the outcome of interspecific competition in the field. White one pea aphid clone followed the pattern set in the laboratory, out-competing the Megoura viciae clone, another showed the reverse effect with Megoura viciae dominating. These differences appear to be the result of variation in early population growth rate between the pea aphid clones, rather than predation, although predation did lead to the eventual extinction of colonies. We also questioned whether intra- and interspecific differences in predator escape behaviour could affect the outcome of competition in the field. All three clones responded similarly to the presence of foraging hoverfly larvae (Episyrphus balteatus), but the Megoura viciae clone dropped from the plant significantly less often in response to the presence of a foraging two-spot ladybird (Adalia bipunctata). This work provides evidence that intraspecific variation in competitive ability can alter the outcome of interspecific competitive interactions in nature and suggests that species-specific behavioural. traits may have the potential to modify the outcome of these interactions.

Non-consumptive predator effects are an important driver in predator-prey interactions. While indirect effects of predation risk shape interspecific species interactions, e.g. in fuelling trophic cascades, knowledge about non-consumptive predator effects on intraspecific interactions among intimidated prey is scarce. 2. In laboratory experiments, we tested whether predation by male and female green crabs (Carcinus maenas) is stronger on small than on larger specimens of the periwinkle Littorina littorea, an important herbivore species in intertidal habitats of the temperate zone. Moreover, we asked whether size-specific differences in predation-induced mortality reflect as a stronger effect of predation risk (caused by nearby consuming crabs) on the foraging behaviour of more threatened periwinkles and ultimately on the recruitment success of the brown seaweed Fucus serratus. Furthermore, predator activity and prey abundance was measured in the field and the efficacy of predation risk on the survival of seaweed recruits was assessed in three field experiments with two different set-ups (open plots and crab exclosures). 3. Male crabs consumed smaller periwinkles more often than larger conspecifics, while females refused periwinkles as food. In summer, 80-90% of periwinkles in the field attained a size at which crab predation was minimal in laboratory assays. The observed up to 15-fold decrease in the consumption of seaweed recruits by periwinkles in the presence of nearby consuming crabs in laboratory assays was, however, independent of the size of periwinkles. Predation risk effects from the laboratory were only confirmed in field experiments using crab exclosures but not with open plots, suggesting an artefact due to trespassing by wild crabs in the open plot set-up. 4. Synthesis. Predation risk may not change intraspecific competition for food in L. littorea. Yet, risk effects on foraging behaviour of periwinkles that experience a low threat of real predation indicate that non-consumptive predator effects may affect prey population dynamics more strongly than consumptive predator effects. Thus predation risk effects may be indirectly beneficial for the survival of basal species like perennial seaweeds, as experimental evidence from field and laboratory experiments indicates.","[Molis, Markus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Sect Funct Ecol, Marine Stn, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany; [Preuss, Inken] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainable Sci, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Firmenich, Annika] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Dept Marine Biol, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Ellrich, Julius] Univ Marburg, Dept Morphol & Evolut Anim, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Molis, M (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Sect Funct Ecol, Marine Stn, Kurpromenade 201, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany.",markus.molis@awi.de,,"Ellrich, Julius/0000-0003-0884-3726",,,,49,15,15,2,52,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

In laboratory experiments cores containing no macrofauna had significantly higher densities of diatoms than cores with C. volutator and cores with N. diversicolor after 8 d. In field experiments the densities of diatoms increased where C. volulator were removed, by spraying with insecticide, and where N. diversicolor were prevented from surface deposit feeding, by the insertion of porous mats under the surface. The mean daily rates of consumption of diatoms by individual C, volutator and N. diversicolor in the field were estimated to be 2150 to 3767 and 5476 to 12 184 cells respectively. In the laboratory the effects of C, volutator and N, diversicolor on the species composition of the diatom assemblage were similar. In the field the assemblages that developed where predation was reduced were different because of initial differences in diatom assemblage structure in the 2 experimental areas. The laboratory results showed that C. volutator and N, diversicolor may feed on the same species of diatoms when presented with the same diatom assemblage, indicating that interspecific competition for food may be important under some natural conditions.","UNIV LONDON QUEEN MARY & WESTFIELD COLL, SCH BIOL SCI, LONDON E1 4NS, ENGLAND; NAT HIST MUSEUM, DEPT BOT, LONDON SW7 5BD, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,35,46,47,0,11,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

On exposing pairs of triclad species to D. cephalotes, significantly more P. felina than Ph. vitta were consumed, whereas similar numbers were eaten in each of the other two triclad combinations. Cannibalism and interspecific predation by triclad species were not observed. It is concluded that predation is unlikely to have a major influence in determining the observed distribution and abundance of triclad species in a Welsh study stream which harbours low numbers of effective predators. The de Wit model of competition was used to examine the competitive relationships between Ph. vitta, and C. alpina and P. felina, using chironomids or tubificid worms as food. In mixed cultures of Ph. vitta and P. felina fed on tubificids a stable equilibrium existed within the range of relative densities used in the experiments, whereas Ph. vitta was competitively superior to C. alpina in cultures fed on each of the food types, and to P. felina fed on chironomids. However, in theory, an equilibrium could occur when 10 or 6-7 times as many Ph. vitta as P. felina and C. alpina respectively are in the culture, when intraspecific rather than interspecific competition would become more important. Where the three triclad species coexist in the Welsh study stream, they are in similar numbers. This could imply that food is not limiting, with no consequent interspecific competition, or that the laboratory experiments were too simplistic to allow any interpretation of the field situation.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUT BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,1,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR 15,1991,211,1,,,,,43,50,,10.1007/BF00008615,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,FG274,WOS:A1991FG27400005,,,,,2021-09-23,

Highly complex habitats, for example, may reduce predation and competition, allowing more individuals living together in a certain area. However, the strength and direction of such interactions can differ strongly and are context dependent. Furthermore, as habitat characteristics are rapidly changing due to anthropogenic impacts, it becomes increasingly important to understand such interactions. Here, we studied the interactive effects of predation and competition on common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) recruitment, growth and survival under different habitat characteristics in the Wadden Sea, one of the world's largest intertidal ecosystems. In a predator-exclosure experiment, we manipulated cockle densities (100 vs. 1000 individuals m(-2)) and shorebird predation at two sites differing in habitat characteristics, namely at the wake of a blue mussel bed (Mytilus edulis) and at an adjacent sandy site. We found that recruitment was higher in the mussel-modified habitat, most likely due to reduction of hydrodynamic stress. Although bird predation strongly reduced recruit density, the combined effects still yielded more recruitment at the vicinity of the mussel bed compared to the sandy area. Furthermore, we found that high cockle densities combined with high densities of other potential prey (i.e. mussels) at the mussel-modified site, mitigated predation effects for adult cockles. Apart from these positive effects on adults, mussel-modified habitat reduced cockle growth, most likely by reducing hydrodynamics in the wake of the mussel bed and by increasing inter-specific competition for food. Our study experimentally underpins the importance of habitat characteristics, competition and predation in interactively structuring intertidal communities.","[de Fouw, Jimmy] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van der Zee, Els M.] Altenburg & Wymenga Ecol Res, Suderwei 2, NL-9269 TZ Veenwouden, Netherlands; [van Gils, Jan A.; van der Veer, Henk W.; Piersma, Theunis; van der Heide, Tjisse] Univ Utrecht, NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Eriksson, Britas Klemens; Olff, Han; Piersma, Theunis; van der Heide, Tjisse] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Weerman, Ellen J.] Univ Appl Sci, HAS Den Bosch, Onderwijsblvd 221, NL-5223 DE sHertogenbosch, Netherlands; [Donadi, Serena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources SLU Aqua, Stangholmsvagen 2, SE-17893 Drottningholm, Sweden","de Fouw, J (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.",j.defouw@science.ru.nl,"van der Heide, Tjisse/M-3000-2013; Eriksson, Britas Klemens/D-8601-2015","Donadi, Serena/0000-0002-8920-9630; Eriksson, Britas Klemens/0000-0003-4752-922X; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",NWO grant of the 'Nationaal Programma Zee-en Kustonderzoek' [839.08.310],"thank T.

Both species have persisted in the lake for decades, but their water-column densities are negatively correlated. The larger Daphnia pulicaria dominates in some years, the smaller D. galeata mendotae in others, and in some years one species replaces the other seasonally. Although this pattern results in part from annual variation in vertebrate predation pressure, predation alone cannot explain the irregular daphnid dynamics. In 1992-1995, I examined the water-column abundances, birth and death rates of both species. D. pulicaria dominated in two years, D. galeata mendotae was replaced by D. pulicaria in one year and in 1994, both species persisted in low numbers. To test the effect of temporal changes on the strength of intra- and interspecific competition on both juvenile and adult daphnids, I manipulated a series of field enclosures in 1994 and 1995. The outcome of competition varied within and between years, and its effects were most evident at the highest densities and lowest resource levels. For adults of both species, the effects of interspecific competition were detected more often than those of intraspecific competition. Lipid reserves (a metric of fitness) among juveniles were generally low, with those of D. galeata mendotae often being less than those of D. pulicaria. Contrary to the results of other studies examining competition in daphnids, spatial segregation and predictable within year reversals in competitive dominance most likely do not play a large role in fostering coexistence of the Oneida Lake daphnids. Instead, coexistence of these competitors is promoted by interannual variation and long-lived diapausing eggs.","Cornell Univ, Ecol & Systemat Sect, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Caceres, CE (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",caceres@mail.inhs.uiuc.edu,,,,,,69,44,45,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,233,244,,10.1007/s004420050512,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700029,28308457,,,,2021-09-23,

Predation risk has been shown to regulate mutualism dynamics in species-specific case studies; however, we lack studies which investigate whether predation can also explain broader patterns of mutualism evolution. We report that fish-anemone mutualisms have evolved on at least 55 occasions across 16 fish families over the past 60 million years and that adult body size is associated with the ontogenetic stage of anemone mutualisms: larger-bodied species partner with anemones as juveniles, while smaller-bodied species partner with anemones throughout their lives. Field and laboratory studies show that predators target smaller prey, that smaller fishes associate more with anemones, and that these relationships confer protection to small fishes. Our results indicate that predation is likely driving the recurrent convergent evolution of fish-anemone mutualisms and suggest that similar ecological processes may have selected convergence in interspecies interactions in other animal clades.","[Feeney, William E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Feeney, William E.; Brooker, Rohan M.; Johnston, Lane N.; Lecchini, David; Dixson, Danielle L.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Brooker, Rohan M.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Gilbert, James D.

I studied the role of competition in structuring the benthic community of hard substrates in a coldwater stream dominated by mobile insects that grazed upon periphyton and by relatively sessile filter-feeding insects. I expected competitive interactions among periphyton grazers to be significant and chronic because the community was not subject to frequent flow-related disturbances and grazer densities were high despite consistently low periphyton availability. Laboratory and field experiments were performed to determine: (1) the potential for, and relative strengths of, competition within and between two common, widely distributed grazers, the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior and the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus, (2) the role of Glossosoma in affecting the organization of the community, and (3) the mechanisms of competition. Strong intraspecific effects on Baetis survivorship were observed in laboratory enclosures within the range of natural densities, but interspecific effects were not detected. Glossosoma survivorship was not affected by competition with itself or with Baetis. Individuals of both species experienced significant intra- and interspecific effects on growth, but the relative strengths of these effects differed between species. The effects of Baetis on Glossosoma growth were stronger than the effects of Glossosoma on itself. In contrast, Baetis growth was much less affected by the presence of Glossosoma than by conspecifics. Both species strongly depressed periphyton abundance, indicating that observed competitive effects resulted, in part, from exploitation. Exclusion of Glossosoma from habitats in the field resulted in a marked increase in periphyton biomass throughout a 10-mo study in which the movements of other taxa were not restricted. Most periphyton grazers responded to this increase in resource availability with increased densities in the Glossosoma exclusion treatment relative to the control. The size distributions of several chironomid grazers suggested that larval growth rates were greater in the absence of Glossosoma than with Glossosoma present. The larvae of two relatively small-bodied filter-feeders (Simulium, Rheotanytarsus) responded positively to the removal of Glossosoma, but larger bodied species (Hydropsyche, Brachycentrus) were not affected. There was not strong evidence for seasonal variation in the intensity of competition. Effects of Glossosoma on filter-feeders appeared to result from a form of interference competition, but there was no evidence for the operation of interference among grazers. Glossosoma had no effect on the colonization of habitats by grazers, and the feeding rates of Baetis and Glossosoma were not affected by the presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics. Contrasting patterns in periphyton abundance between the laboratory and field experiments suggest that, when their movements are unrestricted, Baetis departs periphyton patches at higher food densities than does Glossosoma to search for food elsewhere. Thus, strong competitive effects of Baetis on Glossosoma in the laboratory experiments resulted, in part, from limited Baetis dispersal in the enclosures. Baetis and Glossosoma appear to exhibit trade-offs in feeding efficiency and the costs of exploiting food patches that should help to ensure their coexistence on a spatially variable food resource. Results of this study suggest that the structure of benthic communities in coldwater streams composed largely of mobile taxa may often be strongly influenced by Glossosoma. A similar role has been observed for sessile, territorial grazers in other systems. Glossosoma's dominance does not result from aggressive behavior, but from physiological, behavioral, and life cycle attributes that allow it to regulate periphyton biomass throughout the year.",,"KOHLER, SL (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, 607 E PEABODY DR, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA.",,,,,,,89,139,144,0,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Autoparasitoids are intraguild consumers that attack and kill heterospecific and conspecific parasitoids as well as immature stages of hemipteran hosts, such as aphids, whiteflies and soft scales. Field experiments assessing the importance of interspecific competition between autoparasitoids and primary parasitoids, as well as its impact on herbivore suppression, are scarcely found in the ecological literature. 2. Using field data from 40 olive orchards, this study examined the mechanisms that regulate: (i) the interspecific competition between primary parasitoids of the genus Metaphycus and the autoparasitoid Coccophagus lycimnia; and (ii) the density of their shared herbivore host, the soft scale Saissetia oleae. 3. Metaphycus parasitoids used smaller hosts than C. lycimnia, yet did not outcompete C. lycimnia. On the other hand, C. lycimnia preferred to use Metaphycus females as secondary hosts for producing males rather than their own females. This preference might explain why the autoparasitoid negatively affected the density of the primary parasitoids. 4. Parasitism by the autoparasitoid C. lycimnia at the beginning of the season was the sole variable positively related to host mortality throughout the season, showing its greater effect on herbivore suppression. 5. In this study, an autoparasitoid, inferior at resource exploitation, was shown to outcompete a primary parasitoid without disrupting herbivore suppression.","[Marrao, Rosalina; Pereira, Jose A.] Inst Politecn Braganca, Escola Super Agr, CIMO, Braganca, Portugal; [Frago, Enric] CIRAD, Ctr Biol Gest Populat, UMR CBGP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Tena, Alejandro] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Ctra CV 315,Km 10-7, E-46113 Moncada, Spain","Tena, A (corresponding author), Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Ctra CV 315,Km 10-7, E-46113 Moncada, Spain.",atena@ivia.es,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Pereira, Jose A./L-6798-2014","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Pereira, Jose A./0000-0002-2260-0600",,,,44,0,0,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Although many species of voles usually coexist and are in severe competition for food and breeding space, the role of interspecific competition in vole cycles has never been evaluated statistically After studying community effects on the population dynamics of the gray-sided vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in the subarctic birch forest at Kilpisjarvi, Finland, we report statistical results showing that both interspecific and intraspecific effects are important in the direct year-to-year density dependence, However, interspecific effects are-not detectable in the 2-year delayed density dependence that is crucial for generating the characteristic cycles. Furthermore, we show that most of the competition takes place during the winter. The results are evaluated against two models of community dynamics. One assumes that the delayed effects are caused by an interaction with a specialist predator, and the other assumes that they are caused by overgrazing food plants. These statistical results show that vole cycles may be generated by a species-specific trophic interaction. The results also suggest that the gray-sided vole may be the focal species in the birch-forest community, as field voles may be in the taiga and as lemmings may be on the tundra.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Finnish Forest Res Inst, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland","Stenseth, NC (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, POB 1050, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",n.c.stenseth@bio.uio.no,"Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016; Hansen, Thomas F/B-9021-2009","Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; ",,,,46,79,82,0,40,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

The relative importance of each type of interaction is usually a function of the relative size of the organisms involved. This study used field experiments to assess potential size-dependent interactions among small juvenile killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) and grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and larger adult killifish. Density, species combinations, and predation risk were manipulated within field enclosures on an intertidal salt marsh on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects between small juveniles (larval killifish and postlarval grass shrimp) were examined in the absence and presence of predators (larger adult killifish) to determine interactions and modifications of interactions due to predators. In the absence of predators both negative intraspecific and interspecific effects occurred in the form of reduced growth of juvenile grass shrimp. Survival of juvenile shrimp was the same in the presence or absence of juvenile killifish. However, when larger adult killifish were present, the interspecific competitive effect of reduced growth in juvenile grass shrimp was not significantly different from controls. Growth and survival of juvenile fish were unaffected by increased density of conspecific juveniles and the presence of juvenile grass shrimp and adult fish predators. These results provide field evidence for interspecific competitive interactions between juveniles of two of the most abundant species of nekton utilizing salt marsh habitat along the eastern coast of North America. However, when larger adult killifish predators were present these interspecific competitive effects among similar sized juvenile killifish and grass shrimp disappeared. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We investigated the recent successful invasion of the Pacific crabs Hemigrapsus takanoi and H. sanguineus to the southeastern North Sea coast with respect to their recruitment patterns, as well as interactions of juvenile with sub-adult individuals among the Pacific crabs and with native shore crabs Carcinus maenas. A field survey of juvenile native and introduced crab abundances (carapace width 1.4-10 mm) was conducted in the northern Wadden Sea, spanning 24 months from 2014 to 2016. The survey revealed different seasonal recruitment patterns of native C maenas and both introduced Hemigrapsus species. Native shore crabs showed a single recruitment peak from June to July, while Hemigrapsus spp. mainly recruited from August to early September, but recruits occurred in low densities throughout the winter until the end of the following spring season. Field experiments on the effects of larger crabs on the recruitment intensity showed that recruitment of H. takanoi was enhanced by the presence of larger congeners, but remained unaffected by larger C. maenas. Recruitment of juvenile C maenas, by contrast, was reduced by the presence of larger Hemigrapsus spp. Additional laboratory experiments revealed high rates of cannibalism on newly recruited C. maenas by subadult conspecifics as well as strong predation by larger Hemigrapsus spp. In contrast, newly recruited Hemigrapsus spp. had a much lower risk of being preyed on by subadult conspecifics and native shore crabs. Our results suggest that the timing of recruitment in combination with low intraspecific competition and reduced predation pressure by native shore crabs are crucial for the rapid and ongoing establishment of Hemigrapsus spp. in the Wadden Sea.

While its occurrence is predicted to increase in the future, we have little understanding of mechanisms that underlie changes in the fish community associated with coral degradation. The present study uses a field-based experiment to examine how the intensity of interference competition between juveniles of two species of damselfish changes as healthy corals degrade through thermal bleaching. The mortality of a damselfish that is a live coral specialist (Pomacentrus moluccensis) increased on bleached and dead coral in the presence of the habitat generalist (Pomacentrus amboinensis). Increased mortality of the specialist was indirectly owing to enhanced aggression by the generalist forcing the specialist higher up and further away from shelter on bleached and dead coral.

Their space use was monitored using tracking stations distributed in field and forest plots along a distance gradient from buildings and analyzed using the occupancy-modeling framework. For all three species occupancy decreased with increased distance from buildings, although for the fox the pattern was relatively weak. The occurrence of cats at the stations was higher in the forest than in the field; for fox and dog, there was a strong variation between study plots. For all three predators, the probability of detection was higher during the night than during the day and varied between the seasons; however, the exact patterns were species-specific. The presence of one predator was also linked to the presence of the other two species generally, a given species was detected more frequently in the absence of the other two species.

The rationale behind this approach is twofold. First, interspecific competition among herbivorous arthropods is thought to be weak; populations are kept at low levels through the action of natural enemies. Second, the potential benefits of an herbivorous biological control agent must be weighed against the damage it causes to the host plant through its feeding. In the field we have been successful at using less economically important Willamette mites to control economically important Pacific mites. In greenhouse and field experiments reported here, we examined both direct and indirect mechanisms (via the host plant or a shared predator) to explain this negative interaction. In our first greenhouse experiment we injured leaves on single canes of young Zinfandel grapevines with Willamette mites at four density levels, removed these mites and then measured consequences of this past injury on Pacific mites placed on newly produced leaves. Pacific mite populations were reduced significantly by previous Willamette mite injury, suggesting a systemic induced response. In our second greenhouse experiment we measured the relative importance of interspecific interactions between concurrent populations of Willamette and Pacific mites, direct predation by a phytoseiid predator, and interactions between predation and competition (apparent competition). Predators and prey were confined to single canes and, at this small scale, direct predation was of overriding importance while interspecific competition and apparent competition were not significant in determining Pacific mite populations. We examined the relative importance of an early season release of Willamette mites, predaceous mites, or both in a large field experiment conducted in a commercial Zinfandel vineyard. Pacific mite populations were most strongly reduced by the early release of Willamette mites and by midseason abundance of predaceous mites. Our ANOVA results did not detect a significant interaction between the early season release of Willamette mites and predaceous mites. The presence of Willamette mites did not make releases of predators more effective at controlling Pacific mites. Grape yield and berry sugar concentration were unaffected by either Willamette mite or predaceous mite treatments in the year of the mite releases nor in the following season. Path analysis showed that Willamette mite density was never strongly negatively correlated with Pacific mite density in the subsequent time period (2-wk intervals between sampling dates), despite the strong negative effect that the early-season release of Willamette mites had on Pacific mite densities later in the season. This suggests that Willamette mites affected Pacific mites indirectly.",,"ENGLISHLOEB, GM (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,34,33,33,0,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Studying these interactions under fluctuating food availability, while taking habitat characteristics into account, offers a quasi-experimental setup to determine the relative impact of con-and heterospecifics on reproductive success of predators. We analyzed the settlement decisions and reproductive success of Eurasian Pygmy Owls (Glaucidium passerinum) in the presence of both breeding conspecifics and their competitor and intraguild predator, Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus), under fluctuating abundance of their primary prey (voles). We used detailed data, collected across 11 years in a large study area (1300 km(2)), on the spatial and temporal variation of habitat characteristics in all available nesting sites, local densities of both species, and vole abundance. We found that Pygmy Owls strongly avoided breeding close to conspecifics but did not avoid Tengmalm's Owl nests. Nest box occupation of Pygmy Owls was positively correlated to the proportion of old spruce, mature and old pine forests, and farmlands, and occupation probability was higher at high vole abundance and in areas occupied in previous years. Pygmy Owl avoidance of conspecifics decreased when voles were abundant. At high conspecific density, Pygmy Owls showed lower hatching success and delayed hatching date, in agreement with the observed spatial avoidance. Finally, even though breeding Pygmy Owls did not spatially avoid Tengmalm's Owls, the density of heterospecifics correlated with low hatching and fledging success in Pygmy Owls. This suggests short term fitness costs when living close to competitors, even when lethal effects of intraguild interactions are subtle. Our results suggest that joint costs of exploitative and interference competition by Tengmalm's Owls, as well as intraguild predation, were lower than those induced by intraspecific competition only. This result might be due to the similar body size between the species considered, Tengmalm's Owls being only twice as large as Pygmy Owls. Interactions among con-and heterospecifics can therefore modify the spatial settlement and reproductive success of individuals on a landscape scale, also within the predator guild.","[Morosinotto, Chiara; Villers, Alexandre; Thomson, Robert L.; Varjonen, Rauno; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Villers, Alexandre] Univ Rochelle, CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UMR7372, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Thomson, Robert L.] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa","Morosinotto, C (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",chimor@utu.fi,"Morosinotto, Chiara/AAK-5266-2020; Villers, Alexandre/W-8184-2019; Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Morosinotto, Chiara/0000-0002-9172-894X; Villers, Alexandre/0000-0003-3050-4106","Center for International Mobility (CIMO [TM-07-4819]; Finnish Cultural Foundation-South Ostrobothnia Regional fund; Turku University Foundation; Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Biological Interactions Graduate School; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [138049, 123379, 136717, 250709]","The two-first authors (C.

This may happen via differential individual properties of prey animals (e.g. vigilance, escape) or via habitat effects making hunting by a predator easier and more rewarding in some habitats, or both. Furthermore, community dynamics may be influenced by predator mediated apparent competition, in which an increase in one prey type has negative effects on another prey type indirectly via the shared predator. We summarize the current knowledge from the field in a model predator-prey system consisting of sympatric boreal vole species and their common specialist predator and review field studies using predator manipulation and studies on the responses of individuals in the laboratory and in outdoor enclosures. The vole species studied represent different prey types that are thought to have different vulnerabilities. Our observations on the main resident specialist predator, the least weasel (Mustela nivalis nivalis L.), show that it hunts according to prey availability and suitability of the hunting habitat. Prey voles respond to the presence of the predator behaviorally in various ways to avoid predation. We conclude that even if the least weasel is a specialized predator of small rodents it acts like a generalist predator within the small rodent guild and may facilitate the coexistence of prey species via predator switching. This may lead to interspecific synchrony between prey populations, which has often been observed. We suggest that the processes determining the community impact of predator-prey interactions are driven by the behavioral arms race between the predator and the prey, together with the habitat-dependent density of prey and net gain for the predator.","[Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland","Sundell, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",janne.sundell@helsinki.fi,,,"Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [52045, 44887, 208478]","We are grateful to the Academy of Finland (projects 52045, 44887 and 208478) for funding our research.

For furtive predators, like the predatory midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza which preys on aphids while simultaneously residing and remaining undetected within their colonies, oviposition behaviour is crucial because these slow moving offspring are restrained to their natal colony. Here we develop a new model for predicting the optimum number of eggs that a furtive predator should lay in an aphid colony, based on: (1) the number of available prey (aphids); (2) the protection from predation conferred by hiding in the colony and (3) the effects of interspecific and intraspecific competition. We also explore the effect of aphid attendance by ants on oviposition behavior. We compare model predictions with empirical field observations of the clutch sizes of A. aphidimyza in apple orchards. The simplest of the four models best fits the observed data and provides the first field evidence that a furtive predator adjusts its clutch size as a function of prey density. The slope of the relationship between clutch size and aphid number is quite close to that predicted by our models suggesting that intra-clutch competition is the main factor governing furtive aphid midge oviposition choice.","[Sentis, Arnaud; Lucas, Eric; Vickery, William L.] Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Sentis, A (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, Dept Sci Biol, CP 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",asentis@hotmail.fr,"Sentis, Arnaud/K-5004-2014","Sentis, Arnaud/0000-0003-4617-3620",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"This work was funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grants to Eric Lucas and William L.

Most studies have focused on the effect of large invasive fishes such as salmonids, whereas the effect of smaller fish on amphibians has been seldom investigated. We experimentally studied effects of the invasive Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) on pygmy newts (Triturus pygmaeus), a species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We set up outdoor mesocosms in Doana National Park with native aquatic flora and invertebrate fauna, and containing larval newts at two experimental densities. Density of larval newts was also crossed with presence or absence of mosquitofish, either free-swimming or caged, in order to distinguish consumptive and non-consumptive effects. Increased density of coexisting larval newts did not reduce their survival, but reduced their growth and development. Newt survival and size at metamorphosis were dramatically reduced in the presence of free-swimming mosquitofish, whether at low or high fish densities. Caged mosquitofish, however, had no effect on larval newts. In laboratory trials, mosquitofish preyed more efficiently on insect larvae than did larval pygmy newts, highlighting the high competitive potential of mosquitofish. This was confirmed by the depletion of zooplankton that free fish caused in the experimental outdoor mesocosms. Our study suggests that invasive mosquitofish exert a high negative impact on coexisting newt populations. Such effects can be explained by a combination of direct predation, injuries caused by predation attempts, and intense competitive exploitation of common food resources.","[Cabrera-Guzman, Elisa; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Ave Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain; [Cabrera-Guzman, Elisa] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Cabrera-Guzman, E; Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Ave Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain.",elisa.cabrera_guzman@okstate.edu; igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014","Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in RDI [SEV-2012-0262, SO-07]; CONACYT (ConsejoNacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia deMexico)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [204202]","We thank Lola Asencio, Rosa Arribas, Pablo Burraco, Rafael Carmona, Sara Castro, Carmen Fernandez, Pilar Fernandez, Ana Herrero, Maria Leon, Raquel Lopez and Daniel Moen for help in the field or in the laboratory.

Lotka-Volterra equations (LVEs) are known to be the most popular model, and they are mainly applied to the systems of predation and competition. However, LVEs often fail to catch the population dynamics of mutualism; the population sizes of species increase infinitely under certain condition (divergence problem). Furthermore, LVEs never predicts the Allee effect in the systems of obligate mutualism. Instead of LVEs, several models have been presented for mutualism; unfortunately, they are rather complicated. It is, therefore, necessary to introduce a simpler theory for mutualism. In the present paper, we apply the lattice gas model which corresponds to the mean-field theory of the usual lattice model. The derived equations are cubic and contain only essential features for mutualism. In the case of obligate mutualism, the dynamics exhibits the Allee effect, and it is almost the same as in the male-female systems. In our model, the population sizes never increase infinitely, because our model contains not only intra- but also interspecific competitions. If the density of one species increases disproportionately in respect of its mutual partners, then this might imply downward pressure on the population abundance of the mutual partner species and such feedback would eventually act as a controlling influence on the population abundance of either species. We discuss several assumptions in our model; in particular, if both species can occupy in each cell simultaneously, then the interspecific competition disappears. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The outcomes of such experiments are often difficult to anticipate solely on the basis of intuition. This is because the effects of a perturbation may pass through a complex network of direct and indirect pathways in a food web, and the outcome may be highly sensitive to the strength of interactions among species. One solution to understanding outcomes of press experiments is to quantify first the community matrix, the matrix of measured direct interactions between all species in a food web, and then obtain the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of the community matrix predicts the effect of all species presses on all other species. I evaluated the utility of the inverse community matrix in predicting the outcomes of press experiments in an old-field food web. I used data from field and laboratory experiments to quantify the interaction strengths between grasshoppers, four old-field plants, and nitrogen supply. These values were used to parameterize the community matrix and obtain its inverse in a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was used to predict the mean and standard error in the outcome of a simultaneous nitrogen and herbivore press on food-web structure and dynamics. The predictions were compared with data from an enclosure experiment in the field in which I manipulated nitrogen supply and herbivore abundance. There was a high degree of uncertainty predicted and observed in the study system. Despite this, I show that the degree and the sources of uncertainty were predictable for each species. This suggests that the inverse community matrix offers a useful theoretical benchmark for understanding the outcome of field press experiments.","YALE UNIV,CTR COMPUTAT ECOL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511","Schmitz, OJ (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH FORESTRY & ENVIRONM STUDIES,370 PROSPECT ST,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511, USA.",,,,,,,54,96,98,1,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1997,78,1,,,,,55,69,,,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WD345,WOS:A1997WD34500004,,,,,2021-09-23,

Interactions with classical predators (e.g., those not competing for shared resources) can strongly influence nest-site selection, but whether intraguild predation also influences this behavior is unknown. We tested whether risk of predation from an intraguild predator [the diurnal scincid lizard Eutropis (Mabuya) longicaudata] influences nest-site selection by its prey (the nocturnal gecko Gekko hokouensis) on Orchid Island, Taiwan. These two species putatively compete for shared resources, including invertebrate prey and nesting microhabitat, but the larger E. longicaudata also predates G. hokouensis (but not its hard-shelled eggs). Both species nested within a concrete wall containing a series of drainage holes that have either one (closed-in) or two openings (open). In allopatry, E. longicaudata preferred to nest within holes that were plugged by debris (thereby protecting eggs from water intrusion), whereas G. hokouensis selected holes that were open at both ends (facilitating escape from predators). When we experimentally excluded E. longicaudata from its preferred nesting area, G. hokouensis not only nested in higher abundances, but also modified its nest-site selection, such that communal nesting was more prevalent and both open and closed-in holes were used equally. Egg viability was unaffected by the choice of hole type, but was reduced slightly (by 7%) in the predator exclusion area (presumably due to higher local incubation temperatures). Our field experiment demonstrates that intraguild predators can directly influence the nest density of prey by altering maternal nest-site selection behavior, even when the predator and prey are active at different times of day and the eggs are not at risk of predation.","[Huang, Wen-San] Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Taichung, Taiwan; [Pike, David A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Huang, WS (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Taichung, Taiwan.",wshuang@mail.nmns.edu.tw,"Pike, David A/B-2032-2012","Huang, Wen-San/0000-0003-0073-3557","Kuo Wu Hsiu Luan Culture and Education Foundation; National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC96-2621-B-178-002-MY3]; National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan [NMNSHP97-002]","We are grateful to C.

Previous studies have demonstrated the important role that predators play in this process but not the impact of competitors on selective predation. We use a combination of lab and field studies to evaluate the effect of the presence of adult competitor damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus moluccensis; family Pomacentridae) on the selective mortality of newly-arrived (settled) lemon damselfish (P. moluccensis) by resident predator fishes (Pseudochromis fuscus Pseudochromidae and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus Apogonidae). Lab trials consisted of mesocosm experiments in which the behaviour, mortality, and physiological condition (measured as lipid content) of surviving P. moluccensis settlers from each of three treatments: (1) predators absent, (2) predators present, and (3) predators and competitors present, were compared. The field study involved stocking newly settled P. moluccensis on natural bommies (patch reefs) which had either been subject to a partial removal of resident fish (predators and competitors) or left alone. Results indicated there was very strong condition-based selective mortality in both the lab and field trials. In both cases there was a strong positive relationship between mortality and the lipid content of surviving fish; implying low-condition fish were selectively removed. The mesocosm trials indicated that the strength of mortality as well as condition selectivity was higher when competitors were present than when they were absent. Behavioural observations in the mesocosm study suggest that attention by juvenile P. moluccensis to the movements and occasional chases of the competitors (especially D. aruanus) reduced their vigilance to the predators. These results suggest the important and interactive roles which condition of newly settled reef fish and interspecific competition can play in the outcomes of post-settlement predation.","[Figueira, Will F.; Booth, David J.; Gregson, Marcus A.] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environ Resource Management, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Figueira, WF (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environ Resource Management, Dept Environm Sci, POB 123,Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",william.figueira@uts.edu.au,"Figueira, Will/A-5163-2009","Figueira, Will/0000-0001-9472-8710; Booth, David/0000-0002-8256-1412",,,,57,15,15,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2008,156,1,,,,,215,226,,10.1007/s00442-008-0985-2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,289DD,WOS:000255034300021,18305966,,,,2021-09-23,

Microhabitat selection of Calopteryx splendens and Erythromnia najas was further examined in the laboratory, individually at different larval densities and in the presence of the other species and a predator. - E. najas, Ischnura elegans and Platycnemis pennipes showed significant preferences for particular aquatic macrophytes compared to others in the field, whereas C. splendens did not discriminate between the investigated plant species. Only limited spatial separation was apparent between the larvae of different species, as preferences for the same macrophyte species were found. - When kept separate and at low densities, larvae of C. splendens and E. najas inhabited significantly different microhabitats in the laboratory. At high intraspecific abundances, spatial overlap between the two species became apparent as both increasingly occupied less preferred substrata, which is in concurrence with the ideal free distribution model of habitat selection. E. najas showed no change in perch selection in the presence of C. splendens at high densities. - In this instance, intraspecific competition therefore appeared to be more important than interspecific competition with other Zygoptera in determining the microdistribution of E. najas. In the field, the niches of the two species may be more adequately separated on the basis of prey selection or hunting behaviour. E. najas also actively reacted to the presence of a predator, indicating some flexibility of response regarding perch selection.","Univ Essex, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England","Hofmann, TA (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Dept Biol Sci, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",tahofmp@essex.ac.uk,,,,,,25,5,6,1,7,SOC INT ODONATOLOGICA,BILTHOVEN,"PO BOX 256, 3720 AG BILTHOVEN, NETHERLANDS",0375-0183,,,ODONATOLOGICA,Odonatologica,MAR 1,2005,34,1,,,,,27,36,,,,,10,Entomology,Entomology,903FX,WOS:000227412300003,,,,,2021-09-23,

Researchers have frequently examined the roles of competition and predation in terrestrial or semi-aquatic communities of salamanders, but have rarely examined the influence of these factors between these communities. We conducted mesocosm and laboratory behavioral experiments (1) to test hypotheses, derived from by a previous laboratory study, in a semi-natural setting and (2) to formulate new hypotheses regarding novel species-pair combinations. Our mesocosm experiments did not support a previous hypothesis of predation by Desmognathus fuscus (a semi-aquatic species) on Plethodon cinereus (a terrestrial species), but did support a prediction that P cinereus would avoid D. fuscus. We predicted that behavioral experiments between pairs of semi-aquatic species would demonstrate predatory behavior by D. fuscus toward E. cirrigera and aggressive behavior by D. ochrophaeus toward Eurycea cirrigera; we did not find strong evidence for either predation or aggression. This finding was surprising given the similar activity patterns and dietary habits of these species. Although we predicted that Desmognathus might influence local distributions of heterogeneric salamanders through interspecific aggression in a manner similar to that seen within this genera, we found that both D. fuscus and D. ochrophaeus displayed much less aggression than expected. However, D. juscus, in particular, appears to induce avoidance behavior in both P. cinereus and E. cirrigera without evidence of predation or excessive aggression, indicating that interference competition may be an important factor in structuring plethodontid communities.","Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA","Ransom, TS (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Gilmer Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",tsr6a@virginia.edu,,,,,,48,8,8,0,14,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,NOV,2006,143,,11,,,,1357,1382,,10.1163/156853906778987524,,,26,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,127BR,WOS:000243560800004,,,,,2021-09-23,

At high latitudes, close to or beyond the polar circles, uninterrupted midsummer daylight may pose a challenge to the circadian rhythms of otherwise nocturnal species, such as eagle owls Bubo bubo. By non-invasive field methods, we studied eagle owl activity in light of their interactions with their main prey the water vole Arvicola amphibius, and their competitor the white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla during continuous midsummer daylight on open, treeless islands in coastal northern Norway. We evaluated circadian rhythms, temporal overlap, exposure, and spatial distribution. The owls maintained a nocturnal activity pattern, possibly because slightly dimmer light around midnight offered favourable hunting conditions. The eagles were active throughout the 24-h period as opposed to the strictly diurnal rhythm reported elsewhere, thus increasing temporal overlap and the potential for interference competition between the two avian predators. This may indicate an asymmetry, with the owls facing the highest cost of interference competition. The presence of eagles combined with constant daylight in this open landscape may make the owls vulnerable to interspecific aggression, and contrary to the available literature, eagle owls rarely exposed themselves visually during territorial calls, possibly to avoid detection by eagles. We found indications of spatial segregation between owls and eagles reflecting differences in main prey, possibly in combination with habitat-mediated avoidance. Eagle owl vocal activity peaked in the evening before a nocturnal peak in visual observations, when owls were active hunting, consistent with the hypothesis of a dusk chorus in nocturnal bird species. The owls may have had to trade-off between calling and foraging during the few hours around midnight when slightly dimmer light reduced the detection risk while also providing better hunting conditions","[Eriksen, Ane; Wabakken, Petter] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol Agr Sci & Biotechnol, Evenstad, Norway","Eriksen, A (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol Agr Sci & Biotechnol, Evenstad, Norway.",ane.eriksen@inn.no,"Eriksen, Ane/H-2773-2013","Eriksen, Ane/0000-0002-9073-8812",Norwegien Environment Agency; Inland Norway Univ. of Applied Sciences,This study was funded by the Norwegien Environment Agency and the Inland Norway Univ. of Applied Sciences.,,49,2,2,3,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0908-8857,1600-048X,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

However, considerable debate exists over whether multiple natural enemies often interact to produce additive or non-additive effects on their prey or host populations. Based on the large data set stored in the Sao Joao and Barra sugarcane mills (state of Sao Paulo, Brazil) regarding the programme of biological control of Diatraea saccharalis using the parasitoids Cotesia flavipes and tachinid flies, in the present study the author investigated whether the parasitoids released into sugarcane fields interfered significantly with the rate of parasitized D. saccharalis hosts. The author also observed whether there was an additive effect of releasing C. flavipes and tachinids on the rate of parasitized hosts, and looked for evidence of possible negative effects of the use of multiple parasitoid species in this biological control programme. Results showed that C. flavipes and the tachinids were concomitantly released in the Barra Mill, but not in the Sao Jao Mill. Furthermore, in the Barra Mill there was evidence that the parasitoids interacted because the percentage of parasitism did not increase after the release of either C. flavipes or tachinids. In the Sao Joao Mill, when both parasitoid species were released out of synchrony, both the percentage of parasitism by C. flavipes as well as that of the tachinids increased. When large numbers of tachinids were released in the Barra Mill, they caused a significant lower percentage of parasitism imposed by C. flavipes. The implications of the results as evidence of non-additive effects of C. flavipes plus tachinids on D. saccharalis populations are discussed.","Univ Estadual Paulista, IB, Dept Parasitol, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil","Rossi, MN (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, IB, Dept Parasitol, Rubiao Jr, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",rossilife@fca.unesp.br,"Rossi, Marcelo N/D-8876-2013",,,,,32,2,2,1,6,BLACKWELL VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",1439-0418,,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

Carabid communities are regulating weeds in arable fields and include a mix of species ranging from granivores to predators that are obligate omnivores. It is not clear from field studies whether granivore and obligate omnivore species either contribute equally or are complementary in the process of weed suppression, and little is known about the impact of potential predator interference within carabid communities on weed suppression. We compared the weed seed foraging strategy of the granivore Harpalus affinis and the obligate omnivore Poecilus cupreus. Using no-choice test experiments, we compared their activity and seed acceptance for four weed species through a scoring of the proportion of tested individuals consuming weeds, their latency before the consumption of the first seed and the total number of seeds consumed. We then evaluated their seed acceptance for dandelion seed Taraxacum officinale under predator interference by using chemical cues of carabids and tested the impact of three treatments, namely cues of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition and intraguild predation. We found that the obligate omnivore P. cupreus was highly active, had a low latency before consuming its first seed but had an interest in only two of the four weed species. P. cupreus seed acceptance remained unchanged in the presence of predator cues. By contrast, H. affinis was slow to start its seed consumption, accepted equally seeds of the four weed species and significantly increased its seed consumption in the presence of cues mimicking intraguild predation. These findings indicate that the two species differ in their foraging strategies, and as such, could have different contributions to weed seed suppression. This novel result calls for further studies documenting the foraging strategy of carabid species that thrive in arable fields as this could significantly improve our understanding of the delivery of weed seed regulation.

We examined how these factors and their interactions affected mass at metamorphosis, length of larval period, growth rate, and survival. These experiments demonstrated the effect of body size on predator-prey interactions by manipulating time of introduction of size-structured prey in a system with a gape-limited predator. Microhabitat differences in primary productivity, sources of predation other than salamanders, and abiotic factors were important determinants of community structure. High levels of salamander predation negatively affected tadpole survival, but affected no other response variable. We detected no density-dependent effects in either taxon. Tadpoles in the early treatment had longer larval periods and lower survival rates than those in the late treatment. Interactions of factors, including time of introduction, were common. Biotic and abiotic factors differentially affecting growth of predator or prey appear to be responsible for these differences. Priority effects in arrival to breeding sites, or climatic events affecting the growth rate of predator, prey, or both, play a role in determining community structure. Interactions of factors complicate the predator-prey relationship. In our experiment, the effects of time of introduction are highly correlated with body size in the two temporal treatments. Our results indicate that more realistic models of predator-prey systems, or population dynamics, should incorporate size structure of predator and prey.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TEMPE,AZ 85287; ARIZONA GAME & FISH DEPT,NONGAME BRANCH,2221 W GREENWAY RD,PHOENIX,AZ 85023",,,,,,,,45,22,24,0,15,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1991,72,6,,,,,2232,2239,,10.2307/1941573,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV769,WOS:A1991GV76900029,,,,,2021-09-23,

Collared lemmings were less active and exhibited less exploratory behavior than did brown lemmings, which were more active under cover than in the open. Similar behaviors scaling along axes of activity and curiosity were revealed by principal components analysis. Each axis defined different aspects of brown lemming personality, but repeated testing of the same individuals yielded a striking dependence of their behavioral response on open-field treatments.

In this work, we examined the role of abiotic conditions in shaping the structure of a simple agricultural community that is dominated by two species of predatory mites (i.e., Eusieus stipulatus and Eusieus scutalis) competing for resources. Population and community dynamics experiments were carried out at two abiotic conditions mimicking local climates in a Mediterranean region, to estimate the population cariying capacity (k) and interspecific competition (a) for each predatory mite species. Subsequently, we used this data to parameterize a competition model, thereby predicting species dominance at each abiotic condition. To test our model predictions, we sampled several orchards located in areas influenced by each of the local climates, to determine the abundance of each species of natural enemy. Results showed that the outcome of the competitive interactions between predatory mites was strongly affected by abiotic conditions, leading to temperature-dependent changes in the community structure. Furthermore, the pattern of species dominance found in the field agreed with the model predictions built upon our laboratory experiments. We therefore emphasize that, in a changing climate, if we are to guarantee the successful use of biocontrol agents, we need to account for the effect of temperature upon biotic interactions.

Chemical signals can act as repellents or attractants and may therefore have applications for wildlife management. We devised a field experiment to investigate whether dominant predator (ferret Mustela furo) body odor would alter the behavior of three common mesopredators: stoats (Mustelaerminea), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), and ship rats (Rattus rattus). We predicted that apex predator odor would lead to increased detections, and our results support this hypothesis as predator kairomones (interspecific olfactory messages that benefit the receiver) provoked eavesdropping behavior by mesopredators. Stoats exhibited the most pronounced responses, with kairomones significantly increasing the number of observations and the time spent at a site, so that their occupancy estimates changed from rare to widespread. Behavioral responses to predator odors can therefore be exploited for conservation and this avenue of research has not yet been extensively explored. A long-life lure derived from apex predator kairomones could have practical value, especially when there are plentiful resources that reduce the efficiency of food-based lures. Our results have application for pest management in New Zealand and the technique of using kairomones to monitor predators could have applications for conservation efforts worldwide.","[Garvey, Patrick M.; Clout, Mick N.; Wyse, Sarah V.] Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Garvey, Patrick M.; Glen, Alistair S.] Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Wyse, Sarah V.] Royal Bot Gardens Kew, Wakehurst Pl, Haywards Heath RH17 6TN, W Sussex, England; [Nichols, Margaret] Lincoln Univ, Ctr Wildlife Management & Conservat, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Pech, Roger P.] Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand","Garvey, PM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.; Garvey, PM (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",pgar874@aucklanduni.ac.nz,,"Wyse, Sarah/0000-0002-7015-8685; Glen, Al/0000-0002-7777-7630; Wyse, Sarah/0000-0002-0442-9950",,,,84,15,15,1,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

I examined the competitive ability of larval common frogs (Rana temporaria) and common toads (Bufo bufo) in a laboratory experiment by manipulating the number and size of Rana and the number of Bufo. 2. Bufo was the most active tadpole type, whereas small Rana was more active than large Rana. 3. Especially at high food availability, the growth rate of large Rana at metamorphosis was reduced in the presence of small Rana, whereas that of small Rana was not affected by larger conspecifics. 4. Both size classes of Rana were negatively affected by the presence of Bufo. Size at metamorphosis of Bufo was greater when large Rana was present. These results suggest that activity level is important in determining competitive ability. 5. To study competition in the field, tadpoles of Bufo were introduced to small rock-pools that did not support Bufo naturally, but were with or without Rana. 6. In the experimental pools, there were no interspecific effects on the growth rate of either species. However, the growth rate of Bufo was lower in the experimental pools than in pools inhabited naturally. Futher, survival of Bufo was low in small pools. Lower food availability or physical factors associated with small pools, rather than interspecific competition, may be the reason why Bufo avoids breeding in small rock-pools.","Univ Helsinki, Div Populat Biol, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Integrat Ecol Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Laurila, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Populat Biol, Norbyvagen 18 D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,60,31,35,0,21,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

One might therefore expect snail assemblages to be equilibrial and structured by interspecific interactions such as competition. If competition is strong and persistent throughout an assemblage, then it should manifest as density compensation (a negative correlation in population density between competitors) and be most pronounced for species pairs that are morphologically similar, as they should compete most strongly for resources. We assessed the degree to which terrestrial snails in the LEF exhibit density compensation, from both spatial and temporal perspectives. In general, density compensation was weak, especially from a spatial perspective. Moreover, the degree of density compensation was not significantly associated with dissimilarity in body size or shell shape. These results suggest that external factors such as predation or disturbance probably maintain population densities at low enough levels that the effects of interspecific competition do not become intense or persistent enough to mold patterns of assemblage structure for terrestrial snails.","[Bloch, Christopher P.] Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Bloch, CP (corresponding author), Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA.",cbloch@bridgew.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BSR-8811902, DEB 9411973, DEB 0080538, DEB 0218039]","This research was supported by grants BSR-8811902, DEB 9411973, DEB 0080538, and DEB 0218039 from NSF to the Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies, University of Puerto Rico, and to the International Institute of Tropical Forestry, USDA Forest Service, as part of the Long-Term Ecological Research Program in the Luquillo Experimental Forest.

Only the first two hypotheses have been fairly well studied. To test the predator-removal hypothesis as a force determining IGP in avian predators, we performed a field experiment to simulate the presence of an IG predator (eagle owl Bubo bubo dummy) in the surrounding of the nests of four potential IG prey (black kite Milvus migrans, red kite Milvus milvus, booted eagle Aquila pennata and common buzzard Buteo buteo). To discard the possibility that an aggressive reaction towards the eagle owl was not related to the presence of the IG predator, we also presented a stuffed tawny owl Strix aluco, which is a potential competitor but cannot be considered an IG predator of the studied diurnal raptors considered in the experiment. While almost always ignoring the tawny owl, raptors chiefly showed an interspecific aggressive behaviour towards their IG predator. Our results seem to support the predator-removal hypothesis, as the IG prey may take advantage of the diurnal inactivity of the IG predator to remove it from their territory. However, the recorded behaviour may be also considered as a special variety of mobbing (i.e. a prey's counter-strategy against its predator), where the mobber is sufficiently powerful to escalate predator harassment into deliberate killing attempts. In their turn, eagle owls can respond with an IG predatory behaviour aimed at removing IG prey species which are highly aggressive mobbers.","[Lourenco, Rui; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo] Univ Evora, LabOr Lab Ornithol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Lourenco, Rui; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo] Univ Evora, Inst Mediterranean Agr & Environm Sci, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Lourenco, Rui; Penteriani, Vincenzo; del Mar Delgado, Maria] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Penteriani, Vincenzo] Univ Helsinki, Zool Museum, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [del Mar Delgado, Maria] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Marchi-Bartolozzi, Michela] Bourne Bridge Cottages, Little Abington, Cambridge CB21 6AN, England","Lourenco, R (corresponding author), Univ Evora, LabOr Lab Ornithol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",ruifazendalourenco@gmail.com,"Lourenco, Rui F/B-7148-2012; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo/A-7851-2011","Lourenco, Rui F/0000-0001-7694-0478; Delgado, Maria del Mar/0000-0002-3009-738X; Rabaca, Joao E./0000-0002-2196-3709","Consejeria de Medio Ambiente, Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [700/2005/M/00./]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [BD/27434/2006]; Ministry of Education and Science, C.S.I.C.

These larvae live in water-filled holes in fallen and living trees, where they and three other common odonate species are the top predators. By mid wet season, M. coerulatus larvae were found in nearly half of all tree holes that harbored odonates. Although M. coerulatus were typically, but not always, eliminated from holes inhabited by larger heterospecifics, M. coerulatus were more likely to encounter conspecifics than other odonate species. Hole with less than 1 1 of water rarely contained more than a single larva. In large holes where M. coerulatus was the only odonate species present, multiple larvae coexisted at a density of one larva per 1-21 of water. There the absence of 2-4 of the 5 larval size classes, despite a continuous input of eggs, suggested that cannibalism was a common cause of mortality. The size of the final instar, which determined adult body size, was correlated positively with tree hole volume for male, but not female, larvae. Experiments showed that when two larvae were placed together in 0.4-1 holes with abundant tadpole prey, the larger larva killed the smaller one. Often the larva that was killed was not eaten. Small larvae were more tolerant of each other than were pairs of medium of large larvae. Before killing occurred, the presence of larger larvae reduced the growth of smaller individuals, relative to controls. 'Obligate' killing was density-dependent. In 3.0-1 holes with ad libitum prey, conspecific killing occurred until the larval density stabilized at one larva per 1-1.5 1, similar to the density found in large holes under field conditions, For M. coerulatus, cannibalism functions to reduce the number of potential competitors for food in addition to providing nutrition. When interactions between paired larvae in small holes were experimentally prevented, competition for food reduced the growth of one or both larvae relative to controls. Holes that were watered during the dry season supported larval densities similar to those in the wet season. Thus, dry season mortality could not be attributed to a decrease in available prey. Rather, M. coerulatus larvae could not survive more than 1 month of complete drying. Because the dry season typically lasts more than 6 weeks, habitat drying is a secondary source of mortality, affecting second- or third-generation larvae that fail to emerge before tree holes dry out completely.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST,BALBOA,PANAMA",,,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136",,,,42,87,94,3,29,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,1994,100,1-2,,,,,118,127,,10.1007/BF00317138,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PR645,WOS:A1994PR64500015,28307035,,,,2021-09-23,

The coastal estuaries of Washington State, USA, provide appropriate habitat fur recently introduced green crab, yet these areas are important nursery grounds for Dungeness crab and contribute greatly to the coastal crab fishery. Juvenile Dungeness crabs are dependent on limited intertidal epibenthic shell for refuge habitat during early benthic life and experience increased mortality on open sand and mud as a result of predation by fish and birds, Early juveniles throughout the subtidal are similarly at risk due to predation by fish and especially adult conspecifics. Laboratory experiments and infrared video observations revealed that juvenile green crab displace Dungeness crab of equal size from shelters during one-on-one competition. Green crab also consistently win nocturnal foraging trials in which the species compete for fresh, damaged clams. Field and laboratory enclosure experiments show that juvenile Dungeness crab emigrate from oyster shell habitat as a result of competition and predation by adult green crab, Depending on the extent to which the two species overlap, interactions with the dominant nonindigenous species could have a negative influence on juvenile Dungeness crab survival and could conceivably impact recruitment to the fishery. However, current evidence indicates that the distribution of green crab in Washington State is far removed from nursery areas of Dungeness crab. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

For each of these combinations, food consumption by predators was calculated assuming functional responses of either type 1, 2 or 3. Two levels of competition intensity were studied: low and high intensity, with food consumption decreased by 1% or 50% as compared to a situation without competition. The reproduction of prey was either slow or rapid, potentially increasing the number of prey at the end of a simulation by either 2* or 100* initial abundances. Prey reproduction was either exponential, influenced by intraspecific interaction or by both intra- and interspecific interactions between prey. All together, separate analyses of intra- and interspecific competition between different numbers of predator species combined with different numbers of available prey species, competition intensities, functional responses and rates and regulation of prey reproduction, gave 288 different types of models. For each of these, 100 simulations were run, with prey capture rates determined randomly for each predator-prey combination. The output data analysed were frequencies of increases and decreases in food niche overlap in response to interspecific competition and expansion and contraction in food niche width in response to either intra- or interspecific competition. All changes in niche parameters resulted from pure exploitative competition, without behavioural changes, short-term selection or evolutionary processes. The results were complex, with both increases and decreases in niche width and niche overlap as results of intra- and interspecific competition. Frequencies of increases and decreases were influenced by complex interactions between number of species of predators and preys, functional response of predators and reproduction rate and density dependence in prey population growth. The effect of one species on the niche width of another, as well as on their mutual niche overlap, sometimes changed with the intensity of competition. These results are in strong contrast to the niche dynamics theory frequently used as basis for interpreting field data, according to which species are assumed to generalise in response to intraspecific competition (niche expansion), and segregate and specialise in response to interspecific competition (decreased overlap and niche contraction [resource partitioning]). These variable results were derived from models which are very simple compared to the complexity of Nature, a complexity which is reasonable to assume increases the possibility for the development of complex niche dynamics. In my opinion, niche dynamics in Nature are thus very likely to be complex and great care must be taken before concluding from field data on food niche dynamics whether or not coexisting species compete.","UNIV STOCKHOLM,CTR MARINE RES,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","HANSSON, S (corresponding author), UNIV STOCKHOLM,DEPT SYST ECOL,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,85,10,13,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

By combining information from comprehensive diet and movement analyses we found four dimensions of differentiation: (1) Geographic foraging area: LLB tended to forage relatively close to their nests (2.35 +/- 0.62 km), while STE forage far from their nest (13.03 +/- 2.20 km); (2) Foraging-habitat type: LLBs forage at low natural vegetation, avoiding cultivated fields, whereas STEs forage in cultivated fields, avoiding low natural vegetation; (3) Diurnal dynamics of foraging: LLBs are uniformly active during daytime, whereas STEs activity peaks in the early afternoon; and (4) Food-niche: while both species largely rely on reptiles (47.8% and 76.3% for LLB and STE, respectively), LLB had a more diverse diet and consumed significantly higher percentages of lizards, while STE consumed significantly higher percentages of snakes.

We conducted a field experiment to evaluate Culex oviposition behavior in response to the interspecific competitor Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae, and resources in the form of quantity of plant detritus, and dissolved nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) derived from that detritus. We tested a set of specific predictions: 1) As a poorer competitor, Culex will avoid ovipositing in containers with superior interspecific competitors; 2) Culex choose oviposition habitats that contain greater amount of resources for the microbial food of their offspring; 3) Sufficiently high resource abundance can override avoidance of oviposition in containers with interspecific competitors. Culex restuans Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) was the only species ovipositing, and the oviposition responses changed over time. The effect of resources was more important in driving oviposition decisions at the beginning and end of the experiment. The amount of resources, as manifest by TN and TP concentrations, had differential effects on oviposition. At the beginning females laid more eggs in containers with low detritus, which had the highest TN. After that, females preferred those containers with high detritus, which had low TN and high TP. The effect of competitors was important only during the middle of the experiment. Paradoxically, even as a poorer competitor Cx. restuans preferentially oviposited in containers with late-instar Ae. triseriatus, suggesting that the presence of successful heterospecifics indicates a good quality larval habitat.","[Grech, Marta G.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Grech, Marta G.] UNPSJB, Fac Ciencias Nat, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Grech, MG (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina.",mgrech@comahue-conicet.gob.ar,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID grantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322-01A1]; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We wish to thank G.

In the field, however, contaminant effects are ubiquitously co-occurring with ecological interactions such as species competition and predation, which might influence the sensitivity of the individuals exposed to toxicants. The present experimental study investigated how intra- and interspecific competition influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms to a pesticide. For this, the effects of the fungicide carbendazim were assessed on the mortality and growth of the snail Bithynia tentaculata and the crustacean Gammarus pulex under different levels of intraspecific and interspecific competition for a food resource. Interspecific competition was created by adding individuals of Radix peregra and Asellus aquaticus, respectively. The interaction of competition and carbendazim exposure significantly influenced B. tentaculata growth, however, combined effects on survival and immobility were considered transient and were less easily demonstrated. Positive influence of competition on G. pulex survival was observed under low-medium carbendazim concentrations and under medium-high density pressures, being partly related to cannibalistic and predation compensatory mechanisms, enhanced under food limiting conditions. This study shows that intra- and interspecific competition pressure may influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms in a more complex way (positive, non-significant and negative effects were observed) than just increasing the sensitivity of the studied species, as has generally been hypothesized.

Results were interpreted by using a competing risk analysis model, which uniquely enabled us to estimate the intrinsic patch-leaving decisions independently of external interruptions of foraging bouts by aggression. The experiment was conducted in two 1-ha field enclosures completely surrounded by rodent-proof fences and included allopatric (only Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) and sympatric (G. a. allenbyi and G. pyramidum) treatments. We predicted that increased food patch quality (i.e., habitat quality) should decrease intrinsic patch-leaving rates and increase rates of aggressive interactions involving the forager feeding in the patch (i.e., the occupant individual). We also anticipated that increasing population density should result in an increase in the rate of aggressive interactions involving the occupant individual. Our results supported the first two predictions, indicating a trade-off between foraging and aggression. However, the third prediction was realized only for G. a. allenbyi in allopatry. Furthermore, in allopatry, occupant G. a. allenbyi individuals with high competitive ranks were involved in aggressive interactions at lower rates than those with low competitive ranks. However, in sympatry, patch-use behavior of occupant G. a. allenbyi individuals was mainly influenced by aggressive behavior of G. pyramidum, which did not respond to their competitive rank. Thus, it should pay less for G. a. allenbyi to be aggressive in sympatric populations. The observed reduction in intraspecific aggression among individual G. a. allenbyi in the presence of G. pyramidum supports this assertion. We suggest that this reduction likely weakens the negative effect of intra- and interspecific density on the per capita growth rate of G. a. allenbyi. Because this would change the slope of the isocline of G. a. allenbyi, it could be an important mechanism promoting coexistence when habitat selection is constrained.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Ovadia, O (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",ofer.ovadia@yale.edu,"Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012","Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,34,26,26,2,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Hence, competition is often considered to be one of the primary determinants of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. In this paper, we investigate how the native Vespa crabro and the recently introduced Vespa velutina show some degree of niche differentiation that potentially minimizes their interspecific competition, the two dimensions investigated here being seasonal activity patterns and preferences for food. These two species share common characteristics: they are closely related, live in the same areas, belong to the same guild (predators), exploit the same kind of food sources, and exhibit a similar annual life cycle. Considering all these similarities, interspecific competition may occur if the two species exhibit identical seasonal phenologies. Our data show that their seasonal phenologies overlap to some extent probably due to biological constraints common to Vespinae. The shifts in time observed here allow the hornet species to not directly compete for food sources at the same time. It does not however exclude indirect competition, especially in a 'first-come, first-served' fashion.","[Monceau, K.; Maher, N.; Bonnard, O.; Thiery, D.] INRA, UMR Sante & Agr Vignoble 1065, ISVV, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France; [Monceau, K.; Maher, N.; Bonnard, O.; Thiery, D.] Univ Bordeaux, UMR Sante & Agr Vignoble 1065, Bordeaux Sci Agro, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France","Thiery, D (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Sante & Agr Vignoble 1065, ISVV, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France.",thiery@bordeaux.inra.fr,,"Monceau, Karine/0000-0003-3786-1835",France Agrimer [797/2007-2010]; Region AquitaineRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine; INRA,"This research was financially supported by France Agrimer # 797/2007-2010, a grant from Region Aquitaine and INRA.

Henry Wilbur's model of population regulation in amphibians serves as a framework for the arguments. Much of the discussion is based on studies of eastern North American plethodontids that have been the focus of most of the research. Ensembles of plethodontids in this region include species with complex fife cycles (i.e., larval development) and simple life cycles (i.e., direct development). Interactions between members of these two life-history categories appear to be weaker than those within categories. Whereas there is no definitive evidence of factors that regulate populations of plethodontid salamanders, interspecific competition and intraguild predation do appear to contribute in some ensembles. Food and space have been identified as limiting resources in interspecific competition. Although predation of larger on smaller salamanders may be relatively rare in nature, the threat of predation appears to promote behavioral responses in members of the smaller species that reduce risks but may lower fitness through other effects. The role of extralimital predators and competitors in regulation of these salamanders is largely untested. ideally, future research should involve manipulative experiments on unenclosed field plots that examine effects of resources, intraguild competitors and predators, and extralimital predators on populations of key species of plethodontids.","Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA","Bruce, RC (corresponding author), Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA.",ebruce1563@aol.com,,,Highlands Biological Station; Western Carolina University,"I benefited immensely front insightful discussions of plethodontid ecology, over many years with the late Nelson G Hairston, Sr. (1917-2008), I dedicate this paper to his memory.

We extend a predator-prey model previously parameterized for voles and weasels to two prey species, a 'Microrus' (field vole) type which is competitively superior to but more vulnerable to predation than a 'Clethrionomys' (bank vole) type. 2. The model explains four patterns in the dynamics of multispecies rodent assemblages in Fennoscandia: a predictable shift in the relative abundances of different prey species during one multiannual population cycle; long-term (supracyclic) variation in relative prey abundances; an association between the amplitude of population oscillations and the type of the numerically dominant prey species; and increasing rodent species number with increasing latitude, 3. The model results illustrate the complex and often unexpected behaviour of strongly connected multispecies assemblages, of which the Fennoscandian rodent-predator community is a prime example. 4. Since the mid 1980s, rodent oscillations in many, though not all, parts of northern Fennoscandia have become distinctly less regular (non-cyclic), a change which is reflected in the entire animal community linked to the keystone species. the arvicoline rodents, We demonstrate that such long-term changes in the amplitude and regularity of rodent oscillations are not unexpected in multispecies prey-predator assemblages.","FINNISH FOREST RES INST, DEPT FOREST ECOL, SF-01301 VANTAA, FINLAND","Hanski, I (corresponding author), UNIV HELSINKI, DEPT SYSTEMAT & ECOL, DIV POPULAT BIOL, POB 17, ARKADIANKATU 7, SF-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND.",,,,,,,84,160,164,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

I examined the effects of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), an omnivorous fish, on the reproductive success of the red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena), an avian gape-limited predator, along a fish size gradient created by stocking distinct age-cohorts in seminatural ponds. Young-of-the-year (0+) carp were an essential food source for young grebes. Only adult birds were able to consume 1-year-old (1+) fish, while 2-year-old (2+) fish attained a size refuge from grebes. Amphibian larvae were the principal alternative prey to fish, followed by macroinvertebrates, but the abundance of both dramatically decreased along the carp size gradient. Fledging success was 2.8 times greater in ponds with 0+ versus 1+ carp; in ponds with 1+ carp, chicks received on average 2.6-3 times less prey biomass from their parents, and over 1/3 of broods suffered total failure. Breeding birds avoided settling on 2+ ponds. These results show that changes in prey fish size structure can account for shifts from positive trophic effects on the avian predator to a negative impact on the predator's alternative resources. However, competition did not fully explain the decrease in grebe food resources in the presence of large fish, as carp and grebes overlapped little in diet. In experimental cages, 1+ carp totally eliminated young larvae of amphibians palatable to fish. In field conditions, breeding adults of palatable taxa avoided ponds with 1+ and older carp. Non-trophic interactions such as habitat selection by amphibians or macroinvertebrates to avoid large fish may provide an indirect mechanism strengthening the adverse bottom-up effects of fish on birds.","Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Nat Conservat Dept, Inst Biol, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland","Kloskowski, J (corresponding author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Nat Conservat Dept, Inst Biol, Akad 19, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland.",januszkl@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,"Kloskowski, Janusz/0000-0002-0525-2421","State Committee for Scientific ResearchPolish State Committee for Scientific Research [KBN 6 PO4F06620, 3 PO4F03623]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [MNiSW 2 P04G05030]","Thanks to J.

However, predators can alter such competitive interactions substantially. Predation can promote the coexistence of species in a situation where it would otherwise be impossible, for example if a tradeoff between the competitive abilities and predation resistance of the prey species exists. The field vole Microtus agrestis and the sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis are sympatric grassland species, which compete for the same resources. At the population level sibling voles are suggested to be superior competitors to field voles, yet more vulnerable to predation. We tested the effects of predation on the two species in 0.5 ha outdoor enclosures by exposing vole populations to radio-collared freely-hunting least weasels Mustela nivalis nivalis for three weeks. Lethal and non-lethal impacts of predation limited population densities of both species during and after the experimental period, but the effect was more pronounced in sibling voles in which population densities decreased markedly during the treatment period and even after that. Field vole population densities remained stable under weasel predation, while densities increased in controls. Survival in both species was lower in treatment populations compared to controls, but the effect tended to be more pronounced in sibling voles and in females of both species. The average mass of adults in both species declined in the treatment populations. These results suggest that predation by least weasels can limit vole populations locally, even during favourable summer conditions, and have extended negative effects on the dynamics of vole populations. In addition, predation alleviated interspecific competition between the vole species and is, therefore, a potential factor enabling the coexistence of them.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Biomed & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Koivisto, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",elanko@utu.fi,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509",,,,57,8,8,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2008,117,1,,,,,6,12,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15938.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,237PG,WOS:000251387000002,,,,,2021-09-23,

Spodoptera frugiperda is in the same feeding guild as the indigenous species Ostrinia furnacalis, with both pests attacking maize plant tissues such as whorls and tassels. In this study, the interaction of these species was assessed under laboratory and field conditions by examining the survival and predation rate of larvae in maize whorls and tassels. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions of larvae were assessed to characterize movements in arenas in the presence and absence of food. When S. frugiperda and O. furnacalis were present at an equal ratio, S. frugiperda prevailed over O. furnacalis with a high survival rate (over 90%) and predation rate of O. furnacalis (over 40%) under most scenarios in both laboratory and field conditions. When both species occurred at different ratios in the field, S. frugiperda had on average almost 16 times the number of survivors as O. furnacalis on whorls, and 8.3 times the number on tassels, highlighting a substantial advantage in these environments. Spodoptera frugiperda larvae undertook a low frequency of lethal attacks (strikes) and showed a higher incidence of defensive movements compared to O. furnacalis. A field survey showed that S. frugiperda larvae can colonize vegetative plant stages in maize, but it remains to be seen if competitive interactions can be linked to population dynamics of both species though they are expected to favor S. frugiperda.","[Zhao, Jing; Jiang, Yiping; Xiao, Liubin; Tan, Yongan; Bai, Lixin] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jing] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Food Qual & Safety Jiangsu Prov, State Key Lab Breeding Base, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Hoffmann, Ary] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Bio21 Inst, Pest & Environm Adaptat Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zhou, Changyong] Huai Yin Inst Agr Sci Xuhuai Regionin Jiangsu, Huaian, Peoples R China","Xiao, LB (corresponding author), Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",xlb@jaas.ac.cn,,,Chinese Agricultural Research System of MOF and MARA [CARS-15-18]; Foundation project of Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences [CX19 (2004)]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31901889]; Integration research and demonstration of the technology of cotton fertilizer and pesticide reduction of China [2017YFD0201900],"This work was supported by Chinese Agricultural Research System of MOF and MARA (CARS-15-18), the Foundation project of Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CX19 (2004)), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31901889), the Integration research and demonstration of the technology of cotton fertilizer and pesticide reduction of China (2017YFD0201900).",,33,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

The availability of small mammals in four different environmental types was also investigated by means of live-trapping and mark-and-recapture procedures. All snakes fed primarily on small mammals and lizards, whereas owls preyed essentially upon small mammals. A. noctua was also largely insectivorous. In general, diet composition of phylogenetically unrelated predators was similar (as shown by relatively high overlap estimates), and several prey taxa were eaten by all predators (including both owls and snakes). However, (i) interphyletic comparisons and (ii) multivariate statistical procedures revealed some interesting differences in predator diet composition. Owls were found to prey mainly upon small mammal taxa from semicultivated open grassy habitats, whereas snakes did so upon forest-associated small mammals. Correlation analyses confirmed this evidence. The potential for competition for food seems to be higher between phylogenetically related than between phylogenetically unrelated taxa, due to separation among groups in frequented macrohabitat and, possibly, also to daily activity rhythms. Food niche partitioning was more evident among owls than among snakes, in agreement with the fact that snakes, contrary to owls, are low-energy organisms that can survive on limited food resources.","UNIV ROMA LA SAPIENZA,DIPARTIMENTO BIOL ANIM & UOMO,I-00161 ROME,ITALY; CNR,CTR GENET EVOLUZIONIST,I-00161 ROME,ITALY",,,"CAPIZZI, DARIO/O-6431-2019; Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020","Capizzi, Dario/0000-0003-0871-9602",,,,71,55,59,1,18,GAUTHIER-VILLARS,PARIS,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS, FRANCE",1146-609X,,,ACTA OECOL,Acta Oecol.-Int.

The question of what mechanisms drive the displacement of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni by the often introduced G pulex is presented as a case study Patterns of displacement are well documented throughout Europe, but the speed and direction of displacement between these species can be varied. From early studies proposing interspecific competition as causal in these patterns, I review research progress to date. I show there has been no evidence for interspecific competition operating, other than the field patterns themselves, a somewhat tautological argument. Rather, the increased recognition of behavioural attributes with respect to the cannibalistic and predatory nature of these species gave rise to a series of studies unravelling the processes driving field patterns. Both species engage in 'intraguild predation' (IGP), with moulting females particularly vulnerable to predation by congeneric males. G pulex is more able both to engage in and avoid this interaction with G duebeni. However, several factors mediate the strength and asymmetry of this IGP, some biotic (e.g. parasitism) and others abiotic (e.g. water chemistry). Further, a number of alternative hypotheses that may account for the displacement (hybridization; parasite transmission) have been tested and rejected. While interspecific competition has been modelled mathematically and found to be a weak interaction relative to IGP, mechanisms of competition between these Gammarus species remain largely untested empirically. Since IGP may be finely balanced in some circumstances, I conclude that the challenge to detect interspecific competition remains and we require assessment of its role, if any, in the interaction between these species. Appreciation of behavioural attributes and their mediation should allow us to more fully understand, and perhaps predict, species introductions and resultant distributions.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Med Biol, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland","Dick, JTA (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Med Biol, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",j.dick@qub.ac.uk,,,,,,67,45,46,1,33,UNIV AMSTERDAM,AMSTERDAM,"LIBRARY FACULTY BIOLOGY, PLANTAGE MIDDENLAAN 45, AMSTERDAM, 1018 DC, NETHERLANDS",1383-4517,,,CONTRIB ZOOL,Contrib.

In central Oklahoma, the predaceous ant lions Myrmeleon crudelis and M. immaculatus live in dense aggregations at the sheltered bases of cliff ledges. Three larval instars of each species act as predators and competitors of one another. In controlled field experiments, mortality of second and third instars increased with density, although intra-and interspecific effects were indistinguishable. The presence of third-instar larvae did not affect recruitment or survivorship of first-instar larvae. In all experiments, mortality was predictable on the basis of body mass and larval density, but not species identity. Increased food supply shortened development time and increased adult body mass but did not affect mortality. Larvae near the front of the ant lion aggregation grew faster due to greater food availability but suffered greater mortality in the pupal stage. Although food and space were limiting, neither species was excluded because (1) intra-and interspecific effects were similar; (2) third-instar larvae could not suppress the recruitment of first-instar larvae; and (3) recruitment was patchy in time and space.

The communities consisted mainly of aquatic dipteran larvae. Community M was dominated by a filter feeder, Tripteroides tenax, which reached a high density despite a strongly aggregated distribution. Community K had five trophic groups: carrion feeders, filter feeders, detritus feeders, nipping predators and hooking predators, each including multiple species. The summed density of filter feeders in Community K remained much below the level attained by filter feeders in Community M. Niche differentiation within each trophic group with regard to pitcher age and feeding behaviour was not sufficient to allow species coexistence through niche separation alone. Aggregated distributions directly reduced interspecific encounters. Nevertheless, species belonging to the same trophic group commonly shared the same pitcher, because of high occurrence probabilities of dominant species and positive associations between some taxa (due mainly to similar occupancies by pitcher age). Predator coexistence in Community K may have been facilitated by self-limitation of the large predators through intraspecific cannibalism strengthened by aggregation. Prey coexistence, on the other hand, may have relied more on population suppression by predation, especially the selective removal of old instar Tripteroides.","UNIV MALAYA,DEPT ZOOL,KUALA LUMPUR 59100,MALAYSIA","MOGI, M (corresponding author), SAGA MED SCH,DEPT MICROBIOL,DIV PARASITOL,NABESHIMA,SAGA 849,JAPAN.",,"Yong, Hoi Sen/C-1548-2010","Yong, Hoi Sen/0000-0002-9832-8826",,,,64,40,41,1,18,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1992,90,2,,,,,172,184,,10.1007/BF00317174,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU052,WOS:A1992HU05200004,28313712,,,,2021-09-23,

Because interspecific and exploitative competition for suitable ledges may have a vital influence on the survival and reproduction of Verreaux's Eagles (Aquila verreauxii) and Chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), an investigation into the reciprocal rock-ledge usages by the two species will improve our understanding of this trait. In this study, we used camera traps stationed at four eagle nests to study interspecific interactions at nest sites. At the first two eagle nests, no baboons were recorded, and two young birds fledged successfully. At the third nest, the baboons only slept on the nest once the fledgling successfully left the nest. At the fourth nest, the eagles did not breed and the birds (eight visits) and baboons (three visits) used the nest interchangeably over a 28-day period. Whereas the cliff-ledge provided a secure nest site for the Verreaux's Eagles in the breeding season, for Chacma baboons sleeping on an inaccessible ledge may limit predation by terrestrial predators (e.g. by leopard Panthera pardus). This alternating usage of cliff ledges suggests that the two species probably co-use this limited cliffside resource to increase their own fitness.","[Malan, G.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Nat Conservat, Pretoria, South Africa; [Padayachee, K.] Univ Cape Town, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Padayachee, K.] KaiNav Conservat Fdn, Johannesburg, South Africa","Padayachee, K (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, Rondebosch, South Africa.; Padayachee, K (corresponding author), KaiNav Conservat Fdn, Johannesburg, South Africa.",kailen@kainavconservation.org,,"Malan, Gerard/0000-0002-6261-4513",National Research Foundation; Birdlife Northern Gauteng; The Sean Williams Living Creatures Trust; KaiNav Conservation Foundation; Department of Nature Conservation of the Tshwane University of Technology,"We thank all the land-downers that provided us with access to the eagle nests on their properties, and to Pieter and Natasja Saunders from the Wonderboom Urban Black Eagle Project and Walter Nesser from Vulpro for assisting with setting up of the nest cameras along the Magaliesberg.

We compared proportional habitat use at observation sites with randomly selected points and evaluated differences in distance to the water sources and to urban boundaries. Habitat use by both species was different from what we had expected from random points. Stone martens used high-density housing more frequently than red foxes and that expected from random points and avoided open and industrial areas, whereas red foxes used housing estates significantly more often than expected and avoided high-density housing. Both species used the other habitats according to their availability. Stone martens often selected habitats located closer to the city centre, whereas red foxes often selected habitats closer to urban borders than expected. The distribution of red foxes and stone martens is influenced by several factors including the availability of shelter and food, as well as the opportunity to move around undetected. Interspecific competition may also play an important role in habitat selection. Stone martens seem to be better adapted to urbanized areas than red foxes.

Ecological theory predicts the trait that determines the resource holding potential (RHP), and hence the winner of encounter competition, is most often body size or mass. The difficulties of observing encounter competition in complex organisms in natural environments, however, has limited opportunities to test this theory across diverse species. We studied the outcome of encounter competition contests among mesocarnivores at deer carcasses in California to determine the most important variables for winning these contests. We found some support for current theory in that body mass is important in determining the winner of encounter competition, but we found that other factors including hunger and species-specific traits were also important. In particular, our top models were strength and hunger and size and hunger, with models emphasizing the complexity of variables influencing - outcomes of encounter competition. In addition, our wins above predicted (WAP) statistic suggests that an important aspect that determines the winner of encounter competition is species-specific advantages that increase their RHP, as bobcats (Lynx rufus) and spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis) won more often than predicted based on mass. In complex - organisms, such as mesocarnivores, species-specific adaptations, including strategic behaviors, aggressiveness, and weapons, contribute to competitive advantages and may allow certain - species to take control or defend resources better than others.

Despite the recognition that salamanders have the potential to strongly affect ecosystem function through both direct and indirect pathways, little is known regarding the nature of interactions between small vertebrates and the large, predatory arthropods with which they share both microhabitat and prey. Our study was designed to explore interactions between Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, and spiders in the genus Wadotes in an eastern North American temperate forest ecosystem. We were particularly interested in teasing apart behaviors such as territoriality and intraguild predation in an attempt to determine specifically which interaction is most likely responsible for the observed negative relationship between salamander and spider abundance at our field site. Field data indicate that P. cinereus and large syntopic spiders exhibit negative spatial associations in the microhabitat beneath cover objects, a possible indication of interspecific territoriality. In our laboratory experiments, resident salamanders displayed agonistic postures similarly toward both intruding conspecifics and spiders, suggesting that salamanders may perceive large intruding spiders as competitors. Finally, we observed no injuries to individual P. cinereus or adult spiders even though occasional chases and bites by both were recorded during the behavioral trials. We found no evidence that adults or juveniles of P. cinereus were envenomated by adult Wadotes spp., and there were no instances of intraguild predation in this study. Multiple lines of evidence from this study, and others, suggest that the primary interaction between individuals of P. cinereus and large spiders is competitive in nature rather than predatory. We suggest that the cost associated with intraguild predation on salamanders with noxious skin secretions may preclude them from being preyed upon by spiders.","[Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.; Anthony, Carl D.; Figura, Anna M.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, University Hts, OH 44118 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, University Hts, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,,,National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0608239]; John Carroll University,This work was supported by The National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant [grant number DEB-0608239] to Cari-Ann M.

M. epiroticus suffered more from predation than M. agrestis, probably because densities in M. epiroticus patches were higher than densities in M. agrestis patches making M. epiroticus more profitable prey for patch-searching predators. The proportion of M. epiroticus among all voles declined during the crash phase of the vole cycle, at least partly as a result of predation. Breeding female voles showed little spatial overlap and presumably competed for space at high densities. At low densities, interference competition through predators may have been more important than space competition. The proportion of the smaller species M. epiroticus in the total number of all voles increased rapidly with increasing vole densities. This could be due to more aggregated way of life which gives an advantage in competition for space. Predation reduced the time for space competition to short periods, and decreased periodically the proportion of the more successful competitor. Thus, the coexistence of the two vole species seemed to be predator-induced. In this sense predation was a more important factor.than interspecific competition.","UNIV TURKU,DEPT BIOL,ECOL ZOOL LAB,SF-20500 TURKU 50,FINLAND","NORRDAHL, K (corresponding author), UNIV HELSINKI,DEPT ZOOL,DIV ECOL,P RAUTATIEKATU 13,SF-00100 HELSINKI 10,FINLAND.",,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,33,71,72,0,5,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1993,67,1,,,,,149,158,,10.2307/3545105,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KZ779,WOS:A1993KZ77900017,,,,,2021-09-23,

Two species of freshwater invertebrate predator, Notonecta maculata and N. obliqua, showed a negative association in a series of small, man-made ponds in the Peak National Park, Derbyshire, U.K. The present study examines the potential role of interspecific interactions among nymphs on this regional distribution pattern. 2. The survival, development and feeding efficiency of nymphs were examined in laboratory and field mesocosm experiments with intra- and interspecific competition and contrasting environmental complexity. 3. Survival to adulthood and mean lifespan varied significantly in interspecific competition treatments in both laboratory and field experiments, with N. maculata showing higher survival in the simple environment and N. obliqua higher survival in the complex environment. 4. Variations in feeding efficiency were consistent with the survival trends: N. maculata had a higher efficiency in the simple environment, whereas N. obliqua had greater efficiency in the complex environment. There was evidence of a developmental response in feeding efficiency, with differences between species increasing with age. 5. These results suggest that the relative competitive abilities of the two species are affected by habitat complexity, and that competition between species may modify the species distribution where they co-occur.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Briers, RA (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",,"Briers, Robert/B-5810-2014","Briers, Robert/0000-0003-0341-1203",,,,29,8,9,1,9,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

However, the influence of interspecific aggression and fatigue on the predation cost of fighting is seldom examined, although both are unignorable aspects of fighting. Here, I incorporated both factors in a series of field experiments on the cichlid Lamprologus ocellatus. If territorial males respond more strongly to conspecific territorial intruders than to heterospecific intruders, then they should delay escape more frequently during intraspecific fighting than during interspecific fighting. Consequently, although I predicted that vigilance would be decreased as fighting progresses in both cases, intraspecific aggression should decrease vigilance more than interspecific aggression. Males were also exposed to a predator approaching at different (slow or fast) speeds during these fighting bouts. Delays in predator detection and flight initiation were quantified and these predictions were tested. As predicted, males responded more strongly to intraspecific intruders, resulting in slower predator detection and fleeing times than when encountering interspecific intruders. Furthermore, flight latency decreased with increasing fight duration, suggesting that fatigue negatively influenced escape responses. However, contrary to the prediction, the vigilance decrement rate was faster in response to slow predators than in response to rapid predators, and was not influenced by intruder identity. This suggests that fighting males reserve their attention for information critical to their survival and are less vigilant toward a less-threatening (slowly approaching) predator. This cognitive allocation may be an adaptive compensation for fatigue-related low vigilance during fighting.","[Ota, Kazutaka] Osaka City Univ, Dept Biol & Geosci, Sumiyoshi Ku, Osaka 5588585, Japan","Ota, K (corresponding author), Osaka City Univ, Dept Biol & Geosci, Sumiyoshi Ku, Osaka 5588585, Japan.",otkztk@gmail.com,,"Ota, Kazutaka/0000-0002-7097-7330","Overseas Research grant from Osaka City University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16777290]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K18614] Funding Source: KAKEN",This study was supported by an Overseas Research grant from Osaka City University and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (no. 16777290).,,63,6,6,0,6,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

Daphnia pulicaria is mostly found in the hypolimnion whereas D. galeata mendotae undergoes diel vertical migration between the hypolimnion and the epilimnion. I examined how habitat segregation between these two potentially competing species might be affected by trophic interactions with their resources and predators by performing a field experiment in deep enclosures in which I manipulated fish predation, nutrient levels, and the density of epilimnetic Daphnia. The results of the experiment indicate that habitat use by D. pulicaria can be jointly regulated by competition for food from epilimnetic Daphnia and predation by fishes. Patterns of habitat segregation between the two Daphnia species were determined by predation by fish but not by nutrient levels: The removal of epilimnetic fish predators resulted in higher zooplankton and lower epilimnetic phytoplankton densities and allowed D. pulicaria to expand its habitat distribution into the epilimnion. In contrast, increased resource productivity resulted in higher densities of both Daphnia species but did not affect phytoplankton levels or habitat use by Daphnia. The two species exhibit a trade-off in their ability to exploit resources and their susceptibility to predation by fish. D. g. mendotae (the less susceptible species) may thus restrict D. pulicaria (the better resource exploiter) from the epilimnion when fish are common due to lower minimum resource requirements than those needed by D. pulicaria to offset the higher mortality rate imposed by selective epilimnetic fish predators. D. g. mendotae does not appear to have this effect in the absence of fish.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,KELLOGG BIOL STN,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060",,,,,,,,51,83,83,0,24,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,86,4,,,,,510,520,,10.1007/BF00318317,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN885,WOS:A1991FN88500008,28313332,,,,2021-09-23,

Propagule size and number often vary by several orders of magnitude among co-occurring plant species. Explaining the maintenance of this variation and understanding how propagule size contributes to coexistence remain a central challenge for community ecologists. The dominant paradigm is that a competition-colonization trade-off maintains interspecific variation in seed size, but empirical support is limited and other coexistence mechanisms, such as size-dependent seed predation, have not been examined. 2. We examined how seed size, fecundity, and other functional traits of 18 co-occurring perennial forbs trade-off with both vulnerability to rodent seed predation and competitive response to a community-dominant perennial bunchgrass. We added seeds of these species to 1 m(2) plots at 10 sites where we factorially manipulated rodent seed predation and competition from the community dominant, Festuca campestris. For a given plot, seeds of each species were added at densities that reflected the fecundity (i.e., per capita seed production) for each species. Moreover, we varied total seed density among plots by adding seeds at one of five relative densities (0, 0.25. 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 times each species' fecundity) to examine how fecundity affected overall recruitment for each species. 3. There was a trade-off between seed size and fecundity, as expected, but larger seed size was also associated with greater plant height, lower C/N ratios, and lower water use efficiency, suggesting that seed size represented a resource acquisitive trait syndrome (as quantified by trait principal component scores). 4. In the field experiment, the suppressive effects of seed predation on seed recruitment rate increased with increasing seed size. In contrast, smaller seeded species with less resource-acquisitive traits were more negatively affected by competition from F. campestris than were species with more resource acquisitive traits. 5. Synthesis. While the competition-colonization trade-off has been the predominant mechanism thought to maintain coexistence among species that vary in fecundity and seed size, our work suggests that susceptibility to rodent seed predation and competitive response to community dominants represent alternative mechanisms that can differentially influence plant recruitment of species based on their seed size and associated traits.","[Maron, John L.; Hajek, Karyn L.; Hahn, Philip G.; Pearson, Dean E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula, MT USA","Maron, JL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,,Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB-1553518]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518; NSF, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518",,55,9,9,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The competition hypothesis proposes that this pattern of habitat segregation reflects the effects of interspecific competition on habitat selection. To test this hypothesis we conducted field experiments that allowed the two species to select from among several habitats when alone and when together. We expected to find a lower proportion of each species in the habitat most associated with the other species, and a negative correlation between the demography and density of each species and the density of the competing species, but this was not the case. Interspecific competition did affect movement patterns of prairie voles. In the presence of meadow voles, net movement (immigration minus emigration) of prairie voles in high-cover habitats decreased and net dispersal of individuals from high- to low-cover habitats increased. Thus, our results indicated only a weak effect of competition on habitat selection. We suggest that other mechanisms, such as differences in habitat preference (or tolerance), differences in dispersal ability, and the advantage of first residency, need to be considered in conjunction with interspecific competition to explain the habitat segregation observed in these species.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Batzli, GO (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",,,,,,,28,13,15,0,4,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Five hypotheses were evaluated to explain why Z. mall had more impact on M. occidentalis in the field than on T. pyri. Given equal opportunity, Z. mall adult females did not consume more M. occidentalis eggs than T. pyri eggs nor did adult females of either phytoseiid inflict greater mortality on Z. mall eggs or larvae through attack or consumption. There was no difference in the within-tree association of Z. mall adult females with eggs of either phytoseiid species nor were there differences in the way prey mites (all life stages) were spatially partitioned between adult female Z. mall as compared with adults and deutonymphs (combined) of either phytoseiid. The foraging area of adult female Z. mali and the oviposition locations of the two phytoseiids from both field and laboratory data were compared using spatial statistics. Metaseiulus occidentalis laid significantly more eggs in the primary foraging area of adult female Z. mall than T. pyri.

We conducted laboratory and field experiments to evaluate the effects of intra- and interspecific interactions on the use of food resources and behavior of the sea stars Leptasterias polaris and Asterias vulgaris, 2 major predators in subtidal communities of the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, We demonstrate interference (encounter) competition between the two. For both species, the presence of the other (as detected by both contact and chemical signals) decreased feeding activity and provoked behavioral changes (avoidance, decrease in percentage feeding). These effects were reversible and short-lived, and were more pronounced when there was a shortage of food and when sea stars were exposed to simulated attacks by the other species (involving pedicellarial pinching). L. polaris seemed to be the inferior competitor as (1) it switched to less profitable prey size (smaller mussels, Mytilus edulis) when A. vulgaris was present, and (2) it avoided A. vulgaris and reduced its feeding activity when food was scarce, The dominance of A. vulgaris is possibly attenuated at our study site (near its northern distributional limit) by the reduction of its fitness when water temperatures are low (most of the year) and during the winter when it migrates to deeper water, Competition for food resources seems to occur periodically (mainly summer), in localized areas (patches and beds of mussels) or when sea stars form dense aggregations in which they are likely to interact frequently, Interactions, and thus the chance of competition, are less likely at greater depths. Coexistence seems to be permitted by both the attenuation of the dominance of A. vulgaris and by the great variations in how L. polaris and A. vulgaris interact (strongly affected by variations in prey availability, sea star abundance, and in the patterns of prey use by both sea stars).","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, GIROQ, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Himmelman, JH (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",john.himmelman@bio.ulaval.ca,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,73,33,35,1,21,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

These antagonistic interactions have been scarcely studied in coccinellids. Through a laboratory study we assessed aphid consumption, weight gain and reproduction when the invasive Harmonia axyridis, the alien Hippodamia variegata and the native Eriopis chilensis were alone, in conspecific and heterospecific groups, at low and high aphid densities. Under intraspecific competition, coccinellids were more voracious than when they were alone, particularly H. axyridis and H. variegata at high aphid density; H. axyridis and H. variegata gained more weight than E. chilensis, and H. axyridis barely reproduced at low aphid densities, even when alone, while in the other two species reproduction was not affected by the presence of conspecifics. Under interspecific competition, weight gain and reproduction results suggest that H. axyridis was responsible for most aphid consumption; H. variegata gained less weight and barely reproduced in heterospecific groups, but its reproduction was not affected. Eriopis chilensis weight gain and reproduction was low but not affected by the presence of the other species. The lack of negative effects of intraspecific competition on H. axyridis and its better performance in heterospecific groups suggests that this species is the stronger competitor, negatively affecting H. variegata, but not E. chilensis. Thus, exploitative interspecific competition is an important mechanism explaining the dominance of H. axyridis and the decline of some species following its invasion.

Interference competition is when one species denies a competing species access to a resource. One mechanism of interference competition is aggression, which can result in altered space-use of a subordinate species due to the threat of harm, otherwise known as a 'landscape of fear'. Alternatively, subordinates might outcompete dominant species in resource-poor environments via a superior ability to extract resources. Our goal was to evaluate spatial predictions of the 'landscape of fear' hypothesis for a carnivore guild in Newfoundland, Canada, where coyotes recently immigrated. Native Newfoundland carnivores include red foxes, Canada lynx, and black bears. We predicted foxes and lynx would avoid coyotes because of their larger size and similar dietary niches. We used scat-detecting dogs and genetic techniques to locate and identify predator scats. We then built resource selection functions and tested for avoidance by incorporating predicted values of selection for the alternative species into the best supported models of each species. We found multiple negative relationships, but notably did not find avoidance by foxes of areas selected by coyotes. While we did find that lynx avoided coyotes, we also found a reciprocal relationship. The observed patterns suggest spatial partitioning and not coyote avoidance, although avoidance could still be occurring at different spatial or temporal scales. Furthermore, Newfoundland's harsh climate and poor soils may swing the pendulum of interspecific interactions from interference competition to exploitative competition, where subordinates outcompete dominant competitors through a superior ability to extract resources.","[Mumma, Matthew A.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Holbrook, Joseph D.] Montana State Univ, Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Rayl, Nathaniel D.; Zieminski, Christopher J.; Fuller, Todd K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Organ, John F.] US Geol Survey, Cooperat Fish Unit, Reston, VA 22092 USA; [Organ, John F.] US Geol Survey, Wildlife Res Unit, Reston, VA 22092 USA; [Mahoney, Shane P.] Conservat Vis LLC, St John, NF, Canada; [Mahoney, Shane P.] Govt Newfoundland & Labrador, Sustainable Dev & Strateg Sci, Dept Environm & Conservat, St John, NF, Canada; [Waits, Lisette P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA","Mumma, MA (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC, Canada.",matt.mumma@unbc.ca,,"Mumma, Matthew/0000-0003-1954-6524; Waits, Lisette/0000-0002-1323-0812","Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation (Sustainable Development and Strategic Science); Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation (Institute for Biodiversity, Ecosystem Science and Sustainability); Safari Club International Foundation","This study was funded by the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation (Sustainable Development and Strategic Science and the Institute for Biodiversity, Ecosystem Science and Sustainability) and the Safari Club International Foundation.

Such characteristics promote distinct ecological conditions that support the existence of unique communities. In this work, we studied seven caves in the Presidente Olegario municipality, Minas Gerais state, Southeast Brazil, to determine their richness of predatory species, to understand how they are spatially distributed in the cave and whether their distribution is influenced by competition and/or predation. We carried out five surveys of the caves, with each cave divided into sampling plots. We collected fauna within the plots using a manual search method. The collected animals were fixed in 70% ethanol for later identification. We performed a canonical correspondence analysis to verify the spatial distribution and substrate preference of each species, and selected five species for agonistic interaction testing in the laboratory. We found a great richness of predators in the caves, with 79 species distributed among 22 families of spiders, five families of pseudoscorpions, three families of chilopods, two families of opilionids and one family each of scorpions and heteroptera. Spiders were the most species diverse and abundant of all arthropods we found in the caves. We recorded evidence of competition among some pairs of species but, in general, the spatial distribution of the predatory community in the interior of the caves seems to be unrelated to interspecies competition. The laboratory pairings support our field observations that most species merely share space, rather than exhibiting aggressive or predatory behaviour.","[Resende, L. P. A.; Bichuette, M.

They threaten a native species of similar biology, the European bullhead, by displacing them from shelters. These shelters are necessary for reproduction as well as for protection against predators and hydrodynamic forces. However, abiotic conditions may strongly modify the outcome of an interspecific competition in the wild. Nevertheless, little is known of the effect of flow velocity on the competition between these rheophilic species, although this factor is crucial for their distribution in the field. We video-recorded fish behaviour for 2h in single-species and mixed-species pairs in the presence of single shelters at three flow velocities: 0, 10 (a velocity preferred by the racer goby) and 30cms(-1) (a velocity greater than preferred by the racer goby) to determine whether the invader can deprive the native species of its shelter. At the flow of 0 and 10cms(-1), the racer goby exhibited aggressive behaviour towards bullhead, and this restricted the time spent by the bullhead in the shelter. Moreover, although the flow of 30cms(-1) inhibited racer goby aggression, the time spent by the bullhead in the shelter in interspecific competition was still reduced when compared to intraspecific controls. Our results suggest that under natural conditions, the racer goby displace bullheads from their shelters even at flow velocities greater than optimal for the racer goby.","[Jermacz, Lukasz] Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Jermacz, Lukasz; Kobak, Jaroslaw; Dzierzynska, Anna] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland; [Kakareko, Tomasz] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Hydrobiol, Torun, Poland","Jermacz, L (corresponding author), Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",lukasjermacz@gmail.com,"Jermacz, Lukasz/B-8728-2017; Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013","Jermacz, Lukasz/0000-0001-9182-116X; Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Kakareko, Tomasz/0000-0001-5054-7416","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [N N304 371539]","Our research was supported by a Grant of the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education No. N N304 371539.

The common sea star, Asterias rubens (Linneaus), is a dominant indigenous predator in rocky subtidal habitats in eastern Canada, affecting community structure through sustained consumption of bivalve prey, mainly blue mussel, Mytilus edulis (Linneaus). Yet, considerable spatial and dietary overlaps with the indigenous rock crab, Cancer irroratus (Say), and introduced green crab, Carcinus maeneas (Linneaus), together with comparatively lower mobility in A. rubens, suggest the latter is poorly fit to compete with both crabs for M. edulis. A laboratory mesocosm experiment was used to examine competitive interactions for variably-sized M. edulis between small and large, 3-week starved A. rubens, and large C. irroratus or C. maenas (in one-on-one sea star versus crab face-offs) from southeastern Newfoundland. Mussel consumption in starved A. rubens, as well as four components of its natural feeding behaviour, were quantified over 75-h trials in relatively cold (similar to 4 to 5.5 degrees C) seawater representative of the current northern limit of C. maenas' distribution in the northwestern Atlantic. Results showed that starved A. rubens (1) prioritizes consumption, upon contacting mussel prey, over non-feeding activities such as responding to physical contacts initiated by crabs; (2) alters consumption and feeding behaviour under prolonged exposure to C. irroratus; and (3) increases movement in presence of green crab, more so in large than small sea stars. Overall, findings demonstrate that A. rubens' foraging decisions vary ontogenetically and with competitor's identity. Observed differences in consumption and feeding behaviour in A. rubens exposed to familiar (rock crab) or unfamiliar (green crab) competitors also suggest timing and frequency of encounters with competitors have the potential to alter feeding patterns throughout an organism's lifetime.","[St-Pierre, Anne P.; Gagnon, Patrick] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ocean Sci Ctr, Dept Ocean Sci, 0 Marine Lab Rd, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Moreland, Hali R.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, 232 Elizabeth Ave, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada","St-Pierre, AP (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ocean Sci Ctr, Dept Ocean Sci, 0 Marine Lab Rd, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",apsp66@mun.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI-Leaders Opportunity Funds); Research & Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador (Ignite RD); Department of Biology of Memorial University of Newfoundland,"We are grateful to D.

However, the mode of their interactions is not known to use these predators together in the field. Hence, we investigated on the possible interactions i.e., cannibalism, intraguild predation (IGP) and competition between the predators in the presence and absence of prey Planococcus citri. In the presence of prey, no cannibalism and predation were observed in both S. epius and C. montrouzieri larvae. A pair of S. epius larvae consumed significantly more number of mealybugs than one S. epius/C. montrouzieri larva or a pair of C. montrouzieri larvae. The predation of S. epius larva by C. montrouzieri larva was significantly more than the predation of C. montrouzieri by S. epius. Conspecific and interspecific egg predation was absent both in S. epius and C. montrouzieri. Cannibalism in C. montrouzieri was more than that in S. epius. The study indicated that C. montrouzieri larvae can be used as an additive along with voracious S. epius larvae under abundant prey population. IGP was asymmetric between the two predators in the absence of prey. Both S. epius and C. montrouzieri larvae can maintain a stable coexistence when prey is abundantly available, however, in the complete absence of prey C. montrouzieri may dominate the guild. This study provides an insight into the possible complex inter- and intraspecific predatory phenomena in the field to use these two predators in the biological control of mealybugs.","[Dinesh, A.

Predator diversity alterations have been observed in most ecosystems as a result of the loss and/or addition of species. This has implications for predator-prey dynamics as non-trophic interactions among predators, so-called multiple predator effects (MPE), are known to influence predation success. In addition, there is often a density-dependent relationship between prey availability and prey consumption (functional response). While MPE investigations are common in the literature, functional responses have rarely been incorporated into this field of predation ecology. 2. Here, we outline an experimental procedure that incorporates functional responses into multiple predator effect studies. Using three fish species with different functional traits as model predators (bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, southern mouthbrooder Pseudocrenilabrus philander and banded tilapia Tilapia sparrmanii), we assess intra-and interspecific predator interaction outcomes on predator-prey dynamics. This was done by contrasting observed functional responses of heterospecific and conspecific combinations of predators with expected responses based on those of individual predators. 3. Multipredator combinations produced variable results. Bluegill were the only species in which observed conspecific multipredator functional responses matched those of expected based on individual performance (prey risk neutral effects). In contrast, prey risk reduction was observed for both mouthbrooder and tilapia conspecific multipredator trials. Heterospecific combinations revealed strong prey risk reduction effects for mouthbrooder-tilapia and bluegill-tilapia trials, while mouthbrooder-bluegill multipredator functional responses combined additively. These results are discussed within the context of behavioural traits of the species and the development of a trait-based predictive framework. 4. Using a functional response approach allowed for the assessment of multiple predator effects across a range of prey densities. We propose that the incorporation of within-guild predator combinations into classic functional response investigations will enhance predictive capacity development in competition and predation ecology.","[Wasserman, Ryan J.; Ellender, Bruce R.; Weyl, Olaf L.

In this study, the intra- and interspecific competition between two congeneric sandy beach amphipods Bathyporeia pilosa and B. sarsi was examined by means of a two-way factorial mesocosm experiment. The amount of natural food resources as well as population densities of B. pilosa and B. sarsi were manipulated in order to investigate whether firstly, the species compete for food, and secondly, whether crowding effects, such as damaging encounter competition, are present within and between both Bathyporeia species. The absence of food negatively influenced survival and recruitment and enhanced aggressive behavior in the B. sarsi population, while there was no influence of the absence of food in the B. pilosa population. In the field, B. pilosa is occurring high in the intertidal where food supply is low, while B. sarsi is occurring in the mid-intertidal where food supply is higher. Hence, B. pilosa is more adapted to low food conditions than B. sarsi. Although an increased intraspecific density stimulated encounter competition within the B. sarsi population, no evidence of interspecific competition was found in this study. This first report on encounter competition for the deposit-feeding amphipod Bathyporeia sarsi suggests that zonation patterns of the two amphipods may be the result of the combined influence of species-specific physiological restrictions and biotic interactions within the B. sarsi population, indicating that on dissipative beaches, biotic interactions may be more common than generally considered.

The leaf beetle, Chrysomela lapponica, originally uses the salicyl glucosides (SGs) of its host plants to sequester salicylaldehyde, which serves as a defence against generalist enemies but attracts specialist enemies. However, some populations of C. lapponica have shifted to SG-poor hosts, and their secretions do not contain salicylaldehyde. 2. In was suggested that beetles shift to SG-poor hosts to escape from specialist enemies. To test this hypothesis, we compared field mortality between two populations of C. lapponica that were associated with SG-rich willow, Salix myrsinifolia (Kola Peninsula and Finland) and two populations that fed on SG-poor willows, S. glauca (Ural) and S. caprea (Belarus). 3. Mortality from generalist enemies was significantly higher in Belarus than in three other populations, whereas mortality from specialists did not differ among populations. A specialist predator (syrphid fly larvae, Parasyrphus nigritarsis) and specialist parasitoids (phorid flies, Megaselia spp.) were attracted to the secretions of larvae reared on both SG-rich and SG-poor hosts. 4. Feeding on leaves of S. caprea and S. myrsinifolia both previously damaged by leaf puncturing and by the larvae of potentially competing species Chrysomela vigintipunctata, decreased the weight and prolonged the development of C. lapponica. 5. Thus, populations of C. lapponica that have shifted to SG-poor willow species did not obtain enemy-free space because specialist enemies have developed adaptations to herbivores that switched to a novel host plant. We suggest that in some populations host plant shift was favoured by interspecific competition with the early season SG-using specialist, C. vigintipunctata.","[Zvereva, Elena L.; Kozlov, Mikhail V.] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Kruglova, Oksana Yu] Univ Belarus, Fac Biol, Minsk, BELARUS","Zvereva, EL (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",elezve@utu.fi,"Zvereva, Elena L./M-8490-2016; Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013","Zvereva, Elena L./0000-0003-2934-3421; Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244",Maj and Tor Nessling foundation; ECEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [EVK2-2002-00169]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [122133],"We thank V.

We have studied the seasonal expression of these two interaction types within a two-species, boreal small mammal system. Seasons differ by resource availability, individual breeding state and intraspecific social system. Live-trapping methods were used to monitor space use and reproduction in 14 experimental populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in large outdoor enclosures with and without a dominant competitor, the field vole Microtus agrestis. We further compared vole behaviour using staged dyadic encounters in neutral arenas in both seasons. Survival of the non-breeding overwintering bank voles was not affected by competition. In the spring, the numbers of male bank voles, but not of females, were reduced significantly in the competition populations. Bank vole home ranges expanded with vole density in the presence of competitors, indicating food limitation. A comparison of behaviour between seasons based on an analysis of similarity revealed an avoidance of costly aggression against opponents, independent of species. Interactions were more aggressive during the summer than during the winter, and heterospecific encounters were more aggressive than conspecific encounters. Based on these results, we suggest that interaction types and their respective mechanisms are not either-or categories and may change over the seasons. During the winter, energy constraints and thermoregulatory needs decrease direct aggression, but food constraints increase indirect resource competition. Direct interference appears in the summer, probably triggered by each individual's reproductive and hormonal state and the defence of offspring against conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Both interaction forms overlap in the spring, possibly contributing to spring declines in the numbers of subordinate species.","[Eccard, Jana A.] Univ Potsdam, Unit Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Fey, Karen] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Caspers, Barbara A.] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Behav Biol, Res Grp Mol Ecol & Behav, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Unit Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",eccard@uni-potsdam.de,"Caspers, Barbara/C-5573-2011","Caspers, Barbara/0000-0002-4380-0476",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank the staff of the Konnevesi Research Station for maintaining the facilities and caring for animals, as well as researchers and field helpers.

What is known of the diet breadth, habitat preferences, and thermal thresholds for development of these two species indicates considerable niche overlap. The larger H. axyridis has many intrinsic advantages over C. sanguinea, including higher fecundity and fertility, and a lower rate of larval cannibalism. In laboratory tests, adults and larvae of H. axyridis consumed eggs of C. sanguinea more readily than vice versa. All H. axyridis adults provided with either a conspecific or a heterospecific second-instar larva killed and ate it, whereas only 15% of C. sanguinea adults consumed a second-instar larva of H. axyridis over a 24-h period. Larvae of H. axyridis were more aggressive against larvae of C. sanguinea in laboratory tests than vice versa; even when H. axyridis larvae were paired with a C. sanguinea larva 2d older and two to three times as large,they won 67% of contests. In choice tests, larvae of both species preferred to feed on dead C. sanguinea larvae than on dead H. axyridis larvae. Larvae of H. axyridis were capable of completing development exclusively as intraguild predators on C. sanguinea larvae, whereas the reverse was not true. The data suggest that H. axyridis is a highly evolved interspecific competitor, whereas C. sanguinea is adapted more to intraspecific competition and has few defenses against H. axyridis. Competitive displacement of C. sanguinea by H. axyridis appears to be in progress in the citrus ecosystem in Florida.","Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA","Michaud, JP (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Inst Food & Agr Sci, 700 Expt Stn Rd, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",jpmi@lal.ufl.edu,,,,,,45,181,192,2,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

The arctic fox in mainland Europe is endangered, while the red fox is increasing its range in the north. It has been suggested that the southern distribution limit of the arctic fox is determined by interspecific competition with the red fox. This has been criticised, on the basis that the species co-exist on a regional scale. However, if the larger red fox is superior and interspecific competition important, the arctic fox should avoid close contact, especially during the breeding season. Consequently, the distribution of breeding dens for the two species would be segregated on a much smaller spatial and temporal scale, in areas where they are sympatric. We tested this hypothesis by analysing den use of reproducing arctic and red foxes over 9 years in Sweden. High quality dens were inhabited by reproducing arctic foxes more often when no red foxes bred in the vicinity. Furthermore, in two out of three cases when arctic foxes did reproduce near red foxes, juveniles were killed by red foxes. We also found that breeding arctic foxes occupied dens at higher altitudes than red foxes did. in a large-scale field experiment, red foxes were removed, but the results were not conclusive. However, we conclude that on the scale of individual territories, arctic foxes avoid areas with red foxes. Through interspecific interference competition, the red fox might thus be excluding the arctic fox from breeding in low altitude habitat, which is most important in years when food abundance is limited and competition is most fierce. With high altitude refuges being less suitable, even small-scale behavioural effects could scale up to significant effects at the population level.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Tannerfeldt, M (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",tanner@zoologi.su.se,"Angerbjorn, Anders/AAX-3670-2021; Angerbjorn, Anders/A-5982-2013; Elmhagen, Bodil/M-4444-2014","Angerbjorn, Anders/0000-0001-5535-9086; Elmhagen, Bodil/0000-0001-5496-4727",,,,52,141,144,0,185,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2002,132,2,,,,,213,220,,10.1007/s00442-002-0967-8,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,580PL,WOS:000177242900008,28547354,,,,2021-09-23,

In Argentine Patagonia, the exotic European hare has one of the highest numbers recorded worldwide and is now a widely consumed prey for many predators. We examine the potential relationship between abundance of this relatively new prey and the abundance and breeding spacing of one of its main consumers, the Black-chested Buzzard-Eagle (Geranoaetus melartoleucus). First we analyze the abundance of individuals of a raptor guild in relation to hare abundance through a correspondence analysis. We then estimated the Nearest Neighbor Distance (NND) of the Black-chested Buzzard-eagle abundances in the two areas with high hare abundances. Finally, we performed a meta regression between the NND and the body masses of Accipitridae raptors, to evaluate if Black-chested Buzzard eagle NND deviates from the expected according to their mass. We found that eagle abundance was highly associated with hare abundance, more than with any other raptor species in the study area. Their NND deviates from the value expected, which was significantly lower than expected for a raptor species of this size in two areas with high hare abundance. Our results support the hypothesis that high local abundance of prey leads to a reduction of the breeding spacing of its main predator, which could potentially alter other interspecific interactions, and thus the entire community.","[Barbar, Facundo; Ignazi, Gonzalo O.; Lambertucci, Sergio A.] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ecotono Lab, Grp Biol Conservac, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Hiraldo, Fernando] Estn Biol Donana CSIC Espana, Dept Biol Conservac, Seville, Spain","Barbar, F (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ecotono Lab, Grp Biol Conservac, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",facundo.barbar@gmail.com,"Hiraldo, Fernando/AAA-8314-2019","LAMBERTUCCI, SERGIO/0000-0002-2624-2185",,,,86,6,6,0,3,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2167-8359,,,PEERJ,PeerJ,MAY 10,2018,6,,,,,,,,e4746,10.7717/peerj.4746,,,17,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,GF5OE,WOS:000432016600002,29761058,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-23,

In India, recently invaded fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) has to compete with native lepidopterans to become successful in an exotic environment. Invasive FAW and native pink stem borer (PSB), Sesamia inferens belong to the same feeding guild, and hence they are intraguild competitors. FAW is an aggressive pest and is known to have a cannibalism/predation habit and hence a good model system to study the ecological interactions. The present study examined the incidence of different lepidopteran pests in maize fields for three years after the recent invasion. Incidence of FAW increased over the years compared to other lepidopteran pests. Laboratory and field intraguild competition studies were conducted to understand the survival and fitness of FAW and PSB larvae under different competition scenarios. Our study demonstrated that survival of FAW was reduced in intraspecific as compared to interspecific competition. However, survival of PSB was significantly reduced in interspecific competition due to intraguild predation by FAW. Fitness cost analysis of PSB pupae survived in competition with FAW larvae indicated that they were negatively affected with reduced pupal weight. Low field incidence of PSB and its lowest survival in the presence of intraguild competitor, i.e. FAW prove that PSB might get displaced from the maize ecosystem in the near future.","[Divya, J.; Kalleshwaraswamy, C.

The three-species, the three two-species combinations, and one-species controls were used. The predictions from island biogeography and metapopulation theory that extinctions rates increase with decreasing patch size and increasing number of species present were also examined. Analyses of reproductive indices and population dynamics indicated that the species used similar resources and that interspecific competition operated during substantial parts of each year. The number of eggs per adult female (adult female egg ratio; E(A)) in the three species were positively related to each other, and concordant changes in the E(A)-values of pairs of species between subsequent sampling dates were significantly more common than discordant changes. There were negative relationships between E(A)-values and total Daphnia density in each species, but these were strong in one species only. Relative extinction rates (extinctions-population-1.year-1) were higher in experiments with three species initially present than in two-species experiments. No extinctions occurred in the one-species controls. Relative extinction rates were also higher in smaller than in larger volumes. The large species D. magna went extinct fewer times than the two smaller species D. pulex and D. longispina. In two-species experiments in volumes larger than 4 l, coexistence of both species after four years was the rule, in spite of interspecific competition. This is not consistent with the classical view that interspecific competition should lead to either niche differentiation or competitive exclusion, but it supports the view that environmental variability may promote coexistence of competing species. Although interspecific competition by itself may not be the most important factor determining the distribution of rockpool Daphnia, the finding that extinctions were most common in three-species experiments still indicates that competition may limit species richness in the rockpool system.","UNIV UPPSALA, DEPT ZOOL, S-75122 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",,,,,,,,98,34,36,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1993,67,3,,,,,451,464,,10.2307/3545357,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LN449,WOS:A1993LN44900007,,,,,2021-09-23,

In many systems this separation is experimentally impossible without interfering with the natural behavior of the animals. Consequently, these studies can only demonstrate the combined effect of interference and exploitation on the forager's feeding rate, namely, it usually decreases in a decelerating rate as a function of density. We suggest here a simple experimental and statistical procedure that facilitates the separation of the effects of interference from those of exploitation. This procedure includes manipulation of both predator density and the foraging experiment duration. The statistical analysis is based on multiple linear regression. The working assumption is that exploitation can be neglected at the beginning of the foraging experiment because, initially, predators do not experience diminishing returns in prey capture rates. Using both the results of an individual-based simulation and a field experiment dataset of gerbils foraging for seeds in an artificial food patch located in the field, we demonstrate that our procedure can successfully detect and separate the effect of interference from the combined overall effect of competition (i.e., interference plus exploitation).","[Scharf, Inon; Filin, Ido; Ovadia, Ofer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Scharf, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",schari@bgu.ac.il; filin@bgu.ac.il; oferovad@bgu.ac.il,"Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012; Scharf, Inon/AAF-2343-2020","Scharf, Inon/0000-0002-8506-7161; Filin, Ido/0000-0001-6231-0029; Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,27,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",1438-3896,,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

This paper reports on an experiment designed to test competitive effects in a natural community of web-weaving spiders, accomplished by selective removal of each of the three locally dominant species: Araneus marmoreus, Argiope bruennichi, and Agelena labyrinthica. No statistically significant difference was found among control plots and the plots where one of the three species had been removed, for any of the variables measured, but the small number of replicates limited statistic power. Considering only effect direction, and not statistical significance, these removal experiments supported competitive effects on community structure, habitat overlap, and spider body size. On the other hand, effects were contrary to competitive expectations as regards abundance and habitat breadth. These results are in line with the findings of the other removal experiments conducted so far on spiders, that uncovered small intra- and interspecific competitive effects fbr some variables but not for others. So Ear, there is no evidence that interspecific competition may affect spider communities, although a low-level competition remains possible, but difficult to test statistically for its evolutionary consequence.","Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Fasola, M (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, Piazza Botta 9, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",fasola@ipv36.unipv.it,,"FASOLA, MAURO/0000-0002-7366-5893",,,,19,3,3,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1125-0003,1748-5851,,ITAL J ZOOL,Ital.

The balance of predation between closely related invasive and native species can be an important determinant of the success or failure of biological invasions. In Irish freshwaters, the introduced amphipod Gammarus pulex has replaced the native G. duebeni celticus, possibly through differential mutual intraguild predation (IGP). Theoretically, parasitism could mediate such predation and hence the invasion outcome. However, this idea remains poorly studied. 2. In a field survey, we show that the acanthocephalan parasite Echinorynchus truttae is present in more G. pulex populations than G. d. celticus populations. In addition, within parasitised populations, E. truttae is more prevalent in the invader than in the native. 3. We show for the first time that an acanthocephalan parasite mediates predation between its intermediate macroinvertebrate hosts. In a field experiment, E. truttae parasitism of the invader lowered IGP upon the unparasitised native. In laboratory experiments, parasitism of G. pulex significantly reduced their predatory impact on recently moulted female G. d. celticus. Parasitism also appeared to cause reduction in predatory behaviour, such as attacks per contact on precopula guarded female natives. 4. We conclude that higher parasite prevalence in invaders as compared with natives, by mediation of interspecific interactions, could promote species coexistence, or at least slow species replacements, in this particular biological invasion.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Ctr Med Biol, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","MacNeil, C (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Ctr Med Biol, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",,"Briffa, Mark/M-9041-2013","Briffa, Mark/0000-0003-2520-0538; Dunn, Alison/0000-0002-4855-1077",,,,55,35,36,1,27,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Coexistence of the two species in Lake Candia lasted only 7 months, suggesting that species replacement was determined either by environmental changes or by strong competition. To assess whether the potential for interspecific competition existed and to identify species' traits which could explain the competitive superiority of E. gracilis, we examined field seasonal patterns, reproductive parameters and body size of the two species. E. padanus abundance was probably reduced by predation and parasitism, which favoured the displacement of the species shortly after invasion by E. gracilis. The temporarily underexploited niche provided an opportunity for the successful establishment of the invader. The reproductive patterns of the two species were found to be similar in most of their features, with the exception of a markedly larger clutch size and a smaller egg volume in the resident species. By contrast, the invader showed a higher adult:egg ratio and a lower death rate. Thus, despite the greater fecundity of E. padanus, the competitive success of the invader might be attributable to interspecific differences in developmental rates and/or juvenile mortality.","CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, I-28922 Verbania, Italy","Riccardi, N (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, Largo Tonolli 50, I-28922 Verbania, Italy.",n.riccardi@ise.cnr.it,"Riccardi, Nicoletta/G-1756-2013; Riccardi, Nicoletta Rita/ABD-3351-2020","Riccardi, Nicoletta/0000-0002-5297-3387; Riccardi, Nicoletta Rita/0000-0002-5297-3387",,,,58,13,14,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

Mice were introduced into a 5 m diameter enclosure containing substrates from three habitats: maple, mixed, and coniferous forest. Trapping data were taken from a long-term monitoring study of small-mammal populations in Algonquin Park, Ontario. We used data from 1991-1995 from the three habitats used in the enclosure experiment. If competition or predation affects habitat distribution patterns. then, given a choice, mice should select different substrates in the enclosures from those they use in the field. Alternatively, if habitat use is not constrained by interactions with competitors or predators (i.e., if small mammals select habitats), then habitats used in the enclosure should match habitat distributions observed in the field. Habitats used in the field did not match habitats selected in the enclosure experiment for either deer mice or woodland jumping mice. Redback voles selected habitats similar to those used in the field.

The field experiment followed a two-factorial design, with Glossosoma densities (natural vs reduced) and sculpin presence (present vs absent) as treatments. Diet analysis revealed that all four prey species were eaten under the natural condition and the sculpin preferred mayfly grazers to Glossosoma. Our experiment showed that although mayfly densities in the presence of either sculpin or Glossosoma were lower than in the no-sculpin plus reduced-Glossosoma treatment, no difference in mayfly densities was found between the following three treatments: sculpin plus natural-Glossosoma, no-sculpin plus natural-Glossosoma, and sculpin plus reduced-Glossosoma. These results indicated that fish predator produced no effects additive to the competitive operation on the mayfly density, and also that competitive operation of Glossosoma on the mayfly densities produced no additional effects to fish predators. In addition, although the competitive effect of the mayflies on Glossosoma could not be manipulated in isolation, the density of Glossosoma in the presence of sculpin was greater than that in the absence of sculpin in the natural-Glossosoma treatment. Thus, the densities of these competing grazers either stayed the same or increased in the presence of the fish predator relative to predator-free treatments. A theoretical model, developed to explain the experimental results here, predicted that the densities of the two competing prey under predation pressure could be simultaneously greater than those under predator absent conditions when the behaviorally-mediated effects of the predator were strongly operative. Although we were unable to distinguish experimentally the two different effects of predator on the prey competition, the behaviorally- and density-mediated effects, the reality of the behaviorally-mediated effects in the experiment was discussed.","Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600019, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; Chitose Board Educ, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan","Miyasaka, H (corresponding author), Res Inst Human & Nat, Kamigyo Ku, 335 Takashima Cho, Kyoto 6020878, Japan.",,,,,,,44,15,15,0,23,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2003,101,3,,,,,511,520,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12001.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,680PH,WOS:000182986200008,,,,,2021-09-23,

Because it is difficult to identify seed hoarders and pilferers under field conditions by traditional methods, the full costs incurred and benefits accrued by scatter-hoarding have not been fully evaluated in most systems. By using infrared radiation camera tracking and seed tagging, we investigated the benefits and losses of scatter-hoarded seeds (Camellia oleifera) for 3 sympatric rodent species (Apodemus draco, Niviventer confucianus and Leopoldamys edwardsi) in a subtropical forest of Southwest China during 2013 to 2015. We established the relationships between the rodents and the seeds at the individual level. For each rodent species, we calculated the cache recovery rate of cache owners, as well as conspecific and interspecific pilferage rates. We found that all 3 sympatric rodent species had a cache recovery advantage with rates that far exceeded average pilferage rates over a 30-day tracking period. The smallest species (A. draco) showed the highest rate of scatter-hoarding and the highest recovery advantage compared with the other 2 larger species (N. confucianus and L. edwardsi). Our results suggest that scatter-hoarding benefits cache owners in food competition, supporting the pilferage avoidance hypothesis. Therefore, scatter-hoarding behavior should be favored by natural selection, and plays a significant role in species coexistence of rodent community and in the formation of mutualism between seeds and rodents in forest ecosystems.","[Gu, Haifeng; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gu, Haifeng; Zhao, Qingjian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,,,"Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB11050300, KSZD-EW-TZ-008]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31330013]","We thank Zhishu Xiao, Hongmao Zhang, Xianfeng Yi, Chuan Yan, Lin Cao and Xinru Wan for technical support; Xifu Yang, Wenhua Xie and Chengqiang Wang for field assistance; Stephen Vander Wall, Patrick Jansen, Michael Steele, Marcel Holyoak and Guiming Wang for comments that helped improve the manuscript; and the Subalpine Mountain Plant Garden of West China, CAS and the Forest Bureau of Dujiangyan City of Sichuan Province for support through the use of facilities.

These interaction types may overlap and vary with the season and life-history state of individuals. We studied effects of competition and potential nest predation by common shrews (Sorex araneus) on lactating bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in two seasons. The species coexist and may interact aggressively. Additionally, shrews can prey on nestling voles. We studied bank vole mothers' spatial and temporal adaptations to shrew presence during summer and autumn. Further, we focused on fitness costs, e.g. decreased offspring survival, which bank voles may experience in the presence of shrews. In summer, interference with shrews decreased the voles' home ranges and they spent more time outside the nest, but there were no effects on offspring survival. In autumn, we found decreased offspring survival in enclosures with shrews, potentially due to nest predation by shrews or by increased competition between species. Our results indicate a shift between interaction types depending on seasonal constraints. In summer, voles and shrews seem to interact mainly by interference, whereas resource competition and/or nest predation by shrews gain importance in autumn. Different food availability, changing environmental conditions and the energetic constraints in voles and shrews later in the year may be the reasons for the varying combinations of interaction types and their increasing effects on the inclusive fitness of bank voles. Our study provides evidence for the need of studies combining life history with behavioural measurements and seasonal constraints.","[Liesenjohann, Monique; Liesenjohann, Thilo; Eccard, Jana A.] Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Trebaticka, Lenka; Haapakoski, Marko; Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Trebaticka, Lenka; Haapakoski, Marko; Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Metapopulat Res Grp, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Liesenjohann, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",monique.liesenjohann@uni-potsdam.de,,"Haapakoski, Marko/0000-0003-0901-6319",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [ec361/4-1],This study was supported by the German Science Foundation (grand to JAE ec361/4-1).,,74,17,17,0,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

This study assessed the predator-prey relationship between two non-native crayfish species (Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus) and three native (Anodonta anatina, Potomida littoralis and Unio delphinus) and one non-native (Corbicula fluminea) freshwater bivalve species through experiments in laboratory and validation under natural conditions (Sabor River basin, Portugal). All native bivalve species were preyed both in laboratory and in the field: however, both crayfish species were unable to prey C. fluminea. Predation was dependent on crayfish and bivalve species but was not affected neither by crayfish nor bivalve sizes. In the laboratory, the most preyed species by both crayfishes was A. anatina. On average, this species was preyed at least 12% more than other species, when crayfishes had a choice. Similar results were found in the field. We also found signs of competition between both crayfishes, being P. clarkii more dominant and aggressive as this species, on average, manipulated the bivalves 63.6% more times and 24:33 min longer than P. leniusculus, and initiated 55.8% more agnostic bouts. Our results support the idea that P. clarkii and P. leniusculus can affect native freshwater bivalves, but clear interspecific differences were detected. Both crayfishes may have direct and indirect impacts on bivalve populations by increasing mortality or by reducing their fitness. In addition, since both crayfishes do not prey C. fluminea, they offer this IAS another advantage over native bivalves. Given the widespread distribution of both P. clarkii and P. leniusculus and the threatened status of many freshwater bivalves, the dynamics and impacts of this relationship should be taken in account in the implementation of management measures devoted to the conservation of native freshwater bivalves.

Animals may anticipate and try to avoid, at some costs, physical encounters with other competitors. This may ultimately impact their foraging distribution and intake rates. Such cryptic interference competition is difficult to measure in the field, and extremely little is known at the interspecific level. 2. We tested the hypothesis that smaller species avoid larger ones because of potential costs of interference competition and hence expected them to segregate from larger competitors at the scale of a resource patch. We assessed fine-scale spatial segregation patterns between three African herbivore species (zebra Equus quagga, kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis) and a megaherbivore, the African elephant Loxodonta africana, at the scale of water resource patches in the semi-arid ecosystem of Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. 3. Nine waterholes were monitored every two weeks during the dry season of a drought year, and observational scans of the spatial distribution of all herbivores were performed every 15 min. We developed a methodological approach to analyse such fine-scale spatial data. 4. Elephants increasingly used waterholes as the dry season progressed, as did the probability of co-occurrence and agonistic interaction with elephants for the three study species. All three species segregated from elephants at the beginning of the dry season, suggesting a spatial avoidance of elephants and the existence of costs of being close to them. However, contrarily to our expectations, herbivores did not segregate from elephants the rest of the dry season but tended to increasingly aggregate with elephants as the dry season progressed. 5. We discuss these surprising results and the existence of a trade-off between avoidance of interspecific interference competition and other potential factors such as access to quality water, which may have relative associated costs that change with the time of the year.","[Ferry, Nicolas; Dray, Stephane; Fritz, Herve; Valeix, Marion] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon, CNRS UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, Bat Gregor Mendel,43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Ferry, N (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon, CNRS UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, Bat Gregor Mendel,43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",ferrynicolas@me.com,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014; Dray, Stephane/B-4107-2010; Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661; Dray, Stephane/0000-0003-0153-1105; Ferry, Nicolas/0000-0001-5191-9648",CNRS Zone Atelier Hwange (CNRS-Hwange LTER); French 'Ministere de la Recherche' through the 'Ecole Doctorale Diversite du Vivant' of 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie',"This research was conducted under the Hwange Environmental Research Development (HERD) programme from the French 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique' (CNRS) and 'Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement' (CIRAD), within the study area of, and with funding support from, the CNRS Zone Atelier Hwange (CNRS-Hwange LTER).

Tests were run in the presence and absence of a potential competitor, Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii). From tracks in the sand, we determined that, when alone, deer mice decreased total activity as moonlight increased and were more active in areas with cover than in open areas. However, deer mice did not vary proportions of activity allocated to open areas (ca. 20%) and cover/edge areas (ca. 80%) with variations in moonlight. Deer mice consumed more seeds in areas with cover but also did not vary the proportions of seeds eaten in the open (ca. 43%) or cover (ca. 57%) with variations in moonlight. Using infrared video filming, we determined that deer mice increased use of cover to nearly 100% in the presence of Ord's kangaroo rats.

In this study, we used a manipulative experiment to test the effects of habitat degradation on competition between two planktivorous, coral-dwelling damselfishes, Chrysiptera parasema and Dascyllus melanurus. Experimental reefs were constructed with either healthy (100% live) or degraded (10% live) Acropora longicyathus coral, stocked with varying densities of these two fish species, and monitored for two months. On healthy habitat, the mortality of C. parasema was density dependent, and increased substantially in the presence of the dominant interspecific competitor D. melanurus. In contrast, on reefs where habitat was degraded, C. parasema mortality was highly variable, density independent, and was no longer influenced by the presence of dominant competitor D. melanurus. Behavioral observations revealed that agonistic interactions for both species increased with density on degraded habitat, but not on healthy habitat. In addition, on degraded reefs, both species displayed a reduced association with reef habitat and ventured further away from shelter with increasing densities of the dominant competitor D. melanurus. These results suggest that reduced habitat quality can have such a profound effect on reef fishes, that it eliminates density-dependent mortality and competitive dominance hierarchies, thereby substantially altering the mechanisms that structure reef fish communities.","[Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Bonin, Mary C.; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Bonin, Mary C.; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Bostrom-Einarsson, L (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",lisa.bostromeinarsson@my.jcu.edu.au,"Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/B-5436-2015; Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011; Bonin, Mary/H-3433-2012","Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/0000-0003-4814-9552; Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498; Bonin, Mary/0000-0001-7249-0887","Australian Research Council through the Center of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; College of Marine and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia","We are grateful to E.

In the Florida Keys (USA), anecdotal observations have long pointed to an inverse relationship in abundance of two large decapod crustaceans found co-occurring in hard-bottom habitat, the stone crab Menippe mercenaria and the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. We used them to explicitly test whether competition for a renewable resource (shelter) can drive the abundance and distribution of the inferior competitor. We first explored this relationship in shelter competition mesocosm experiments to determine the competitively dominant species. Results showed that stone crabs are clearly the dominant competitors regardless of the number of lobsters present, the presence of co-sheltering species such as the spider crab, Damithrax spinosissimus, or the order of introduction of competitors into the mesocosm. We also found that lobsters use chemical cues from stone crabs to detect and avoid them. We then tested the ramifications of this competitive dominance in the field by manipulating stone crab abundance and then tracking the abundance and distribution of spiny lobsters through time. Increased stone crab abundance immediately resulted in decreased lobster abundance and increased aggregation. The opposite occurred on sites where stone crabs were removed. When we stopped removing stone crabs from these sites, they soon returned and lobster abundance decreased. This study explicitly demonstrated that interspecific competition can drive population dynamics between these species, and ultimately, community composition in these shallow water habitats.","[Behringer, Donald C.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Behringer, Donald C.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Behringer, Donald C.; Hart, John E.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",behringer@ufl.edu,,,University of Florida School of Natural Resources and EnvironmentUniversity of Florida; NOAA Florida Sea Grant College Program [R/LR-B-65]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0928398],"We thank D.

Very little is known though about the shape of the cost function for species with direct interference competition. Here we report the results of an experiment with two vole species in artificial coexistence in large enclosures, where density of the dominant competitor species (Microtus agrestis) was manipulated. Experimental populations of the subordinate vole species (Clethrionomys glareolus) were composed of same aged individuals to study distribution of costs of coexistence with a dominant species within an age-cohort. Survival and space use decreased gradually with increasing field vole numbers. Thus, responses to interference competition in our system appeared to be similar as expected from resource competition. The total number of breeders was stable. Reproductive characteristics such as the timing of breeding, and the litter size were not affected. In the single species enclosures a proportion of surviving individuals were not able to establish a breeding territory against stronger conspecifics. Under competition with heterospecifics such nonbreeders suffered high mortality, whereas the breeders survived. Combined interference of dominant conspecifics and heterospecifics probably increased the frequency of aggressive interactions, social stress and mortality for the weaker individuals within a homogeneous age cohort of the subordinate competitor population. Our results suggest, that in open systems where bank voles are outcompeted over the breeding season by faster reproducing field voles, animals able to establish a territory may be able to withstand competitor pressure, while nonbreeding bank vole individuals are forced to emigrate to suboptimal forest habitats.","Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",jana.eccard@uni-bielefeld.de,,,,,,42,14,16,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

While the presence of aphid-tending ants can change the distribution of aphids among host plants, the role of mutualistic ants has not been fully explored to understand coexistence of multiple aphid species in a community. The tansy plant (Tanacetum vulgare) hosts three common and specialized aphid species, with only one being tended by ants. Often, these aphids species will not coexist on the same plant but will coexist across multiple plant hosts in a field. In this study, we aim to understand how interactions with mutualistic ants and predators affect the coexistence of multiple species of aphid herbivores on tansy. We show that the presence of ants drives community assembly at the level of individual plant, that is, the local community, by favoring one ant-tended species, Metopeurum fuscoviride, while preying on the untended Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria and, to a lesser extent, Uroleucon tanaceti. Competitive hierarchies without ants were very different from those with ants. At the regional level, multiple tansy plants provide a habitat across which all aphid species can coexist at the larger spatial scale, while being competitively excluded at the local scale. In this case, ant mutualist-dependent reversal of the competitive hierarchy can drive community dynamics in a plant-aphid system.","[Mehrparvar, Mohsen; Zytynska, Sharon E.; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Ctr Food & Life Sci Weihenstephan, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Balog, Adalbert] Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transylvania, Dept Hort, Fac Tech & Human Sci, Targu Mures, Romania; [Mehrparvar, Mohsen] Grad Univ Adv Technol, Dept Biodivers, Inst Sci & High Technol & Environm Sci, Kerman, Iran","Zytynska, SE (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Ctr Food & Life Sci Weihenstephan, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",sharon.zytynska@tum.de,"Zytynska, Sharon/C-9089-2011; Balog, Adalbert/O-9649-2019; Adalbert, Balog/AAR-4097-2021; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014","Zytynska, Sharon/0000-0002-0174-3303; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Mehrparvar, Mohsen/0000-0002-6051-5845","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [WE 3081/25-1]; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology of Iran; Institute of Science and High Technology and Environmental Sciences, Kerman, Iran; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Technical University of Munich (TUM)","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: WE 3081/25-1; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology of Iran and Institute of Science and High Technology and Environmental Sciences, Kerman, Iran; German Research Foundation (DFG); Technical University of Munich (TUM)",,48,2,2,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The species is sometimes seen in primary rainforest, although at a curiously low density compared with that of other monkey species. We conducted a 24-month field study in the tropical rainforest of Tai National Park, Ivory Coast, and found that putty-nosed monkeys require an ecological niche almost identical to that of the Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana diana. Moreover, the niche breadth of putty-nosed monkeys was significantly decreased in the presence of Diana monkeys, suggesting that feeding competition with Diana monkeys kept putty-nosed monkeys from successfully colonizing a rainforest habitat. However, contrary to the interspecies competition hypothesis, groups of both species almost completely overlapped in home ranges and formed near-permanent mixed-species associations, rather than avoiding each other. We hypothesized that Diana monkeys tolerated immigrating putty-nosed monkeys and formed mixed-species groups with them, despite high levels of competition, because of their merit in predation defense. Direct observations and a series of field experiments confirmed that male putty-nosed monkeys play a vital role in defense against crowned eagles, suggesting that putty-nosed monkeys obtain access to feeding trees by offering antipredation benefits to Diana monkeys. We discuss these findings in light of biological market theory.","Ctr Suisse Rech Sci, Tai Monkey Project, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire; Univ Leipzig, Fak Biowissensch Pharm & Psychol, Abt Biol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol, St Andrews KY16 9JP, Fife, Scotland","Zuberbuhler, K (corresponding author), Ctr Suisse Rech Sci, Tai Monkey Project, BP 1303, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire.",kz3@st-and.ac.uk,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X",,,,44,72,78,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

However, investigating carnivore behaviour in the field can be challenging especially for species that are difficult to access. Methods that enable remote collection of data provide a means of recording natural behaviour and are therefore useful for studying elusive species such as leopards (Panthera pardus). Camera traps and Global Positioning System (GPS) collars are powerful tools often used independently to study animal behaviour but where their data are combined, the interpretation of a species' behaviours is improved. In this study we used data from baited camera trap stations to investigate the feeding habits of leopards at Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, Zimbabwe. We investigated the influence of spotted hyenas, lions and other competing leopards on the feeding duration of leopards using Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Modelling. To test the influence of competing predators on resting distances from bait sites, eight leopards were fitted with GPS collars. Results showed that leopards spent the shortest time feeding on the baits in the presence of competing male leopards compared to other predators while lion presence caused animals to rest farthest from bait sites. Interaction analysis indicated that small-bodied leopards spent significantly shorter durations feeding when spotted hyenas were present. Our findings demonstrate that competition from guild carnivores has negative impacts on the food intake of leopards, which may have implications for fitness and survival. This study provides a snapshot of the competition dynamics at bait sites which may give insight to ecosystem level interactions among large carnivores in savanna ecosystems.","[Tarugara, Allan; Clegg, Bruce W.] Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, Private Bag 7085, Chiredzi, Zimbabwe; [Tarugara, Allan; Gandiwa, Edson; Muposhi, Victor K.] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Sch Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe","Tarugara, A (corresponding author), Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, Private Bag 7085, Chiredzi, Zimbabwe.",allantarugara@gmail.com,,"Tarugara, Allan/0000-0003-4623-6097","The Malilangwe Trust, Chiredzi, Zimbabwe","The Malilangwe Trust, Chiredzi, Zimbabwe",,81,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Until now, the existence of competition (including predation) between these groups has not been tested. To assess the coexistence and potential role of interspecific interactions between surface Gammarus fossarum and subterranean Niphargus timavi, and to determine their micro distributions, we conducted a series of field and laboratory observations. We aimed to determine: (1) species substrate preference, (2) whether the presence of G. fossarum influences the habitat choice of N. timavi, and (3) possible predation effects on micro habitat choice of small juveniles. Throughout a small river in SW Slovenia, N. timavi was predominantly found in leaf litter and gravel, but rarely in sand. In the sand however, we exclusively found juveniles. In contrast, surface G. fossarum sheltered mainly in leaf litter. A similar, body size dependent, micro distribution was observed in G. fossarum, where small individuals were generally found in gravel and sand. The presence of G. fossarum affected the micro distribution of juvenile, but not adult, N. timavi. In the laboratory we observed predation and cannibalism in both species. Niphargus timavi, however, appeared to be a more efficient predator than G. fossarum. In particular, juvenile N. timavi were most vulnerable to preying by adults of both species. This probably affected the distribution of juvenile N. timavi that chose finer substrates when placed with adult individuals in an aquarium with granules of different size. To understand the distribution of subterranean species, the summed effect of intraspecific interactions, as well as surface - subterranean species interactions, in particular between individuals of different size, should be taken into account.","[Lustrik, Roman; Turjak, Martin; Fiser, Cene] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Biol, SI-1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kralj-Fiser, Simona] Slovenian Acad Sci & Arts, Jovan Hadzi Inst Biol, Ctr Sci Res, SI-1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia","Lustrik, R (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Biol, POB 2995, SI-1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",roman.lustrik@gmail.com,,"Kralj-Fiser, Simona/0000-0001-6604-2332",Slovenian Ministry of Education and Sport,"The paper is dedicated to the memory of Miha Valic, who accompanied Cene Fiser in the very first field observations in 2004.

However, the nature and strength of interactions among species remain unknown for most resource pulse-driven ecosystems. We considered five hypotheses concerning the influence of resource pulses on the interactions between rodents, predators, and bird reproduction with data from northern Switzerland collected between 2010 and 2015. In high-rodent-abundance-years (HRAYs), wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) nest survival was lower than in low-rodent-abundance-years, but rodents were not important nest predators, in contrast to rodent-hunting predators. The higher proportion of nests predated by rodent-hunting predators and their increased occurrence in HRAYs suggests a rodent-mediated aggregative numerical response of rodent-hunting predators, which incidentally prey on the wood warbler's ground nests. There was no evidence that rodent-hunting predators responded behaviorally by switching prey. Lastly, nest losses caused by nonrodent-hunting predators were not related to rodent abundance. We show that wood warblers and rodents are linked via shared predators in a manner consistent with apparent competition, where an increase of one species coincides with the decrease of another species mediated by shared predators. Mast seeding frequency and annual seed production appear to have increased over the past century, which may result in more frequent HRAYs and generally higher peaking rodent populations. The associated increase in the magnitude of apparent competition may thus at least to some extent explain the wood warbler's decline in much of Western Europe.","[Grendelmeier, Alex; Pasinelli, Gilberto] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland; [Grendelmeier, Alex; Arlettaz, Raphael] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, Bern, Switzerland; [Arlettaz, Raphael] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Valais Field Stn, Sion, Switzerland; [Pasinelli, Gilberto] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland","Grendelmeier, A (corresponding author), Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland.",alex.grendelmeier@vogelwarte.ch,,"Pasinelli, Gilberto/0000-0003-3704-4843",Styner-Stiftung; Basler Stiftung fur biologische Forschung; Lotteriefonds des Kantons Solothurn; Hilfsfonds fur die Schweizerische Vogelwarte Sempach; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [31003A_ 143879/1]; Emilia Guggenheim-Schnurr-Stiftung; Stotzer-Kastli-Stiftung; Carl Burger-Stiftung Munchenstein,"Styner-Stiftung; Basler Stiftung fur biologische Forschung; Lotteriefonds des Kantons Solothurn; Hilfsfonds fur die Schweizerische Vogelwarte Sempach; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 31003A_ 143879/1; Emilia Guggenheim-Schnurr-Stiftung; Stotzer-Kastli-Stiftung; Carl Burger-Stiftung Munchenstein",,69,10,11,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In these areas populations of the native mud snail, Cerithidea californica, have declined precipitously. Since both species feed on epipelic diatoms, I hypothesized that the decline in Cerithidea was a result of exploitative competition with Batillaria. To test this hypothesis I manipulated snail densities in Bolinas Lagoon, California, to estimate their effects on, and responses to, food resources. For two size classes of each snail species I quantified (1) the effect of intraspecific density on food availability, and (2) the growth response of each size class to different food levels. These relationships were used to generate predictions of the exploitative competitive effect of each snail on the other species. These predictions were tested against direct measurements of the effect of interspecific competition on snail tissue growth using field experiments. The observed values of snail growth matched well the predicted relationships, suggesting that exploitative competition does occur. Although the two snails did not differ in their effect on resource levels at any experimental snail density, the introduced snail was always more efficient at converting limited resources to tissue growth. Similar results were obtained in three different experimental periods. Batillaria's enhanced resource conversion efficiency provides a sufficient explanation for its successful invasion and subsequent exclusion of Cerithidea. Theoretically, conversion efficiency of resources should be just as important as resource suppression and uptake to exploitative competitive ability, but it is rarely examined experimentally.

Although not yet studied in the field, the distribution and abundance of Andalusian toothcarp are thought to be strongly influenced by interspecific interactions. We analysed the abundance and microhabitat use of Andalusian toothcarp in two water courses, one in which several other fish species occurred (sympatric site) and one hypersaline stream in which toothcarp was the only species present (allopatric site). Fish were sampled using plastic minnow traps and results were analysed separately for three size categories. Toothcarps were clearly more abundant in the allopatric population than in the sympatric one, though the difference was less apparent in the smallest size category. In coexistence with other species, toothcarp occupied shallower microhabitats, but in both sites in the absence of shelter fish selected deeper positions than in its absence. While in the sympatric site sheltered microhabitats were used predominately by small individuals, in the allopatric ones they were used by larger ones. Observed patterns strongly suggest that predation is the main mechanism involved in the differences in abundance and microhabitat use between sites. Our results confirm that the presence or absence of coexisting species is an important habitat feature for Andalusian toothcarp populations.","Univ Girona, Inst Ecol Aquat, Girona 17071, Spain; Univ Huelva, Dept Biol Ambiental & Salud, Huelva 21007, Spain","Clavero, M (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Inst Ecol Aquat, Girona 17071, Spain.",miguel.clavero@udg.es,"Clavero, Miguel/A-9040-2015; PRENDA, JOSE/K-4994-2014","Clavero, Miguel/0000-0002-5186-0153; Prenda, Jose/0000-0002-1505-8331",,,,43,12,14,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Interspecific competition, predation, increased disturbance, organochlorine poisoning and food shortages were suggested as main reasons for the overall decrease. Here we contribute to a better understanding of population declines by comparing foraging movements of satellite tracked adult gulls in three geographical areas of Finland (West, South, and East) that differ in their population trends. Our analysis examines potential differences and preferences in the feeding site behaviour of adult gulls. Our comparison of the three geographical areas showed that nLBBGs preferred feeding at fur farms in West Finland, waste dumps in South Finland, and lakes and fields in East Finland. We found individual gulls of this purportedly generalist species to be highly specialised in their foraging behaviour, particularly those that might be associated with their survival probabilities. We hypothesise that differences in foraging behaviour and food availability during the breeding season are partially responsible for differences in demographic trends between populations. Specifically, we identify potential local conservation problems such as shooting in birds visiting fur farms. Our data suggest that the effective conservation and management of endangered nLBBGs could be aided by simple actions in the breeding areas in addition to better protection throughout the annual movement cycle.

Here, we examine the role of seasonality in moderating interactions between a globally important invasive mysid shrimp (Hemimysis anomala) and an ecologically similar native species (Mysis salemaai) by combining distribution and diet surveys with experimental quantification of comparative resource exploitation rates and mutual aggressive interactions. We found partial overlap in winter, but not summer horizontal distributions of the two species. Diets were highly similar in the seasonally overlapping range, potentially resulting in competition for the high-quality, but seasonally scarce, zooplankton prey in invaded lakes. Despite its smaller size, H. anomala had similar feeding rates to M. salemaai on three key zooplankton prey species. H. anomala was more aggressive toward M. salemaai than M. salemaai was toward H. anomala, although there was no evidence for intraguild predation. Our findings indicate that spatio-temporal niche partitioning permitted invasion by H. anomala and coexistence with M. salemaai, in spite of their high trophic similarity.","[Penk, Marcin R.; Donohue, Ian] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Irvine, Kenneth] UNESCO IHE Inst Water & Educ, Delft, Netherlands","Penk, MR (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",penkm@tcd.ie,"Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013","Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064; Penk, Marcin/0000-0001-5619-1991","Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [ECS/2009/01]; Ecological Consultancy Services Limited [ECS/2009/01]",We thank Magda Gluza and Tomek Pia. tek for help in the field.

In Moorea, French Polynesia, surveys were used to quantify habitat association for juvenile Thalassoma hardwicke and 7 sympatric labroid species. Having identified the 3 species most similar to focal T. hardwicke in habitat association, a field assay was used to determine if the presence of larger individuals of these species adversely affected the survival of focal individuals. Finally, a field experiment was used to test how competition with larger residents and structural refuge interact to influence survival of transplanted T. hardwicke. Surveys demonstrated that Gomphosus varius, Pseudocheilinus hexataenia, and T. quinquevittatum were most similar to T. hardwicke in habitat association. In the field assay, the presence of T. quinquevittatum had the greatest negative effect on survival of T. hardwicke. The field experiment revealed that competition with T. quinquevittatum and structural refuge both altered T. hardwicke survival, although their effects were not interactive. Survival of T. hardwicke was 2.3 times greater in treatments without T. quinquevittatum relative to those with T. quinquevittatum, and 2.8 times greater in treatments with structural refuge relative to those without structural refuge. The additive effect may have occurred via the establishment of social dominance hierarchies between transplanted T. hardwicke and resident T. quinquevittatum independently of structural refuge, suggesting that it is important to account for interactions occurring independently of resources when examining resource competition.","Victoria Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Sch Biol Sci, POB 6140, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",shane.geange@vuw.ac.nz,,"Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; VUW; Fulbright-Ministry of Research, Science and Technology","C.

Notwithstanding a general improvement in the sophistication of experimental work, there remains a major problem when manipulations involve the forced confinement of mobile organisms in enclosures (or 'cages'). Some evidence suggests that outcomes of field experiments depend upon the size of the enclosure used. Simulated field experiments are conducted here to explore some of the implications of the effects of enclosure size on experiments involving consumers engaged in exploitative competition for food resources. The simulations employ calibration data from rocky intertidal systems of South-Eastern Australia, but they are not designed to imitate a specific system but rather to illustrate some potentially general problems associated with confinement experiments. The simulations indicate that there will be enclosure size-dependent effects on consumption rates of individuals, with the severity of effects being inversely related to the enclosure size used (i.e., worse artefacts for smaller enclosures). The mechanism underlying the effect appears to be the more concentrated harvesting of resources by consumers confined to small enclosures, which prevent the food resource from 'escaping' predation as frequently as occurs under unconstrained conditions. The simulations are extended to investigate how the interpretation of interspecific competition may be influenced by the size of enclosure used and, if the results reflect natural conditions, then misleading interpretations are likely to emerge if enclosure sizes are too small relative to natural scales of movement.

Previous studies showed that the competitive displacement occurs rapidly and is facilitated by clumped insect resources. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of displacement is primarily due to differences in the ability of each species to exploit insect resources. (1) These species show nearly complete diet overlap. (2) Insects are a limiting resource for both geckos as evidenced by positive demographic effects with increased insect abundance. (3) Hemidactylus frenatus depletes insect resources to lower levels than L. lugubris, which results in reduced rates of resource acquisition in L. lugubris. (4) This reduced resource acquisition translates into significant reductions in the body condition, fecundity, and survivorship of L. lugubris individuals. (5) Evidence for interference (and other) mechanisms does not account for these negative demographic effects on L. lugubris. Interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition for L. lugubris, with increasing L. lugubris density having negligible effect on H. frenatus, mirroring the asymmetry of the large-scale displacement. The superior harvesting ability of H. frenatus is most pronounced when insects are clumped spatially and temporally, and is attributable to a variety of species-specific traits such as their larger body size, faster running speed, and reduced intraspecific interference while foraging. We conclude that clumped resources can increase interspecific exploitation competition, and this mechanism may contribute to species turnover when human environmental alterations redistribute resources.","UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, DEPT BIOL 0116, LA JOLLA, CA 92117 USA",,,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Petren, Kenneth/0000-0002-7936-6042",,,,44,222,237,1,81,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1996,77,1,,,,,118,132,,10.2307/2265661,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TR079,WOS:A1996TR07900014,,,,,2021-09-23,

While the use of free water is influenced by physiological factors (e.g., species-specific water requirements, moisture in forage, temperature), nonphysiological factors, such as habitat characteristics and interspecific interactions, are also important. In fact, for species of concern, interspecific interactions and habitat can be important factors influencing their spatial and temporal use of the landscape and its resources. The kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) is a small carnivore considered to be a species of concern over much of its range, and two of the most important conservation challenges it faces are related to (1) habitat and (2) predation/competition by intraguild species. Our objective was to determine the influence of habitat characteristics, predators (bobcats [Lynx rufus], coyotes [Canis latrans]), and potential competitors (badgers [Taxidea taxus], gray foxes [Urocyon cinereoargenteus]) on the use of water by kit foxes. From June to September 2010-2012, we used remote cameras to monitor carnivores at 63 water sources in the Mojave Desert. We used zero-inflated mixed-effects models and a two-stage model selection analysis to evaluate the influence of habitat, predators, and competitors on spatial visits to water by kit foxes. We also assessed temporal avoidance of intraguild predators and competitors by kit foxes at water sources using a coefficient of overlap. We found that visual obscurity, overhead canopy cover, badgers, and coyotes influenced spatial visits of kit foxes. In addition, kit foxes exhibited strong temporal overlap with badgers and bobcats, moderate temporal overlap with gray foxes, and weak temporal overlap with coyotes. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the spatial and temporal use of water sources by kit foxes is dynamic, depending on habitat characteristics and the activity of intraguild predators and competitors.","[Hall, Lucas K.] Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA; [Larsen, Randy T.; McMillan, Brock R.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Knight, Robert N.] US Army Dugway Proving Ground, Environm Programs, Dugway, UT 84022 USA","Hall, LK (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA.",lhall12@csub.edu,,,Utah Division of Wildlife Resources [106298]; Utah Chapter of The Wildlife Society,"We would like to thank R.

This study assesses the possible direct and indirect impact of the mass occurrence on native fish species in the lake. Laboratory foraging experiments showed that larvae of roach Rutilus rutilus L., perch Perca fluviatilis L. and whitefish Coregonus lavaretus L are accessible to sticklebacks as food. However, distinct species effects were apparent, with whitefish showing no effective predator avoidance strategy and therefore experiencing drastically increased mortality risk compared to the other predator adapted prey species. Furthermore, in absence of larval prey, sticklebacks were shown to feed predominantly on Daphnia in the field, indicating a strong interspecific food competition with whitefish. The results suggest that sticklebacks, acting as both an invasive species and a predator in the pelagic zone where prior no predator or neozoon existed, create a unique challenge to the unadapted autochthonous fish, and thus threaten the ecological resilience of the lake. Impacts on recruitment, e.g. through larval predation and interspecific competition for zooplankton could explain recent drastic declines in fishing yields.","[Roch, S.; von Ammon, L.; Brinker, A.] Fisheries Res Stn Baden Wurttemberg, Argenweg 50-1, D-88085 Langenargen, Germany; [Geist, J.] Tech Univ Munich, Aquat Syst Biol Unit, Muehlenweg 22, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Brinker, A.] Univ Konstanz, Mainaustr 252, D-78464 Constance, Germany","Roch, S (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Stn Baden Wurttemberg, Argenweg 50-1, D-88085 Langenargen, Germany.",samuel.roch@lazbw.bwl.de,"Geist, Juergen/C-4933-2008; Brinker, Alexander/ABF-4644-2020","Geist, Juergen/0000-0001-7698-3443; Brinker, Alexander/0000-0002-2433-5652",,,,78,12,12,3,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-7836,1872-6763,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,AUG,2018,204,,,,,,172,180,,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.02.014,,,9,Fisheries,Fisheries,GG5XB,WOS:000432768000019,,,,,2021-09-23,

Difficulty in the evaluation of interspecific interactions and trophic links using conventional rearing and dissection methods has prevented a deeper understanding of such relationships. The analysis of trophic links in the parasitoid community associated with the melon aphid (Aphis gossypii) in Hawaii provides a unique opportunity to assess complex interactions that occur in a system where all of the aphids and parasitoids have been introduced. Here, we developed and applied multiplex PCR assays to investigate the occurrence of in-host competition between parasitoids and/or hyperparasitoids on melon aphids collected from fields of Colocasia esculenta. To fully document the parasitoid-hyperparasitoid community within A. gossypii, both live and mummified aphids were examined. A total of 818 live and 245 mummified aphids were analyzed using the multiplex assays, with congruent rearing of over 600 mummified aphids serving as a basis for qualitative comparisons in terms of species composition and trophic linkages. The rearing and the DNA methods showed similar trends, with sharp declines in one parasitoid species followed by sharp increases in another during the course of the season. Molecular analyses revealed that hyperparasitism and multiparasitism of live aphids is remarkably low, whereas hyperparasitism of mummified aphids was extraordinarily high in both rearing and molecular analyses. In comparison to reared samples, molecular analysis of the parasitoid community was more complete and permitted the identification of previously unknown or unconfirmed trophic linkages. The potential of this approach in future studies on the biological control of aphids in Hawaii, particularly in light of new parasitoid introductions, is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Using the model system of the post-Pleistocene radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) inhabiting blue holes, we used a comparative field study to examine variation in density, age structure, tertiary (adult) sex ratio, habitat use, as well as adult feeding and social behaviors in relation to environmental features including predation risk, interspecific competition, productivity (e.g. chlorophyll a, zooplankton density), and abiotic factors (e.g. salinity, surface diameter). The primary environmental factor associated with ecological differentiation in G. hubbsi was the presence of piscivorous fish. Gambusia hubbsi populations coexisting with predatory fish were less dense, comprised of a smaller proportion of juveniles, and were more concentrated in shallow, near-shore regions of blue holes. In addition to predation risk, the presence of a competitor fish species was associated with G. hubbsi habitat use, and productivity covaried with both age structure and habitat use. Feeding and social behaviors differed considerably between sexes, and both sexes showed behavioral differences between predator regimes by exhibiting more foraging behaviors in the absence of predators and more sexual behaviors in their presence. Males additionally exhibited more aggressive behaviors toward females in the absence of predators, but were more aggressive toward other males in the presence of predators. These results largely matched a priori predictions, and several findings are similar to trends in other related systems. Variation in predation risk appears to represent the primary driver of ecological differentiation in this system, but other previously underappreciated factors (interspecific competition, resource availability) are notable contributors as well. This study highlights the utility of simultaneously evaluating multiple environmental factors and multiple population characteristics within a natural system to pinpoint environmental drivers of ecological differentiation.","[Heinen, Justa L.; Coco, Matthew W.; Marcuard, Maurice S.; Martin, Ryan A.; Langerhans, R.

The model assumes that patches only vary with respect to host species present and encounter rates of parasitoids and hosts. It predicts that L. heterotoma should visit patches consisting of decaying stinkhorn mushrooms. This prediction is insensitive to values of model parameters and assumptions. However, field data show that L. heterotoma females rarely visit stinkhorn patches. This leads us to consider predation risk and interspecific competition on all patch types in the field. Predation was never observed, and generalist predators did not prey on our parasitoids. We hypothesise that L. heterotoma females avoid visiting stinkhorn patches because another. closely related, parasitoid species (Leptopilina clavipes) is often present on these patches. Subsequent experiments shaw that L. heterotoma females can recognise odours emanating From patches where adult L. clavipes females are present, and that they avoid visiting these patches. We show that L. clavipes is the superior competitor. Hence. by refraining to visit patches with L. clavipes, L. heterotoma females avoid strong interspecific competition. When interspecific competition is included in the model, predictions closely match field observations, indicating that avoidance of competition is an important factor for patch selection by L. heterotoma.","LEIDEN UNIV, INST EVOLUT & ECOL SCI, LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","JANSSEN, A (corresponding author), UNIV AMSTERDAM, DEPT PURE & APPL ECOL, KRUISLAAN 320, 1098 SM AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.",,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,48,52,53,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1995,73,3,,,,,356,366,,10.2307/3545959,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TA648,WOS:A1995TA64800007,,,,,2021-09-23,

Although food availability differs between habitats or seasons, these differences had never been considered in previous studies. We conducted year-round field surveys throughout a stream to compare the food habits of an introduced salmonid, brown trout Salmo trutta, and a native salmonid, masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou. Masu salmon did not constitute a large proportion of the diet of brown trout and vice versa. Thus, predation will likely not affect the population level of either species. The dietary overlap between brown trout and masu salmon varied depending on the presence of Gammaridae and terrestrial invertebrates; i.e., the intensity of interspecific competition for food resources may differ according to food conditions.","[Hasegawa, Koh; Ohkuma, Kazumasa] Fisheries Res Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan; [Yamazaki, Chitose] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Ohta, Tamihisa] Hokkaido Univ, Takaoka, Hokkaido 0530035, Japan","Hasegawa, K (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan.",hasekoh@affrc.go.jp; yamyama@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp; tami-hisa@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp; ohkuma@affrc.go.jp,"Hasegawa, Koh/H-9926-2019","Ohta, Tamihsia/0000-0001-7040-9926","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24780196, 12J07244] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank the staff of the National Salmon Resource Center for their support during this study.

The experiments were conducted using oyster shell habitats constructed in the intertidal zone. First we tested whether crab losses from intertidal shell habitat constructed in the intertidal zone. First we tested whether crab losses from intertidal shell habitat were due to density-dependent emigration, density-dependent predation, or both. Our results show that although both processes account for crab losses, predation is not density-dependent, and most crabs had emigrated rather than being eaten at high crab density. Field experiments were also conducted to test the effect of crab density, food availability and conspecific physical contact on crab emigration. Treatments were different densities of free crabs to allow physical contact between them or individually caged crabs to prevent physical contact, with or without enhanced food (small clams). Emigration of crabs from experimental shell habitat increased with density of free crabs, irrespective of whether food was enhanced or risk of predation increased. Our results suggest that physical interactions regulate density because: (1) the per capita consumption rate of clams in the artificial shell plots was significantly lower at high crab density; and (2) density of enclosed crabs did not affect the immigration rate of conspecifics. Although the ultimate cause may be competition for food or avoidance of cannibalism, we suggest that when crab recruitment to epibenthic shell substratum has been successful, crab density over the short term is regulated primarily by space competition mediated by physical interactions.",,"IRIBARNE, O (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH FISHERIES,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.",,,,,,,43,38,38,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

It has been shown that the two common granivorous gerbil species Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum that coexist in the sand dunes of the Israeli Negev show temporal partitioning in their time of activity. The bigger species, G. pyramidum, aggressively displaces the smaller species from early night-time. We examined the change in the activity pattern of G. allenbyi in pure and mixed populations in two 1-ha field enclosures. 2. We confirmed the temporal pattern reported by Ziv et al. (1993) and Kotler et al. (1993). 3. We also measured how much energy it takes (in g of millet seeds) to compensate for the costs, associated with interference and exploitation competition, by adding millet seeds to 18 seed trays/enclosure. We added 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 g of seeds/seed-tray. In each seed-tray we mixed the seeds in 2 L of sand. 4. It took 3-5 g of seeds/seed-tray (1.8-3 g seeds/day/ha/individual) to completely overcome the competition by G. pyramidum. This is the cost of the interference and exploitation competition from G. pyramidum (in the currency of millet seeds). 5. The result suggests that there is a trade-off between interference competition and food to which gerbils respond behaviourally.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Abramsky, Z (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",zvika@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012",,,,,43,36,36,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Intraguild predation and competition often occur simultaneously, and ontogenetic shifts in competitive strength can dictate the magnitude and direction of species interactions. The recent introduction of the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus to the Atlantic coast of North America has resulted in the potential for considerable intraguild interactions with juvenile American lobsters Homarus americanus, with which it now co-occupies rocky intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. We present data from 5 yr of monthly (May-October) field sampling revealing a significant decline in lobster density as H. sanguineus density increased in the low intertidal. To investigate potential mechanisms behind this pattern, we conducted three mesocosm experiments designed to examine whether competitive interactions between H. americanus and H. sanguineus are size- or density-dependent. Larger early benthic phase lobsters (16-34 mm CL) outcompeted H. sanguineus for both food and shelter resources. These lobsters fed faster and more in the presence of H. sanguineus, effectively defended shelter, were responsible for the majority of agonistic interactions, and, in multiple instances, killed and consumed H. sanguineus. Effects on sheltering and agonstic interactions by these lobsters were independent of H. sanguineus density; however, prior shelter residency increased lobster agonistic behavior towards crabs. In contrast, H. sanguineus outcompeted smaller, early benthic phase lobsters (7.2-11.2 mm CL) for shelter, and these interactions were density dependent. Displacement of lobsters from shelter by crabs and cumulative agonistic interactions instigated by crabs towards lobsters scaled positively with H. sanguineus density. Given the similarity of the invasion documented here and others occurring globally, these experiments demonstrate the importance of considering how factors such as ontogeny, density-dependence, and primacy influence the outcomes of interactions between intraguild predators. Disentangling how these factors structure intraguild interactions between invasive and endemic species will both advance our fundamental understanding of community ecology and enhance efforts to conserve and manage natural resources.","[Baillie, Christopher J.; Grabowski, Jonathan H.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA","Baillie, CJ (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.",baillie.c@husky.neu.edu,,"Grabowski, Jonathan/0000-0003-4711-5481",,,,95,2,2,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2018,99,9,,,,,2067,2079,,10.1002/ecy.2432,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GS3WV,WOS:000443558200015,29920682,,,,2021-09-23,

Predators with differing foraging modes may have different effects on prey behavior, and these effects may be transmitted differently through food webs. Here we test the hypothesis that shifts in the type of predator present in a food web indirectly affect the prey's resource independent of changes in the density of prey. We assessed the importance of predator identity in mediating the grazing effects of the freshwater snail Physa integra on its periphyton resources using field and mesocosm studies. Field observations showed that Physa used covered habitats more in ponds containing fish than in ponds containing crayfish or no predators at all. A field experiment confirmed that snail behavior depended on predator identity. Physa placed near caged pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) selected covered habitats, but Physa placed near caged crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) moved to the surface of the water. The effects of predator identity on periphtyon were then examined in a mesocosm experiment, using caged predators. Habitat use of Physa was similar to their habitat use in the field experiment. In the presence of caged sunfish, periphyton standing crop in covered habitats was reduced to 34% of the standing crop in the presence of crayfish. In contrast, periphyton in near-surface habitats was 110% higher in the presence of fish than in the presence of crayfish. Thus, the effects of predator identity on Physa behavior cascaded through the food web to affect the abundance and spatial distribution of periphyton.","Clar Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16412 USA","Bernot, RJ (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, 232 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Fences and netting selectively excluded from large, replicated grids. Small mammal populations were censused monthly over >4 yr, and effects of predator and degu exclusions on numbers and survival of small mammals were assessed with repeated measures ANOVAs. Marginally significant predator exclusion effects were detected on O. degus, and highly significant year x predation interactions in both wet and dry seasons; degu survival (= persistence) was also significantly longer on exclusion grids. Predation had significant effects on numbers of Phyllotis darwini, and a significant month X predator interaction existed in the wet season; survival was also significantly higher on predator exclusion grids. There was a marginally significant year x competitor interaction in the dry season for this species. Akodon olivaceus had significant month x predator and month x competitor interactions in the wet season only; survival was significantly longer on degu exclusion grids. An irruptive species, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, showed no significant predator or competitor effects in 1991-1992; however, survival was significantly longer on predator + competitor exclusion (vs. control) grids. An uncommon species, Abrothrix longipilis, had marginally nonsignificant time x competitor interactions but no treatment differences in survival. Finally, a second uncommon rodent, Abrocoma bennetti (not analyzed numerically) had significantly longer survival on predator exclusion grids with degus. Degus and P. darwini were significantly overrepresented (relative to availability) in diets of culpeo foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and three nocturnal owls, respectively, whereas A. bennetti was significantly overrepresented in predator diets generally, Vertebrate predation has pervasive effects on some species that, however, may be related to their intrinsic demographic characteristics.

We performed a field experiment to determine whether effects of current abiotic conditions and interspecific competition with O. hylas were responsible for displacement of O. peruncus from parts of their former range. We examined growth and survival of juvenile male O. peruncus exposed to juvenile male O. hylas in enclosures at two sites in the former range of O. peruncus. Enclosures contained 8 (low density) or 16 individuals (high density) and had O. peruncus only (control) or both species (interspecific treatment). Juvenile O. peruncus were able to survive and grow in portions of their former range, implicating biotic versus abiotic factors in the displacement of O. peruncus. Survival rates of O. peruncus did not differ among treatments at either site. Orconectes peruncus showed significant growth in all treatments and interspecific effects were not greater than intraspecific effects on O. peruncus growth rates. High-density treatments showed significantly reduced O. peruncus growth rates compared to low-density treatments, except in Carver Creek interspecific treatments. When considered in the context of previous studies examining the effects of O. hylas on O. peruncus, results suggest that neither direct competition between juvenile males of the two species or abiotic change are responsible for the decreased range of O. peruncus.

Previous studies revealed that A. macrophthalmus is able to host-shift to several mimosoid species. Here, we aim to test the host-shift potential to other mimosoid and non-mimosoid plants and possible roles of interspecific competition, genetic background, and plant chemistry in host-shift. First, we found that A. macrophthalmus predator completed development on two new hosts: pigeon pea Cajanus cajan and Cajanus scarabaeoides (Faboideae), by rearing from seeds collected in South/Southeast Asia and Hawaii. In contrast, in most regions, both Cajanus species were infested only by other beetle species. Second, we performed no-choice tests using 11 leguminous plants, covering all three subfamilies as potential hosts, including the two new hosts. A Taiwanese A. macrophthalmus population reared in the laboratory on Leucaena did not deposit eggs on any of the seeds of each tested species. To compare host-shift responses between populations, we also used a Hawaiian A. macrophthalmus population that had completed its development on freshly collected Leucaena seeds from the field. This population deposited eggs onto and hatching larvae burrowed into C. cajan seeds, although none developed beyond the larval stage. Third, the surface chemical composition of seed-pods of L. leucocephala and the two Cajanus species was dissimilar, although that of seeds was highly similar. Finally, all of the host-shifting A. macrophthalmus populations shared the same haplotypic group.","[Tuda, M.] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Inst Biol Control, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Wu, L. -H.; Wu, W. -J.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Yamada, N.; Kagoshima, K.] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Wang, C. -P.] Council Agr, Taiwan Forestry Res Inst, Silviculture Div, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Buranapanichpan, S.] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Chen, Z. -Q.] Yunnan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Teramoto, K.

Interspecific prey aggregations or neighborhoods may therefore affect an individual's vulnerability to predation. We examined the influence of prey neighborhood structure (i.e., the densities and identities of prey neighborhoods) on spatial variation in predation in a multi-prey system with a primary apex predator. We combined GPS locations of lions (Panthera leo), kill-site surveys, and spatially explicit density estimates of five species of ungulates for which a significant level of predation was attributable to lions. In addition to the dual influence of predator activity and vegetation, predation risk was attributable to the structure of prey neighborhoods for at least two of the five species of prey. Along with traditionally recognized components of predation (the rate of predator-prey encounters and prey catchability), we encourage ecologists to consider how prey neighborhood structure influences spatial variation in predation risk.","[Ng'weno, Caroline C.; Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Ng'weno, Caroline C.; Kibungei, Alfred K.] Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Conservat Dept, Private Bag 10400, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Ford, Adam T.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Goheen, JR (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jgoheen@uwyo.edu,,,"Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the FutureSchlumberger; Earthwatch Institute, Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International; Russell E.

Here we use on-animal data loggers to assess whether such trade-offs can be revealed by the breathing rates (BR) and timing of breaths in long-finned pilot whales (Globicephela melas). We used the period immediately following foraging dives in particular, for which respiratory behavior can be expected to be optimized for gas exchange. Breath times and fluke strokes were detected using onboard sensors (pressure, 3-axis acceleration) attached to animals using suction cups. The number and timing of breaths were quantified in non-linear mixed models that incorporated serial correlation and individual as a random effect. We found that pilot whales increased their BR in the 5-10 min period prior to, and immediately following, dives that exceeded 31 m depth. While pre-dive BRs did not vary with dive duration, the initial post-dive BR was linearly correlated with duration of >2 min dives, with BR then declining exponentially. Apparent net diving costs were 1.7 (SE 0.2) breaths per min of diving (post-dive number of breaths, above pre-dive breathing rate unrelated to dive recovery). Every fluke stroke was estimated to cost 0.086 breaths, which amounted to 80-90% average contribution of locomotion to the net diving costs. After accounting for fluke stroke rate, individuals in the small body size class took a greater number of breaths per diving minute. Individuals reduced their breathing rate (from the rate expected by diving behavior) by 13-16% during playbacks of killer whale sounds and their first exposure to 1-2 kHz naval sonar, indicating similar responses to interspecific competitor/predator and anthropogenic sounds. Although we cannot rule out individuals increasing their per-breath O-2 uptake to match metabolic demand, our results suggest that behavioral responses to experimental sound exposures were not associated with increased metabolic rates in a stress response, but metabolic rates instead appear to decrease. Our results support the hypothesis that maximal performance leads to predictable (optimized) breathing patterns, which combined with further physiological measurements could improve proxies of field metabolic rates and per-stroke energy costs from animal-borne behavior data.","[Isojunno, Saana; Miller, Patrick James O'Malley] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Aoki, Kagari] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba, Japan; [Cure, Charlotte] UMRAE, Cerema Ifsttar, Strasbourg, France; [Kvadsheim, Petter Helgevold] Norwegian Def Res Estab, Horten, Norway","Isojunno, S (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",si66@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Waxler, Robert/S-4345-2018","isojunno, saana/0000-0002-2212-2135","NL Ministry of Defence; FR Ministry of Defence (DGA) [15860052]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research ProgramMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; NOR Ministry of Defence; United States Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-08-1-0984, N00014-10-1-0355, N00014-14-1-0390]","This work was funded by NL Ministry of Defence, NOR Ministry of Defence, United States Office of Naval Research (N00014-08-1-0984, N00014-10-1-0355, and N00014-14-1-0390), and FR Ministry of Defence (DGA) (public market no 15860052).

Direct and indirect effects of native predators and competitors on invasive lionfish,CORAL REEFS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competition; Consumptive effects; Groupers; Non-consumptive effects; Invasive species control,RED LIONFISH; ECOLOGY; METAANALYSIS; FISHES; DRIVEN,"Biotic resistance is the ability of an ecological community to prevent or limit the establishment or success of non-indigenous species. Native species can confer resistance by outcompeting or directly consuming non-native invaders. The fear of being eaten could also limit invader success, but non-consumptive effects of native predators have rarely been documented as a source of biotic resistance. Here, we test whether native groupers on Caribbean coral reefs can promote biotic resistance to invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish through competition, consumption, and/or through non-consumptive effects. Stomach content analysis of more than 200 groupers, comprising five species, revealed no instances of predation on lionfish. To test for competitive and non-consumptive effects of groupers, we released tagged juvenile lionfish onto reef patches that varied in grouper densities and monitored lionfish behaviours over five weeks. At dawn, during peak grouper and lionfish hunting times, juvenile lionfish hid more on reefs with more grouper predators. Juvenile lionfish were also less active during the day on reefs with high grouper densities. Hiding and inactivity are incompatible with foraging and thus should result in lionfish eating fewer prey and having reduced somatic growth rates. Although there was no substantial effect of interspecific competition on lionfish behaviours, we found that lionfish swam greater distances with increasing densities of intraspecific competitors at dawn. We did not detect a cascading effect of grouper predators on smaller fishes, perhaps because the seasonal peak in prey fish recruitment masked the effects of lower lionfish predation. Fear of native predators by lionfish has the potential to reduce invader foraging success, although it might not fully mitigate the negative effects on native prey communities. Efforts to rebuild grouper populations throughout the Caribbean may still aid in controlling the lionfish invasion despite weak evidence of interspecific competition and lack of direct predation on lionfish, but further research is needed. At broader scales, our findings highlight that the global depletion of large predators can have implications beyond demographic effects on prey.","[Smith, Nicola S.; Cote, Isabelle M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Smith, NS (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",nicolas@sfu.ca,,,Organization of American States Graduate Scholarship; Bullitt Foundation Environmental Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery grantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank Jocelyn Curtis-Quick, Fiona Francis, Kyla Jeffrey, Helen Yan, Emma Atkinson, and Adrienne Berchtold for assistance collecting data in the field.

Niche separation by means of exploitation or interference competition was investigated in two taxa of crop-inhabiting spiders that overlap in microhabitat use and have similar web design. Competition for prey and web sites was tested in microcosm experiments with the most common species that build sheet-webs: Enoplognatha gemina (Theridiidae) and Alioranus pastoralis (Linyphiidae). A field survey over the crop season provided data on spatial and temporal dispersion of Enoplognatha spp. (Theridiidae) and linyphiid spiders (Linyphiidae) and on availability of prey over the season. In the microcosm experiments, both taxa took springtails as prey, but only Enoplognatha fed on aphids. Differences in diet, however, could not be attributed to either exploitative or interference competition. Spatial separation of websites was attained by vertical displacement of webs in the vegetation (Enoplognatha) and by avoidance of patches occupied by conspecific or heterospecific individuals (linyphiids). In the field, densities of linyphiids and Enoplognatha were correlated negatively and webs were over-dispersed relative to a random distribution. Both taxa colonized the field at the start of the season; linyphiids colonized as adults, quickly reproduced, and had a second adult peak; Enoplognatha matured in the middle of the season and their numbers remained fairly constant over the season. The combined experimental manipulations and field data suggest that niche separation occurs at different scales. The hypothesis of competition for websites was partially supported, while prey preference (or tolerance) and temporal differences in life history stages also may explain the negative correlations between densities of the two taxa.","[Opatovsky, Itai] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Opatovsky, Itai] Reg Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Southern Branch Besor, IL-85400 Besor, Israel; [Gavish-Regev, Efrat] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Natl Nat Hist Collect, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel; [Weintraub, Phyllis G.] Agr Res Org, Dept Entomol, IL-85280 Gilat Res Ctr, Israel; [Lubin, Yael] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Opatovsky, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.; Opatovsky, I (corresponding author), Reg Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Southern Branch Besor, IL-85400 Besor, Israel.",itaiopa6@gmail.com,"Lubin, Yael D/F-1382-2012","Lubin, Yael D/0000-0003-3876-1668; Weintraub, Phyllis/0000-0003-0661-9499",Ministry of AgricultureGida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi [857-0578-09]; JNF (Emilio Sacerdote fund) [02-4682]; Sigma Xi; Ben-Gurion University,"We thank Z.

Field samples revealed that shells of the gastropod Cerithium atratum were the main resource used by both hermit crab species and that Pagurus used eroded or damaged shells in higher frequency than Clibanarius. The exploitative ability of each species was compared between species in the laboratory using dead gastropod (Cerithium) baits to simulate predation events and signalize newly available shells to hermit crabs. Pagurus reached the baits more rapidly than Clibanarius, but this higher exploitative ability did not explain shell utilization patterns in nature. Another experiment evaluated the dominance hierarchy between these two hermit crab species and revealed that Clibanarius was able to outcompete Pagurus for higher quality shells in agonistic encounters. This higher interference competitive ability of Clibanarius in relation to Pagurus may explain field observations. Nevertheless, Pagurus may be responsible to enhance shell availability to other hermit crab species that have lower ability to find and use newly available shells. Differently, the poorer condition of shells used by Pagurus, the higher ability of this species to attend gastropod predation events and its higher consumption rate by shell-breaking crabs (Menippe nodifrons) may increase its predation risks, thus revealing the disadvantages of such an exploitative competitive strategy for hermit crabs.

The field experiments required to test this hypothesis are complex to implement, but the recent revival of regression methods offers a viable alternative. Here we use the dynamic and static regression methods to determine the importance of D. aurita as a competitor and intraguild predator. Capture-recapture data from two localities in the Rio de Janeiro State were used, Garrafao (municipality of Guapimirim), a coastal forest of the Serra do Mar, and Barra de Marica, a costal sand dune vegetation. Population and microhabitat variables were monitored from April 1997 to April 2003 in Garrafao, and from January 1986 to July 1990 in Barra de Marica. Microhabitat variables were related to Canopy, Plant, Litter and Rock covers, Obstruction from 0 to 1.5 m, and Number of logs. Exploitation competition was tested by the dynamic method, which models the effects of D. aurita on the per capita growth rate of a species. Interference by predation or competition was tested by the static method, where the abundance of D. aurita at trap stations was regressed against the abundance of other small mammals, after removal of any variation associated with microhabitat factors. Exploitation competition was not detected, but the interference of D. aurita was pervasive, affecting all small mammals studied in the two localities. The clear avoidance of D. aurita by all small mammals tested in two localities of different physiognomies indicates that it functions as an intraguild predator, even if actual predation by D. aurita is an occasional event.","[Vieira, Marcus V.; Cerqueira, Rui] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Vertebrados, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Vieira, MV (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Vertebrados, CP 68020, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mvvieira@biologia.ufrj.br,"Vieira, Marcus/U-5314-2019; Vieira, Marcus/D-2540-2011; Cerqueira, Rui/E-5321-2011","Vieira, Marcus/0000-0002-4472-5447; ",IBAMA/MMA; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPERJFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ); FUJB; PIBIC/CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"Many colleagues and partners assisted in the fieldwork, particularly Joana Macedo, Diogo Loretto, Rosana Gentile and Simone Freitas.

The fields of biological control and insect pest management have generally been slow to adopt PCR-based diagnostics in comparison with other fields of science. However, there has been increasing interest in the use of molecular diagnostic tools in arthropod biological control. In applied entomology, molecular techniques have generally been used for insect identification and systematics; however, PCR-based techniques are increasingly becoming recognized as valuable tools in ecological studies. Here, we review research that has used PCR-based techniques for parasitoid and predator/prey identification and detection, and place these studies in the context of their contributions to biological control of arthropods. The status and future directions of diagnostic molecular markers in applied entomology and insect pest management are also discussed.","CABI Europe Switzerland, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland; Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada; Agr & Agri Food Canada, Saskatoon Res Ctr, Saskatoon, SK, Canada","Gariepy, TD (corresponding author), CABI Europe Switzerland, Rue Grillons,1, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland.",t.gariepy@cabi.org,,,,,,109,135,147,0,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-2048,1439-0418,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

Cases where the invasion has been tracked since its beginning are rare, however, such that the first interactions between invasive and native species remain poorly understood. Communication behavior is an integral part of species identity and is subject to selection. Consequently, resource use and direct interference competition between native and invasive species may drive its evolution. Here, we tested the role of interactions between the recently introduced invasive lizard Anolis cristatellus and the native Anolis oculatus on variation in behavior and communication in Calibishie (Dominica). From May to June 2016, we filmed 122 adult males of both species displaying in banana farms under two contexts (allopatry and sympatry). We then recorded (i) the proportion of time spent displaying and (ii) the relative frequency of dewlap vs. push-up displays. To control for habitat variation, we measured and compared the habitat characteristics (canopy openness and habitat openness) of 228 males in allopatry and sympatry. While the habitat characteristics and total display-time did not differ between the contexts for the two species, the proportion of display-time spent dewlapping by A. cristatellus decreased in sympatry. The display of A. oculatus did not differ between the contexts, however. Shifts in microhabitat use, predation pressure, or interspecific interference are potential factors which might explain the behavioral changes in display observed in A. cristatellus. This study highlights the role of behavioral traits as a first response of an invasive species to recent competition with a closely related native species.","[Dufour, Claire M.

Graham & Lambin (2002) have reported on a weasel-reduction experiment, concluding that the impact of weasel predation on field vole survival was neither sufficient nor necessary to initiate and drive the cyclic decline of field vole populations in Kielder Forest, northern England. They also stated that their findings contradict conclusively the specialist predator hypothesis put forward to explain population cycles of voles in North Europe. 2. Straightforward inferences from Kielder Forest to the northern boreal zone are misleading, because the population cycles of voles in Kielder Forest differ essentially from North European vole cycles. The low amplitude of the vole cycles in Kielder Forest, their restricted spatial synchrony in comparison to northern Europe and the virtual lack of interspecific synchrony in Kielder Forest suggest that there are essential differences between the mechanisms responsible for the two types of cyclic fluctuations of voles. 3. The weasel-reduction experiment may provide a misleading picture on the role of predators, even in the Kielder Forest cycle. The experimental reduction of weasels alone may not stop the population decline of voles, because competing larger predators are expected to increase their hunting in the weasel-reduction areas. The small spatial scale of the experiment, which produced only slight, short-term differences in weasel densities between reduction and control areas, also suggests that other predators could have compensated easily for the weasels that were removed. 4. We propose a new version of the predation hypothesis to explain low-amplitude population cycles of voles in temperate Europe, including the Kielder Forest. The interaction between generalist predators and vole populations might account for these cycles because generalists can have a functional response that is destabilizing in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium point. As most generalists are orders of magnitude larger than weasels, and thus need much more food for survival, generalist-driven cycles should be characterized by high prey minima, as observed in Kielder Forest.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia","Korpimaki, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",ekorpi@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X; Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495",,,,89,63,64,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Ideal free models for unequal competitors predict a truncated competitor phenotype distribution among patches when relative payoffs of phenotypes vary across patches. Partial truncation is expected under field conditions. This prediction was tested in a field experiment with an overwintering population of mute swans (Cygnus olor). 2. Two food patches were generated in which adult and subadult swans were expected to have different relative success. In one patch ('clumped'), pieces of bread were thrown over a small area on the water surface. In the other patch, pieces of bread were scattered over a larger area. 3. When only one patch was offered at a time (no choice situation), adult swans were more successful than subadult swans in the 'clumped' patch, but were similarly successful in the 'scattered' patch. Relative payoffs of adult and subadult swans differed significantly between patches. 4. When the two patches were offered simultaneously, black-headed gulls (Larns ridibundus) competed with the swans to a considerable extent in some replicates. The gulls appeared to be the poorest competitors. They snatched more bread in the scattered than in the clumped patch. Both classes of swans avoided the scattered patch but not the clumped patch with increasing competition from gulls. Gulls preferred the scattered patch and swans increasingly preferred the clumped patch under gull competition, creating a partially truncated distribution. 5. Without the four replicates in which the gulls had consumed more than 25% of the bread, the percentage of adult swans that chose the clumped patch was significantly higher than the percentage of subadult swans that chose that patch. This is the first experimental verification of a partially truncated phenotype distribution. Subadult swans significantly preferred the scattered patch whereas adults tended to prefer the clumped patch. This distribution was predicted from the 'no choice' experiment, where competition by gulls had been similarly weak.",,"MILINSKI, M (corresponding author), UNIV BERN, INST ZOOL, VERHALTENSOKOL ABT, WOHLENSTR 50A, CH-3032 HINTERKAPPELEN, SWITZERLAND.",,,,,,,42,24,24,1,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We demonstrated here the presence of periodic oscillations in small mammal populations in eastern Poland using 22-year (1986-2007) trapping data from marginal meadow and river valley grasslands located in the extensive temperate woodland of BiaowieA1/4a Primeval Forest. The two most common species inhabiting meadows and river valleys, root vole Microtus oeconomus and common shrew Sorex araneus, exhibited synchronous periodic changes, characterised by a 3-year time lag as indicated by an autocorrelation function. Moreover, the cycles of these two species were synchronous within both habitats. Population dynamics of the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius was not cyclic. However, this species regularly reached maximum density 1 year before the synchronized peak of root voles and common shrews, which may suggest the existence of interspecific competition. Dynamics of all three species was dominated by direct density-dependent process, whereas delayed density dependent feedback was significant only in the root vole and common shrew. Climatic factors acting in winter and spring (affecting mainly survival and initial reproduction rates) were more important than those acting in summer and autumn and affected significantly only the common shrew. High temperatures in winter and spring had positive effects on autumn-to-autumn changes in abundance of this species, whereas deep snow in combination with high rainfall in spring negatively affected population increase rates in common shrew.","[Zub, K.; Jedrzejewska, B.; Jedrzejewski, W.; Barton, K.

Disturbance, interspecific competition between seedlings and between seedlings and adults, and access for potential predators were manipulated in the field after a fire to identify mechanisms to explain between- and within-habitat species coexistence. When soil surfaces are disturbed or seeds are buried, dry-heath species can establish in the wet heath. Under natural conditions, however, wet heath is rarely disturbed by animal foragers and lack of safe sites may preclude establishment of dry-heath species. In contrast, dry heath is often disturbed by ground foragers such as bandicoots and safe sites are plentiful for establishment of all heath species. Nevertheless, while wet-heath species can establish in dry heath, their seedlings are apparently unable to survive there due to the drier conditions. No evidence for competition among species was detected in either type of habitat during the first 3 years of the experiment, even at elevated seedling densities. Lack of early competition and unsaturated seed-banks may promote coexistence of species. Seedling predation from vertebrates was low and did not appear to influence patterns of coexistence within or between habitats. In terms of community theory we suggest that several interacting mechanisms are responsible for community structure in heaths after a fire. Chance and microsite disturbance are important during dispersal, while resources are critical during establishment and early survival of seedling populations. In these heath systems where fires burn extensive areas, seed-banks may be more important in temporal storage of species than patch or spatial storage as a mechanism for maintaining coexistence and plant diversity.","UNIV SYDNEY,SCH BIOL SCI,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA; UNIV SYDNEY,INST WILDLIFE RES A12,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA",,,"Clarke, Peter/D-6403-2012",,,,,23,9,9,0,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

However, it is not clear if the nonindigenous clam is the one directly responsible for these predominance patterns. Within this context, the main goal of the present study was to analyze the competitive interaction between the nonindigenous Manila clam and the native carpet shell clam to determine whether this interaction could impact directly growth and mortality of the native clam populations. The effect of exposure to predators on both species was also examined. For this purpose, between May 2010 and May 2011 a field experiment was conducted on an intertidal area in the Bay of Santander (N Spain) where both species coexist without an extreme predominance of the introduced species. Relative density of clam species was manipulated in a randomized block experimental design. The results obtained show that (i) the increased density of Manila clam simulating species expansion scenario does not affect growth or mortality of the native clam; and (ii) for densities of Manila clam substantially higher than observed in the field, predation plays an essential role in regulating both species populations, limiting their density increase. Moreover, Manila clam appears to be more negatively impacted by predation compared to the native clam. Overall, our results indicate that predation has a more significant effect on both populations when compared to competitive interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We tested the hypothesis that site-specific heterogeneity in the physico-chemical environment alters the dominance of two competing amphipods: Gammarus fasciatus, the dominant native species in the upper St. Lawrence River, and Echinogammarus ischnus, a euryhaline Ponto-Caspian species that invaded the river in the late 1990s. E. ischnus has replaced G. fasciatus as the dominant amphipod at some sites, while remaining inferior at other sites-even several years after invasion. We tested the effect of water chemistry (conductivity) on the outcome of interactions between these two species in the laboratory and in the river in 2006 and 2007. Field experiments involved transplanting both species to different sites along a gradient of conductivity within the river, whereas the laboratory experiments examined interspecific predation in water collected from these sites. The laboratory experiments revealed that these species are mutual predators and their rate of predation on each other varies with conductivity; E. ischnus is the dominant predator at higher conductivity, while G. fasciatus dominates at lower conductivity. The field experiments showed interannual variation, but supported the lab results at high conductivity in 2006 and at low conductivity in 2007. E. ischnus was more sensitive than G. fasciatus to variation in conductivity, which apparently mediates this invader's ability to replace or dominate the native species in a heterogeneous environment.","[Kestrup, Asa M.; Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Ricciardi, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",asa.kestrup@mcgill.ca; tony.ricciardi@mcgill.ca,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",,,,43,40,40,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Determining the nature and strength of these interactions is integral to understanding why some aliens are suppressed and others become highly invasive pests. For introduced terrestrial plants, seed and seedling interactions with native biota are crucial, because most nascent populations start from seed. Herein, we explored interactions between native generalist rodent and bird consumers and seeds of the invasive wild cucumber Echinocystis lobata by conducting seed-offering experiments in Poland. We also evaluated how interspecific competition from native plants and intraspecific competition from clustering of E. lobata seed (clustering resembling consumer seed caching) affected survival of seedlings and young plants. Native consumers interacted strongly with E. lobata seeds, with rodents removing 98% of seeds from ground locations and birds removing 24% of elevated seeds. Camera and live traps indicated that striped field mice Apodemus agrarius were the predominant rodent removing seeds. Camera traps and visual observations indicated that great tits Parus major and European jays Garrulus glandarius were the primary bird species removing elevated seeds. While some level of seed removal was likely attributable to seed predation, as indicated by seed coat remains, we also observed evidence that rodents may cache E. lobata seeds and Garrulus glandarius are known to cache and disperse seeds. Monitoring of seedlings indicated that increasing cover of native plants and clustering of E. lobata seedlings both reduced survival of seedlings and young plants due to inter- and intraspecific competition, respectively. Hence, caching by generalist consumers may disperse E. lobata seeds, which are heavy and lack dispersal adaptations, but such caching may also reduce individual seedling survival rates. Fully understanding invasion success of the E. lobata will require evaluating the net effects of generalist consumers on its recruitment and dispersal.","[Dylewski, Lukasz; Myczko, Lukasz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Dylewski, Lukasz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Dylewski, L (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.; Dylewski, L (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",ldylewski@man.poznan.pl,"Dylewski, Lukasz/AAM-4073-2021","Dylewski, Lukasz/0000-0002-1370-7625; Myczko, Lukasz/0000-0002-9305-2306","National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2018/28/T/NZ8/00264]","We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the manuscript.

This study examined the direct effects of interspecific competition between the crayfish, and indirect effects of competitive interactions and fish (European perch, Perca fluviatilis L.) predation. Three different experiments with young-of-the-year (YOY) crayfish were performed. P. leniusculus was strongly dominant over similar-sized A. astacus in interference competition for shelter in a laboratory experiment. However, in a 35-day experiment in outdoor pools, A, astacus growth and survival were about equally affected by interactions with conspecifics and P. leniusculus. In contrast, P. leniusculus was significantly more affected by intraspecific competition than by competition with A. astacus, suggesting asymmetric competition between the two species. The presence of perch in outdoor ponds with mixed-species groups of the two crayfish species resulted in considerably higher predation rates on A. astacus than on P. leniusculus. Both species showed strong antipredator responses to perch by increasing refuge use. I suggest that higher perch predation rates on A. astacus originate from P. leniusculus being the superior species in interspecific competition for shelter. Because of displacement from refuges, A. astacus individuals become more exposed to the predator. This indirect effect of interactions among the two crayfish species and the predator may be important in the observed in situ replacement of A. astacus by P. leniusculus.","SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DEPT ENVIRONM ASSESSMENT,S-75007 UPPSALA,SWEDEN","SODERBACK, B (corresponding author), UPPSALA UNIV,INST LIMNOL,NORBYVAGEN 20,S-75236 UPPSALA,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,60,71,71,0,23,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1994,100,3,,,,,229,235,,10.1007/BF00316949,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PZ755,WOS:A1994PZ75500004,28307005,,,,2021-09-23,

Understanding the factors underlying the abundance and distribution of species requires the consideration of a complex suite of interacting biotic and abiotic factors operating on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Larval mosquitoes inhabiting small human-constructed ponds represent a unique opportunity to investigate the relative importance of these structuring mechanisms while simultaneously generating applied knowledge on mosquito control. 2. A multi-year field survey of 32 stormwater ponds was conducted in central Illinois (Champaign County). From each pond, data were collected on pond structure type and hydroperiod, the presence/absence of cattails (Typha spp.), and measures of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon, and chlorophyll a. The communities of crustacean zooplankton and aquatic insects were characterised, and these taxa were assigned into two main groups: predators and competitors of larval mosquitoes. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the direct and indirect effects of these biotic and abiotic factors on larval density for three species of culicine mosquitoes (Culex pipiens, Culex restuans, and Aedes vexans). 3. Hydroperiod had an indirect negative effect on C. pipiens density. However, this effect was mediated by predator density; more permanent ponds had more predators, which therefore reduced the density of C. pipiens larvae. Aedes vexans density was positively correlated with predator density. No predictor variables were found that explained variation in C. restuans density. 4. This study show that the relative importance of these biotic and abiotic factors varies among species of culicine mosquitoes inhabiting stormwater ponds.","[Holmes, Christopher J.; Caceres, Carla E.] Univ Illinois, Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Holmes, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave,515 Morrill Hall,MC-122, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",cholmes@life.illinois.edu,,"Holmes, Christopher/0000-0003-3981-0759","United States National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1754115]; University of Illinois Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment; Department of Animal Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; School of Integrative Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","We first thank Andrew J.

Although ecological and behavioral interactions among species of salamanders have been well studied, little is known about the interactions between territorial P. cinereus and other ecologically similar species, such as large predatory invertebrates. Our field data indicate that P. cinereus and a large syntopic centipede, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus, exhibit negative spatial associations in natural habitats, possibly indicating interspecific territoriality. Only seven instances of salamander/centipede co-occurrence were recorded from a field sample of 247 occupied cover objects. Cover object size was positively correlated with salamander SVL (tip of the snout to the anterior end of the cloaca), but there was no correlation of cover object size to centipede length. Data on the ability of P. cinereus to differentiate among chemicals on the substrate suggest that visual cues are not necessary to elicit a territorial response from intruding salamanders. Although in laboratory trials salamanders behaved similarly toward intruders of both species, biting was directed only toward centipedes. Salamanders spent significantly more time approaching centipedes than they did approaching other salamanders. Approach behavior was often associated with nose tapping and may be an investigative, rather than aggressive, behavior. We suggest that territorial P. cinereus respond similarly to intruding salamanders and centipedes, but that they escalate more readily to biting centipedes because S. sexspinosus is sightless and thus unable to respond to visual signals.","John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Univ Hts, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,"Hickerson, Cari-Ann/A-8013-2008",,,,,52,26,28,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

In Bolinas Lagoon, in central California, the site of this study, at least 15 species of trematodes infect snail populations. This study investigated patterns of interspecific association and interaction among members of this parasite guild. Seven to 19 host subpopulations were sampled annually at each of two sites in the lagoon from 1981 to 1988. Mixed-species infections constituted only 2.5% of the 5025 infections examined in the study. A Monte Carlo simulation procedure demonstrated that the numbers of such infections were often less than would be expected by chance, especially when the overall prevalence of infection was high. Patterns of association between particular pairs of species depended on whether the species' life histories include redial or only sporocyst larvae. Species that develop as rediae were predominantly negatively associated with other redial species and with most species that develop only as sporocysts. There was weak evidence of positive interspecific association between a few redial and sporocyst-only species, while members of other such pairs were distributed independently. Associations between sporocyst-only species were either weakly positive or neutral. Snails carrying known infections were marked, released, and recaptured at both study sites. During their exposure in the field, some initial infections were invaded by another parasite species that often excluded the first parasite. The vulnerability of a parasite species to invasion and replacement by another differed among the tested species. Infections of the largest redial species, Parorchis acanthus, were especially resistant to replacement, while those of the smallest redial species, Euhaplorchis californiensis, were the most frequently excluded. Four other species were invaded or replaced at intermediate rates. The two largest redial species, P. acanthus and Himasthla rhigedana, were responsible for >90% of the invasions or exclusions. Direct observations showed that the rediae of these species prey on the larval stages of other species, as do the rediae of Echinoparyphium sp. This direct form of interspecific antagonism is probably the primary mechanism by which such species exclude others from host snails, as has been widely demonstrated in similar freshwater snail-trematode systems. While hierarchical, negative interactions prevent the coexistence of species at the level of the individual host, the mark-recapture study showed that rates of exclusion are low for most subordinate species, with the exception of Euhaplorchis californiensis. At the level of the host subpopulation, the assemblage of larval trematodes is diverse, and its composition is temporally and spatially variable. There is no trend toward dominance of the assemblage by large redial species as the level of infection rises within aging cohorts or subpopulations of hosts. These patterns of guild structure within host cohorts and subpopulations are consistent with the hypothesis that recruitment processes rather than interspecific interactions primarily determine the composition and relative abundance of species at this regional level. Several characteristics of snail-trematode systems that may promote regional coexistence of such a large number of potentially interacting parasite species are the isolated and subdivided nature of the host resource, the aggregated distributions of larval stages, and the differential exploitation of different-sized hosts. Many features of this system are consistent with Price's (1980) non-equilibrial view of parasite communities.",,"SOUSA, WP (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,122,115,116,0,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Using a response surface design and a press manipulation of densities, we tested effects of competition within and between two species of coral reef fishes (Coryphopterus glaucofraneum and Gnatholepis thompsoni). By tracking individually tagged fishes, we showed that the per-capita effect of intraspecific competitors on individual growth was at least twice as great as the effect of interspecific competitors. Growth rate was better predicted by measures of density that incorporated body size, rather than numerical density, suggesting interference competition. Individuals of both species interacted aggressively with conspecifics at least twice as often as with heterospecifics. Individuals of both species also covered more area while foraging and spent less time in shelter when crowded than when at lower densities. In combination, these behaviours suggest that increased metabolic costs at high density contribute to competitive effects on growth. These competitive interactions occurred among adult fishes, so reduced growth may translate to reduced fecundity as well as reduced survival, and so contribute to population regulation.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93103 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Forrester, GE (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",gforrester@uri.edu,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X",,,,40,48,48,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2006,148,4,,,,,632,640,,10.1007/s00442-006-0397-0,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,056OG,WOS:000238533400010,16518631,,,,2021-09-23,

We conducted controlled experiments in a little-studied area (Hulunbuir meadow steppe, China) to explore the effects of presence of a larger species, Spermophilus dauricus, and ambient temperature in shaping diel activity patterns of Microtus gregalis. Our results suggest that although interference competition existed between S. dauricus and M. gregalis, the presence of S. dauricus did not significantly affect the diel activity patterns of M. gregalis (P > 0.05). Timing of activity of M. gregalis, however, was always significantly correlated with ambient temperature (P < 0.001). As winter approached, ambient temperature appeared to be a major factor in shaping activity patterns of M. gregalis.

Results were completely consistent: no matter how favorable the weather conditions for using the ground (mainly characterized by temperature, humidity, wind speed, rain), A. sagrei did not do so if the predator was present. Hence, great behavioral plasticity enabled A. sagrei to adjust its use of space very quickly.

Thus, we have no idea what types of interspecific interactions to expect if we randomly sample species from an environment. The probability that a unidirectional, non-zero interaction is negative (P--) or positive (P-+) has a direct effect on the expected types of reciprocal interspecific interactions. Analysis of field studies where strengths and signs of interactions between seven or more species were documented (large studies were selected to avoid bias from choosing species known to interact) suggests that P-+ = P-- = 0.5. Data also suggest that the proportion of non-zero interactions (C) is generally less than 0.6 when 10 or more interactions are considered. The proportion of expected reciprocal interspecific interactions can be calculated given the proportion of direct interactions that are not significantly different from zero and assuming that non-zero interactions are equally likely to be positive or negative. In general, this neutral model predicts that if species are chosen from an environment randomly, non-interaction (0/0), commensalism (+/-/0), or amensalism (-/0) will be most common when C<0.6. Predation and functionally similar interactions (+/-), competition (-/-), and mutualism (+/+) should be relatively rare when there are less than 10 species with C<0.6.

The ability of a species to respond appropriately to risk cues may determine the outcome of interspecific competition. We investigated whether two invasive mussel species, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, and the quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, differ in their behavioural responses to risk cues released from round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, and rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus. In response to risk cues, both species increased their attachment strength, aggregated more, increased the use of a refuge habitat and decreased clearance rates. Although attachment strength, aggregation rate and refuge habitat use was greater for zebra than for quagga mussels, the strength of predator-induced responses was similar in the two mussel species for all behaviours except for filtering activity. Zebra mussels decreased clearance rates more when exposed to predator risk cues than quagga mussels. Both mussels decreased clearance rates the most with rusty crayfish risk cues present. Since these responses have a fitness cost associated with lower growth rates, the stronger response of zebra mussels may make this species competitively inferior to quagga mussels in an initial low-predation environment when few native predators are feeding on these mussels. This advantage may shift to zebra mussels over time if native predators learn or adapt to feed on the dreissenids. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Social learning is usually studied as an intraspecific phenomenon (but see [5-7]). However, other species with some overlap in ecology can be more than merely potential competitors: prior settlement and longer residence can render them preferable sources of information [8]. Socially induced acquisition of choices or preferences capitalizes upon the knowledge of presumably better-informed individuals [9] and should be adaptive under many natural circumstances [10, 11]. Here we show with a field experiment that females of two migrant flycatcher species can acquire a novel, arbitrary preference of competing resident tits for a symbol attached to the nest sites. The experiment demonstrates that such blind acquisition of heterospecific traits can occur in the wild. Even though genetic variation for habitat preferences exists in many taxa [12] and overlap between bird species likely induces costs [13], this result shows that interspecific social learning can cause increased overlap in nest-site preferences. Conventional, negative species interactions push ecological niches of species apart, but the use of competing species as a source of information counters that force and may lead to convergence.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Anim Ecol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Seppanen, JT (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",janseppa@jyu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-5132-6268; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X",,,,39,81,81,1,59,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0960-9822,1879-0445,,CURR BIOL,Curr.

In gape-limited predators, body size asymmetries determine the outcome of predator-prey interactions. Due to ontogenetic changes in body size, the intensity of intra- and interspecific interactions may change rapidly between the match situation of a predator-prey system and the mismatch situation in which competition, including competition with the prey, dominates. 2. Based on a physiologically structured population model using the European perch (Perca fluviatilis), analysis was performed on how prey density (bream, Abramis brama), initial size differences in the young-of-the-year (YOY) age cohort of the predator, and phenology (time-gap in hatching of predator and prey) influence the size structure of the predator cohort. 3. In relation to the seasonality of reproduction, the match situation of the predator-prey system occurred when perch hatched earlier than bream and when no gape-size limitations existed, leading to decreased size divergence in the predator age cohort. Decreased size divergence was also found when bream hatched much earlier than perch, preventing perch predation on bream occurring, which, in turn, increased the competitive interaction of the perch with bream for the common prey, zooplankton; i.e. the mismatch situation in which also the mean size of the age cohort of the predator decreased. 4. In between the total match and the mismatch, however, only the largest individuals of the perch age cohort were able to prey on the bream, while smaller conspecifics got trapped in competition with each other and with bream for zooplankton, leading to enlarged differences in growth that increased size divergence. 5. The modelling results were combined with 7 years of field data in a lake, where large differences in the length-frequency distribution of YOY perch were observed after their first summer. These field data corroborate that phenology and prey density per predator are important mechanisms in determining size differences within the YOY age cohort of the predator. 6. The results demonstrate that the switch between competitive interactions and a predator-prey relationship depended on phenology. This resulted in pronounced size differences in the YOY age cohort, which had far-reaching consequences for the entire predator population.","[Borcherding, Jost; Beeck, Peter; Scharf, Werner R.] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Ecol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, Biol Resources Div, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, US Geol Survey, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Borcherding, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Ecol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",jost.borcherding@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG BO1507/5-1]; U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources DivisionUnited States Geological Survey","We gratefully acknowledge the help of Joscha Groddeck, Lisa Heermann, Martina Heynen, Stephanie Kiel, Ulrike Konig, Andreas Scharbert, Ralph Urbatzka and many volunteer helpers during the field sampling.

Both of these impacts increase marine microbial diversity by increasing interspecific competition. By contrast, very little is known about the role of phage predation in terrestrial ecosystems. A recent field study in Barrow, AK found phage predation to be a key factor controlling terrestrial bacterial population dynamics in Arctic soils. When phage abundance was artificially reduced using a tea extract, antiphage treatment, bacterial abundance, and respiration increased accordingly, suggesting top-down control by phages. The goal of this study was to examine the impact of phage predation in temperate soil ecosystems. Laboratory-scale experiments confirmed the potent antiphage properties of tea extracts. However, field experiments conducted at two discrete sites (upland and wetland) yielded little evidence that top-down control by phage predation was significant in temperate soils.","[Helsley, Kaitlin R.; Brown, Theresa M.; Furlong, Kevin; Williamson, Kurt E.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, Integrated Sci Ctr 2127, Williamsburg, VA 22185 USA","Williamson, KE (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, Integrated Sci Ctr 2127, Williamsburg, VA 22185 USA.",kewilliamson@wm.edu,,,William & Mary Honors Fund; Jeffress Memorial Trust [J-988],"This work was supported by William & Mary Honors Funding to KRH provided by individual donors Dr. John Sherwood, Ms. Margery Daughtry, Mr. Ted Dintersmith, and Ms. Janet Bouland and by a grant to KEW from the Jeffress Memorial Trust ( J-988).

On Guam, the sponge Dysidea sp. overgrows the sponge Cacospongia sp. and causes necrosis. Using field assays, we tested the effects of crude organic extracts and a major sesquiterpene isolated from Dysidea, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane, on Cacospongia and on the production of the major terpenoid metabolites scalaradial and desacetylscalaradial by Cacospongia. We also tested whether the amounts of organic compounds produced by Dysidea differed in the presence or absence of Cacospongia. To determine whether 7-deacetoxyolepupuane had another ecological function, we tested the compound as a predator deterrent. In field experiments, crude extracts of Dysidea and pure 7-deacetoxyolepupuane both caused necrosis in Cacospongia when they were incorporated into agar strips and placed in contact with Cacospongia for 7 d. Organic extract, scalaradial, and desacetylscalaradial concentrations in Cacospongia were not affected by the overgrowth of Dysidea. However, a greater quantity of organic extract (but not scalaradial or desacetylscalaradial) was found in portions of Cacospongia covered by agar strips containing Dysidea organic extracts than in portions of Cacospongia covered by control agar strips. The production of 7-deacetoxyolepupuane by Dysidea occurring on rock substrates and on Cacospongia did not differ; thus, the production of this compound is not induced by the presence of competitors. In addition to its role in competition, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane deterred predation by a spongivorous fish, illustrating the multiple ecological roles that a single secondary metabolite may play.","Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA","Paul, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA.",,"Becerro, Mikel/A-5325-2008","Thacker, Robert/0000-0002-9654-0073",,,,78,81,92,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1998,79,5,,,,,1740,1750,,,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101CX,WOS:000074853000023,,,,,2021-09-23,

Muller). Two different predator profiles were used, one simulating a gape-limited (vertebrate) predator, and the other simulating a size-dependent (invertebrate) predator sensu Zaret (1980). Predation was executed by manually removing fixed percentages of populations in susceptible size-classes in accordance with the profiles, irrespective of species. Thirty-six two-species and seven one-species experiments were performed with predation rates from 0 to 90% per 8 days. (2) Under gape-limited (vertebrate) predation, the time to extinction of the larger D. magna decreased with increasing predation rates. In the size-dependent (invertebrate) predation experiments, coexistence of both species was common up to c. 75% predation per 8 days, and then D. longispina became extinct at higher predation rates. Extinctions of the sub-dominant species did not occur when it was reared alone under high predation rates. Both interspecific competition and predation appeared to be important for the exclusion of the species most susceptible to predation. (3) The results support the idea that vertebrate predation can be important in regulating prey size distribution and species composition in rockpool and pond zooplankton communities. They also suggest that low rates of invertebrate predation may have little effect on zooplankton composition in rockpools and ponds. (4) Predation and competition interacted to produce differences in species composition between different predation rates and profiles. Interspecific competition was still of importance under high predation rates. It is therefore suggested that the view that either one or the other of these processes operates in a particular community may be too simplistic.",,"MILBRINK, G (corresponding author), UNIV UPPSALA, DEPT ZOOL, BOX 561, S-75122 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,"Bengtsson, Jan/AAF-2325-2021",,,,,78,19,19,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

During a study on the great tit at Wytham Wood, Oxfordshire, nest predation by weasels was as high as 50% in some years prior to 1976. In 1976, nest-boxes were made virtually predator proof. 2. The change in nest-box type increased local recruitment rate and total population size of great and blue tits. We examined here the consequences of reduced nest predation on the survival rate of the great tit late in life. 3. Prior to 1976 (during the nest predation period), survival rate after the age of 5 years showed no decline and no relationship to the number of successful breeding attempts in either sex. 4. After 1976 (predator-proof period), both sexes showed increased mortality rates after the age of 5. However, only female survival was related to the number of successful breeding attempts, with a negative correlation. 5. This enhanced mortality late in life is likely to result from an increased cost of reproduction due to the combined effects of increased competition (higher adult density) and increased investment in reproduction (more young to raise because of reduced nest predation). These results fit predictions from life history theory, where increased effort early in life is predicted to trade with survival late in life.","EDWARD GREY INST FIELD ORNITHOL, DEPT ZOOL, OXFORD, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,59,56,58,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Both snails and tadpoles feed on periphytic algae and, thus, there should be a large potential for competitive interactions to occur between these two distantly related taxa. In a field experiment we examined the relative strength of competition between two closely related snail species, Lymnaea stagnalis and L. peregra, and between L. stagnalis and tadpoles of the common frog, Rana temporaria. Snail growth and egg production and tadpole size at and time to metamorphosis were determined. Effects on the common food source, periphyton, were monitored with the aid of artificial substrates. Periphyton dry weight was dramatically reduced in the presence of snails and/or tadpoles. There were no competitive effects on growth or egg production of the two snail species when they were coexisting. Mortality of L. peregra was high (95%) after reproduction, but independent of treatment. Growth of L. stagnalis was reduced only at the highest tadpole densities, whereas egg production was reduced both by intraspecific competition and by competition with tadpoles. Differences in egg production were retained after tadpole metamorphosis. Tadpole larval period increased, weight of metamorphosing frogs decreased and growth rate was reduced as a function of increasing tadpole density. However, contrary to expectation, snails had a positive effect on tadpole larval period, weight and growth rate. Further, in experimental containers without snails there was a dense growth of the filamentous green alga Cladophora sp. We suggest that the facilitative effects of snails on tadpoles are due to an indirect mutualistic mechanism, involving competition between food sources of different quality (microalgae and Cladophora sp.) and tadpoles being competitively dominant over snails for the preferred food source (microalgae). In the presence of tadpoles snails will be forced to feed on low-quality Cladophora, increasing nutrient turnover rates, which results in enhanced productivity of microalgae, increasing tadpole food resources. Thus, tadpoles have a negative effect on snails through resource depression, while snails facilitate tadpole growth through an indirect enhancement of food availability.",,"BRONMARK, C (corresponding author), UNIV LUND,DEPT ECOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,78,77,80,1,48,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,87,1,,,,,8,18,,10.1007/BF00323774,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR962,WOS:A1991FR96200002,28313346,,,,2021-09-23,

Understanding the interaction among predators and between predation and climate is critical to understanding the mechanisms for compensatory mortality. We used data from 1999 radio-marked neonatal elk (Cervus elaphus) calves from 12 populations in the north-western United States to test for effects of predation on neonatal survival, and whether predation interacted with climate to render mortality compensatory. 2. Weibull survival models with a random effect for each population were fit as a function of the number of predator species in a community (3-5), seven indices of climatic variability, sex, birth date, birth weight, and all interactions between climate and predators. Cumulative incidence functions (CIF) were used to test whether the effects of individual species of predators were additive or compensatory. 3. Neonatal elk survival to 3 months declined following hotter previous summers and increased with higher May precipitation, especially in areas with wolves and/or grizzly bears. Mortality hazards were significantly lower in systems with only coyotes (Canis latrans), cougars (Puma concolor) and black bears (Ursus americanus) compared to higher mortality hazards experienced with gray wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus horribilis). 4. In systems with wolves and grizzly bears, mortality by cougars decreased, and predation by bears was the dominant cause of neonatal mortality. Only bear predation appeared additive and occurred earlier than other predators, which may render later mortality by other predators compensatory as calves age. Wolf predation was low and most likely a compensatory source of mortality for neonatal elk calves. 5. Functional redundancy and interspecific competition among predators may combine with the effects of climate on vulnerability to predation to drive compensatory mortality of neonatal elk calves. The exception was the evidence for additive bear predation. These results suggest that effects of predation by recovering wolves on neonatal elk survival, a contentious issue for management of elk populations, may be less important than the composition of the predator community. Future studies would benefit by synthesizing overwinter calf and adult-survival data sets, ideally from experimental studies, to test the roles of predation in annual compensatory and additive mortality of elk.","[Griffin, Kathleen A.; Hebblewhite, Mark; Robinson, Hugh S.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Zager, Peter] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Lewiston, ID 83501 USA; [Barber-Meyer, Shannon M.] Teton Sci Sch, Kelly, WY 83011 USA; [Christianson, David; Creel, Scott] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Harris, Nyeema C.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hurley, Mark A.] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Salmon, ID 83467 USA; [Jackson, DeWaine H.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, Roseburg, OR 97470 USA; [Johnson, Bruce K.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; [Myers, Woodrow L.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Spokane, WA 99216 USA; [Raithel, Jarod D.] Kihei Charter Sch, Kihei, HI 96753 USA; [Schlegel, Mike] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Kamiah, ID 83536 USA; [Smith, Bruce L.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Jackson, WY 83001 USA; [White, Craig] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Boise, ID 83707 USA; [White, P.

We analyzed time series of the abundance of ten species of spring foliage feeding Lepidoptera sampled over a 25-year period at 20 sites in the Slovak Republic. Six species were free-feeders and four were leaf-rollers as larvae. Twenty-nine percent of interspecific pairs were significantly synchronous and correlations were highest among species exhibiting similar feeding strategies. Similar patterns of interspecific synchrony have been previously demonstrated in several other taxa, and the synchronizing effects of weather and/or specialist predators have been proposed as mechanisms. As an alternative explanation, we explored a model in which two species within the same feeding guild were synchronized by the functional response of generalist predators. In this model, species remained unsynchronized in the complete absence of predation or when predatory pressures were applied to only one species. Pairs of prey species projecting relatively similar search images to predators were more highly synchronized than species with relatively different search images. Prey handling time only influenced synchrony when it was very high relative to the total time prey was exposed to predators. Our model's prediction of greater synchrony among species that project similar search images to predators was in agreement with our field study that showed greater synchrony among species sharing similar larval feeding strategies and morphologies.","US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA; Fores Res Inst, Res Stn Banska Stiavnica, SK-96923 Banska, Stiavnica, Slovakia; Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia; US Forest Serv, USDA, NE Res Stn, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA","Raimondo, S (corresponding author), US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, 1 Sabine Isl Dr, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA.",raimondo.sandy@epa.gov,"Liebhold, Andrew M/C-1423-2008",,,,,55,32,33,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2004,107,3,,,,,462,470,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13449.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,873FZ,WOS:000225266600002,,,,,2021-09-23,

Sharing a common habitat may lead to interspecific competition for resources, but field assessment of these biological events is not always easily accomplished. By using a non-invasive method, we evaluated the physiological stress responses of Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) to the presence of cattle, sheep and goat, red deer (Cervus elaphus), people (hikers), and predators to identify which factors may affect this endangered species. During September 2012, November 2012, and July 2013, a total of 318 faecal samples were collected in representative sites and analysed for faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM). FCM concentration was analysed through linear mixed-effect models. A significant increase in FCM values in Apennine chamois sharing their habitat with domestic animals was recorded during all study periods. On the contrary, stress responses to red deer and people were limited in time and emerged only during summer months, when hikers are more frequent and red deer extend their altitudinal range reaching chamois' habitat. The observed effects of domestic animals, red deer, and hikers should be considered in future Apennine chamois management plans, which should include the regulation of pastured domestic livestock, anthropogenic disturbances, and possible interferences with other wild species within parks.","[Formenti, Nicoletta; Trogu, Tiziana; Bonfanti, Marta; Lanfranchi, Paolo; Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Dept Vet Med, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Formenti, Nicoletta] Ist Zooprofilatt Sperimentale Lombardia & Emilia, Via Bianchi 7-9, I-25124 Brescia, Italy; [Vigano, Roberto; Fraquelli, Cristina] Studio Associato AlpVet, Piazza Venzaghi 2, I-21052 Busto Arsizio, VA, Italy; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Veterinarpl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Ctr Ric Coordinata Epidemiol & Sorveglianza Mol I, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Ferrari, N (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Vet Med, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy.; Ferrari, N (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Ctr Ric Coordinata Epidemiol & Sorveglianza Mol I, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",nicola.ferrari@unimi.it,"Ferrari, Nicola/E-6331-2013; Vigano, Roberto/ABE-8075-2020; Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008","Ferrari, Nicola/0000-0001-8959-3495; Vigano, Roberto/0000-0001-8594-1296; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Formenti, Nicoletta/0000-0003-1516-1256","Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN project)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) [2010P7LFW4];  [LIFE09 NAT/IT/000183]",This research was supported by the 'Project LIFE09 NAT/IT/000183 Coornata' and partly by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN project no. 2010P7LFW4).,,60,4,4,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Frankliniella occidentalis is significantly larger than F. bispinosa. Frankliniella bispinosa has greater mobility compared with F. occidentalis. When O. insidiosus was offered either F. bispinosa or F. occidentalis as prey in single species trials, there were no significant differences in the number of prey captured. However, O. insidiosus had significantly more encounters with F. bispinosa than with F. occidentalis. In arenas with equal numbers of both species, O. insidiosus encountered and captured F. occidentalis more than F. bispinosa. In large arenas with two pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L.), O. insidiosus preyed on more F. occidentalis than on F. bispinosa. These results indicate that O. insidiosus can prey on both thrips species, but that it preferentially captures F. occidentalis. The greater locomotion and movement of F. bispinosa, perhaps combined with its smaller size, allow it to evade predation by O. insidiosus better than F. occidentalis. Consequently, the observed preference of O. insidiosus for F. occidentalis is not exclusively a function of active selection by the predator but also could arise from inherent differences among prey. We propose this differential predation as a mechanism contributing to observed differences in the temporal dynamics of these species in pepper fields.","USDA ARS, CMAVE, Tallahassee, FL 32308 USA; Univ Florida, N Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Quincy, FL 32351 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Reitz, SR (corresponding author), USDA ARS, CMAVE, 6383 Mahan Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32308 USA.",sreitz@saa.ars.usda.gov,"Reitz, Stuart/B-7667-2008; Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019",,,,,57,35,45,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Here, we demonstrate that phloem-feeding membracids (Publilia modesta) compete intraspecifically for the protective services of an ant mutualist (Formica altipetens). By experimentally increasing membracid densities in the field, we observed three negative effects due to competition for ants: (1) a 45%-59% reduction in the number of ants tending membracid aggregations, (2) a 63% increase in the abundance of a predatory salticid spider (Pellenes sp.), and (3) a 59% reduction in the mean number of membracid nymphs per plant. In total, the loss of protective services due to competition for mutualists translated into a 92% decrease in the production of newly eclosed membracid adults. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration that animal species compete for mutualists. In addition, our work indicates that mutualisms can be strongly influenced by the local biotic neighborhoods in which they occur and thus may be far more variable than previously thought.","NO ARIZONA UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, FLAGSTAFF, AZ 86011 USA","CUSHMAN, JH (corresponding author), MACQUARIE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,64,68,71,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Following introductions in the 1950s, Gammarus pulex has replaced the native Irish freshwater amphipod G. duebeni celticus in several river systems. We show that G. pulex has eliminated and replaced G. d. celticus in lower sections of the River Lagan system, N. Ireland, although G. d. celticus maintains pure populations upstream-from G. pulex. More rarely, the two species may be found together. 2. We investigate the potential roles of cannibalism and mutual predation in explaining these replacement patterns. G. d. celticus was significantly more cannibalistic on moulted conspecifics than G. pulex. Mutual predation by intermoult individuals on moulted congenerics was observed in all combinations of adult males and females, including those in the precopulatory mate-guarding phase, and juveniles. In general, predation between species exceeded cannibalism within species, particularly predation by G. pulex on G. d. celticus. Predation was differentially in favour of G. pulex in most combinations. These differences in predation frequencies were not dependent on body size. 3. A model is presented incorporating resource exploitation competition, cannibalism and mutual predation. The behaviour of the model agrees with our intuitive predictions and our conclusions based on empirical findings. Cannibalism in the absence of predation promotes coexistence, whereas mutual but differential predation in the absence of cannibalism may lead to elimination, depending on relative resource competitive ability. When cannibalism and predation occur together, predation of equal magnitude or greater than cannibalism leads to rapid elimination. Predation in favour of species 1 may overcome a competitive advantage for species 2, leading to elimination of species 2. 4. We conclude that the superior abilities of G. pulex to resist predatory attacks and to prey on moulted G. d. celticus may be major features of the elimination and replacement of the latter species by the former. 5. We encourage examination of replacements involving other crustaceans in terms of predatory behaviour and, more generally, urge adoption of approaches at the individual level to elucidate mechanisms underlying interspecific relationships.",,"DICK, JTA (corresponding author), QUEENS UNIV BELFAST,SCH BIOL & BIOCHEM,MED BIOL CTR,DIV ENVIRONM & EVOLUT BIOL,BELFAST BT9 7BL,ANTRIM,NORTH IRELAND.",,,,,,,44,108,111,0,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Sudden Oak Death (SOD), caused by Phytophthora ramorum (Oomycota), is an introduced disease causing large-scale tree mortality. Two additional Phytophthora species, Phytophthora nemorosa and Phytophthora pseudosyringae, cause significantly lower oak mortality, yet they also commonly colonize leaves of Umbellularia californica, the major transmissive host of SOD in California. We combined field surveys and inoculation experiments to understand disease prevalence dynamics and competitive interactions among these pathogen species. Despite the broader geographic distribution of P. nemorosa with respect to that of P. ramorum, our results suggest that P. nemorosa exhibits a narrower ecological amplitude and, in any given region, occupies fewer sites than P. ramorum. Our results additionally suggest that, perhaps due to priority effects, P. nemorosa can persist at levels comparable to those of P. ramorum in ecologically suitable plots when climate favors P. ramorum dormancy. However, P. ramorum prevalence increases to levels higher than those of the competing species when abundant rainfall triggers its sporulation. Understanding the determinants and outcomes of competition between these species has important implications for understanding the epidemiology and possible control strategies for Sudden Oak Death.

We tested the hypothesis that Gerbillus henleyi (de Winton 1903), the smallest species (10 g) of a pssamophilic guild in Israel, is scarce on relatively productive dunes of the Israeli desert, due to negative interactions from the common G. allenbyi (Thomas 1918) and G. pyramidum (Geoffroy 1825). 2. The alternative hypothesis was that scarcity on sand resulted from the size of its naked hind feet, that do not allow efficient locomotion on sand. 3. Despite their naked soles the weight-bearing surface of G. henleyi feet carry less mass/area than those of any other species. 4. We measured interaction coefficients with the two common species using field-manipulation experiments in two enclosures. 5. Habitat usage of G. henleyi changed from significantly preferring the stabilized sand, when alone, to significantly using the semistabilized dune, when G. allenbyi was also present. 6. We also estimated the interaction coefficients and calculated the G. henleyi's isoclines competing with the two common gerbil species using a technique we developed elsewhere. 7. The stability analysis of the isoclines of G. henleyi competing with either G. allenbyi or with G. pyramidum suggests that stable coexistence occurs when G. henleyi is relatively scarce while the competitors are common. 8. Interspecific competition from either G. allenbyi or G. pyramidum accounts for 90.3% reduction in G. henleyi density, relative to when it is alone. 9. We concluded that the negative interactions from congeners was the major cause for the scarcity of G. henleyi on the relatively rich sand dunes of the Israeli desert.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Abramsky, Z (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",zvika@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012","Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,31,7,9,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The lakes are characterized by a dominance of large zooplankton species. Small zooplankton species are scarce, whereas in nearby lakes with fish they are common. The importance of biotic and abiotic factors in preventing the successful invasion of small zooplankton species into these fishless lakes was determined using a series of field manipulations. The relative importance of competition with large herbivores (the cladoceran Daphnia pulex), predation by large invertebrates (the dipteran Chaoborus americanus and the copepod Diaptomus leptopus), and abiotic conditions including pH were examined experimentally. Abiotic and/or resource conditions suppressed the population growth rate of 70% of the small zooplankton species introduced into enclosures in the fishless lakes relative to those introduced into enclosures in their resident lake (a lake with fish). Fewer small zooplankton species were suppressed in a similar experiment when pH was experimentally raised to 7, suggesting that pH is one factor that inhibits the successful invasion of small zooplankton into these lakes. Manipulations of large herbivores and invertebrate predators showed that predation was more important than competition in restricting the distribution of small species. Predation by Chaoborus primarily reduced the densities of crustaceans while predation by Diaptomus reduced the densities of rotifers. Competitive suppression of small zooplankton by Daphnia was not detected. The results suggest that both predation by Chaoborus and Diaptomus and abiotic conditions, including pH, are important factors determining zooplankton community structure in these fishless bog lakes.","MIAMI UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,OXFORD,OH 45054",,,,"Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X",,,,86,101,109,0,42,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1993,74,8,,,,,2361,2380,,10.2307/1939588,,,20,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MJ575,WOS:A1993MJ57500017,,,,,2021-09-23,

Variation in predation risk and resource availability may influence the occurrence and fitness effects of aggregating in nature. Yet tests of such possibilities are lacking. Cavity-nesting birds provide an interesting test case. They compete aggressively for resources and experience low nest predation rates, which might predict dispersion, but across 19 years of study we found that they commonly aggregate by sharing nest trees. Tree sharing was more common when aspen were more abundant and was somewhat more common in years with higher nest predation risk. Nest success was higher in shared trees when nest predation risk was higher than average. Ultimately, the costs and benefits of aggregating (nest tree sharing) varied across years, and we outline hypotheses for future studies.","[Mouton, James C.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Martin, Thomas E.] Univ Montana, US Geol Survey, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Mouton, JC (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",james@moutons.org,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1701672, DEB-0841764, DEB-1241041, IOS-1349178]","We appreciate helpful comments from two anonymous reviewers and our laboratory on the manuscript.

The extent to which microhabitat partitioning occurs depends on a variety of environmental parameters and biotic interactions. In the present study, we manipulated factors (animal density, presence of heterospecifics, and presence of predator cues) that potentially influence the differential use of microhabitats by 2 hemi-sessile congeners that coexist on small spatial scales at very high densities: the amphipod crustaceans Jassa marmorata and J. herdmani. In both species, the presence of heterospecifics had a clear effect on which part of an offered macroalga was preferably colonized, suggesting that the extent of microhabitat partitioning depends on the presence/absence of heterospecifics. Furthermore, 'predatory fish cues' in the seawater induced an avoidance behaviour, which should reduce the extent of habitat partitioning and inevitably increase competition between the species. The results clearly show some flexibility of habitat selection in, and thus habitat segregation between, the studied species, allowing for a trade-off between interspecific competition and predation pressure.","[Beermann, Jan] Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany; [Boos, Karin] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Beermann, J (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, POB 180, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany.",jan.beermann@awi.de,,"Beermann, Jan/0000-0001-5894-6817",Free University of Berlin (Elsa- Neumann-Stipendium of the Federal State of Berlin),"We thank the crew of the RV 'Aade' for their help in the field and colleagues Heinz- Dieter Franke (Helgoland, Germany), Martin Thiel (Coquimbo, Chile) and Roger Mundry (Leipzig, Germany) for valuable comments and suggestions.

Recent theory predicts that both competition and predation (which causes apparent competition among prey) can either promote or limit species coexistence. Both mechanisms cause negative interactions between individuals, and each mechanism promotes stable coexistence if it causes negative interactions to be stronger between conspecifics than between heterospecifics. However, the relative importance of competition and predation for coexistence in natural communities is poorly known. Here, we study how competition and apparent competition via pre-dispersal seed predators affect the long-term fecundity of Protea shrubs in the fire-prone Fynbos biome (South Africa). These shrubs store all viable seeds produced since the last fire in fire-proof cones. Competitive effects on cone number and pre-dispersal seed predation reduce their fecundity and can thus limit recruitment after the next fire. In 27 communities comprising 49 990 shrubs of 22 Protea species, we measured cone number and per-cone seed predation rate of 2154 and 1755 focal individuals, respectively. Neighbourhood analyses related these measures to individual-based community maps. We found that conspecific neighbours had stronger competitive effects on cone number than heterospecific neighbours. In contrast, apparent competition via seed predators was comparable between conspecifics and heterospecifics. This indicates that competition stabilizes coexistence of Protea species, whereas pre-dispersal seed predation does not. Larger neighbours had stronger competitive effects and neighbours with large seed crops exerted stronger apparent competition. For 97% of the focal plants, competition reduced fecundity more than apparent competition. Our results show that even in communities of closely related and ecologically similar species, intraspecific competition can be stronger than interspecific competition. On the other hand, apparent competition through seed predators need not have such a stabilizing effect. These findings illustrate the potential of community demography', the demographic study of multiple interacting species, for understanding plant coexistence.","[Nottebrock, Henning; Treurnicht, Martina; Pagel, Joern; Schurr, Frank M.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, August von Hartmann Str 3, DE-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Nottebrock, Henning; Schurr, Frank M.] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, UMR 5554, Montpellier, France; [Schmid, Baptiste; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Schleuning, Matthias] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmid, Baptiste; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Schleuning, Matthias] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Frankfurt, Germany; [Boehning-Gaese, Katrin] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Ecol Evolut & Divers, Frankfurt, Germany; [Nottebrock, Henning; Schmid, Baptiste; Treurnicht, Martina; Esler, Karen J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Biol & Entomol, Matieland, South Africa; [Nottebrock, Henning; Schmid, Baptiste; Treurnicht, Martina; Esler, Karen J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, Matieland, South Africa","Nottebrock, H (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, August von Hartmann Str 3, DE-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",henning@nottebrock.net,"Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019; Schurr, Frank M./O-6575-2016","Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/0000-0003-0477-5586; Schurr, Frank M./0000-0002-4518-0602; Schmid, Baptiste/0000-0002-7736-7527; Pagel, Jorn/0000-0002-4817-1920","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHU2259/3-1, SCHL 1934/1-1]","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation [grant no.

Similarly sized third instar larvae of Hippodamia convergens and H. tredecimpunctata, H. convergens and H. sinuata, and H. convergens and Coccinella septempunctata, were tested in experiments designed to ensure that paired larvae experienced moderate competition. Interspecific competition in these experiments did not differ significantly from intraspecific competition, in that an individual's weight gain did not depend on whether its competitor was heterospecific or conspecific. Furthermore, aphid populations were reduced equally by heterospecific and conspecific pairs. These results suggest that there is little or no difference between intra and interspecific interactions among larvae of these ladybeetles when two similarly sized individuals co-occur on a host plant.

Industrial landscape change creates a novel playing field on which these interactions take place, and a key question for wildlife managers is whether and how species are able to coexist in such working landscapes. Using camera traps deployed in northern Alberta, we surveyed boreal predators to determine whether interspecific interactions affected occurrences of black bears (Ursus americanus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and lynx (Lynx canadensis) within a landscape disturbed by networks of seismic lines (corridors cut for seismic exploration of oil and gas reserves). We tested hypotheses of species interactions across one spatial-only and two spatiotemporal (daily and weekly) scales. Specifically, we hypothesized that (1) predators avoid competition with the apex predator, gray wolf (Canis lupus), (2) they avoid competition with each other as intraguild competitors, and (3) they overlap with their prey. All three predators overlapped with wolves on at least one scale, although models at the daily and weekly scale had substantial unexplained variance. None of the predators showed avoidance of intraguild competitors or overlap with prey. These results show patterns in predator space use that are consistent with both facilitative interactions or shared responses to unmeasured ecological cues. Our study provides insight into how predator species use the working boreal landscape in relation to each other, and highlights that predator management may indirectly influence multiple species through their interactions.","[Tattersall, Erin R.; Burgar, Joanna M.; Burton, A.

For this reason, they have been often used to examine the consequences of competitive interactions. Hosts represent limited resources for larval parasitoid development and thus one competitor usually excludes all others. Although parasitoid competition has been debated and studied over the past several decades, understanding the factors that allow for coexistence among species sharing the same host in the field remains elusive. Parasitoids may be able to coexist on the same host species if they partition host resources according to size, age, or stage, or if their dynamics vary at spatial and temporal scales. One area that has thus far received little experimental attention is if competition can alter host usage strategies in parasitoids that in the absence of competitors attack hosts of the same size in the field. Here, we test this hypothesis with two parasitoid species in the genus Aphytis, both of which are specialized on the citrus pest California red scale Aonidiella aurantii. These parasitoids prefer large scales as hosts and yet coexist in sympatry in eastern parts of Spain. Parasitoids and hosts were sampled in 12 replicated orange groves. When host exploitation by the stronger competitor, A. melinus, was high the poorer competitor, A. chrysomphali, changed its foraging strategy to prefer alternative plant substrates where it parasitized hosts of smaller size. Consequently, the inferior parasitoid species shifted both its habitat and host size as a result of competition. Our results suggest that density-dependent size-mediated asymmetric competition is the likely mechanism allowing for the coexistence of these two species, and that the use of suboptimal (small) hosts can be advantageous under conditions imposed by competition where survival in higher quality larger hosts may be greatly reduced.","[Pekas, Apostolos; Garcia-Mari, Ferran] Univ Politecn Valencia, IAM, Cami de Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Tena, Alejandro] UJI, IVIA, Unidad Asociada Entomol, Valencia 46113, Spain; [Harvey, Jeffrey A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Frago, Enric] Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, Droevendaalsesteeg 1,Bldg 107,POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Frago, E (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, Droevendaalsesteeg 1,Bldg 107,POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",enric.frago@gmail.com,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Harvey, Jeffrey A/B-7439-2008; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Pekas, Apostolos/J-8823-2017","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Harvey, Jeffrey A/0000-0002-4227-7935; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Pekas, Apostolos/0000-0002-8209-3882",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia of SpainSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [AGL2005-07155-C03-03]; European CommunityEuropean Commission [329648],"We would like to thank Amparo Aguilar for her valuable help in the field and in the laboratory, and Camille Ponzio for her comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Predaceous diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) are a model group for testing these potential coexistence mechanisms because they are abundant, interact in finite habitats, and are mobile among habitats. We focused on two morphologically similar species, Laccophilus fasciatus rufus (Aube) and Laccophilus proximus (Say), to determine if mechanisms exist that help to explain patterns of their coexistence. Behavioral observations and feeding trials in the laboratory, a field experiment, and a mesocosm experiment were used to determine if habitat use, prey consumption, or dispersal rates of these two species were inherently different or changed when in the presence of intra- or interspecific competitors. We found no difference between habitat use or prey consumption between species in constant depth aquaria, and no effect of intra- or interspecifics on their behaviors. In variable depth aquaria, L. proximus occupied significantly shallower habitat when compared with L. f. rufus; in the former this difference only occurred between conspecific treatments. Field collections confirmed that L. proximus occupied shallower habitats than L. f. rufus. In field mesocosms, L. proximus displayed higher dispersal rates than L. f. rufus. These species also do not appear food limited in the field, suggesting that adult competition for food is unlikely. L. f. rufus and L. proximus exhibit different habitat use and dispersal responses, but this does not seem to be in response to intra- or interspecific competitive interactions.","[Pitcher, K.

Each species relies primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g. satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for Adelie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands, occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources.

The monthly availability of their food resources in the field, and the monthly variation in the feeding relationships between these snakes and their preys, were also studied. Food items of 1245 snakes. i.e. 554 Grayia smythii, and 691 Afronatrix anoscopus, were examined. The mean body length of Grayia smythii was significantly larger than that of Afronatrix anoscopus in any interspecific comparison, i.e. males versus males, females versus females, and females versus males; however, in both species the females attained significantly larger body sizes than the males. 676 prey items were obtained from the stomachs of Afronatrix anoscopus, and 390 from those of Grayia smythii. Both species of snake exhibited an increased activity in the open during the wet months, and this increased activity was positively correlated to the higher abundance of prey during the wet season. In both species the diet consisted of a great variety of different amphibian and fish species. Direct interference competition was not observed. The month-by-month dietary patterns exhibited by the two snake species were similar. Mean prey size was significantly larger in the larger species, and the difference in prey size between the two snake species increased during the dry season, i.e. during the period of reduced prey availability. The monthly availability of the three main food types for these snakes varied, and were significantly more abundant during the wet season (April-September). A positive relationship between prey availability and prey use by snakes strongly suggests that the two snake species are predatory generalists, utilizing prey in relation to their abundance in the field.","FIZV Ecol, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, I-00198 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), FIZV Ecol, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,51,33,35,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4674,1469-7831,,J TROP ECOL,J.

This is surprising not because competition is rare but because for a biogeographic pattern caused by species interactions to be detectable, it must be strong enough to override the many physical and historical differences that exist among real islands. Moreover, the direct pairwise links between species, once embedded in the complicated network of species interactions in entire communities, may become diluted and confused by the indirect interactions of still other species, particularly predators. Nevertheless, if competition is strong and if communities are simple (as they are on many species-poor islands), competition leaves its fingerprint on the ecological and evolutionary trajectories taken by island lizards.",,"CASE, TJ (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,DEPT BIOL C016,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.",,,,,,,46,46,47,0,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0169-5347,,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

We examined interactions between an omnivorous shrimp and a grazing mayfly, two co-dominant taxa found in Puerto Rican headwater streams, to assess how predator presence may influence mayfly resource use and instantaneous growth in a tropical rainforest ecosystem. We conducted a series of behavioral and growth experiments to determine the effects of the freshwater shrimp, Xiphocaris elongata, on the growth rate and resource selection of mayfly nymphs in the family Leptophlebiidae. For resource choice assessments, we conducted a series of five day laboratory experiments where mayflies were given access to two resource substrate choices (cobble vs. leaves) in the presence or absence of shrimp. To assess for the effects of shrimp on mayfly fitness, we measured mayfly growth in laboratory aquaria after five days using four treatments (cobble, leaves, cobble + leaves, no resource) in the presence or absence of shrimp. In resource choice experiments, mayflies showed preference for cobble over leaf substrata (p<0.05) regardless of the presence of shrimps, however, the preference for cobble was significantly greater when shrimp were present in the leaf habitat. In growth experiments, there were no statistical differences in mayfly growth in the presence or absence of shrimp (p=0.07). However, we measured increased mayfly nymph growth in the absence of predators and when both cobble and leaves were available. Our results suggest that interspecific interactions between these taxa could potentially influence organic matter resource dynamics (e.g., leaf litter processing and export) in Puerto Rican streams.","[Macias, Nicholas A.] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Biol Sci, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Macias, Nicholas A.; Colon-Gaud, Checo; Duggins, Jonathan W.] Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Duggins, Jonathan W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Math & Stat, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Ramirez, Alonso] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Environm Sci, San Juan, PR 00931 USA","Macias, NA (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Sacramento, Biol Sci, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",nm01510@georgiasouthern.edu; jccolongaud@georgiasouthern.edu; dugginsj@uncw.edu; aramirez@ramirezlab.net,,,"Research Experiences for Undergraduates Summer Internship in Ecology and Evolution (National Science Foundation Division of Biological Infrastructure) [0552567]; Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [NSF DBI-0905345]; Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus; El Verde Field Station in the LUQ LTER; Science Educational Equity Program at California State University Sacramento","This study was in part funded by a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Summer Internship in Ecology and Evolution awarded to N.

Mosquito larvae are their most common prey. Holes colonized naturally by predators and prey had lower densities of mosquitoes if odonates were present than if they were absent. Using artificial tree holes placed in the field, we tested the effects of odonates on their mosquito prey while controlling for the quantity and species of predator, hole volume, and nutrient input. In large and small holes with low nutrient input, odonates depressed the number of mosquitoes present and the number that survived to pupation. Increasing nutrient input (and consequently, mosquito abundance) to abnormally high levels dampened the effect of predation when odonates were relatively small. However, the predators grew faster with higher nutrients, and large larvae in all three genera reduced the number of mosquitoes surviving to pupation, even though the abundance of mosquito larvae remained high. Size-selective predation by the odonates is a likely explanation for this result; large mosquito larvae were less abundant in the predator treatment than in the controls. Because species assemblages were similar between natural and artificial tree holes, our results suggest that odonates are keystone species in tree holes on BCI, where they are the most common large predators.",,"Fincke, OM (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA,DEPT ZOOL,NORMAN,OK 73019, USA.",,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136; Yanoviak, Stephen/0000-0001-6425-1413",,,,45,79,84,2,21,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1997,112,2,,,,,244,253,,10.1007/s004420050307,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YA693,WOS:A1997YA69300015,28307577,,,,2021-09-23,

Adult females are very efficient in locating aphid infestations over a relatively long range, up to 45 m, and deposit eggs near or within aphid colonies. The predatory larvae are aphid generalists preying on several agriculturally important aphid species. The successful use of this biocontrol agent in agricultural systems depends on several biotic and abiotic factors. Among biotic factors, aphid species, plant structure, interspecific competition and intraguild predation may significantly impact the predator ' s population dynamics. Key abiotic conditions include day lengths (above a critical threshold to prevent diapause), availability of mating sites in the crop, temperature (above 15 degrees C to enable egg laying), air relative humidity (above 70%) and availability of pupation sites. Although several successes have been reported in open field crops with naturally occurring or released populations, commercial releases are primarily used in protected crops. Optimized emergence boxes combining provisioning of food sources for the adults, integration with the technological advances that occurred in the greenhouse environment lately, insights into the nutritional ecology in open field crops and exploration of the genetic variability are proposed as future directions to improve adoption and efficacy of A. aphidimyza in crop protection.

In Moorea, French Polynesia, we conducted a factorial field experiment to quantify the independent and combined effects of priority effects and habitat complexity on the strength of intraspecific competitive interactions among recently settled individuals of a coral reef fish (Thalassoma quinquevittatum: Labridae). Simultaneous arrival of focal individuals with competitors resulted in a 2.89-fold increase in survival relative to reefs where focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors (i.e., a priority effect). Increasing habitat complexity resulted in a 1.55-fold increase in survivorship when focal individuals arrived simultaneously with or before competitors. However, increasing habitat complexity did not affect the survivorship of focal individuals arriving 5 days later than competitors. Behavior observations showed that survivorship was negatively correlated with aggression. Aggression by prior residents towards focal individuals was significantly greater when focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors than when they arrived simultaneously. Increasing habitat complexity did not reduce aggression. Our results suggest that, when competitors arrive simultaneously, competitive interactions are weak and subordinates are not displaced from complex habitat; increasing habitat complexity increases survival by disrupting predation. Conversely, when competitors arrive at different times, aggression intensifies and increasing habitat complexity does not disrupt predation because competitive subordinates are excluded from habitat resources. This study demonstrates that the strength of competition can be context-dependent and may vary with the timing of competitive interactions and habitat complexity.","[Geange, Shane Wallace] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",shane.geange@vuw.ac.nz,,"Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272; Stier, Adrian/0000-0002-4704-4145","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; VUW; Fulbright-Ministry of Research, Science and Technology; New Zealand Post Graduate Study Abroad Award; Three Seas Fellowship; French American Cultural Exchange Grant; National Geographic International Ecostations Fellowships","C.

We found no evidence for a negative interspecific density dependence in individual performance in either Arctic char or brown trout. In contrast, a negative intraspecific density dependence was present, especially in Arctic char. Furthermore, large brown trout condition showed a positive response to encounter rate with Arctic char (related to the density of small Arctic char). The most parsimonious interaction module to explain the Arctic char - brown trout interaction patterns in the studied system does therefore not need to include interspecific competition.

Yet the influence of resource availability-critical for survival and reproduction-on small carnivore habitat use within these modified environments is poorly understood. We conducted camera-trap surveys within a seasonally dry tropical forest fragment (148 km(2)) in northeastern Thailand to better understand the influence resource availability has on small carnivore habitat use within fragmented areas. Species occupancy models including both habitat and resource variables were assessed across periods of high and low resource availability (fruit abundance and rodent biomass). Species with similar resource or habitat preferences may also compete when resources are low. Therefore, we tested species with shared preferences for patterns of spatial co-occurrence and temporal overlap. Fruit availability influenced the distribution of common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), while rodent biomass influenced Asiatic jackal (Canis aureus), leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), and small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), but only during annual periods of scarcity. In contrast, small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was highly selective for a specific habitat (dry dipterocarp forest) regardless of seasonal fluctuations in food availability. Occupancy increased for all species during periods of resource scarcity, with leopard cat and Asiatic jackal experiencing the greatest increases (139% and 58%, respectively). Species with shared resource and habitat preferences appeared to avoid each other, either spatially or temporally. For example, leopard cat and Asiatic jackal co-occurred spatially less than would be expected, though only when rodents were scarce. Similarly, small Indian civet and small Asian mongoose, which used the same habitat and co-occurred spatially at a rate greater than expected, were active at different times. Our results indicate that seasonal resource fluctuations and interspecific interactions strongly influence the distribution of sympatric small carnivores in a fragmented forest.

Here, we focused on two biotic interactions and examined their effect on movement of the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator: intraspecific interactions (specifically, the effect of conspecific density) and interspecific interactions with a competitor-predator, the mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta (=Nassarius obsoletus). We assessed the magnitude of the temporal variation and examined the influence of pertinent abiotic variables (lunar cycle, presence of tide pools). Despite substantial temporal variation in movement levels, density of conspecifics did not influence emigration or immigration rates of C. volutator. Mud snails negatively affected immigration of C. volutator, and this was consistent across all lunar phases. However, mud snails influenced mortality and emigration of C. volutator in a contrasting way relative to lunar phases; sometimes amphipods evaded snails and survived, but at other times did not emigrate and were killed. The presence of tide pools did not change the nature or strength of the snail-amphipod interaction. Our results further clarify the complex interactions between C. volutator and I. obsoleta and suggest that resources on the mudflat are sufficient to sustain high densities of amphipods in a density-independent manner. Further, they highlight the importance of considering multiple environmental variables when examining interspecific interactions.","[Drolet, David; Hamilton, Diana J.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada; [Drolet, David; Coffin, Michael R.

Generally, within a host species, large hosts (i. e. older instars) are considered of higher quality for parasitoid development. Studies of interspecific competition between parasitoids have considered the effect of host instar on indirect competition but its effect on interference competition remains unknown. Here, we report the first results on whether the quality of host instars might dictate the outcome of interference competition between sympatric parasitoids of the genus Aphytis (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) when they attack low-quality (second) and high-quality (third) instars of their common host Aonidiella aurantii (Hemiptera: Diaspididae). Oviposition behaviour (host acceptance and clutch size) in low-and high-quality host instars was similar for both Aphytis species in the absence of competition. When they found heterospecific parasitized hosts of high quality, Aphytis melinus laid more eggs and accepted significantly more hosts than Aphytis chrysomphali, whereas there were no significant differences in the low-quality instar. This result suggests that interference competition is mediated by host quality. However, the progeny proportion of both parasitoids in multiparasitized hosts (outcome of competition) was independent of host quality and A. melinus always emerged at higher rates. Therefore, the result of interference competition between these sympatric parasitoids was not affected by host quality and this competition will contribute to the displacement of the native A. chrysomphali by the introduced A. melinus, which has been observed in some areas of the Mediterranean basin.

Surveys of naturally breeding populations on an experimental pond site indicated that the two species often compete in the larval phase, and because both species may overwinter as larvae, interactions can occur between disparate size (year) classes. Using an additive design, I conducted field experiments manipulating densities of four species-class combinations (year I and II bullfrogs and green frogs) in the presence of low numbers of the other classes. The design permitted estimates of the effect of manipulated species/classes on different target classes and, because the latter were held constant, the effects of manipulated classes on themselves. Strong competitive effects were found within and between species/classes with one important exception. Neither class of green frogs affected small bullfrogs despite the fact that both had strong effects on large bullfrogs. Both classes of bullfrogs, however, affected both classes of green frogs. In general, smaller classes had a greater per unit biomass effect on target classes than larger classes and tolerated competitive effects better. Independent of size effects, bullfrogs appeared to be better competitors than green frogs because of other traits, presumably greater activity levels. I interpret these results in terms of a simple model of the ontogenetic scaling of foraging costs and gains. This model enables a mechanistic interpretation of the above results through the two components of competitive interactions, effect and response. Larger classes have greater per capita effects on resources, but because the gain curve is decelerating, smaller classes have greater per unit biomass effects. On the other hand, smaller classes respond less to competitors because net gain for these classes is higher of affected less by a decline in resources. I argue that to understand size-structured interactions in many taxa, we must first isolate the underlying ontogenetic or size-scaling component of competitive relations, and then add to these relations the effects of unique species traits.",,"WERNER, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT BIOL, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,66,123,127,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1994,75,1,,,,,197,213,,10.2307/1939394,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MP602,WOS:A1994MP60200019,,,,,2021-09-23,

The basic concept is straightforward: host species vary in suitability ( competence) for parasites, and disease transmission decreases when there are more incompetent hosts interacting with vectors or removing free-living stages of a parasite. However, host species also often interact with each other in other ecological ways, e. g., as competitors for resources. The net result of these simultaneous, multiple interactions ( disease dilution and resource competition) is challenging to predict. Nonetheless, we see the signature of both roles operating concurrently in a planktonic host-parasite system. We document pronounced spatiotemporal variation in the size of epidemics of a virulent fungus (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) in Midwestern U. S. lake populations of a dominant crustacean grazer ( Daphnia dentifera). We show that some of this variation is captured by changes in structure of Daphnia assemblages. Lake-years with smaller epidemics were characterized by assemblages dominated by less suitable hosts (diluters,'' D. pulicaria and D. retrocurva, whose suitabilties were determined in lab experiments and field surveys) at the start of epidemics. Furthermore, within a season, less suitable hosts increased as epidemics declined. These observations are consistent with a dilution effect. However, more detailed time series analysis ( using multivariate autoregressive models) of three intensively sampled epidemics show the signature of a likely interaction between dilution and resource competition between these Daphnia species. The net outcome of this interaction likely promoted termination of these fungal outbreaks. Should this outcome always arise in friendly competition'' systems where diluting hosts compete with more competent hosts? The answers to this question lie at a frontier of disease ecology.","[Hall, Spencer R.; Becker, Claes R.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Simonis, Joseph L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Duffy, Meghan A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Tessier, Alan J.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Environm Biol, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Caceres, Carla E.] Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Hall, SR (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",sprhall@indiana.edu,"Simonis, Juniper/AAE-2410-2019; Duffy, Meghan A/A-9376-2008; Duffy, Meghan A/E-6867-2016","Simonis, Juniper/0000-0001-9798-0460; Duffy, Meghan A/0000-0002-8142-0802","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [02-35119, 02-35039, DEB 06-13510, 06-14316]","We are grateful for the help of R.

Though many interspecific associations have been described for closely related mammals, few studies have examined the associations between mammals in different orders. The yellow mongoose (Cynictus pencillata), a carnivore, and the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a rodent, co-occur in arid and semi-arid South Africa where they share sleeping burrows, predators, a similar body size, and the capability to emit alarm calls in response to predators. To investigate enhanced predator avoidance as a potential benefit explaining the persistence of this association, we assessed individual mongoose vigilance alone and with squirrels or other mongooses, and with varying interspecific group size, using field observations. We also tested for responses to conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls in both study species using playback experiments. The proportion of time mongoose individuals spent vigilant decreased in the presence of squirrels or other mongooses and was negatively correlated with interspecific group size; a similar pattern was previously shown for conspecific groups of Cape ground squirrels. These results are predicted by both the dilution and collective detection hypotheses. In addition, hetero- and conspecific alarm calls elicited vigilance responses in both species. These results suggest that both species can benefit from the collective detection and dilution arising from their interspecific association and that this interspecific association could be mutualistic.","[Makenbach, Sarah A.; Waterman, Jane M.; Roth, James D.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Waterman, JM (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, 50 Sifton Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",Jane.Waterman@ad.umanitoba.ca,"Roth, James D/N-4178-2016",,National Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank M.

We took an experimental approach to investigate whether absence of A. carolinensis and A. sagrei from these islands results from the inability of populations to become established and whether the presence of the other species has a negative effect on population density and probability of successful colonization. We introduced propagules of five lizards of each species, either in allopatry or sympatry, on five blocks of three islands each. Populations were censused yearly using mark-recapture methods. Anolis sagrei populations thrived on almost all islands, whereas within three years, many A. carolinensis populations had gone extinct, and most others were very small. We conclude that an inability to successfully establish populations on small islands might explain the absence of A. carolinensis from these islands, but not the absence of A. sagrei. Anolis carolinensis was not more likely to become extinct on islands containing A. sagrei, but population densities of A. carolinensis were lower on islands with both species (sympatric islands) compared to allopatric islands. In addition, A. carolinensis tended to perch higher, relative to available vegetation, on sympatric islands than they did on allopatric islands. conversely, the presence of A. carolinensis had little impact on A. sagrei populations. However, inspection of population changes through time suggest that A. carolinensis may have initially had an effect on A. sagrei, but this effect decreased as A. carolinensis populations declined. The observed absence of A. sagrei from these islands may indicate that its dispersal abilities are limited relative to the frequency of devastating hurricanes.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Losos, JB (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",Losos@biodec.wustl.edu,,,,,,27,43,50,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1999,80,1,,,,,252,258,,10.2307/176994,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,157DV,WOS:000078045600019,,,,,2021-09-23,

These continuum models seem to overcome some limitations intrinsically associated to other alternative approaches based on mass balances in multiphase systems, because the crucial role played by residual stresses accompanying growth and nutrients walkway is preserved. Nevertheless, when these strategies are applied to analyze solid tumors, mass growth is usually assigned in a prescribed form that essentially copies the in vitro measured intrinsic growth rates of the cell species. As a consequence, some important cell-cell dynamics governing mass evolution and invasion rates of cancer cells, as well as their coupling with feedback mechanisms associated to in situ stresses, are inevitably lost and thus the spatial distribution and the evolution with time of the growth inside the tumor-which would be results rather than inputs- are forced to enter in the model simply as data. In order to solve this paradox, it is here proposed an enhanced multi-scale poroelastic model undergoing large deformations and embodying inelastic growth, where the net growth terms directly result from the interspecific predator-prey (Volterra/Lotka-like) competition occurring at the micro-scale level between healthy and abnormal cell species. In this way, a system of fully-coupled non-linear PDEs is derived to describe how the fight among cell species to grab the available common resources, stress field, pressure gradients, interstitial fluid flows driving nutrients and inhomogeneous growth all simultaneously interact to decide the tumor fate.

We tested this idea with a native primary parasitoid, Eretmocerus eremicus, and an exotic autoparasitoid Encarsia sophia, both attacking the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Autoparasitoids are intraguild consumers that attack and kill both the immature stages of hemipteran hosts, such as whiteflies, and heterospecific and conspecific parasitoids. In population cages on cotton plants in the field in 1997 and 1998, we introduced whiteflies and then parasitoids in a replacement design with constant total numbers of parasitoids, as follows: (1) control (whiteflies only), (2) E. eremicus only, (3) E. sophia only, and (4) both E. eremicus and E. sophia. Destructive samples of plants were taken 2, 4, and 6 wk after wasp releases, and immature whitefly and wasp stages were censused. In 1997, there were no significant differences in whitefly densities among treatments. In 1998, the control treatment densities were significantly greater than parasitoid treatments, but there was no difference among the parasitoid treatments, indicating equivalent suppression of whitefly populations by the two parasitoid species. In both years, similar patterns in parasitoid dynamics were observed. Densities of E. eremicus were significantly higher in the absence of E. sophia. In contrast, E. sophia densities were unaffected by the presence of E, eremicus. The results suggest that interference by the autoparasitoid reduced primary parasitoid density, but with no concommitant disruption of host suppression. The results support theoretical predictions that no disruption should occur when both parasitoids are equally efficient and suggest that an autoparasitoid may be as efficient as a primary parasitoid in suppressing host densities.","Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Hunter, MS (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, 410 Forbes Bldg, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",mhunter@ag.arizona.edu,"Hunter, Martha/B-7307-2012; Hunter, Martha/AAF-5288-2020","Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X; Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X",,,,46,22,31,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2002,83,5,,,,,1459,1469,,10.2307/3071957,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543YK,WOS:000175131300026,,,,,2021-09-23,

Here, we asked whether interference by the larger House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) could reduce breeding success and parental behavior in the smaller Great Tit (Parus major) following clutch completion, by experimentally allowing House Sparrows to access half of the Great Tit nest boxes. Significantly more tit pairs failed to raise young in nest boxes that House Sparrows were able to enter during their breeding period compared to those that were not able to do so, because House Sparrows usurped 77.8% of the Great Tit nests. Great Tits also increased the duration of nest defense in the presence of House Sparrows. As the outcome of interference competition may lead to breeding failure, birds should necessarily evolve ways to avoid nest competitors either by selecting nests that restrict access to their larger competitors and/or by initiating breeding earlier. Conservation efforts should be directed toward attaching a metal restrictor plate around the entrance of nest boxes to prevent woodpeckers from enlarging the entrance and larger species from entering nests.","[Goldshtein, Aya; Leshem, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Markman, Shai; Puchinsky, Maya] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, Fac Nat Sci, Oranim, Tivon, Israel; [Charter, Motti] Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, Katzrin, Israel","Charter, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, Katzrin, Israel.",chartermotti@gmail.com,"Charter, Motti/AAQ-9529-2021","Charter, Motti/0000-0003-3861-6356",Tel Aviv University; Jewish National Fund; Smollar-Winnikov Scholarship Fund,"Special thanks to Jonathan Chazan who took an active part throughout the entire study; to Shaul Aviel, Kobi Meyrom, and Shai Halevi for their advice and technical assistance; to Ori Peleg, Avi Koplovich, Mary Weber, Shir Asher, and Nati Wein for field assistance; to Israel Goldshtein and Sergio Chazan for help in building the nest boxes; and to Naomi Paz for editorial assistance.

We conducted a field removal experiment to investigate potential interactions among salamanders across the steam-woodland ecotone and to determine the effects of such interactions on community structure. We used removals of a terrestrial salamander, Plethodon cinereus, and/or several species of semi-aquatic salamanders of the genus Desmognathus to investigate potential interactions between these genera and the semi-aquatic salamander Eurycea cirrigera. Although removals did not significantly decrease numbers of P. cinereus or Desmognathus on plots, distribution of E. cirrigera shifted unexpectedly closer to streams in response to removals of P. cinereus. Eurycea cirrigera may have been responding to demographic shifts of P. cinereus, as average snout-vent length and mass of P. cinereus decreased significanfly on removal plots.

The question becomes more complex when competition occurs between size-structured populations of predators in which the nature of the interaction extends beyond exploitative competition. I conducted a field experiment examining the interactions between fingerling brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis (total length 78-101 mm), and larval spring salamanders, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (snout-vent length 35.7-62.4 mm), in an array of replicate experimental streams. Brook trout affected both the growth and survival of larval spring salamanders, reducing survival by 50% and growth by > 90% for mass and 44% for SVL. Brook trout also altered the habitat use of larval G. porphyriticus. G. porphyriticus had no effect on any of the responses of fingerling S. fontinalis. These results parallel those found in an earlier experiment on interactions between small adult brook trout and larval spring salamanders. Interactions between size-structured populations of G. porphyriticus and S. fontinalis are characterized by strong asymmetry in favor of S. fontinalis across a wide range of relative body sizes. This calls into question the mechanisms allowing continued coexistence of G. porphyriticus and S. fontinalis, and in general, the persistence of stream salamanders with predatory fish. Persistence is likely a complex function of the interactions between the life history and local demography of both G. porphyriticus and S. fontinalis, coupled with characteristics of the local environment, rather than the result of classic mechanisms of species coexistence such as niche divergence or alpha selection. Such complex mechanisms of species coexistence are likely more common in situations involving competition between size-structured populations than single factor explanations based on models of exploitative competition between competitors of fixed body sizes and life stages.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,,,,,,72,47,48,0,21,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,1995,73,2,,,,,188,198,,10.2307/3545907,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RH162,WOS:A1995RH16200006,,,,,2021-09-23,

We also investigated whether this aggressive behavior is better characterized as interference competition or attempted predation. During staged encounters in laboratory chambers, both male and female resident A. maculatum responded aggressively toward introduced P. cinereus. Direct observations and analysis of videotaped encounters showed that A. maculatum used behavior patterns more similar to those used during predation attempts than to those used in intraspecific interference competition. This aggressive biting by A. maculatum resulted in the consumption of over 9% of the P. cinereus intruders, although most (62%) of the P. cinereus escaped following these strikes.

Their ranges and dispersal rates vary across Europe, which may result from their interspecific interactions, accelerating or reducing migrations. We checked this hypothesis by testing interference competition among co-occurring invaders: Dikerogammarus villosus, D. haemobaphes and Pontogammarus robustoides. We used 140-cm long tanks (gravel substratum), divided into seven compartments. We introduced 25 residents into the outermost compartment, separated with a barrier. After 1 h, we introduced 25 intruders. After the next 1 h, we removed the barrier and the gammarids dispersed in the tank. After 4 or 20 h, we counted the gammarids in the compartments. We tested all pairwise species combinations and single-species controls. Dikerogammarus villosus displaced other species (P. robustoides only after 4 h) and reduced its own motility after 20 h in their presence. Pontogammarus robustoides stimulated the short-time migrations of D. villosus intruders and of D. haemobaphes. As P. robustoides migrated spontaneously much more than Dikerogammarus spp., its impact decreased after longer time. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes stimulated the short-time movement of P. robustoides intruders but reduced the long-time relocation of this species. In general, gammarid dispersal increased in the presence of stronger competitors (D. villosus and P. robustoides, especially residents) and decreased in response to weaker competitors (D. haemobaphes). Thus, competitive interactions may affect dispersal of invasive gammarids and contribute to the fastest spread of the weakest competitor, D. haemobaphes observed in the field, whereas the strongest species, D. villosus was the latest newcomer in many novel areas.","[Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland; [Rachalewski, Michal; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina] Univ Lodz, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Hydrobiol, Lodz, Poland","Kobak, J (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland.",jkob73@umk.pl,"Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina/E-4234-2015","Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina/0000-0003-4498-5107","National Science CentreNational Science Centre, Poland [2011/03/D/NZ8/03012, 2012/05/B/NZ8/00479]",The authors would like to thank Lukasz Jermacz and Kamil Hupalo for help in collecting animals used in the experiments.

If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant-and predator-mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem-feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore-plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti-herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.","[Ramirez, Ricardo A.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Eubanks, Micky D.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Ramirez, RA (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ricardo.ramirez@usu.edu,"Ramirez, Ricardo/AAE-8394-2021",,U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI-2008-02341],"We thank P.

There are two, nonexclusive, hypotheses typically proposed to explain the formation of social groups: increased predator vigilance and greater foraging efficiency. In mixed-species groups, these hypotheses are typically tested with species-level summary measures such as flocking propensity, the assignment of species-level roles, mean body size, and foraging and habitat characteristics. Literature syntheses make it clear that while these hypotheses are important, much about mixed-species groups remains unexplained. We suggest that we can substantially increase our understanding of the evolution and ecology of mixed-species social groups in terms of both traditional and novel hypotheses by shifting the analytical focus to bottom-up approaches common in intraspecific investigations of sociality. Bottom-up approaches to analyses of social structure treat pairwise interactions as the fundamental unit of analysis and social structure as an emergent property rather than relying on a priori assignments of species as units of association. The construction of social networks from pairwise interaction rates allows us to assess the factors that promote group formation on the basis of individuals, a more appropriate level of selection, rather than species groups. We illustrate this approach with data from mixed-species foraging assemblies in tits (Paridae), finding significant effects of dominance on social behaviour within species. This new focus allows us to address questions about active associations among heterospecifics, the role of individuals within mixed-species societies, and the role of environments, which will collectively provide a richer description of the evolution and function of mixed-species societies.

Inducible defenses are flexible responses in which predator (or competitor)-released substances stimulate potential prey organisms to transform into predator-resistant phenotypes. Induced defenses may be highly protective. Benefits however are often balanced by fitness costs such as decreased growth rates or reduced reproductive potential. Here I discuss inducible defenses in ciliates with particular attention to the hypotrich genera: Aspidisca, Euplotes, Onychodromus, Sterkiella, and an undescribed hypotrich genus. I isolated Sterkiella sp. and the undescribed genus from vernal woodland pools on Saint Anselm College campus. Experimental evidence shows that a signal-induced defensive transformation occurs in these ciliates within hours after exposure to a predator cue and results in a significant decrease in susceptibility to predation. Deployment of ciliate antipredator structures such as spines, keels, ridges and other protuberances requires a large investment of cytoskeletal elements, primarily microtubules, and incurs an evolutionary cost in the form of significantly reduced growth rates. Onychodromus quadricornutus exhibits an extraordinary degree of phenotypic plasticity. In response to different environmental conditions individuals within a clone may express one of three general phenotypes: basic, lanceolate, or giant cells. The predacious giant phenotype releases a morphogenetically active signal substance, Onychodromus-factor, that triggers defensive phenotypic transformation in both intraspecific and interspecific prey. Enzyme degradation and ultrafiltration experiments indicate that Onychodromus-factor is a peptide with a molecular weight below 10,000 Da. Conspecifics develop hypertrophied dorsal spines when exposed to Onychodromus-factor. Sterkiella cells develop two defensive dorsal keels and transform to an enlarged ovoid cell in response to Onychodromus-factor as well as inducing signals released by Stylonychia, Urostyla, and Lembadion. Field studies of two vernal pools show that defensive phenotypic transformation in Sterkiella cells coincides with the appearance of Lembadion magnum during vernal pool succession. An undescribed hypotrich genus also expresses its defended phenotype when Lembadion is present in these pools. Aspidisca turrita (Ehrenberg, 1838) Claparede and Lachmann 1858, closely resembles Aspidisca lynceus (Muller, 1773) except for the possession of a dorsal thorn-like structure. Experimental evidence shows that the dorsal thorn is a defensive structure induced by signals released by the predacious ciliates Urostyla grandis and Lembadion magnum. Thus, A. turrita and A. lynceus are alternate phenotypes of the same species. I speculate that inducing signals function in predacious ciliates as lectin-like, carbohydrate-binding adhesion proteins during prey recognition and that prey species have evolved specialized cell surface receptors that allow detection of different predator proteins. I consider consequences for both predator and prey.",,"Wicklow, BJ (corresponding author), ST ANSELM COLL,DEPT BIOL,100 ST ANSELMS DR,MANCHESTER,NH 03102, USA.",,,,,,,65,33,34,0,20,SOC PROTOZOOLOGISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",1066-5234,,,J EUKARYOT MICROBIOL,J.

The endangered Pacific pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris pacificus) is being reintroduced to parts of its former range where multiple species of native rodents have overlapping diets. The granivorous species in this foraging guild compete for seeds exploitatively and through direct interference interactions, and pocket mice are the smallest and least dominant species in the guild. Repeated aggressive interactions from resident heterospecifics could lower the chances of reintroduced pocket mice establishing burrows during the post-release settlement period. As such, temporarily reducing the density of competing species through exclusionary fencing might be an advisable reintroduction strategy, in combination with other interventions, such as predator exclusion. The presence of other members of the seed-foraging guild, however, could have a net benefit for pocket mice, if the pocket mice pilfer from the other species' seed caches more than the other species pilfer from their caches. To test the frequency of cache pilfering between species, we conducted a field experiment with fluorescent dyed seeds. Two of 10 pocket mice pilfered from heterospecifics, but only 1 of 33 heterospecifics pilfered from pocket mice. In a field-enclosure experiment, we could not conclude that any of the 4 species tested used heterospecific scent to find (or avoid) seed caches, and pocket mice were less efficient in pilfering from artificial caches, recovering fewer seeds than the larger species. We did not find strong evidence that Pacific pocket mice benefit from living in sympatry with larger, dominant species. Although further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between heterospecific density and the prevalence of cache pilfering, a conservative reintroduction approach would be to select receiver sites with low densities of known competitors to benefit pocket mice during the critical post-release establishment phase.","[Chock, Rachel Y.; Grether, Gregory F.; Shier, Debra M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 612 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Chock, Rachel Y.; Shier, Debra M.] San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, Recovery Ecol, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA","Chock, RY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 612 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Chock, RY (corresponding author), San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, Recovery Ecol, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA.",rchock@sandiegozoo.org,"Grether, Gregory F./F-6286-2011",,"United States Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and California Department of Fish and Wildlife; United States Department of Education Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need Fellowship; Los Angeles (UCLA), a UCLA Pauley Fellowship, a UCLA Chancellor's Prize; Animal Behavior Society; Center for California Conservation Science, Sea and Sage Audubon, Santa Monica Bay Audubon; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology","We thank J.

The quantification of these evolutionary forces is essential for the understanding of the coexistence of predators in light of competitive exclusion dynamics. We address this topic by investigating the ecological niche of two medium-sized troglophile spiders (Meta menardi and Pimoa graphitica). Over one year, we surveyed several populations in four subterranean sites in the Western Italian Alps, monitoring monthly their spatial and temporal dynamics and the associated physical and ecological variables. We assessed competition between the two species by means of multi regression techniques and by evaluating the intersection between their multidimensional hypervolumes. We detected a remarkable overlap between the microclimatic and trophic niche of M. menardi and P. graphitica, however, the former being larger in size resulted the best competitor in proximity of the cave entrance, causing the latter to readjust its spatial niche towards the inner part, where prey availability is scarcer (step back effect). In parallel to the slight variations in the subterranean microclimatic condition, the niche of the two species was also found to be seasonal dependent, varying over the year. With this work, we aim at providing new insights about the relationships among predators, demonstrating that energy poor environments such as caves maintain the potential for diversification of predators via niche differentiation and serve as useful models for theoretical ecological studies.

The impact of introduced non-mammalian competitors, however, is poorly understood. The house gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, is one of the most successful invasive reptiles and has been implicated in the decline of endemic geckos and other taxa on a number of tropical and subtropical islands. We investigated the patterns of niche utilization between the house gecko and endemic ornate day gecko, Phelsuma ornata, in Mauritius, two species which were not believed to compete because they had different diel activity periods. The dietary and temporal niche partitioning of the two species were examined in relation to seasonal invertebrate prey abundance for three seasons. Dietary overlap between the two species was least when prey abundance was lowest and temporal overlap in activity greatest. Exploitative competition was therefore inferred, whereby changes in dietary overlap were attributed to shifts in prey selection by the day, but not the house, gecko, which was hypothesized to deplete prey. The compensatory response of the day gecko may have been to increase its tendency for cannibalism, such that the smaller house gecko was indirectly responsible for population reduction of its larger competitor. This is the first study to show how an invasive nocturnal gecko may be affecting a predominantly diurnal species.","[Cole, Nik C.; Harris, Stephen] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England","Cole, NC (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England.",nik.cole@durrell.org,,,"Mauritian Wildlife Foundation; National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Ago-Industry, Mauritius; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust; Dulverton Trust","We thank the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, particularly Asha Poonyth and Poonam Gangaram for phenology data, and the National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Ago-Industry, Mauritius for supporting this study, Lisa Cole for assistance in the field, and Phil Baker and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments that improved the manuscript.

However, we reviewed recent studies and found that only nine of 144 cases are strong examples that have ruled out alternative explanations for an ECD-like pattern. We suggest that the rise in esteem of ECD has outpaced available data and that more complete, rather than simply more, case studies are needed.

When unequal competitors are involved, the dominant species tends to displace the subordinate one to its less preferred habitat. Here, we use habitat isodars, an approach which reflects evolutionary stable strategies of habitat selection, to evaluate whether interspecific competition between two competing species with distinct habitat preferences, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax and the great bustard Otis tarda, modulates their habitat use. Field data on these endangered species demonstrate that unequal competitors can coexist without completely segregating on their preferred habitats. The negatively sloped isodar of the subordinate little bustard unveils its competition with the dominant great bustard. Interference from great bustards in secondary cereal habitats reinforces use of preferred natural habitat by little bustards. Studies of density-dependent habitat selection by a single-species can thus aid in identifying the effects of competition on community composition, and guide the conservation of at-risk species. Isodars, in particular, represent a promising method to gain clear knowledge on interspecific competition for species in which experimental manipulations are not feasible.","[Tarjuelo, Rocio; Traba, Juan; Morales, Manuel B.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, C Darwin 2, ES-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Tarjuelo, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, C Darwin 2, ES-28049 Madrid, Spain.",rocio.tarjuelo@gmail.com,"Tarjuelo, Rocio/ABG-9983-2020; Traba, Juan/D-9191-2012; Morales, Manuel B./B-1448-2014","Traba, Juan/0000-0001-6326-8942; Tarjuelo Mostajo, Rocio/0000-0002-0638-1911",Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2009-13029/BOS]; network of the Madrid region REMEDINAL2 [S-2009/AMB/1783]; network of the Madrid region REMEDINAL 3CM [S2013/MAE-2719]; Aeropuerto de Ciudad Real S.A.; FPU-grantSpanish Government [AP2009-0762],Funding was provided by the Spanish Ministry of Science (CGL2009-13029/BOS); and the networks of the Madrid region REMEDINAL2 (S-2009/AMB/1783) and REMEDINAL 3CM (S2013/MAE-2719).

This experiment investigated effects of accumulated invertebrate carcasses as a resource for two competing mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes aegypti (L.) whether either species differentially benefited from accumulated carcasses, and if such a benefit affected interspecific competition. First, we measured accumulation of invertebrate carcasses in standard containers at a field site. We then used a replacement series with five different species ratios at the same total density: and varied the input of invertebrate carcasses [dead Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) ] in three levels: none, the average input from our field site, or the maximum input recorded at our field site. Survivorship, development time, and mass were measured for each mosquito species as correlates of population growth, and were used to calculate a population performance index, lambda'. There were strong positive effects of invertebrate carcass additions on all growth correlates and lambda'. Differences in performance between species were pronounced in small or no carcass additions and absent in large inputs of invertebrate carcasses, but there was little evidence that inputs of invertebrate carcasses altered the competitive advantage in this system. These results suggest that terrestrial invertebrate carcasses may be an important resource for many types of container communities, and large accumulations of dead invertebrates may: reduce resource competition between these mosquitoes. thus favoring coexistence. We propose that the total amount of resource, including accumulated invertebrate carcasses, may explain observed patterns of replacement involving these mosquitoes.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Div Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Daugherty, MP (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Div Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI044793, R01 AI044793-01, R15 AI039700-01, R01 AI44793-01, R15 AI39700-01] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI039700, R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,37,111,115,0,18,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0022-2585,,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

This was investigated in two species of ladybird predators of aphids, Harmonia axyridis and Propylea japonica. H. axyridis is known to be the stronger intraguild predator and P. japonica to be the more frequent intraguild prey in interactions of these two species. These ladybirds share aphid prey on mugworts, hibiscus, and Italian ryegrasses in fields of northern Japan but largely avoid each other on the same plant. Fecal cues of these ladybird predators were found to contribute in their assessment of predation risk from conspecific and heterospecific competitors in common habitats. Gravid females of H. axyridis reduced rates of feeding and oviposition when exposed to feces of conspecifics, but not when exposed to feces of P. japonica. In contrast, gravid females of P. japonica reduced feeding and oviposition when exposed to feces of both H. axyridis and its own species. Females of both ladybird species exhibited similar behavior in response to water extracts of feces. For P. japonica, the influence of heterospecific feces was greater than that of conspecific feces. Our results demonstrate that feces of ladybirds contain odors that have the potential to deter the feeding and oviposition activities of conspecific as well as heterospecific ladybirds. Such deterrence allows these insects to avoid predation risk. Differences in responses of the two predators are discussed.","Tripura Univ, Dept Life Sci, Agartala 799004, Tripura, India; Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan","Agarwala, BK (corresponding author), Tripura Univ, Dept Life Sci, Agartala 799004, Tripura, India.",,,"Agarwala, Basant/0000-0002-7282-8849",,,,49,66,71,0,25,KLUWER ACADEMIC/PLENUM PUBL,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0098-0331,,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

Few studies, however, have examined how variation in intra- and interspecific resource use affect trophic interactions over time within a seasonally-dynamic food web. We compared diets with respect to predator body size and predator species identity over 3 seasons by collecting stomach contents from 2028 Reticulate Sculpin (Cottus perplexus), 479 Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii), and 107 Pacific Giant Salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) in western Oregon streams. In each season, predator body size was strongly associated with dietary composition and positively related to taxonomic breadth and the size of individual prey. Intra- and interspecific diet variation changed substantially across seasons, with much greater interspecific variation in spring than in summer and autumn. Interspecific differences in foraging mode (e.g., benthic vs drift feeding) were associated with predator-specific responses to a seasonal pulse in the availability of terrestrial thrip larvae (Thysanoptera) and contributed to temporal variation in trophic niche differentiation. These findings show that the relative magnitudes of intra- and interspecific diet differentiation can change over time in systems that receive seasonal resource pulses. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of food webs and the need to incorporate sampling over relevant temporal scales to understand species interactions.","[Falke, Landon P.; Preston, Daniel L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Henderson, Jeremy S.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, 305 South Canyon City Rd East, Canyon, OR 97820 USA; [Novak, Mark] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 3029 Cordley Hall,2701 Southwest Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA","Falke, LP (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",landonfalke@gmail.com; hendejer@gmail.com; mark.novak@oregonstate.edu; daniel.preston@wisc.edu,,"Novak, Mark/0000-0002-7881-4253",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1353827]; Oregon State University; University of Wisconsin-Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education,"For assistance with data collection, we thank Anuwar Azraf, Madeleine Barrett, Alicen Billings, Andrew Branka, Clarissa Chan, Rebecca Crawford, Kila Gebeyessa, Daniel Gradison, Kurt Ingeman, Emily Hiser, Tamara Layden, Dana Moore, Elora Ormand, Arren Padgett, Zachary Randell, Kieryian Rock, Wendy Saepharn, Alex Scharfstein, Leah Sequi, Johnny Schwartz, Isaac Shepard, Jasper Shults, Samantha Sturman, Ernesto Vaca Jr, and Beatriz Werber.

This prior residence advantage persisted despite seaweed blennies having the advantage of past experience.

As crosses between two distinct genotypes, hybrids might express fitness characteristics similar to either parent species, or they might produce unique phenotypic attributes that make them more or less than either parent species. We identified a potential hybrid zone among soft corals in a backreef community on Guam, where the broadcast- spawning species Sinularia maxima and S. polydactyla co- occur. Morphological and chemical traits con. rmed the intermediate and unique status of the putative hybrid. Laboratory cross- fertilization experiments using S. maxima and S. polydactyla gametes demonstrated that barriers to hybridization are absent and that the laboratory- reared hybrids developed specific characteristics identified in adult hybrid field populations. Changes in the populations of each parent species and the hybrid were monitored over a decade. While populations of the parent species declined significantly, the hybrid population doubled in percent cover over this period. We assessed responses to abiotic ( sedimentation) and biotic ( competition and predation) factors to determine whether the two parent species or the hybrids exhibited greater. tness. While sedimentation alone could not explain the decline in field populations of the parent species, sediment effects exact a significant cost to these soft corals over narrow spatial scales. Competition between the parent and hybrid soft corals explains some of the changes in the distribution and abundance of these species through time. The extracts of S. polydactyla had no effect against congeners, whereas those of S. maxima and the hybrid caused significant tissue necrosis. Field predation was significantly lower on the hybrid than on either parent species. Laboratory feeding assays demonstrated that the extracts of the hybrid were signi. cantly more deterrent than either S. maxima or S. polydactyla. Comparisons of the bioactive metabolites from the parent species, a hybrid compound, and a semi- purified mixture indicated that the hybrid is more deterrent than either of the parent species. Our results indicate that the hybrid Sinularia maxima3polydactyla exhibits greater. tness than the parent species and suggests that hybrid vigor may have implications for coral reef resilience.","[Slattery, Marc; Kamel, Haidy N.; Ankisetty, Sridevi] Univ Mississippi, Dept Pharmacognosy, University, MS 38677 USA; [Slattery, Marc; Gochfeld, Deborah J.] Univ Mississippi, Natl Ctr Nat Prod Res, University, MS 38677 USA; [Hoover, Cindi A.] Univ Delaware, Coll Marine & Earth Sci, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Thacker, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Slattery, M (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Pharmacognosy, University, MS 38677 USA.",slattery@olemiss.edu,,,,,,152,19,20,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

However, rarely has propagule size been experimentally manipulated to examine changes in invader behaviour, and propagule longevity and success. We manipulated propagule size of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile in laboratory and field studies. Laboratory experiments involved L. humile propagules containing two queens and 10, 100, 200 or 1000 workers. Propagules were introduced into arenas containing colonies of queens and 200 workers of the competing native ant Monomorium antarcticum. The effects of food availability were investigated via treatments of only one central resource, or 10 separated resources. Field studies used similar colony sizes of L. humile, which were introduced into novel environments near an invasion front. In laboratory studies, small propagules of L. humile were quickly annihilated. Only the larger propagule size survived and killed the native ant colony in some replicates. Aggression was largely independent of food availability, but the behaviour of L. humile changed substantially with propagule size. In larger propagules, aggressive behaviour was significantly more frequent, while L. humile were much more likely to avoid conflict in smaller propagules. In field studies, however, propagule size did not influence colony persistence. Linepithema humile colonies persisted for up to 2 months, even in small propagules of 10 workers. Factors such as temperature or competitor abundance had no effect, although some colonies were decimated by M. antarcticum. Synthesis and applications. Although propagule size has been correlated with invasion success in a wide variety of taxa, our results indicate that it will have limited predictive power with species displaying behavioural plasticity. We recommend that aspects of animal behaviour be given much more consideration in attempts to model invasion success. Secondly, areas of high biodiversity are thought to offer biotic resistance to invasion via the abundance of predators and competitors. Invasive pests such as L. humile appear to modify their behaviour according to local conditions, and establishment was not related to resource availability. We cannot necessarily rely on high levels of native biodiversity to repel invasions.","[Sagata, Katayo; Lester, Philip J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand","Lester, PJ (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",phil.lester@vuw.ac.nz,"Lester, Phil/A-1296-2008","Lester, Phil/0000-0002-1801-5687",NZ Aid Scholarship,"We thank Carrone Conroy, Alex Dixson, Catherine Duthie and Megan Sarty for assistance, and John Haywood for statistical advice.

The Menge and Sutherland (MS) model of community regulation and its refinements were developed for hard-bottom habitats, but can be modified for soft-sediment systems. This 'consumer stress model' posits that mobile consumers feed ineffectively in harsh environments, and that the relative importance of physical disturbance, interspecific competition and predation varies predictably with the magnitude of recruitment, environmental conditions, productivity and trophic position. The MS model predicts that interspecific competition for a resource depends directly upon the level of recruitment, though it does not explicitly address the joint effects of recruitment and resource availability, which are important in soft-sediment communities. The model is here revised to incorporate hard-bottom and soft-sediment systems by changing the recruitment axis to a 'recruitment:resource ratio', whereby the effect of a given level of recruitment depends on resource availability. The potential utility of the revised model is illustrated in a hypothetical contrast of the effect of recruitment:resource ratios on community regulation for a mussel-dominated assemblage in hard-bottom habitats and an infaunal clam-dominated system in soft sediments.","Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","Seitz, RD (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",seitz@vims.edu,,,,,,110,10,10,1,4,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

By allowing coevolution both within and between trophic levels the model breaks the traditional dichotomy between coevolution among competitors and coevolution between a prey and its predator. By allowing the diversity of prey and predator species to emerge as a property of the evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS), the model breaks another constraint of most approaches to coevolution that consider as fixed the number of coevolving species. The number of species comprising the ESS is influenced by a parameter that determines the predator's niche breadth. Depending upon the parameter's value the ESS may contain: 1) one prey and one predator species, 2) two prey and one predator, 3) two prey and two predators, 4) three prey and two predators, 5) three prey and three predators, etc. Evolutionarily, these different ESSs all emerge from the same model. Ecologically, however, these ESSs result in very different patterns of community organization. In some communities the predator species are ecologically keystone in that their removal results in extinctions among the prey species. In others, the removal of a predator species has no significant impact on the prey community. These varied ecological roles for the predator species contrasts sharply with the essential evolutionary role of the predators in promoting prey species diversity. The ghost of predation past in which a predator's insignificant ecological role obscures its essential evolutionary role may be a frequent property of communities of predator and prey.","UNIV ARIZONA,DEPT AEROSP & MECH ENGN,TUCSON,AZ 85721","BROWN, JS (corresponding author), UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT BIOL SCI,BOX 4348,CHICAGO,IL 60680, USA.",,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012",,,,,50,140,146,1,53,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,OCT,1992,46,5,,,,,1269,1283,,10.2307/2409936,,,15,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,JV371,WOS:A1992JV37100002,28569003,Bronze,,,2021-09-23,

To identify variations in the risk of predation, nocturnal rodents may use moonlight as a cue of risk. Moonlight avoidance behaviors have been observed in many nocturnal rodent species and are widely generalized to small mammals. However, most prior studies have been limited to 1 species or 1 study site, or occurred in modified habitats. We evaluated desert rodent activity patterns in natural habitats from 1999 to 2006 at 62 study sites across the Great Basin Desert of western North America. Rodent activity was examined by livetrapping in open habitats, using the presence of the sand-obligate kangaroo mouse (Microdipodops) as a habitat indicator. Activity patterns were assessed on 69 nights with clear skies and compared to corresponding moonlight values (moon phase and brightness) to evaluate the frequency of moonlight avoidance. Analyses of total activity of all species in the rodent assemblage relative to moonlight showed a distinct nonrandom (triangular-shaped) pattern but no significant correlations. However, individual genera of desert rodents responded differently to moonlight. Only kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) displayed significant moonlight avoidance patterns; they were maximally active at significantly different moonlight levels and avoided bright moonlight to a greater extent than co-occurring rodents. Moonlight seemed to limit the activity of kangaroo rats most strongly on bright nights during waxing moon phases and summer seasons, but not significantly during the spring or fall seasons, or during waning moons. Rather than avoiding moonlight, the activity of deer mice (Peromyscus), pocket mice (Perognathus), and kangaroo mice may be governed by changes in competition with kangaroo rats. Differences in the body size, locomotion, and space use of kangaroo rats relative to other rodents may explain why different moonlight responses were detected, especially if these traits alter how rodents perceive risk from bright moonlight. These findings indicate that moonlight avoidance may be a specialized trait of kangaroo rats rather than a general behavior of nocturnal desert rodents in the Great Basin.","[Upham, Nathan S.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Upham, Nathan S.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Zool, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Upham, Nathan S.; Hafner, John C.] Occidental Coll, Moore Lab Zool, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA; [Upham, Nathan S.; Hafner, John C.] Occidental Coll, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA","Upham, NS (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",nsupham@uchicago.edu,,"Upham, Nathan/0000-0001-5412-9342","Nevada Department of Wildlife [05-21, 8-15]; Moore Laboratory of Zoology at Occidental College; Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago; United States Department of EducationUS Department of Education [P200A090336]","Fieldwork for this project was assisted by the diligent efforts of P.

We demonstrated that interspecific competition with the exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) significantly increases the daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. The effect of intraspecific competition on the daytime activity of salmon was half that of interspecific competition. This indicates that the effect of rainbow trout was a combination of increasing density and the identity of the competitor. We also demonstrated that the effect of rainbow trout was probably the result of territorial interference between species. Moreover, we showed that water temperature simultaneously played an important role in explaining daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. During twilight, we observed no effect of competition on salmon activity, but environmental cues other than temperature (e.g., invertebrate drift, cloud cover) became significant predictors of activity. Feeding and growth rates of Atlantic salmon were not affected by the different levels of competition. Nevertheless, the exotic species may have a major impact by exposing the native species to increased risks of daytime predation.","[Blanchet, Simon; Bernatchez, Louis; Dodson, Julian J.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, CIRSA, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Blanchet, Simon; Bernatchez, Louis; Dodson, Julian J.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, QC Ocean, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Loot, Geraldine] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France","Blanchet, S (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, CIRSA, Pavillon Vachon, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",blanchet@cict.fr; julian.dodson@bio.ulaval.ca,"Blanchet, Simon/AAA-5871-2019; Blanchet, Simon/D-4850-2013; Loot, Geraldine/A-6365-2011; Blanchet, Simon/A-2313-2010","Blanchet, Simon/0000-0002-3843-589X; Blanchet, Simon/0000-0002-3843-589X; Bernatchez, Louis/0000-0002-8085-9709",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We sincerely thank J.F.

Migrants arrive at their breeding areas later than their main avian predators, European Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). We provide evidence that avian predators are a major factor modifying the breeding bird assemblage of a large field. The distribution of kestrels (hence, predation) was manipulated using nest boxes, which are the only nesting places in open farmland. We counted birds on nine 25-ha plots in which a kestrel pair bred, and on nine control areas situated >1000 m from the nearest kestrel nest in large agricultural fields during early summer 1992. We also counted birds on 15 transect lines (length 1000 m, width 100 m) radiating away from kestrel nests. Observations of the hunting behavior of breeding kestrels showed that kestrels mostly captured their prey items <1000 m from their nest. Breeding bird density was higher on control areas than on areas close to a kestrel nest. In particular, densities of migratory and small birds (body mass <140 g), which are potential prey of kestrels, were lowest near the predator nests. In contrast, the densities of nonmigratory and large-sized birds (body mass >140 g) were independent of the presence of kestrel nests. Skylarks (Alauda arvensis), the most abundant migratory species in the study area, bred less often near kestrel nests than farther away. The results of line transect counts corroborated results of area counts. Our conclusion is that predation risk influences habitat selection of small migratory species in open habitats where scarce vegetative cover gives little protection.","UNIV JYVASKYLA, DEPT BIOL, SF-40351 JYVASKYLA, FINLAND; UNIV HELSINKI, DEPT ZOOL, DIV ECOL, SF-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND; UNIV TURKU, DEPT BIOL, ECOL ZOOL LAB, SF-20500 TURKU, FINLAND",,,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Suhonen, Jukka/0000-0001-8546-8945",,,,65,84,87,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,,,,,1626,1634,,10.2307/1939623,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,WOS:A1994PE26700011,,,,,2021-09-23,

The main paradigms have shifted among the importance of competition, predation and abiotic conditions as determinants of community structure. Differential habitat selection is considered to reduce competition and hence allow co-existence. Our goal was to test hypotheses regarding how breeding site use of a population that was patchily distributed on a dynamic floodplain may facilitate coexistence: 1) do species co-occur randomly or do they occur more or less often than expected by chance? 2) Do species use the same habitat types in equal proportions or do they use them differentially? 3) If they use habitat types differentially, is this differential use related to abiotic and biotic conditions? 4) Does interspecific competition predict breeding site use or do abiotic conditions and predation risk better predict habitat use? We collected presence/absence (i.e. detection/nondetection) data of egg clutches and larvae of four pond-breeding anuran species during a two year study at a total of 353 ponds. We used site occupancy models and model averaging techniques to predict breeding site selection in relation to habitat types, abiotic and biotic factors. These parameters were corrected for imperfect detection of species. The rates of co-occurrence were consistently higher than expected by chance. Species differed in the use of the main habitat types. Habitat types that were used by multiple species were used in a species-specific manner in relation to both abiotic conditions and predation risk. Species preferred ponds where other species and fish were present. Although niche differentiation in breeding site selection is evident, our results do not support the pervasive role of competition avoidance in governing current breeding site selection. We conclude that differential habitat use and differences in response to abiotic conditionsand predation risk can override competitive interactions, thereby facilitating local co-existence and high species diversity.","[Indermaur, Lukas; Jokela, Jukka] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Indermaur, Lukas; Jokela, Jukka] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, IGB, Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, DE-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, DE-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolut Biol & Umweltwissensch, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] KARCH, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland","Indermaur, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",lukas.indermaur@eawag.ch,"Tockner, Klement/G-9265-2011; Jokela, Jukka/F-8626-2010; Schmidt, Benedikt R./B-8491-2008","Schmidt, Benedikt R./0000-0002-4023-1001; Tockner, Klement/0000-0002-0038-8151; Jokela, Jukka/0000-0002-1731-727X",MAVA Fondation pour la nature'' (Switzerland),"We are grateful to Fabienne Sutter and Simone Blaser for field data collection, and to Marc Kery and Jeff Laake for help in modelling issues.

In general, our results suggest a higher degree of spatial co-occurrence of different carnivore species than expected by chance; though it should be noted that this difference was not detectable under the conservative form of the null model. On the other hand, our data do not provide evidence for a significant degree of spatial segregation at the interspecific level. In conclusion, our results imply that antagonistic interactions, such as interspecific competition and predation, are not the dominant factors shaping spatial distribution of carnivores. Consequently, we suggest that the high degree of spatial co-occurrence might be a consequence of spatial heterogeneity in distribution of resources that are shared at the interspecific level.","[Salek, Martin; Kreisinger, Jakub] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Vertebrate Biol, CS-60365 Brno, Czech Republic; [Cervinka, Jaroslav] Univ South Bohemia, Appl Ecol Lab, Fac Agr, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Salek, Martin; Padysakova, Eliska] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Kreisinger, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, CR-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic","Salek, M (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Kvetna 8, CS-60365 Brno, Czech Republic.",martin.sali@post.cz,"Salek, Martin/AAE-9233-2019; Salek, Martin/H-6253-2011; Kreisinger, Jakub/H-4020-2011; Padysakova, Eliska/I-5146-2016","Padysakova, Eliska/0000-0003-3994-2161; Salek, Martin/0000-0003-2639-9745","Czech Ministry of EducationMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [MSMT6007665801]; Research Aim of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic [RVO: 68081766]; Grant Agency of University of South Bohemia [168/2013/P]; Research Centre [LC06073]","We are very grateful to P.

Heterospecific occupants of Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavities (cavity kleptoparasites) exacerbate the limitation of cavities. However, heterospecifics do not maintain the resin barrier, which deteriorates without upkeep. Thus, we predicted that heterospecific occupants of Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavities should suffer rates of nest predation higher than the Red-cockaded Woodpecker's. We compared the daily nest-survival rates of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker and two heterospecific occupants of its cavities, the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) and Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus), in two forests in northern Florida. Results from both forests supported the differential-predation hypothesis. Although during incubation the three species' daily nest-survival rates were similar, the primary cause of failure was hatching failure for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers but predation for the two heterospecific occupants. During the nestling stage, daily nest success was significantly higher for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers than for Red-bellied Woodpeckers or Great Crested Flycatchers and similar for the latter two species (i.e., Red-cockaded Woodpecker >> Red-bellied Woodpecker >= Great Crested Flycatcher); predators destroyed 3-6% of Red-cockaded Woodpecker nests and 21-37% of kleptoparasite nests. We hypothesize that rat snakes have an indirect positive effect on the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (increased cavity availability) by preying differentially on heterospecific occupants of its cavities.","[Kappes, John J., Jr.; Sieving, Kathryn E.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Kappes, JJ (corresponding author), Pine Woods Ecol Res, 910 N Saylor St, Southern Pines, NC 28387 USA.",jjkappes@gmail.com,"Sieving, Kathyrn E/I-6058-2013","Sieving, Kathyrn E/0000-0002-0849-8101",Florida Army National Guard at Camp Blanding Training Site; Department of Forestry at Goethe State Forest; U.

Gradients in competition and predation that regulate communities should guide biogenic habitat restoration, while restoration ecology provides opportunities to address fundamental questions regarding food web dynamics via large-scale field manipulations. 2. We restored oyster reefs across an aerial exposure gradient (shallow-subtidal-to-mid-intertidal) to explore how vertical gradients in natural settlement, growth and interspecific interactions affected the trajectory of man-made shellfish reefs. 3. We recorded nearly an order-of-magnitude higher oyster settlement on the deepest (subtidal) reefs, but within a year abundance patterns reversed, and oyster densities were ultimately highest on the shallowest (intertidal) reefs by over an order-of-magnitude. 4. This reversal was due to (i) significantly elevated survivorship on intertidal reefs and (ii) larger surviving oysters on intertidal reefs. These patterns are likely to have developed from greater levels of biofouling and predator abundance (e.g. stone crabs, gastropods) on deeper reefs where aerial exposure was <5% of the monthly tidal cycle. 5. Synthesis and applications. The success of restoration initiatives involving habitat-forming species can be enhanced by accounting for the biotic interactions that regulate population fitness. In littoral systems, vertical gradients in predation, competition and disturbance can be exploited to guide restoration of vegetated (e.g. mangrove, seagrass) or biogenic reef habitats. In particular, our results demonstrate that paradigms of vertical zonation learned from the rocky intertidal and saltmarshes also describe the fate of restored shellfish reefs. As with rocky shores, the lower vertical limit of adult oyster distribution in our study system was most likely driven by predatory and competitive (i.e. smothering) interactions, with a threshold depth at c. 5% daily aerial exposure. Below this depth, experimentally restored reefs failed completely. As with Spartina saltmarsh, accumulation of oyster biomass was greatest at an intermediate vertical position relative to mean sea level (i.e. mid-to-low intertidal). Our developing model proscribes a vertical 'hot spot' for restoration efforts to maximize biogenic reef fitness and production.","[Fodrie, F.

Congeneric species that overlap in geographic distribution provide an excellent opportunity to explore the mechanisms of coexistence. Two monitor lizards, Varanus gouldii and V. rosenbergi (Varanidae), are sympatric at a local scale in the northern Jarrah Forest of Western Australia. Both species are wide-ranging terrestrial predators of a similar size and may differentiate their ecological niche by utilizing alternative foraging strategies resulting in dietary separation. Because varanid lizards are an important group of terrestrial high-order predators in the Old World, any such separation may have important implications for faunal community structure. In total, 169 scat and stomach samples were analyzed revealing extensive dietary overlap between the species. Dietary intake was not distinguishable between species or related to individual body size. Invertebrates were most important in terms of frequency and volume, although reptiles, mammals and birds were also commonly identified. Dietary partitioning is not the mechanism allowing these congeneric varanid lizards to coexist.","[Sutherland, Duncan R.] Dept Environm & Conservat, Dwellingup, WA 6213, Australia; [Sutherland, Duncan R.] Invas Anim Cooperat Res Ctr, Dwellingup, WA 6213, Australia","Sutherland, DR (corresponding author), Phillip Isl Nat Pk, Res Dept, POB 97, Cowes, Vic 3922, Australia.",dsutherland@penguins.org.au,"Sutherland, Duncan/E-7763-2011","Sutherland, Duncan/0000-0003-0893-4425","Invasive Animals Cooperative Research CentreAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme","Special thanks to J.

(Diptera: Culicidae) may affect the resulting adult densities and, hence, the risk of malaria. We investigated the impact of the presence of a fourth-instar larva (An. gambiae Giles s.s. or An. arabiensis Patton), the quantity of food, and the available space on the survival and development of freshly hatched larvae of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis. To analyse the results, two proportional hazard models were constructed. The first estimated the effects of all covariates on mortality rate and the second estimated the effects of the covariates on development rate into the third larval instar (L3). A time-dependent covariate for density, which changed during the experiment as a result of death or development to L3, was included in both models. In the presence of a fourth-instar larva (L4), survival of the experimental larvae was significantly reduced, but no difference was detected between the presence of L4 An. gambiae and L4 An. arabiensis. The observation that the majority of dead larvae were not recovered in trays with an L4 present suggested that cannibalism and predation occurred readily. Limitation in space significantly increased mortality of larvae, whereas a limitation of food reduced larval development rate, but did not cause mortality per se. From this, we concluded that both cannibalism and predation were enhanced as a result of more frequent interactions within smaller environments, but did not occur for reasons of food shortage. This study shows that inter- and intraspecific interactions among larvae of the An. gambiae complex strongly affect survival and development, and that the quantity of food and the available space are important determinants of the outcome of these interactions. Implications of the results are discussed with respect to the population dynamics of both malaria vectors in the field.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Entomol Lab, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AC Wageningen, Netherlands","Koenraadt, CJM (corresponding author), AFRIMS Entomol Lab, 2 Soi 15,Rachdamnoen Rd 1, Kamphaeng Phet 62000, Thailand.",cjmkoenraadt@ucdavis.edu,,"Koenraadt, Constantianus/0000-0001-7861-8781; Hemerik, Lia/0000-0002-6892-2840",,,,47,39,40,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

These detrimental nontarget effects motivate the use of alternative pest management strategies such as host plant resistance and intercropping. However, when alternative pest management strategies effectively suppress primary pests, they also have the potential to promote secondary pest populations via competitive release. The potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae) is a key pest of alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant cultivars are being widely adopted by growers in the Midwest and Northeast United States. We conducted a field experiment comparing leafhopper-susceptible alfalfa, leafhopper-resistant alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant alfalfa intercropped with orchardgrass. Leafhopper-resistant alfalfa reduced potato leafhopper abundance and protected the crop from protein loss, but there was no benefit of intercropping leafhopper-resistant alfalfa with orchardgrass. Importantly, the abundance of a secondary pest, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), was twice as high in the leafhopper-resistant plant treatments compared to the leafhopper-susceptible treatment. Field sampling and microcosm experiments confirmed that the increase in pea aphids was caused, at least in part, by release from competition with leafhoppers. These results suggest that, when host plant resistance against insects is employed, efforts to monitor and manage secondary pest populations are warranted.","[Straub, Cory S.] Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA; [Faselt, Jamie A.] AmeriCorps VISTA, Glacier Natl Pk,POB 125, East Glacier, MT 59343 USA; [Keyser, Erich S.] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Traugott, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Mt Agr Res, Technikerstr 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Straub, CS (corresponding author), Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA.",cstraub@ursinus.edu,,"Straub, Cory/0000-0002-2776-1817",AFRI-USDA-NIFA [2013-02482]; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank Matthew Wismer of Northern Star Farm for planting and managing the field experiment and Mark Sulc for advice on establishing the experimental plots.

We conducted an outdoor artificial pool experiment to assess the individual and interactive effects of a predator (Anax imperator) and controphic species (primarily Daphnia magna) on larval populations of two common mosquitoes, Culex pipiens and Culiseta longiareolata. Controphic species did not significantly affect survival to pupation of C. pipiens but did increase time to metamorphosis and reduce size at metamorphosis. Culex pipiens and D. magna, both primarily filter feeders, probably compete for food resources. Controphic species caused a small reduction (21.9%) in C. longiareolata survival, an unexpected result given that C. longiareolata larvae are thought to be primarily periphyton grazers while D. magna is a filter feeder. Controphic species did not affect C. longareolata time to, or size at, pupation. Anax imperator reduced C. longiareolata survival to pupation (78%) and size at pupation (11.5%) while increasing development time in males only (11.3%). Anax imperator caused a smaller (32.4%), but statistically significant, reduction in the number of C. pipiens surviving to the pupal stage but did not significantly affect size at or time to pupation. The predator did not reduce controphic species densities, and controphic species did not result in increased predator growth. We predicted that controphic species, by serving as competitors, would result in fewer C. pipiens surviving to pupation in the absence of predators. In the presence of the predator, the negative competitive effect of controphic species would be attenuated by the positive effect of serving as alternative prey. Our results followed this pattern although the predator X controphic species interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.157). Because previous studies showed that D. magna did not affect predation rates by A. imperator on C. longiareolata larvae, and because controphic species did not have a strong competitive effect, we did not predict and did not find a predator X controphic species interactive effect.","Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biol, Ctr Biol Control, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",leon@research.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,76,44,47,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

These two species co-occur over much of northern North America and exhibit changing patterns of between-habitat distribution and abundance in western Canada. In our experiments, adult survival of P. adstrictus was ca. 35% lower in the presence of the larger-bodied P. melanarius. Because starvation of individually isolated beetles did not elevate mortality for either species, we conclude that predation, and not interspecific competition for food, was responsible for reduced survival of P. adstrictus in the mixed-species trials. Although beetle survival was not affected by reduced food, gravid P. melanarius lost mass when food was limited and showed potential increased egg production with increased food. Larvae of both species had high survivorship when held alone, but predation by both conspecific and heterospecific adults significantly reduced larval survival. All of these effects occurred in the presence of suitable alternative food but many were exacerbated when food levels were lowered experimentally. We conclude that intraguild predation and interspecific competition for food could reduce survival and reproductive potential, thus affecting the population dynamics of these two species in nature.","UNIV ALBERTA, DEPT BIOL SCI, EDMONTON, AB T6G 2E9, CANADA",,,,,,,,47,43,47,0,23,COLEOPTERISTS SOC,ATHENS,"UNIV GEORGIA, 413 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES BUILDING, ATHENS, GA 30602-2603 USA",0010-065X,1938-4394,,COLEOPTS BULL,Coleopt.

However, how interspecific differences in defence ability affect habitat partitioning amongst competing prey species remains unresolved. We examined how prey defences affect species distribution in a natural ecosystem: the aquatic food web within Neotropical bromeliads. We first related differences in prey (mosquito) density to the presence and absence of predatory damselfly larvae. We then quantified behavioural responses to predators in the two most abundant mosquito species, and the effects of these behaviours on predator consumption rates. In the absence of damselflies, Wyeomyia was the most abundant mosquito genus in natural bromeliads. However, Wyeomyia numbers were reduced in the presence of damselflies. Numbers of the genus Culex increased with bromeliad size irrespective of the presence of damselflies. As a result of the differing effects of plant size and damselflies on the two genera of mosquito larvae, Culex were more numerous in large bromeliads containing damselflies. The most abundant Culex species, Culex jenningsi, had two kinds of behavioural defences: reduced movement and increased time at the water surface. These defences reduced damselfly attack rate on C.jenningsi, but not handling time. Consequently, consumption rate was reduced at all but the highest prey densities, altering the damselfly's functional response. Inducible defences were not seen in the most abundant Wyeomyia species, Wyeomyia abebela, and pre-exposure to predation risk did not reduce predation on this species. Inducible behavioural defences, and the associated reductions in predation rate, evidently allow C.jenningsi to coexist with predators at a higher density than W.abebela. As predation risk is non-randomly distributed amongst bromeliads, divergence between mosquito species in their response to predation may contribute to the coexistence of a number of mosquito species across the landscape.","[Hammill, Edd; Corvalan, Paloma; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Hammill, Edd; Corvalan, Paloma; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Atwood, Trisha B.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Atwood, Trisha B.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Corvalan, Paloma] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","Hammill, E (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Cnr Harris & Thomas St, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",edd_hammill@hotmail.com,,"Corvalan, Paloma/0000-0001-8932-4017",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"The authors would like to thank Jose Mario Moraga Rios and Sarah and Trevor Amundrud for invaluable help in the field.

FC and FS abilities to survive were determined by field sampling and experimental treatments of laboratory stream models. The effects of interspecific competition, antagonism, and predation on FC and FS survivals were determined using recirculating models that contained either untreated drain water and sediment, cycloheximide-treated drain sediment, or autoclaved drain water and sediment seeded with drain isolates of FC and FS. Storm drain sediment FC and FS counts were stable at 10(5)/100 ml during dry weather (4-6 days), with little or no bacterial supplementation from the water (10(1)-10(2)/100 ml). Untreated (control) model FC and FS populations stabilized at 10(3)/100 ml for 7-9 days. In cycloheximide-treated models, FS and FC survived at 10(4) and 10(5)/100 ml, respectively. In autoclaved-seeded models, FS and FC initial counts of 10(4)/100 ml increased to and stabilized at 10(7)-10(9)/100 ml. Separate storm drain sediments serve as reservoirs of high concentrations of FC and FS during warm, dry weather periods. FC exhibited some ability to multiply in drain sediment. Native microfloral competition/antagonism (including bacterial predation) and protozoan predation are major biotic factors influencing FC and FS survivals. During warm, dry weather periods, abiotic factors were generally stable and had minimal affects on FC and FS survivals.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH PUBL HLTH,DEPT ENVIRONM & IND HLTH,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",,,,,,,,62,67,69,1,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0043-1354,,,WATER RES,Water Res.,SEP,1991,25,9,,,,,1089,1098,,10.1016/0043-1354(91)90202-2,,,10,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GF854,WOS:A1991GF85400008,,Green Published,,,2021-09-23,

Focal individuals were observed alone and in pairs with conspecifics and allospecifics at four prey (Baetis bicaudatus, Baetidae, Ephemeroptera) densities to determine whether competitors and prey resource levels affected prey capture rates. Presence of conspecific or allospecific competitors reduced stonefly prey capture rates, especially for Kogotus, the smaller of the two species, due to a significant decline in predator-prey encounter rates with competitors present. This competitive effect was not observed at the lowest and highest prey densities due to very low or very high predator-prey encounter rates, respectively. Thus, interference affected feeding rates only at intermediate prey densities. Competitors had no effect on the probability of attacks per prey encounter or capture success per attack. Within each stonefly species the effects of intra- and interspecific interference on feeding rates were similar, even though behavioral responses by both stoneflies to interspecific encounters were more frequent than to encounters with conspecifics. Kogotus showed the highest levels of response to encounters with other stone-flies, maintaining those high levels of response to Megarcys over all prey densities. Further, male Kogotus, which are the smaller sex, responded more frequently to competitive interactions than did females. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that interspecific interference was asymmetrical with Megarcys, the larger species, being the superior competitor.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA","PECKARSKY, BL (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,51,49,50,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,85,4,,,,,521,529,,10.1007/BF00323764,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY036,WOS:A1991EY03600009,28312499,,,,2021-09-23,

Competition is reduced by specializing on different prey and/or spatio-temporal separation, usually leading to different food habits. We predicted that two closely related species of large cats, the endangered snow leopard and the near-threatened common leopard, living in sympatry, would coexist through habitat separation and exploitation of different prey species. In central Himalaya, we assessed (2006-2010) habitat and diet overlap between these carnivores. The snow leopard used grassland and shrubland, whereas the common leopard selected forest. Contrary to our prediction, snow leopard and common leopard preyed upon similar wild (Himalayan tahr, musk deer) and domestic species (Bos spp., dogs). Dietary overlap between snow leopard and common leopard was 69% (yearly), 76% (colder months) and 60% (warmer months). Thus, habitat separation should be the result of other factors, most likely avoidance of interspecific aggression. Habitat separation may not always lead to the use of different prey. Avoidance of interspecific aggression, rather than exploitation of different resources, could allow the coexistence of potentially competing large predators.","[Lovari, S.; Minder, I.; Ferretti, F.; Pellizzi, B.] Ev K2 CNR, Bergamo, Italy; [Lovari, S.; Minder, I.; Ferretti, F.; Pellizzi, B.] Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Lovari, S.; Minder, I.; Ferretti, F.] Univ Siena, Biodivers & Conservat Network, BIOCONNET, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Mucci, N.; Randi, E.] ISPRA, Ozzano Dell Emilia, BO, Italy","Lovari, S (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",lovari@unisi.it,"; Preatoni, Damiano/A-8621-2010","LOVARI, Sandro/0000-0002-9945-0268; Preatoni, Damiano/0000-0001-8760-1316; Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0002-0414-1615","Project SHARE (Ev-K2-CNR, Italy); Italian Ministry of Foreign AffairsMinistry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Italy)","We are grateful to National Academy of Sciences and Technology and especially to A.

Both fish species fed on Daphnia pulex in 1980 and growth was rapid; prey biomass per gram of fish was 2-12 times higher for white perch than for yellow perch. In 1987, white perch consumed up to three times more prey biomass than yellow perch, but the subsequent disappearance of D. pulex caused both fish species to switch to macroinvertebrates and growth of both species declined. Between 1977 and 1987, mean weights and specific growth rates of white perch exceeded yellow perch by October in all years, and weights of white perch were closely tied to the density of D. pulex in late summer-early fall (Spearman's rank correlation = 0.58, P = 0.07). Diet overlap for age-0 white and yellow perch was high when D. pulex was present, and the potential for interspecific competition was greatest when these fish were similar in length. Because of a prolonged spawning period, age-0 white perch had a wide range in lengths, which enabled them to feed on a broad size range of prey. As a result, predation on D. pulex by white perch was exerted over a wider size range than was exerted by yellow perch. Such circumstances may allow daphnids to persist when age-0 white perch are abundant. Consequently, competitive interactions between young white and yellow perch appear to be assymmetric, because the ability of large cohorts of yellow perch to collapse Daphnia pulex populations has greater effect on white perch growth than large cohorts of white perch have on yellow perch growth.","CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NAT RESOURCES, BIOL FIELD STN, 900 SHACKELTON POINT RD, BRIDGEPORT, NY 13030 USA",,,,,,,,33,57,58,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

This has prompted research into the potential density enhancement of juvenile lobsters with 'casitas', large (1.1 m(2) surface area) but low-lying (3.8 cm entrance height) artificial shelters that exclude large predators. Moray eels (Muraenidae), however, fit into casitas and could therefore pose a threat to lobster enhancement. In a shelter-poor reef lagoon, we examined potential interactions between juvenile lobsters and the locally dominant morays Gymnothorax vicinus and G. moringa in the absence (four 1 ha control sites) and presence of casitas (five 1 ha 'casita sites', each with 10 casitas), before (6 surveys) and after (22 surveys) deployment. Morays and lobsters did not interact as predator-prey, as morays neither consumed nor intimidated co-occurring lobsters. Rather, the 2 taxa appeared to compete for limited shelter on the reef lagoon, as suggested by a significant increase in density and mean size of both taxa on casita sites after deployment. Casitas significantly increased cohabitation of morays and lobsters, yet they tended to co-occur less often than expected by chance, but this result likely reflects behavioral differences between the highly gregarious, more numerous lobsters and the typically solitary, cannibalistic morays. Our study exemplifies the influence of habitat complexity on the nature of interspecific interactions and shows that G. vicinus and G. moringa would not pose a threat to lobster enhancement with casitas.","[Lozano-Alvarez, E.; Briones-Fourzan, P.; Alvarez-Filip, L.; Negrete-Soto, F.; Barradas-Ortiz, C.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Cancun 77500, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Weiss, H.

In this set of field experiments, we evaluated the interactive, dynamic effects of limited food supply and predation from wolf spiders (Lycosidae) on mortality in Ageneotettix deorum, a common grasshopper (Acrididae) from North American sandhills grasslands. We attempted to determine whether the combined effects of food availability and spider predation on mortality were (1) noncompensatory, with the effects of each factor summing to determine ultimate population size, or (2) compensatory, where the effect of one mortality factor alters the impact of subsequent factors so that the ultimate population size changes little, despite variation in specific sources of mortality. We also investigated whether changes in nutritional quality encountered by grasshoppers would result in different dynamic responses to predation in the context of noncompensatory vs. compensatory responses. Both food availability and predation risk contributed to mortality rates. Individuals of A. deorum were food limited. Survival of grasshoppers feeding on fertilized plants was 50% higher than that of grasshoppers feeding on unfertilized plants over a 31-d period. Most of the mortality due to limited food occurred 12-14 d into the experiment. Predation from lycosid spiders decreased the numbers of individuals by 49% in the first 10-15 days of the experiment. Either noncompensatory or compensatory responses resulted from the combined effects of food availability and predation on population size, depending upon the nutritional status of host plants. At ambient-level food quality (no fertilizer), spider predation and food limitation were compensatory; the same numbers of grasshoppers were recovered in treatments with and without spider-predation risk after 31 d. However, with higher food quality (N fertilizer), spider predation reduced the numbers of surviving individuals as compared with the no-spider-predation treatment, a noncompensatory response. In separate, preplanned experiments, individuals surviving spider-predation treatments lived longer than did individuals protected from spider predation when they were caged individually over vegetation of ambient quality. Combined, these experiments emphasize the importance of food quality as a determinant of how this predator-prey system responds, and the results suggest a mechanism underlying the response. After predation, survivors are likely to encounter more food per capita and to exhibit higher individual quality, which promotes longevity, presumably from reduced competition. This leads to a compensatory response. Under high food quality regimes, predation and food probably act in a noncompensatory fashion because grasshoppers are less food limited, and the release of additional food on a per capita basis by predation has less effect on the subsequent number of survivors.","Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Joern, A (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",,,,,,,101,46,50,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2000,81,1,,,,,66,77,,10.2307/177134,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,277BT,WOS:000084913400007,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-23,

This study assessed the importance of anthropogenic foods to the diets of red foxes and arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus (L., 1758)), and competition for food resources between the two species in Prudhoe Bay. We used stable isotope analysis of fox tissues to infer diet during summer and winter for both red and arctic foxes, and lifetime diet for red fox. While the contribution of anthropogenic foods in late summer for both species' diets was low (similar to 10% to 15%), the contribution in late winter was higher and varied between species (red foxes = 49%; arctic foxes = 39%). Estimates of lifetime diet in red foxes suggest consistent use of anthropogenic foods. We found moderate overlap of fox diets, although red foxes appeared to be more specialized on lemmings, whereas arctic foxes had a more diverse diet. Availability and consumption of anthropogenic foods by red foxes, particularly in winter, may partially explain their year-round presence in Prudhoe Bay.","[Savory, G. A.; Hunter, C.

Competition has historically been viewed as the predominant process affecting plant community structure. In particular, it is often assumed that the dominant resident species is the superior competitor and therefore has large impacts on plant community diversity. This assumption, however, is seldom tested. As well, there are a variety of other processes such as dispersal limitation and seed predation that can influence community structure, although the relative importance of these processes in relation to competition from resident species is still unclear. 2. We examined how interspecific competition, dispersal limitation and post-dispersal seed predation by mice individually and interactively influenced the richness and diversity of local plant assemblages in grasslands of western Montana. 3. We added seeds of 20 mostly locally uncommon native species to subplots in and out of larger rodent exclosure plots. Using a 'species-blind' approach, we manipulated competition from resident plants in these subplots by removing the same amount of cover of one dominant species or several common species. 4. The species richness and diversity of local assemblages was higher in subplots with seed addition than without. Across all levels of the other treatments, average richness for subplots without competitor removal was lower than for competitor removal treatments. However, the removal of one locally dominant species had similar effects to removal of several common species. In contrast, preventing seed predation by mice did not have significant effects on richness. There were no significant interactions between the treatments. 5. Synthesis. Our results reveal a hierarchy of filters that determine local community structure. Many regionally rare species were dispersal limited and established after the seed addition, regardless of release from competition or the presence of seed predators. Subsequently, we found competitive equivalence between dominant and common species.","[Pinto, Sarah M.; Pearson, Dean E.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, Missoula, MT 59801 USA","Pinto, SM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",sarahmariannepinto@gmail.com,,,USDA Cooperative State ResearchUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-35101-16040]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0614406]; U.S. Bureau of Land Management,"We thank Ray Callaway, Winsor Lowe, Lisa Eby and Yvette Ortega for their extensive guidance and feedback.

H. spinosa reproductive output increased threefold promptly when ungulates were excluded, although in the third year Timarcha be.-an to have effects on shrub reproduction. Ungulates affected weevils both by exploitative competition and by incidental predation, with the total number of weevils emerging per shrub being more than fourfold higher in shrubs excluded from these mammals than in shrubs open to them. In addition. during the last year. the abundance of weevils was also affected by Timarcha removal. Our study demonstrated that phytophagous insects can compete with other herbivores highly dissimilar in size, ecology, and taxonomy, such as ungulates. These interactions usually produce asymmetrical results. sometimes closer to amensalism or predation than to pure competition.","Univ Granada, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Gomez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",,"Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017; Megias, Adela Gonzalez/P-8974-2016","Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664; Megias, Adela Gonzalez/0000-0002-2292-9334",,,,71,52,56,0,31,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2002,83,1,,,,,203,211,,10.2307/2680132,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,508YQ,WOS:000173117700018,,,,,2021-09-23,

Antibiosis can occur through the release of plant chemicals from the roots into the soil, which malt adversely affect the host-finding behavior of the infective stage nematode, or the presence of these chemicals in the host insect may negatively affect nematode reproduction. In laboratory studies, intra-specific and inter-specific competition reduces nematode fitness, and inter-specific competition can cause local extinction of a nematode species. For example, after concomitant infection of a host, a steinernematid species usually excludes a heterorhabditid species. The mechanism for the steinernematid superiority has been postulated to be a bacteriocin(s) produced by Xenorhabdus, the symbiotic bacterium of the steinernematid which prevents Photorhabdus, the symbiotic bacterium of the heterorhabditid, from multiplying. Inter-specific competition between two steinernematid species shows that both can co-exist in a host, but one species will eventually prevail in the environment. By having different foraging strategies, however, both steinermatid species may co-exist in the same habitat. An important issue is whether the introduction of an exotic entomopathogenic nematode species will competitively displace an indigenous nematode species. Although the environmental risks are small, the recommended policy is that the introduction of exotic nematodes be regulated With other pathogens, entomopathogenic nematodes can out-compete entomopathogenic fungi, but not Bacillus thuringiensis, for the same host individual when both the nematode and entomopathogen are applied simultaneously. The best studied natural enemy is the nemnrophagous fungus, Hirsutella rhossiliensis, which causes higher mortality in Steinernema glaseri compared with Heterorhabditis bacteriorphora. Differential susceptibility to the fungus may be associated with the retention of the second-stage cuticle by H. bacteriophora. Invertebrate predators including mites and collembolans feed on entomopathogenic nematodes. Although a number of studies have been conducted with antagonists, there is a dearth of field data. We suggest that long-term research plots be established where natural populations of entomopathogenic nematodes occur and include antagonists as a component of such studies.",,"Kaya, HK (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT NEMATOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,101,86,88,3,35,CARFAX PUBL CO,ABINGDON,"PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE",0958-3157,,,BIOCONTROL SCI TECHN,Biocontrol Sci.

In this study, we compared the sensory physiology and behavior of three native species-slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus, spoonhead sculpin C. ricei. and logperch Percina caprodes-with those of the round goby to determine the mechanisms that allow the round goby to dominate native fish. The reaction and strike distances of the four species were examined during predator-prey trials using natural amphipod prey Gammarus spp. under varying light intensities (0-130 lx) to compare input from the mechanosensory lateral line and Visual systems. Trials in the dark (0 lx) indicated that the sculpins and the round goby had similar lateral line sensitivity. However, all three native species had a significant advantage in reaction and strike distance over the round goby at higher light intensities, Interspecific resource competition was assessed by pairing a round goby with a native fish in an artificial stream. Round gobies gained significantly more weight than the native fishes during all trials. Slimy sculpins were able to maintain their weight in the presence of the round goby: however. spoonhead sculpins and logperch lost a significant amount of Weight during the trials. These experiments indicate that although the round goby does not possess an inherent sensory advantage. it can dominate resources and outcompete native fish. Thus, round gobies may pose risks for a wide variety of native benthic fishes.","[Bergstrom, Margot A.; Mensinger, Allen F.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, Duluth, MN 55812 USA","Mensinger, AF (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, 1035 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",amensing@d.umn.edu,"Schwalbe, Margot/AAV-5431-2020; Goforth, Reuben/B-1646-2010","Goforth, Reuben/0000-0001-6891-3146",Visualization and Digital Image Laboratory; Minnesota Sea Grant College U.S. Department of Commerce,"We thank Toni Hrabik, Michael Lynch, and Jamie Sloan for insightful comments on the manuscript.

However, what actually drives social affinity between species in the wild will depend on the characteristics of the species available to group. Here we first present an agent-based model that predicts trait-related survival benefits from mixed-species group formation in a multi-species community and we then test the model predictions in a community-wide field study of African savannah herbivores using multi-layered network analysis. We reveal benefits from information transfer about predators as a key determinant of mixed-species group formation, and that dilution benefits alone are not enough to explain patterns in interspecific sociality. The findings highlight the limitations of classical ecological approaches focusing only on direct trophic interactions when analysing community structure and suggest that declines in species occupying central social network positions, such as key informants, can have significant repercussions throughout communities.","[Meise, Kristine; Bro-Jorgensen, Jakob] Univ Liverpool, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Inst Integrat Biol, Neston CH64 7TE, England; [Meise, Kristine; Franks, Daniel W.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Franks, Daniel W.] Univ York, Dept Comp Sci, York YO10 5GH, N Yorkshire, England","Bro-Jorgensen, J (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Inst Integrat Biol, Neston CH64 7TE, England.",bro@liv.ac.uk,,"Franks, Daniel Wayne/0000-0002-4832-7470","Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L007185/1, NE/L007266/1]","We are grateful to the Kenyan National Commission for Science, Technology, and Innovation, the Narok County Government, the Chief Park Warden of the Masai Mara National Reserve, and the Kenya Wildlife Service for permission to conduct the fieldwork.

Juvenile C. maenas utilize rocks, shell, and other cover, and their arrival on the west coast places them in potential competition for these resources with an abundant native grapsid, H. oregonensis, Similarly, H, sanguineus use intertidal shelter on the east coast, thus placing C. maenas in possible competition with grapsids both as an invader on the west coast and as 'resident' on the east coast, having been established there for more than 150 yr. Field sampling and laboratory experiments testing competition for space between C. maenas and Hemigrapsus spp. of equal carapace width were conducted on both coasts, as were videotaped feeding trials to examine and quantify agonistic interactions between species. When competing for food (a single damaged, anchored bivalve), C. maenas dominated over H. oregonensis, while H. sanguineus were overwhelmingly dominant over C. maenas. Within-quadrat, stratified sampling of rocks and sand revealed striking differences in habitat utilization by C. maenas living in the presence or absence of Hemigrapsus, Only similar to20% of juvenile C. maenas occurred under rocks in areas occupied by either Hemigrapsus species, while north of the present distribution of H. sanguineus (in Maine) >97% of the C. maenas were found beneath rocks. This pattern was reflected in laboratory trials as well, where both species of Hemigrapsus consistently dominated in contests for shelter. Given the importance of intertidal cover for small crabs, such competitive interactions will likely affect patterns of habitat use by C. maenas on the east coast and may have important implications for the ultimate distribution and impact of this species in the northeastern Pacific.","Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Jensen, GC (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",gjensen@u.washington.edu,,,,,,77,125,130,1,99,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

A tritrophic distributed maturation time model for the coffee plant - CBB - three parasitoids (Phymastichus coffea,Cephalonomiastephanoderis, Prorops nasuta) system was proposed by Gutierrez et al. (1998). Based on this pioneering work, and improved models for coffee and CBB (Rodriguez et al., 2011, 2013), we present an updated version of the parasitoid models. The new elements in this analysis include: 1. New data on the biology and behavior of the parasitoids are added. 2. A fourth parasitoid (Cephalonomia hyalinipennis) is added to the system. 3. Interspecific competitive interactions among parasitoids (e.g., dyadic contests, intra-guild predation and hyperparasitism) and their effects on the control of CBB are explored. Because field data on the effectiveness of the parasitoids on CBB control is sparse, we assessed the efficacy of the parasitoids for control of CBB heuristically. The results are compared to prior analyses, and are related to field observations. Specifically, we found: 1. Control of CBB by betilid parasitoids (Cephalonomia stephanoderis, Cephalonomia hyalinipennis and Prorops nasuta) is ineffective because of their low reproductive capacity relative to CBB, their host-feeding behavior, and phenological mismatches with CBB life stages. 2. Of the parasitoids, the eulophid P. coffea has the greatest potential to suppress CBB infestation levels, though the fungal pathogen B. bassiana and insecticides are reported to have detrimental effects on its establishment and dynamics.

Breeding site selection may be based on previous experience, or on social information from the density and success of competitors with an earlier phenology. Variation in animal breeding phenology is often correlated with variation in habitat quality. Generally, animals breed earlier in high-quality habitats that allow them to reach a nutritional threshold required for breeding earlier or avoid nest predation. In addition, habitat quality may affect phenological overlap between species and thereby interspecific competition. Therefore, we hypothesized that competitor breeding phenology can be used as social cue by settling migrants to locate high-quality breeding sites. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally advanced and delayed hatching phenology of two resident tit species on the level of study plots and studied male and female settlement patterns of migratory pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca. The manipulations were assigned at random in two consecutive years, and treatments were swapped between years in sites that were used in both years. In both years, males settled in equal numbers across treatments, but later arriving females avoided pairing with males in delayed phenology plots. Moreover, male pairing probability declined strongly with arrival date on the breeding grounds. Our results demonstrate that competitor phenology may be used to assess habitat quality by settling migrants, but we cannot pinpoint the exact mechanism (e.g. resource quality, predation pressure or competition) that has given rise to this pattern. In addition, we show that opposing selection pressures for arrival timing may give rise to different social information availabilities between sexes. We discuss our findings in the context of climate warming, social information use and the evolution of protandry in migratory animals.","[Samplonius, Jelmer M.; Both, Christiaan] Univ Groningen, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","Samplonius, JM (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands.",jelmersamplonius@gmail.com,"Both, Christiaan/E-6459-2011; Samplonius, Jelmer M./H-6689-2019","Both, Christiaan/0000-0001-7099-9831; Samplonius, Jelmer Menno/0000-0002-8700-4041",University of Groningen,"This project was supported by the University of Groningen.

We focussed on the mechanisms by which an increase of a mutant with a higher growth rate and/or lower mortality leads to decreases in original phenotypes, with a particular emphasis on ''predator-mediated (apparent) competition''. The bacterial population was cultured together with the protozoan population over a long period of time. These were contrasted with single-species control cultures of E. coli (i.e., without predator) experiencing high density-independent mortality from continual dilution of the population, and also a population with strong density-dependent regulation arising from intraspecific competition. The long-term cultures of predator and prey revealed the following changes: predator density increased for some time after inoculation; correspondingly, the specific growth rate of prey increased, and mutants with the long-cell form (which experience low predation rate) appeared and increased in frequency in the population. Comparison of these results with results from control cultures, suggests that predator-mediated competition existed between mutants and the original types in the predator-prey system, i.e., increases in densities of mutants with higher growth rate and/or lower predation rate in the prey population enhanced the predator equilibrium density, which in turn exerted higher predation pressure on the original prey which then decreased in abundance.","TOHOKU UNIV,INST BIOL,DEPT SCI,AOBA KU,SENDAI,MIYAGI 980,JAPAN",,,,,,,,44,12,12,2,9,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1994,71,1,,,,,24,34,,10.2307/3546168,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PQ835,WOS:A1994PQ83500003,,,,,2021-09-23,

Additionally, video observations with infrared cameras were conducted at feeding sites to verify RFID data and analyze interspecific behavior. Composition of the rodent community changed during observation periods from a midday gerbil (Meriones meridianus)-dominated community to a desert hamster (P. roborovskii)-dominated community in 2009 and from a northern three-toed jerboa (Dipus sagitta)-dominated community to a hamster-dominated community in 2010. Activity pattern of hamsters was clearly affected by species composition. In the hamster-dominated community, activity started 1.7 h +/- 1.0 SD after sundown and ended 7.2 +/- 1.4 h after sundown. A similar activity pattern was found for the jerboa-dominated community. In contrast, hamsters shortened their activity tremendously in the gerbil-dominated community, to 2.2 +/- 1.3 h (activity began at 0.8 +/- 0.3 h after sundown and ended at 3.0 +/- 1.5 h after sundown). An analysis of interspecific behavior at feeding sites showed clearly that gerbil behavior was characterized by aggressive attacks (60.4% attacks versus 6.1% being attacked), whereas jerboa behavior was dominated by avoidance of direct contact (67.5% avoidance versus 22.9% attack). Hamster intraspecific behavior included all 4 elements in a similar ratio (27.3% attacks, 21.8% being attacked, 22.7% fleeing without direct contact, and 22.7% causing fleeing without direct contact).","[Scheibler, Elke; Wollnik, Franziska; Brodbeck, David; Hummel, Elisabeth] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Biol, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Yuan, Shuai; Zhang, Fu-Shun; Zhang, Xiao-Dong; Fu, He-Ping; Wu, Xiao-Dong] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm Sci, Hohhot 010019, Peoples R China","Schbbler, E (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Biol, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",elke.scheibler@bio.uni-stuttgart.de,,,Federal State of Baden-Wurttemberg under the Margarete-von-Wrangell program; European Social Fund under the Margarete-von-Wrangell program,"We thank H.

Most demonstrations of the impacts of size variation in trophic systems have focused on size variation in predator species, and the consequences of size variation in prey species are less well understood. We investigated how prey size structure shapes intra- and interspecific interactions in experiments with a gape-limited predator (larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus) and its heterospecific prey (frog tadpoles, Rana pirica). We found that large and small tadpole size groups each increased mortality in the other group by intensifying salamander predation; this type of indirect interactions is called apparent competition. The antagonistic impacts on the prey size groups were caused by different size-specific mechanisms. By consuming small tadpoles, the salamanders grew large enough to consume large tadpoles. The activity of large tadpoles, by increasing the activity of the small tadpoles, may increase the number of encounters with the predator and thus small tadpole mortality. These results suggest that the magnitude of a predator's ecological role, such as whether a top-down trophic cascade is initiated, depends on size variation in its heterospecific prey.","[Yamaguchi, Aya] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Aya; Kishida, Osamu] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan","Yamaguchi, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan.; Yamaguchi, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan.",cryamaguchi.514@gmail.com,"Kishida, Osamu/B-7970-2011",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24370004]","We are very grateful to Noboru Katayama, Kunio Takatsu, Megumi Nosaka, Tomoko Sato and Natsuko Sakai for outstanding support during our experiments.

We explored density-dependent fitness attributes and carry-over effects in Crawfish Frogs (Rana areolata) using a set of field enclosure experiments and a series of field data. Using field enclosures, we hypothesized that 1) at high densities, intraspecific competition would produce smaller Crawfish Frog juveniles that took longer to metamorphose; 2) at high densities, interspecific competition would also produce smaller Crawfish Frog juveniles that took longer to metamorphose; and 3) vertebrate (ambystomatid salamander) predation on Crawfish Frog larvae would reduce survivorship, but by releasing competition pressure would produce relatively larger tadpoles that metamorphosed earlier. Further, we hypothesized 4) that these enclosure results would apply to field data, and that fitness attributes in newly metamorphosed Crawfish Frogs would carry over to first-time breeding adults. Our results confirmed all four hypotheses. Specifically, in Crawfish Frogs, at high densities, both intra- and interspecific competition reduced size (length and mass) at metamorphosis (hypotheses 1 and 2), and predation reduced survivorship and increased size at metamorphosis (hypothesis 3). Finally, we observed density-dependent fitness effects on newly metamorphosed Crawfish Frog juvenile size (length and mass), and carry-over effects from the larval stage on juvenile survival, adult size, and breeding adult numbers (hypothesis 4). In the absence of predators, high densities of intra- and interspecific competitors had no effect on Crawfish Frog larval survivorship. We also present suggestive evidence for compensatory effects. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the patterns of these interactions, as well as the role of these relationships in informing management guidelines intended to ensure the future of this species of conservation concern.","[Stiles, Rochelle M.] San Francisco Zool Soc, 1 Zoo Rd, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Terrell, Vanessa C.

In both years, Daphnia dominated the zooplankton community in June and early July but disappeared in mid-July and early August. Age-0 yellow perch consumed primarily Daphnia and copepods until the Daphnia stocks were depleted then switched to benthic prey. Small age-0 gizzard shad primarily selected Daphnia and copepods while larger individuals consumed fewer zooplankton and more phytoplankton. Data from 1984 through 1993 indicated no direct effect of interspecific competition on growth rates of either species. The decrease in Daphnia populations in years with abundant age-0 gizzard shad occurs later in the year than in years with abundant age-0 yellow perch, and we suggest that this timing is crucial for the outcome of fish interactions. When Daphnia decline later in the season, larger age-0 yellow perch can switch to benthic prey and larger age-0 gizzard shad to phytoplankton; thus, the outcome of these interactions differs from the depression of age-0 bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) by competition from age-0 shad reported from many reservoirs.","CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NAT RESOURCES, BIOL FIELD STN, BRIDGEPORT, NY 13030 USA",,,,"Roseman, Edward/0000-0002-5315-9838",,,,37,43,43,0,8,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

In this study, we consider the importance of disturbance (salinity) and predator and competitor variables on mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in small ephemeral water bodies across the Wheatbelt of Western Australia. Similar to mosquitoes, and contrary to general perceptions, nonculicid aquatic fauna (aquatic fauna) had a common occurrence (number or percentage of water bodies occupied) and were abundant (average density) in ephemeral water bodies, albeit with a simplified trophic structure. The occurrence and density (number per unit area) of aquatic fauna between water bodies were highly variable, but general relationships of aquatic fauna with rainfall, water body surface area, salinity, and mosquitoes were apparent. In contrast to mosquitoes, the density of aquatic fauna declined with recent rainfall, implying mosquitoes may colonize newly created water bodies more quickly than aquatic fauna. Assemblages (richness and density of taxa) of aquatic fauna changed along a salinity gradient, as did mosquitoes, and this was pronounced for predator groups. Densities of mosquitoes were not limited by any single taxonomic group, by a negative relationship. However, the density and richness of mosquitoes generally declined in association with increased richness of predators and density of all other taxa (taxa not specifically classified as predators or competitors of mosquitoes). These relationships may account for higher densities of mosquitoes in smaller water bodies, where richness of predators is reduced and the density of other taxa does not differ from larger water bodies. Our results also suggest salinity in the Western Australia Wheatbelt may facilitate greater abundance of halotolerant mosquitoes, Aedes alboannulatus Macquart and Aedes camptorhynchus Thomson (a vector of Ross River virus [Togoviridae: Alphavirus]), by releasing them from biotic regulation.","[Carver, Scott] Univ Montana, Montana Tech, Dept Biol, Butte, MT 59701 USA; [Carver, Scott; Spafford, Helen; Storey, Andrew] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol M085, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Carver, Scott; Weinstein, Philip] Univ Western Australia, Sch Populat Hlth M431, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Spafford, Helen] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Plant & Environm Protect Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Weinstein, Philip] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia","Carver, S (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Tech, Dept Biol, 1300 Pk St, Butte, MT 59701 USA.",scarver@mtech.edu,"Weinstein, Phil/C-9805-2011; Carver, Scott/J-7654-2014","Carver, Scott/0000-0002-3579-7588; Weinstein, Philip/0000-0001-9860-7166",Australian Government Bureau of Rural SciencesAustralian Government; Australian and Jean Rogerson postgraduate awards; Department of Environment and Conservation,"We acknowledge the contribution of Jessica Lynas and Lisa Chandler for assistance in the laboratory and numerous volunteers that helped with all aspects of the field work.

However, blanket protection of species within a reserve may shelter nonindigenous species that are normally affected by harvesting, intensifying their impacts on native species. I studied a system of marine reserves in the San-Juan Islands, Washington, USA, to examine the extent to which marine reserves are invaded by nonindigenous species and the consequences of these invasions on native species. I surveyed three reserves and eight non-reserves to quantify the abundance of intertidal suspension-feeding clam species, three of which are regionally widespread nonindigenous species (Nuttallia obscurata, Mya arenaria, and Venerupis philippinarum). Neither total nonindigenous nor native species' abundance was significantly greater on reserves. However, the most heavily harvested species, V. philippinarum, was significantly more abundant on reserves, with the three reserves ranking highest in Venerupis biomass of all 11 sites. In contrast, a similar, harvested native species (Protothaca staminea) did not differ between reserves and non-reserves. I followed these surveys with a year-long field experiment replicated at six sites (the three reserves and three of the surveyed non-reserve sites). The experiment examined the effects of high Venerupis densities on mortality, growth, and fecundity of the confamilial Protothaca, and whether differences in predator abundance mitigate density-dependent effects. Even at densities 50% higher than measured in the field survey, Venerupis had no direct effect on itself or Protothaca; only site, predator exposure, and their interaction had significant effects. Analyses incorporating environmental variables tracked at each site indicated that crab biomass most heavily influenced clam responses, causing lower growth of both species and higher mortality of Venerupis, whose annualized loss rate was 50% when exposed to predators. A laboratory prey choice experiment indicated that Cancer productus, an influential intertidal crab predator, favored small adult Venerupis at least 1.7 times over Protothaca. Venerupis' high susceptibility to excavating crab and human predators, as well as its faster growth compared to Protothaca can be explained by its shallower burial depth. By growing quickly and residing near the surface, Venerupis apparently absorbs the brunt of harvest pressure while Protothaca maintains high biomass even outside of reserves.","Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Zool, 46 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jebyers@unh.edu,,"Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,60,47,51,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2005,86,2,,,,,487,500,,10.1890/03-0580,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,906IM,WOS:000227634400024,,,,,2021-09-23,

In order to understand this pattern I performed experiments at two levels. First, at the community level, I evaluated the importance of competition, predation, and pond permanence for patterns of larval performance. Second, at the behavioral level, I asked whether a hypothesized trade-off between gain and risk underlies ecological interactions, and ultimately, patterns of performance and distribution of these species. I employed a field manipulation to assess the contributions of competition and predation within different ponds that varied in permanence. In order to examine the effect of interspecific competition, enclosures contained each tadpole species either alone or in the presence of an equal density of the other species; these enclosures were placed in two temporary ponds, two intermediate ponds, and two permanent ponds. Tadpole stocking densities reflected local natural densities. This competition treatment was crossed with a predator treatment manipulating the absence or presence of predators (with ''presence'' representing the naturally occurring density within each pond). Patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across the pond permanence gradient: chorus frogs performed best relative to spring peepers in temporary ponds while spring peepers performed best relative to chorus frogs in permanent ponds (performance was measured as survivorship and growth). The dominant sources of mortality were pond drying in temporary ponds and predation in more permanent ponds. In contrast to most previous experimental studies of larval anurans, competition had small effects on tadpole performance. Results from the held experiment suggest that pond drying and predation may be important determinants of performance, and that the two species are differentially susceptible to these mortality agents. In a set of laboratory experiments I evaluated the hypothesis that a trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk mediated through activity (proportion of time spent moving) might explain patterns of Pseudacris distribution. In both species, individuals facultatively reduced activity in the presence of a caged predator with a corresponding drop in growth rate. In general, larval chorus frogs also tend to be more active and faster growing and developing than spring peepers. These results provide support for the existence of the trade-off and suggest that interspecific differences in activity may contribute to patterns of larval performance and distribution among ponds. The general nature of this trade-off suggests that it may also be important in other systems.","UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",,,"Skelly, David/D-3878-2013",,,,,57,142,144,0,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1995,76,1,,,,,150,164,,10.2307/1940638,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QC872,WOS:A1995QC87200013,,,,,2021-09-23,

By manipulating prey species richness and identity in experimental mesocosms, we sought to explore the effects of interspecific prey interactions between pinfish Lagodon rhomboides and pigfish Orthopristis chrysoptera, and between blue crabs Callinectes sapidus and common mud crabs Panopeus herbstii on the consumption rates of a shared predator species, gulf toadfish Opsanus beta. We also determined the effects of these interactions on the survivorship of the prey species as mediated by the predator. In both fish and crab prey trials, interspecific interactions between multiple prey increased the overall consumption rate of O. beta, and in each case, one prey species was harmed (decreased survivorship) while the other prey species was not significantly affected by these interactions (all relative to single-prey treatments). In trials run with fish prey, behavioral observations revealed that L rhomboides aggressively chased O. chrysoptera out of a seagrass refuge and into a surrounding sand matrix where O. beta foraged, thus increasing O. chrysoptera vulnerability to predation. In trials run with crab prey, C. sapidus failed to reduce their activity in the presence of O. beta. In addition, P. herbstii displaced C. sapidus from the seagrass refuge in mixed prey treatments, and so these conspicuous behaviors primarily occurred in the unstructured sand habitat where C. sapidus were more vulnerable to predation. We conclude that multiple prey effects, including those involving risk-enhancing, agonistic interactions between prey, can be important determinants of predator-prey outcomes. This may be especially true when refuge space is limited. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Toscano, Benjamin J.; Fodrie, F.

The 3 highest yeast additions resulted in black, reduced sediment and elevated amphipod mortality in some replicates, but where the sediment did not become reduced, food additions enhanced growth significantly, demonstrating that growth depression at high density was primarily due to food limitation and not to crowding as such.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Stockholm, Asko Lab, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Elmgren, R (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",ragnar_e@system.ecology.su.se,"Elmgren, Ragnar/A-1854-2013",,,,,54,18,18,0,5,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

I used laboratory experiments to determine the limiting resource causing the observed density-dependent effects for each species by separating the effects of food and space. Both species experienced reduced survivorship and altered growth rates at high density and in the presence of heterospecific larvae, confirming results from previous field pen studies. Interspecific interactions are a complex combination of intraguild predation (including cannibalism) and competition.

The relative importance of host-plants and predators in the population dynamics of herbivorous insects, and the frequency and intensity of inter-specific competition among herbivores, have both been intensively studied and debated. The joint effects of bottom-up, top-down, and within-trophic level interactions, however, have rarely been integrated in a single system. 2. I studied the dynamics of the cactus bug (Narnia pallidicornis), a specialist feeder on tree cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata), in response to variable host-plant quality, spider predation, and interactions with cactus-feeding beetles (Moneilema appressum). Previous work suggests that cactus reproductive effort (the proportion of meristems allocated to reproduction) is an important component of host-plant quality for Narnia. I conducted a 2-year field experiment to test the hypotheses that Narnia abundance is positively related to host-plant reproductive effort, and that interactions with predators and putative competitors alter the shape of this relationship. 3. I found strong support for the first prediction (positive Narnia-plant quality relationship) in both years, but neither predator removal nor beetle exclusion had detectable effects on this relationship in either year. I conclude that the dynamics of this insect herbivore are driven predominantly from the bottom-up, and that available data from this work and from previous studies are too variable to permit broad generalisations for the combined effects of host-plants, predation, and competition on herbivore dynamics.","[Miller, Tom E.

Giving-up densities (GUD) of seeds were used to measure the foraging activity of the three most common small mammals at the site: degu (Octodon degus), Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), and the olivaceous field mouse (Akodon olivaceus), under shrubs (cover) and in the open on predator-excluded and competitor-excluded (Octodon) plots. Experiments were conducted during both new and full moons. Monthly small-mammal censuses using standard mark-recapture techniques provided data on movement, reproduction, and long-term fluctuations in density between 1989 and 1994. Diurnal Octodon foraged more (had lower GUD-) in the absence of predators (although this was confounded by a numerical, increase resulting from predator exclusion), and foraged more under shrubs than, in the open. However, the lack of a significant cover x predator exclusion interaction and thermoregulation studies suggest that physiological constraints play,a greater role than predation risk in determining micro-habitat selection by Octodon. Predation risk, as influenced by lunar light levels and predator exclusion, had only weak effects on micro-habitat selection by Phyllotis. The strong tendency of Octodon to forage under cover could depress food availability, forcing Phyllotis to feed more in the open. Concomitantly, Phyllotis exhibits several morphological characters that would favor detection and avoidance of predators. There is extensive evidence that interspecific competition is the primary constraint on Akodon foraging; predation risk appears to be relatively unimportant. Akodon is also a less efficient forager than the two other species, having significantly higher GUD, on average. This is partially offset by differences in reproductive biology; Akodon exhibits extremely rapid. demographic responses to favorable changes in the environment. A fourth species, Abrothrix longipilis, may coexist in the system because of its opportunistic nature, but no data are available on its foraging efficiency. These behavioral and biotic interactions occur within a background of periodic El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO), which may ultimately contribute to species coexistence.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Sci Biol, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile","Yunger, JA (corresponding author), Governors State Univ, Environm Biol Program, University Pk, IL 60466 USA.",J-Yunger@govst.edu,,,,,,73,49,49,1,80,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

None of the pairs were in fact competitors. The isopod Caecidotea holsingeri was an amensalist of the amphipod Stygobromus spinatus in the laboratory, but the two did not interact in the field. The amphipod Gammarus minus was a predator on C. holsingeri both in laboratory streams and in the field, and C holsingeri was a competitor of G. minus, at least in laboratory streams. Stygobromus emarginatus was an amensalist of G. minus in laboratory streams and in the field; but in the field G. minus was a commensalist of S. emarginatus. This combination of commensalism and amensalism produces the dynamics of a predator-prey system. Interactions in both laboratory streams and cave streams were asymmetric and often had characteristics of several kinds of interspecific interactions. Negative interactions dominated in laboratory streams while positive interactions were more common in the field experiments. Negative interactions had an effect on microdistribution only at the level of individual stones in a riffle.

Competition-defence trade-offs have long been thought to promote plant coexistence and increase species diversity. However, insights from modern coexistence theory clarify that such trade-offs alone cannot sustain coexistence. Coexistence also requires stabilising niche differences and the ability of competitor populations to persist under consumer pressure. Despite the breadth of potential consequences of competition-defence trade-offs, we have little mechanistic understanding of how they affect diversity in natural communities. 2. We investigated the effects of seed harvesting by ants on coexistence in an annual plant community. We parameterised a model of plant competitive population dynamics with data from two field experiments: (a) plant demographic rates and competition coefficients determined by growing plants alone and against intra- and interspecific competitor density gradients; (b) plant fitness losses to ant consumers determined by measuring seed removal from experimental depots. We tested for a trade-off between a plant species' demographic potential and its susceptibility to consumption and then determined the bounds of ant effects on pairwise and multispecies coexistence by comparing mod& projections with and without seed consumption. 3. Ants harvested seeds of all plant species, but they strongly preferred the competitively superior large seeded species, inducing a competition-defence trade-off. Unequal seed loss to ants changed competition-based fitness hierarchies, affecting both the number and identities of plant species pairs that were predicted to coexist compared to a scenario without ants. The trade-off most often prevented coexistence by severely disadvantaging the superior competitor or excluding species directly through overconsumption, and a simulated reduction in the overall consumption rate opened few additional opportunities for coexistence. Ant exacerbation of average fitness differences was particularly disruptive to multispecies coexistence, where niche differences were insufficient to stabilise the coexistence of plant triplets and quadruplets. 4. Synthesis. Our results show that the presence of a competition-defence trade-off in a community with stabilising niche differences does not always increase diversity. Instead, the full range of diversity outcomes-positive and negative changes in species number and changes in the identity of the dominant-are possible. Taken together, our results support the emerging paradigm that consumers have wide ranging impacts on plant diversity and suggest that variation in consumer pressure may be an important driver of large-scale diversity patterns.","[Petry, William K.; Levine, Jonathan M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kandlikar, Gaurav S.; Kraft, Nathan J.

We investigated the individual and spatial patterns in the feeding of two dominant zooplanktivorous clupeids-herring Clupea harengus membras and sprat Sprattus sprattus-in the Baltic Sea in summer, by means of a taxonomic analysis of stomach content. Both species consumed predominantly the small-sized copepods (Temora longicornis, Eurytemora affinis, and Acartia spp.). E. affinis and T. longicornis were generally positively selected by both species. Centropages hamatus was selected only by sprat. With the exception of Pleopis/ Podon spp. in the case of small sprat, the remaining prey, i. e. the zooplankton taxa that were found in fish stomachs, were consumed at similar proportions as they occurred in zooplankton. Stomach fullness of fish increased with the increasing proportions of prey in the zooplankton community. The share of empty stomachs was lower for sprat, and among smaller fish in both species. Pairwise dietary overlap between fish decreased when zooplankton diversity increased. Dietary overlap was also lowest among the individuals of sprat, probably due to the wider diet spectrum and diversity of stomach content compared to herring. Our results point to high interspecific competition, where sprat seems to be more successful than herring in finding and consuming prey, and therefore may have an advantage over herring when the zooplankton community is dominated by small-sized taxa.","[Ojaveer, Henn; Lankov, Ain; Klais, Riina] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80032 Parnu, Estonia; [Raid, Tiit; Pollumae, Arno] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia","Ojaveer, H (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80032 Parnu, Estonia.",henn.ojaveer@ut.ee,"Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016","Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Klais-Peets, Riina/0000-0003-2895-1273","BONUS - European Union [Art 185]; Estonian Research Council [2012-60]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [SF0180005s10]","We thank Sally Clink for language editing.

We investigated the potential role of two introduced predatory gastropods, the Japanese drill (Ocinebrina inornata) and the eastern drill (Urosalpinx cinerea), in limiting Olympia oyster recovery. We quantified the bay-wide distribution, local abundance, and per capita effects of drills, and asked how each of these three components of total invasion impact might be influenced by another dominant introduced species, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea g gas). Bay-wide sampling revealed differences in spatial distribution of the two drill species, with U. cinerea more abundant toward the head of the estuary and O. inornata more abundant toward the Mouth. Individual feeding trials indicated that both drill species preferred Pacific oysters to Olympia oysters of similar size, and preferentially attacked smaller oysters. We used field enclosures to quantify the direct effects of Japanese drill predation on Olympia and Pacific oysters, intra and interspecific competition, and indirect effects mediated by the shared predator. Predation reduced the survival of both oyster species, but the per capita impact of Japanese drills declined with increasing density of either Olympia or Pacific oysters, consistent with a type I I functional response. This positive indirect effect of Pacific oysters oil Olympia oysters was offset by asymmetric competition, in which Pacific oysters reduced Olympia oyster growth and survival but not vice versa. Despite the large drill impacts seen in these experiments, Olympia oysters transplanted to intertidal sites throughout the bay experienced low and variable rates of drill predation compared with other mortality sources. Introduced drills may be only one of a suite of factors that prevent rebuilding of Olympia oysters in the intertidal zone in Willapa Bay.","[Buhle, Eric R.; Ruesink, Jennifer L.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Buhle, ER (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",eric.buhle@noaa.gov,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to Washington Sea Grant Program, University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington [9NA16RG1044]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research fellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Achievement Rewards for College Scientists fellowship","The authors thank the organizers of the 2006 West Coast Native Oyster Restoration Workshop for coordinating this Special Issue.

Additionally, sea urchins have lower respiration and food consumption rates, and at high biomass levels appear to reduce algal resources to levels lower than herbivorous fishes. A simple biomass-based energetic model was developed to help explain these patterns and to determine the energetic properties of organisms which affect their resource competitive ability and ability to sustain themselves under predation. Simulations of a hypothetical herbivore indicate that herbivore steady-state biomass increases with decreasing consumption rates, but a parabolic relationship was found between herbivore biomass and the level to which the herbivore reduces its food resource (i.e. R *). Simulations of competition between hypothetical herbivores indicate that only the level to which a herbivore reduces its resource (R *) was important in determining the superior resource competitor, although biomass dynamics differed depending on feeding, gross production rates, and initial conditions of competitors. High herbivore consumption and gross production increase rates of biomass recruitment. But, unless an herbivore can also keep resources below the level competitors can tolerate, a high rate of gross production does not insure the competitor superior resource competitive ability in the absence of predators. Yet the model also predicts that organisms with high gross production and consumption rates are able to persist better under high levels of harvesting by predators. The model suggests that sea urchins reach high biomass due to low algal consumption rates and out-compete herbivorous fishes, when their predators are reduced (i.e. often attributable to overfishing), by reducing algal biomass to low levels. Sea urchins appear to tolerate low algal biomass due to their low consumption and respiration rates which allows them to persist at low levels of net algal productivity. But, low sea urchin gross production makes them less likely to persist under high levels of harvesting or predation. The model suggests that organisms may frequently need to make energetic trade-offs between traits which will give them superior resource competitive ability and tolerance to predation or disturbance.","UNIV FLORIDA, CTR WETLANDS, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA; UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN SCI, SYST ECOL PROGRAM, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA",,,"McClanahan, Tim/K-4998-2019","McClanahan, Timothy/0000-0001-5821-3584",,,,69,68,72,1,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

The model parameters were estimated from field data, with the exception of three parameters, for which a range of plausible values was selected. Most parameter combinations generated high-amplitude, chaotic oscillations with a distinct periodic component; the median parameter values predicted dynamics closely resembling the observed 3-5 yr rodent oscillations in northern Fennoscandia. The results were not sensitive to a number of structural changes in the model, suggested by empirical observations: stochastic variation in the prey-carrying capacity, predator refuge at low density, predation on mustelids by large generalist predators in the years when rodents decline, and an alternative assumption about winter breeding in rodents. The model-predicted period and amplitude of oscillations agreed most closely with observations when the model included a low-density refuge for the mustelids. Another predator-prey model with ratio-dependent functional response did not predict dynamics resembling the observed dynamics. The present results provide further support to the hypothesis that the rodent oscillations are maintained by delayed density dependence imposed by specialist predators. Our results also suggest that the dynamics may be chaotic, with a periodic component, rather than a limit cycle with environmental stochasticity.","UNIV TURKU,DEPT BIOL,ECOL ZOOL LAB,SF-20500 TURKU,FINLAND","HANSKI, I (corresponding author), HELSINKI UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DIV ECOL,POB 17,P RAUTATIEKATU 13,SF-00014 HELSINKI,FINLAND.",,,,,,,55,138,139,2,45,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1995,76,3,,,,,840,850,,10.2307/1939349,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QU358,WOS:A1995QU35800014,,,,,2021-09-23,

Limited availability of surface seeds fords some birds to scratch for seeds buried beneath soil, snow, or litter. Artificial seed trays were used to test the ability of five different sparrow species to extract seeds buried at different depths in soil. The results suggest three functional groups based on relative scratching ability. Strong scratchers, which included eastern towhee and song and white-throated sparrows. mel or exceeded their energetic requirements when foraging on seeds buried at ail depths (down to a maximum depth of 1.50-2.25 cm). A weak scratching species, Savannah sparrow, scratched with the same frequency as the strong scratchers, but experienced negative energy budgets when forced to forage on sub-surface seeds. Finally, a non-scratching species, field sparrow, failed to extract any buried seeds. Level of scratching ability may influence foraging efficiency at low resource densities. As a result, interspecific differences in scratching ability may contribute to habitat selection. Strong scratchers may be adapted to foraging near woody vegetation where intense resource competition and abundant litter limit the availability of surface seeds. Weak scratchers, on the other hand, may be forced to feed away from areas where surface seeds are limited. Since woody vegetation serves as a primary source of protective cover in early successional habitats, a tradeoff between foraging efficiency and the risk of predation may promote the local coexistence of species that differ in relative scratching ability and adaptations to evading predators.","Coll William & Mary, Ctr Conservat Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA","Whalen, DM (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",dwhalen@sevilleta.unm.edu,,,,,,63,6,7,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2000,88,3,,,,,574,584,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880314.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,292UK,WOS:000085813300014,,,,,2021-09-23,

We examined aggressive symmetry in two territorial Caribbean damselfish species, the longfin damselfish (Stegastes diencaeous) and the dusky damselfish (S. adustus) because they exhibit qualities that make such relationships hard to predict. These two species show considerable habitat overlap, are closely related and are nearly identical in gross morphology, suggesting they would show the same intensity of aggressiveness to heterospecifics and conspecifics. However, longfins reach a larger adult size, which may cause these two species to instead aggress asymmetrically toward one another. We also tested residents' responses toward bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a common egg predator, to see if highly similar species respond similarly to a presumably equal threat not likely to be misidentified as a conspecific. We presented residents with either a single intruder or two simultaneous intruders to determine if context affected aggressive behavior. When presented with a single intruder, both resident species attacked conspecifics and congenerics with somewhat similar aggression, suggesting either a broad competitive overlap or misidentification. When residents were forced to divide their time between two simultaneous damselfish intruders, they clearly aggressed more intensely toward conspecifics. Additionally, longfins were more aggressive to bluehead wrasse than were dusky damselfish in single and paired presentations. We propose that the higher aggression toward wrasse by longfins is related to longfins having territories on which their eggs are naturally more exposed compared to a typical dusky territory in which eggs are more hidden.","[Little, K.; Itzkowitz, M.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Draud, M.] Long Isl Univ, Dept Biol, Brookville, NY 11548 USA","Little, K (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",kpl208@lehigh.edu,,,,,,48,6,6,0,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

We tested this prediction by suppressing insects in replicated field populations of a native plant, Oenothera biennis, which reduced seed predation, altered interspecific competitive dynamics, and resulted in rapid evolutionary divergence. Comparative genotyping and phenotyping of nearly 12,000 O. biennis individuals revealed that in plots protected from insects, resistance to herbivores declined through time owing to changes in flowering time and lower defensive ellagitannins in fruits, whereas plant competitive ability increased. This independent real-time evolution of plant resistance and competitive ability in the field resulted from the relaxation of direct selective effects of insects on plant defense and through indirect effects due to reduced herbivory on plant competitors.","[Agrawal, Anurag A.; Hastings, Amy P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Agrawal, Anurag A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Johnson, Marc T.

Yearly population estimates of the green oak leaf roller moth, Tortrix viridana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and the winter moth, Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), were taken from the pedunculate oak, Quercus robur, from 1951 to 1966 in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, U.K. Larval mortality from parasitoids was recorded for both species over the same period. 2. Operophtera brumata population density fluctuated around a constant mean, whereas I viridana population density exhibited a linear decline over the sampling period. Population counts were subjected to time-series analysis after the linear decline was removed from the T. viridana data by detrending. Multiple regression models were built so that variation in the per capita rate of increase of each population could be partitioned among (a) current and previous population density, (b) current and previous population density of the second moth species, and (c) rates of larval parasitism. 3. Multiple regression analysis suggested that variation in the per capita rate of increase of O. brumata could be explained by negative feedback from O. brumata density at T-2 (32%), a negative relationship with I viridana density at T-l (18%), and a positive relationship with parasitism suffered by I viridana at T-l (24%). 4. The I viridana population time-series was dominated by a rapid feedback process such that per capita rate of increase at time T was negatively related to population density at time T-l, explaining 53% of variance in population growth rate. Per capita rate of increase was unrelated to larval parasitism or densities of O. brumata. 5. In light of previous life-table and experimental studies on O. brumata and I viridana, the current analyses suggest that pupal predation (data not presented) and interspecific competition are significant determinants of O. brumata population growth rates in Wytham Woods. In contrast, T. viridana population growth rates appear to be dominated by rapid negative feedback consistent with intraspecific competition.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Hunter, MD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",mhunter@sparc.ecology.uga.edu,,,,,,28,14,16,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Argyrodes flavescens and A. bonadea were both found more frequently on webs of two Nephila species than expected from the web areas they occupied among webs of all web spiders. Seasonal dynamics of Argyrodes changed greatly according to whether N. clavata was present or not, indicating the importance of Nephila on Argyrodes populations. The peak density of A. bonadea came earlier than that of A. flavescens. Because A. flavescens is known to limit the number of A. bonadea on host webs, the decrease in the density of A. bonadea may be due to the effect of interspecific competition by A. flavescens.","Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biodivers Sci, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Miyashita, T (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biodivers Sci, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",,,,,,,12,10,11,0,6,AMER ARACHNOLOGICAL SOC,NEW YORK,"C/O NORMAN I PLATNICK, AMER MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, CENTRAL PK WEST AT 79TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10024 USA",0161-8202,,,J ARACHNOL,J.

Population densities of C. aleuticus were only consistent with resource densities across years during two of five study years, indicating a lack of resource matching at large temporal scales. On shorter temporal scales, fish growth rates that were two to three times higher in the estuary compared with the stream were inconsistent with the predictions of resource matching theory. A manipulation of C. aleuticus density showed that the estuary could support at least twice the number of individuals that occurred there; thus, the profitable estuary is underutilized. Interspecific competition with Cottus asper was partially responsible for this underutilization as indicated by a substantial reduction in growth and condition among C. aleuticus individuals in experimental manipulations that compared intra- and inter-specific effects. Observed spatial overlap between these two cottids combined with the results of the competition experiment suggests that C. aleuticus is more strongly limited in its ability to use estuarine habitats opportunistically by interspecific competition than by intraspecific competition.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Polivka, KM (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, Wenatchee Forestry Sci Lab, 1133 N Western Ave, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA.",kpolivka@fs.fed.us,,,,,,83,9,10,0,8,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Galls were more abundant in shade than sun across sites. This finding is consistent with the Sink Competition Hypothesis, which predicts higher gall loads on plants with longer internodes (as those in shade) and hence less competition among sinks. Galled leaves were smaller and senesced more rapidly, and galled shoots grew less. In the sun, galled branches produced fewer flowers, but there was ultimately no relationship between gall load and seed production in the year sampled. Gall load was not correlated with seed predation in sun or shade, suggesting no indirect interactions between herbivores. This work suggests that gall insects negatively affect plant growth and reproduction, but manipulative experiments must be conducted to confirm this. Additionally, this study suggests that relationships between leaf gall load and plant fitness traits may not be clearly regulated by the availability of sunlight resources to the plant.","Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA","Leege, LM (corresponding author), Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, POB 8042, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",leege@GeorgiaSouthern.edu,,,,,,46,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUN,2006,184,2,,,,,203,212,,10.1007/s11258-005-9065-4,,,10,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,059PY,WOS:000238745900002,,,,,2021-09-23,

The animal communities in phytotelmata-plant-held waters-are a convenient exception to this generalization. Tree holes, bamboo internodes, pitcher plants, tank bromeliads, and water-retaining plant axils contain a rich fauna, principally of arthropods, which constitute more or less complex, highly discrete food webs. They are widespread and replicated. The explanations for the community structure observed in these systems may call on bottom-up mechanisms such as simple environmental limitations, competition, predation, and facilitation, or they may adduce grander top-down theories, which explore biogeographic, energetic, dynamic, or biodiversity-related constraints. The existence of the bottom-up mechanisms is well established in experimental systems, and their consequences may be apparent in naturally occurring food webs. Top-down mechanisms demand a more holistic approach and are more difficult to test either by pattern analysis or experimental manipulation. The synoptic explanation of community composition and structure demands a multidimensional approach best expressed as a heuristic template. Phytotelmata represent nearly ideal natural instruments for further study of food web dynamics, and exciting opportunities exist for the development and testing of community theories through their manipulation.","Griffith Univ, Australian Sch Environm Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia","Kitching, RL (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Sch Environm Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",r.kitching@mailbox.gu.edu.au,"Kitching, Roger/C-5102-2009",,,,,184,140,150,3,73,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

Furthermore, our view of phytophagous insect populations is probably biased by the more frequent attention given to economic pests whose dynamics might be expected to be somewhat exceptional. Herein, we report on the population dynamics and community-level features in a diverse, native fauna of phytophagous insects associated with goldenrod (Solidago altissima), a native perennial plant that forms a dominant, long-persisting element in old-field succession. The data consist of censuses taken in six consecutive years at 16 old fields in the Finger Lakes Region of New York; five additional stands were followed for four consecutive years. Our analyses address two questions: (a) to what extent is the functional structure of the community (as reflected in such attributes to the herbivore load, guild spectrum, and dominance hierarchy) maintained by compensatory changes in the densities of the member species and (b) are certain traits associated with a species' tendency to fluctuate in density or to dominate the community? In general, populations of goldenrod insects fluctuated less than those of insects reported in the literature. Few were abundant; only 7 of the 138 species in the goldenrod fauna ever reached densities at which their biomass exceeded 0. 1% of the leaf biomass. The functional structure of the community, as reflected in the total herbivore load and the proportions of that load contributed by various guilds, varied widely in space and time. A small subset of the fauna remained dominant throughout the study; these species, whose populations occasionally irrupted, retained their high rank in relative abundance even during those periods when their populations were waning. There was no evidence for compensatory changes in the densities of species within guilds, as would be expected if a relatively distinct set of limiting resources were available to insects with different feeding styles. Species were no more likely to exhibit negative correlations with their guild mates than they were with members of other guilds. There was also little evidence of sporadic or diffuse competition within the fauna as a whole; even during population outbreaks, the dominant species rarely engendered decreases in the biomass or diversity of the remaining species, and increases in the total herbivore load were seldom associated with losses of species from the community. Several species were positively associated with one another on the basis of similar habitat requirements or the use by one species of conditions created by the presence of another. The community was predictable only in the sense that dominant species remained dominant and rare species rare. The abundance and population variability of species were not correlated with such traits as body size, generation time, or host range. Taxon-related trends, on the other hand, stood out; coleopterans tended to be abundant whereas lepidopterans were rare, and hemipterans tended to fluctuate widely whereas dipterans remained relatively constant. Furthermore, species that were clumped in space (onto stems within fields) tended to be abundant and variable. The boom and bust dynamics of these aggregating species may be related to the ability of colonies to survive the inroads of generalist predators. The low degree of regional synchrony in the performance of populations at different sites suggests that large-scale, weather-driven fluctuations are uncommon. Our analysis of this well-developed, native insect fauna reveals a community that has a somewhat predictable structure that reflects the idiosyncracies of the component species. These species do not fluctuate in an integrated community-structuring manner, but as an outcome of each species performing at its individualistic' level, the community displays a characteristic dominance hierarchy. The members of this diverse fauna rarely achieve densities at which they compete with one another. Our results are consistent with Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin's hypothesis (1960) which predicts that terrestrial herbivores rarely deplete plant resources to levels at which there is widespread interspecific competition.",,"ROOT, RB (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, CORSON LAB, ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,93,138,139,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Ecological differences across environments can alter the context of sexual selection, yet little research has addressed how this may influence the rapid, divergent evolution of male genitalia. Using the model system of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) undergoing ecological speciation across blue holes, we used geometric morphometric methods to test (i) whether male genital shape (the small, approximately 1mm long, distal tip of the sperm-transfer organ, the gonopodium) has diverged between populations with and without predatory fish and (ii) whether any observed divergence has a genetic basis. We additionally examined the effects of genetic relatedness and employed model selection to investigate other environmental factors (i.e. interspecific competition, adult sex ratio and resource availability) that could potentially influence genital shape via changes in sexual selection. Predation regime comprised the most important factor associated with male genital divergence in this system, although sex ratio and some aspects of resource availability had suggestive effects. We found consistent, heritable differences in male genital morphology between predation regimes: Bahamas mosquitofish coexisting with predatory fish possessed more elongate genital tips with reduced soft tissue compared with counterparts inhabiting blue holes without predatory fish. We suggest this may reflect selection for greater efficiency of sperm transfer and fertilization during rapid and often forced copulations in high-predation populations or differences in sexual conflict between predation regimes. Our study highlights the potential importance of ecological variation, particularly predation risk, in indirectly generating genital diversity.","[Heinen-Kay, J.

The present study provides direct evidence indicating that the oviposition behaviour of the two main mango fruit fly species, Ceratitis cosyra (Walker) and Bactrocera invadens Drew-Tsurata & White, is affected by secretions of the dominant arboreal ant Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille). When offered ant-exposed and unexposed mangoes in the absence of the ants, both fly species are reluctant to land on ant-exposed fruits and, when having landed, often take off quickly and fail to oviposit. The number of puparia collected from unexposed mangoes is approximately eight-fold higher than from ant-exposed ones. The results obtained from laboratory experiments and field observations confirm that adult fruit flies are more affected through repellence by ant cues than by direct predation. The use of cues by fruit flies in predator avoidance has implications for evolutionary ecology, behavioural ecology and chemical ecology.","[Van Mele, Paul] Africa Rice Ctr WARDA, Cotonou, Benin; [Vayssieres, Jean-Francois] UR HortSys, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Vayssieres, Jean-Francois; Adandonon, Appolinaire; Sinzogan, Antonio] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin","Van Mele, P (corresponding author), Africa Rice Ctr WARDA, 01 BP 2031, Cotonou, Benin.",p.vanmele@cgiar.org,,,"Conservation, Food and Health Foundation","We thank Mr Delou for his technical assistance and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

The differences in morphology between these two species generate: specific predictions under limiting similarity regarding the likelihood of competition and its relative strength: the congener should be a more important potential competitor. Increased fish density had a strong effect on the multivariate response of survival and growth, and on the relative condition of C. bairdi, indicating competition. The effect of additional C. bairdi or Kanawha sculpins were roughly equal, but the effect of E. flabellare was significantly greater. The most important potential impact on C. bairdi came from interspecific competition by a species that is smaller and very different in morphology, contrary to predictions based, on limiting similarity.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706; MT LAKE BIOL STN,PEMBROKE,NC 27708",,,,,,,,44,14,14,0,8,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,1995,104,1,,,,,31,38,,10.1007/BF00365559,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RZ359,WOS:A1995RZ35900005,28306910,,,,2021-09-23,

Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is to manipulate predator movement using semiochemicals. However, selective manipulation is impeded by attraction of both predators and pests to bark beetle pheromones. 2 The primary bark beetle affecting pine plantations in Wisconsin, U.S.A., is the pine engraver, Ips pini (Say). Other herbivores include Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff) and Dryophthorus americanus Bedel (Curculionidae). The predominant predators are the beetles Thanasimus dubius (Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Histeridae). 3 We conducted field assays using two enantiomeric ratios of ipsdienol, and frontalin plus alpha-pinene. Ipsdienol is the principal pheromone component of L pini, and frontalin is produced by a number of Dendroctonus species. alpha-Pinene is a host monoterpene commonly incorporated into commercial frontalin lures. 4 Thanasimus dubius was attracted to frontalin plus alpha-pinene, and also to racemic ipsdienol. By contrast, I. pini was attracted to racemic ipsdienol, but showed no attraction to frontalin plus alpha-pinene. Platysoma cylindrica was attracted to 97%-(-)-ipsdienol and, to a lesser extent, racemic ipsdienol, but not to frontalin plus alpha-pinene. Ips grandicollis was attracted to frontalin plus alpha-pinene but not to ipsdienol. Dryophthorus americanus was attracted to both ipsdienol and frontalin plus alpha-pinene. 5 This ability to selectively attract the predator T. dubius without attracting the principal bark beetle in the system, L pini, provides new opportunities for research into augmentative biological control and basic population dynamics. Moreover, the attraction of T. dubius, but not P. cylindrica, to frontalin plus alpha-pinene creates opportunities for selective manipulation of just one predator. 6 Patterns of attraction by predators and bark beetles to these compounds appear to reflect various degrees of geographical and host tree overlap with several pheromone-producing species.","Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Biometry Program, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Aukema, BH (corresponding author), Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, 506 W Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.",baukema@pfc.forestry.ca,,,,,,88,18,20,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-9555,1461-9563,,AGR FOREST ENTOMOL,Agric.

A behavioral experiment demonstrated that an individual of either species was less likely to feed on a recently grazed patch when the prior forager was T. aureotincta. Both snails responded only to the amount of food available on a patch, and, except at very low food levels, the likelihood that a snail would remain to feed was identical for the two species across microalgal densities. Where food was scarce, T. eiseni was more likely than T. aureotincta to feed in that patch. Density-dependent effects on microalgal standing stock differed between the snails; at low grazer densities, T. aureotincta depressed food levels to a comparatively greater degree, whereas at high grazer densities, T. eiseni had a relatively greater effect. The relative growth performance of the snails differed as a function of available food: T. aureotincta had superior body growth at high resource densities, while T. eiseni grew comparatively better at low microalgal densities. Differences in effects on and growth responses to microalgae arose from dissimilar foraging characteristics of the snails. Compared with T. eiseni, T. aureotincta moved more rapidly while feeding, harvested twice as great an area per unit time, but was unable to crop microalgae as close to rock surfaces. While T. eiseni grazed a smaller area per unit time, it removed relatively more microalgae per area grazed. These differing suites of foraging attributes may represent a trade-off to harvest food at different densities: cropping closer to the substratum (area intensive grazing) yields more food when microalgae are scarce, but precludes grazing a larger area per unit time (area extensive grazing) through fast movement, which provides a greater food intake when microalgae are abundant. If an area extensive (moves faster)-intensive (digs deeper) trade-off is a common feature of benthic grazer systems, knowledge of this aspect could provide great predictive insight into the patterns and causes of density dependence arising from exploitation.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, INST MARINE SCI,COASTAL RES CTR, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA","Schmitt, RJ (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & MARINE BIOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,104,49,50,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1996,77,2,,,,,408,425,,10.2307/2265618,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TY198,WOS:A1996TY19800006,,,,,2021-09-23,

We used a series of experiments to investigate competition between walleye (WAE) and smallmouth bass (SMB) at different life stages and light conditions, identified behaviors that allowed one fish to outcompete another, and evaluated whether prey switching mitigated competitive interactions. Juvenile and adult SMB appeared to outcompete WAE when fed during the daytime; neither species dominated when fed near dusk. Attack rates and capture efficiencies of both species were similar with an intra-or interspecific competitor, but SMB often exploited prey before the competitor had a chance to feed (exploitative competition) or displayed agonistic behaviors toward a potential competitor (interference competition). Prey selectivity of WAE or SMB did not differ when by themselves or with a potential competitor. These results indicate that SMB could outcompete WAE under limiting prey conditions due to the aggressive nature of SMB, but resources may be partitioned at least along a temporal scale.","[Wuellner, Melissa R.; Graeb, Brian D.

While long periodic cycles in population dynamics can make the experimental observation of the indirect effects difficult, modelling the possible effects on an evolutionary tithe scale may provide the much needed information on the potential threats of the invasive species on the ecosystem. Using empirical data from a recent invasion in northernmost Fennoscandia, we applied adaptive dynamics theory and modelled the long term consequences of the invasion by the winter moth into the resident community. Specifically, we investigated the outcome of the observed short-term asymmetric preferences of generalist predators and specialist parasitoids on the long term population dynamics of the invasive winter moth and resident autumnal moth sharing these natural enemies. Our results indicate that coexistence after the invasion is possible. However, the outcome of the indirect interaction on the population dynamics of the moth species was variable and the dynamics might not be persistent on an evolutionary time scale. In addition, the indirect interactions between the two moth species via shared natural enemies were able to cause asynchrony in the population cycles corresponding to field observations from previous sympatric outbreak areas. Therefore, the invasion may cause drastic changes in the resident community, for example by prolonging outbreak periods of birch-feeding moths, increasing the average population densities of the moths or, alternatively, leading to extinction of the resident moth species or to equilibrium densities of the two, formerly cyclic, herbivores.

Thus, the biological control of herbivorous arthropods can be either enhanced or disrupted by introducing a predator species to an existing host-parasitoid system. We evaluate the impact of introducing a predator, the convergent ladybird beetle, Hippodamia convergens, on the biological control of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, by the parasitoid Lysiphlebus testaceipes, under field conditions. Predation on immature parasitoids by H. convergens was intense: 98-100% of aphid mummies were consumed by the end of the experiment, and H. convergens substantially reduced immature parasitoid populations. Despite the negative impact of H. convergens on aphid parasitoids, aphid population suppression was greatest in treatments containing both H. convergens and parasitoids. The parasitoid alone or in combination with H. convergens suppressed cotton aphids in a density-dependent manner and increased total plant leaf area and biomass, H. convergens did not substantially alter the percentage of aphids mummified by parasitoids and showed a partial feeding preference for unparasitized aphids over aphid mummies. We conclude that under conditions where a predator shows both a partial preference for unparasitized hosts and high levels of predation on unparasitized hosts, we may expect the predator to improve suppression of herbivores even if it produces high levels of intraguild predation. While intraguild predation is an important ecological interaction in the early-season cotton agroecosystem, it does not disrupt cotton aphid biological control.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Colfer, RG (corresponding author), Mission Organ, POB 2357, Salinas, CA 93902 USA.",ramy@nsfoods.com,,,,,,78,133,139,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2001,126,2,,,,,292,304,,10.1007/s004420000510,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393XK,WOS:000166494800018,28547629,,,,2021-09-23,

Arctic foxes have been fully protected in Fennoscandia following their drastic decline in the early 19th century, and their lack of recovery has been hypothesized to result from increased interspecific competition with red foxes that have colonized the arctic fox's range and/or changes in prey dynamics due to increased variation in climatic conditions. We used a large-scale spatiotemporal study combined with an extensive red fox removal intervention to test these two hypotheses by evaluating the relative importance of diverse environmental factors affecting the recolonization of arctic foxes in Northern Norway. Arctic foxes were never observed at sites where just a few daily observations of red foxes were recorded, and the probability of recolonization was zero at sites where no red fox was removed. The probability of recolonization increased when lemming abundance was very high, but the relative importance of this variable was half that of red foxes. Thus, our results lend support to both hypotheses, but they clearly highlight the presence of red foxes as the factor most limiting arctic fox recolonization in this part of its distribution. As the abundance of arctic foxes has remained extremely low even after more than 70 years of full protection, direct conservation actions seem to be needed to promote the recovery of arctic fox populations. Our research therefore highlights that conservation actions targeting a major reduction in red fox numbers are needed because the competitive interaction with red foxes is the most important factor limiting recolonization of this species.

A direct, competitive effect of R. padi on D. noxia was observed only at extraordinarily high aphid densities (>2,000 individuals per greenhouse seedling). Lacewing predators significantly reduced the rate of increase of D. noxia in each experiment, but they were sometimes less effective on plants that received a mixture of both aphid species than they were on plants that received an equivalent number of D. noxia alone. The presence of R. padi may have reduced predation on D. noxia because the former species is more accessible to lacewing predators or because its faster growth rate caused it to outnumber D. noxia on plants that initially received an equal ratio of both species.

Because obligate mutualists are more reliant than facultative mutualists on the resources that their partners provide, they are expected to compete more strongly for those resources. Here, I examined interference competition in two goby fishes: Nes longus (an obligate mutualist) and Ctenogobius saepepallens (a facultative mutualist). Both gobies associate with the shrimp, Alpheus floridanus. Shrimp provide gobies with refuge from predators (a burrow in the sand), and gobies provide shrimp with a warning signal when predators are near. Using an aquarium experiment, I examined the behavior of a pair of gobies with access to a single shrimp burrow. I used four different goby pairings: large N. longus and small N. longus, large N. longus and small C. saepepallens, large C. saepepallens and small N. longus, and large C. saepepallens and small C. saepepallens. When paired with large N. longus individuals, small gobies of both species were less likely to occupy the single burrow than when paired with large C. saepepallens individuals. In addition, large N. longus individuals were less likely to co-occupy the single burrow with smaller gobies than were large C. saepepallens individuals. These results seem to indicate that large N. longus individuals exclude smaller gobies from burrows, while large C. saepepallens individuals do not. This study adds evidence to the supposition that obligate mutualists in general compete more strongly for mutualist partners than do facultative mutualists.","[Lyons, Patrick J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Lyons, PJ (corresponding author), CIEE Res Stn Bonaire, Kaya Gobernador N Debrot 26, Kralendijk, Bonaire, Netherlands.",patrick.lyons5@gmail.com,,,W.

Interspecific competition with larger carnivores may be a factor limiting wild dog density. The density of wild dogs on a 2600-km(2) area of the Selous Game Reserve (Tanzania) was 0.04 adults/km(2). Spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) density for the same area was estimated by audio playbacks as 0.32 hyaenas/km(2). Lion (Panthera leo) density determined from the ratio of hyaenas to lions, was 0.11 lions/km(2). Across six ecosystems including Selous, there were strong negative correlations between wild dog and hyaena densities (r = -0.32; p = 0.01) and between wild dog and lion densities (r = -0.91; p = 0.03). Hyaenas out-numbered wild dogs by ratios ranging from 8.1 to 122:1. Ratios of lions to wild dogs ranged from 3:1 to 21:1. The diets of hyaenas and wild dogs overlap extensively; those of wild dogs and lions show less overlap. Where hyaenas are common and visibility is good, interference competition from hyaenas at wild dog kills is common and reduces wild dogs' feeding time. Where hyaena density is lower and visibility is poor, interference competition at wild dog kills is rare. Wild dogs are commonly killed by lions and occasionally by hyaenas. These data suggest that competition with spotted hyaenas may limit or exclude wild dogs when hyaena density is high. Competition with lions appears less intense, but direct predation by lions on wild dogs is important. Competition and predation by larger carnivores may be of broad importance to the conservation of wild dogs and other medium-sized carnivores.","FRANKFURT ZOOL SOC, SELOUS WILD DOG PROJECT, SELOUS CONSERVAT PROGRAMME, DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA","Creel, S (corresponding author), ROCKEFELLER UNIV, FIELD RES CTR ECOL & ETHOL, TYRREL RD, BOX 38B, RR2, MILLBROOK, NY 12545 USA.",,,,,,,55,236,237,0,156,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Some ecologists believe that at least some and possibly most, of the interpretation of this work may be subject to dispute because of potential artefacts associated with the confinement itself. Simulations suggested that moderate or even severe artefacts may arise from using enclosures that are 'too small', which could produce inferential nonsense in some circumstances (Mac Nally, 1997). Here, the influence of differential mobility is explicitly considered in a simulated environment, with organisms confined in enclosures of a variety of sizes. Some simulations involve single populations, while others pit together competitors differing only in mobility. Three foraging strategies based on simple movement principles are simulated. Results indicate that the relationships between resource consumption and mobility will depend upon foraging strategy, often in unexpected ways compared with the implications of spatial averaging. Outcomes of interactions among pairs of populations having the same foraging strategy but with different mobilities also are complex, indicating that the results of confinement experiments may involve non-intuitive interactions between mobility and foraging method. There needs to be a refocusing on basic biology of organisms used in confinement experiments (e.g. movement distributions) and, particularly, constructing defensible statements on why the selected scales were used.

We constructed individual-based spatially explicit simulation models of two mixed conifer-angiosperm forests, growing on soils of contrasting phosphorus (P) availability, to investigate how browsing by invasive red deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) and granivory by invasive rodents (primarily house mouse Mus musculus) might alter forest dynamics. Models were parameterized with field data. Seedling growth and survival rates were estimated inside and outside deer exclosures. Seed predation rates were estimated at high and low rodent densities in mast and non-mast seeding years. For the alluvial terrace forest, which grew on P-rich soil, our model contained 15 tree species dominated by angiosperms; our model of the P-poor marine terrace forest contained seven species dominated by conifers. The two forest models were used to explore four 500-year scenarios: deer and rodents present, deer present and rodents absent, deer absent and rodents present, and deer and rodents absent. Our field studies revealed that the highest probabilities of seed predation by rodents occurred for two canopy species in mast years and in neighborhoods of high species-specific basal area, and that deer browsing had the greatest negative effects on the growth and survival rates of angiosperm seedlings. Our simulation models predicted that the presence of deer and rodents would reduce the abundances of canopy codominants, and hence total basal area, in the alluvial terrace forest. The presence of deer increased the dominance of conifers in both forests, but effects of deer and rodents were much stronger in the alluvial terrace forest. Our study revealed two emergent properties. First, rodent- and deer-induced reductions in seedling abundances did not always translate into reduced sapling and adult tree abundances. Second, when deer changed the abundance of a canopy dominant, other species were affected by altered interspecific competition. We conclude that the effects of invasive deer and rodents will be greatest in forests growing on P-rich soils. Exclusion of deer is predicted to have greater long-term effects on forest dynamics than exclusion of rodents.","[Forsyth, David M.; Gormley, Andrew M.] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm & Primary Ind, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; [Wilson, Deborah J.] Landcare Res, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Easdale, Tomas A.; Ruscoe, Wendy A.; Gormley, Andrew M.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Kunstler, Georges] Irstea, UR Ecosyst Montagnards, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Canham, Charles D.; Murphy, Lora] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Ruscoe, Wendy A.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Wright, Elaine F.] Dept Conservat, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Gaxiola, Aurora; Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Gaxiola, Aurora] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago, Chile","Forsyth, DM (corresponding author), Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm & Primary Ind, 123 Brown St, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia.",dave.forsyth@depi.vic.gov.au,"Kunstler, Georges/F-9179-2012; Canham, Charles D/F-6161-2011; Wilson, Deborah J/B-8651-2008; Ruscoe, Wendy A./A-5273-2018","Kunstler, Georges/0000-0002-2544-1940; Canham, Charles D/0000-0001-8361-9148; Ruscoe, Wendy A./0000-0002-7763-0356; Gormley, Andrew/0000-0001-9833-7012; Coomes, David/0000-0002-8261-2582; Easdale, Tomas/0000-0001-5086-8527; Wilson, Deborah/0000-0002-6401-3092",New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation via Ecosystem Resilience Outcome-Based Investment [C09X0502]; New Zealand Department of Conservation; Natural Environmental Research Council (UK)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; University of CambridgeUniversity of Cambridge,"This research was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation via Ecosystem Resilience Outcome-Based Investment (Contract C09X0502), investment of Landcare Research's retained earnings, the New Zealand Department of Conservation, the Natural Environmental Research Council (UK), the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, and University of Cambridge.

One possible mechanism thereby is resource partitioning, where each species utilizes a distinct subset of the most limited resource. This resource partitioning is difficult to investigate using empirical research in nature, as only few species are primarily limited by solely one resource, rather than a combination of multiple factors. One exception are the shell-dwelling hermit crabs, which are known to be limited under natural conditions and in suitable habitats primarily by the availability of gastropod shells. In the present study, we used two co-occurring terrestrial hermit crab species, Coenobita rugosus and C. perlatus, to investigate how resource partitioning is realized in nature and whether it could be a driver of coexistence. Results Field sampling of eleven separated hermit crab populations showed that the two co-occurring hermit crab species inhabit the same beach habitat but utilize a distinct subset of the shell resource. Preference experiments and principal component analysis of the shell morphometric data thereby revealed that the observed utilization patterns arise out of different intrinsic preferences towards two distinct shell shapes. While C. rugosus displayed a preference towards a short and globose shell morphology, C. perlatus showed preferences towards an elongated shell morphology with narrow aperture. Conclusion The two terrestrial hermit crab species occur in the same habitat but have evolved different preferences towards distinct subsets of the limiting shell resource. Resource partitioning might therefore be the main driver of their ecological differentiation, which ultimately allowed these co-occurring species to coexist in their environment. As the preferred shell morphology of C. rugosus maximizes reproductive output at the expense of protection, while the preferred shell morphology of C. perlatus maximizes protection against predation at the expense of reproductive output, shell resource partitioning might reflect different strategies to respond to the same set of selective pressures occurring in beach habitats. This work offers empirical support for the competitive exclusion principle-hypothesis and demonstrates that hermit crabs are an ideal model organism to investigate resource partitioning in natural populations.","[Laforsch, Christian] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; BayCEER, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Laforsch, C (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",christian.laforsch@uni-bayreuth.de,"Steibl, Sebastian/ABE-8074-2020","Steibl, Sebastian/0000-0003-4819-8581",Max Weber-Programm-scholarship,"Financial support for accommodation during the field study by the Max Weber-Programm-scholarship.

To investigate the mechanisms that permit coexistence, we studied two species of coexisting agamid lizards that exhibit striking divergence in their use of habitat in the Simpson Desert of central Australia. Here, the military dragon Ctenophorus isolepis is restricted primarily to sites providing >30% cover of hard spinifex Triodia basedowii, whereas the central netted dragon C. nuchalis occurs in areas with much sparser (<10%) cover. We constructed four mechanistic models to explain this pattern and then derived hypotheses to test them. One hypothesis, that competition restricts each species to its preferred habitat, was rejected after dyad encounters in field enclosures failed to elicit any habitat shift or any overt interactions between the species. Our next hypotheses were that each species exhibits preferences for different thermal environments or different prey types and that each selects the habitats that maximize access to them. Both were supported. C. isolepis preferred lower temperatures when active arid specialized in eating ants <5 mm long and selected spinifex-dominated areas where these requirements were met. In contrast, C. nuchalis preferred higher temperatures and a diversity of prey, both of which were available mostly in open areas. Finally, we used plasticine models to test the hypothesis that each species faced lower risk of predation in its selected habitat. This was partly supported, as models of both species were attacked more often in the open than under spinifex cover. The results show that habitat divergence Occurs along several, probably covarying, niche axes. We suggest that different levels of spinifex cover provide the template for a broad range of ecological interactions, allowing lizard species to partition biotic and abiotic resources and achieve the extraordinarily high levels of local diversity that are observed.","[Daly, Benjamin G.; Dickman, Chris R.; Crowther, Mathew S.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Wildlife Res, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Daly, BG (corresponding author), 8-2 Martins Ave, Bondi Jct, NSW 2026, Australia.",ben_daly18@hotmail.com,"Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019; Crowther, Mathew/M-7406-2013","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730; Crowther, Mathew/0000-0001-8968-1161",,,,71,43,43,0,39,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2008,89,1,,,,,65,76,,10.1890/06-1991.1,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,270JN,WOS:000253717200009,18376548,,,,2021-09-23,

As predatory effectiveness is influenced by the presence of other dominant ant species, understanding the ecological factors at work in agroecosystems lies at the basis of conservation biological control. Over three and a half years, the effect of ground vegetation management on the beneficial tree-nesting ant Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille) and its competitor, the ground-nesting ant, Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius), was studied in a citrus orchard in Tanzania. When ground vegetation was present, P megacephala tolerated O. longinoda and to some extent cohabited with this ant in citrus trees. However, after clean cultivation, P. megacephala displaced O. longinoda from tree crowns and became the sole occupant of the majority of trees. Displacement could be reversed by reversing the weed management regime, but this took time. Two years after the establishment of ground vegetation about half of the trees were colonized by Oecophylla only. Maintaining ground vegetation in tree crop plantations benefits the establishment and abundance of Oecophylla over Pheidole and is recommended in order to improve the efficiency of biological control of tree pests. The use of Amdro ant bait (hydramethylnon) to control P. megacephala is discussed. Boosting agroecological innovations, such as the one described in this paper, could benefit smallholder producers.

We investigate potential benefits and costs of a common and varied morphological trait, cuticular spines, for foraging behavior, interspecific competition, and predator-prey interactions in naturally co-occurring spiny ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Polyrhachis) in an experimental setting. We expect that a defensive trait like spines might be associated with more conspicuous foraging, a greater number of workers sent out to forage, and potentially increased competitive ability. Alternatively, consistent with the ecological trade-off hypothesis, we expect that investment in spines for antipredator defense might be negatively correlated with these other ecological traits. We find little evidence for any costs to ecological traits, instead finding that species with longer spines either outperform or do not differ from species with shorter spines for all tested metrics, including resource discovery rate and foraging effort as well as competitive ability and antipredator defense. Spines appear to confer broad antipredator benefits and serve as a form of defense with undetectable costs to key ecological abilities like resource foraging and competitive ability, providing an explanation for both the ecological success of the study genus and the large number of evolutionary origins of this trait across all ants. This study also provides a rare quantitative empirical test of ecological effects related to a morphological trait in ants.","[Blanchard, Benjamin D.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Blanchard, Benjamin D.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Dept Sci & Educ, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Nakamura, Akihiro; Cao, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun, Peoples R China; [Chen, Stephanie T.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC USA; [Moreau, Corrie S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol & Ecol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Moreau, Corrie S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA","Blanchard, BD (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",bblanchard@fieldmuseum.org,"Nakamura, Akihiro/O-8384-2018","Nakamura, Akihiro/0000-0001-7349-5102; Blanchard, Benjamin/0000-0002-7747-6934; Moreau, Corrie/0000-0003-1139-5792","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-1614105, DEB-1701352, IOS-1916995]","We express our gratitude to XTBG for extensive logistical support, especially Hui Xian, Yi Wan, Hui Wang, and Xiao Yang.

A model for evolution of body size under asymmetric competition within and between species is described. The model links processes operating at the scale of the individual to that of macroscopic evolution through a stochastic mutation-selection process. Phase portraits of evolution in a phenotype space characteristically show character convergence and parallel character shifts, with character divergence being relatively uncommon. The asymptotic states of evolution depend very much on the properties of asymmetric competition. Given relatively weak asymmetries between species, a single equilibrium point exists; this is a local attractor, and its position is determined by the intra- and interspecific asymmetries. When the asymmetries are made stronger, several fixed points may come about, creating further equilibrium points which are local attractors. It is also possible for periodic attractors to occur; such attractors comprise Red Queen dynamics with phenotype values that continue to change without ever settling down to constant values. From certain initial conditions, evolution leading to extinction of one of the species is also a likely outcome.","LEIDEN UNIV, INST EVOLUT & ECOL SCI, NL-2300 AA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","Law, R (corresponding author), UNIV YORK, DEPT BIOL, YORK YO1 5DD, N YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.",,"Dieckmann, Ulf/E-1424-2011","Dieckmann, Ulf/0000-0001-7089-0393; Marrow, Paul/0000-0001-9335-6433",,,,60,77,79,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

The spatial distributions of these beetles at the microhabitat scale were negatively correlated. We performed a removal experiment, progressively removing first 25% and then a further 25% of the population of the most abundant species, P. globosa, under the trees where most of the preferred food of both species is concentrated. There was no response of O. rugatipennis to this removal in the tree habitat. In the open, barely-vegetated habitat where most O. rugatipennis are found, the number of this species caught in pitfall traps increased following both removals and decreased following P. globosa replacement under the trees. It appears that intraspecific competition forces some P. globosa to occupy the open habitat. Interspecific competition between P. globosa and O. rugatipennis in the open habitat reduces the number of O. rugatipennis that can co-exist with P. globosa there. Removal of P. globosa under the trees allows conspecifics in the open habitat to move under the trees, releasing O. rugatipennis in the open habitat from competition. This then results in an increase in the numbers of O. rugatipennis in the open habitat as a result of immigration from neighbouring areas. We found that differences in foraging efficiency, measured as giving-up times in artificial food patches, create a likely mechanism of co-existence that explains the distinct preferences of these two species for tree and open habitats.","DESERT ECOL RES UNIT NAMIBIA,SWAKOPMUND 9000,NAMIBIA",,,"Seely, Mary Kathryn/AAI-1072-2019; Ward, David/E-9814-2010",,,,,64,14,14,0,14,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

When eggs of two or more species are deposited at the same time and patch, one can expect a high density of early-instar larvae. Thus, interspecific interactions should be evident. We studied the interaction of two species, Sympetrum fonscolombii and Orthetrum cancellatum, which typically co-occur in French rice fields. We experimentally simulated the laying of egg clutches of both species at the same time and site. Survival of O. cancellatum was reduced compared with that of controls without S. fonscolombii and also with that of S. fonscolombii in the two-species treatment. At the end of the experiment, mean head width of S. fonscolombii was greater than that of O. cancellatum, which may be one reason for the differential survival. In a second experiment we observed the behaviour of pairs of early-instar larvae of both species in different size combinations. Small larvae of S. fonscolombii reduced locomotory activity in the presence of larger O. cancellatum. In contrast, small O. cancellatum did not do so in the presence of larger S. fonscolombii. This behavioural difference may also cause asymmetric interspecific predation.","Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Zool, D-38092 Braunschweig, Germany","Suhling, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Zool, Fasanenstr 3, D-38092 Braunschweig, Germany.",f.suhling@tu-bs.de,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261",,,,56,16,18,1,11,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Den site selection is often based on fitness related criteria like escape from predators, food availability and shelter from extreme weather conditions. African wild dogs are cooperative breeders that use a den to give birth to their offspring. They often co-exist with lions and spotted hyenas, both of which are known to kill African wild dog pups. Little is known about den site selection by African wild dogs. In this study, we compared vegetation characteristics and distribution of roads and waterholes around den sites and random sites, in areas with high and low lion and spotted hyena densities. In both areas, African wild dogs selected den sites in closed woodland with little visibility, which is likely to reduce detection by predators, increase the likelihood of escape when detected, and might provide shelter from extreme weather conditions. In the high predator density area, African wild dogs seemed to spatially avoid predators by selecting den sites in this type of habitat relatively further away from waterholes and roads. African wild dogs have high energetic costs of gestation. Therefore, even when predation risk is relatively low, they are likely to try to maximise their fitness by choosing a den site in habitat that will provide optimal protection for their offspring, leaving little additional options to respond to a higher predation pressure.

The effects of trahira density (treatment groups: addition, removal, and reference) in two habitat categories (open and macrophyte-covered areas) on attributes of the fish assemblage structure were evaluated (using rm-ANOVA) over 120 days. Reductions in species richness were recorded in all assemblages and were more pronounced at the end of the experiment within macrophyte-covered areas of the lakes where H. aff. malabaricus was removed. In these lakes, the number of fish was also significantly smaller and evenness was significantly higher than in those in which trahira were added or maintained at natural densities. The increase of the relative abundance of all size classes over the first 60 days on the assemblages where trahira was present, and the decrease of the small-sized fish where trahira was absent contributed to the lack of pronounced alterations in total biomass. The absence of the predator from its preferred habitat was found to negatively affect the less abundant species, which seemed to be highly sensitive to the effects of interspecific competition among prey species. In addition to the well-known effects of hydrological seasonality, the role played by native predators might be important in determining the persistence of local species in the fish assemblages of Neotropical floodplains.","[Petry, Ana Cristina] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-27910970 Macae, RJ, Brazil; [Gomes, Luiz Carlos; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio] Univ Estadual Maringa, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Piana, Pitagoras Augusto] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, R Fac, BR-85903000 Toledo, PR, Brazil","Petry, AC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, R Rotary Club Sn,CP 119331, BR-27910970 Macae, RJ, Brazil.",ac_petry@yahoo.com.br; lcgomes@nupelia.uem.br; pitapiana@yahoo.com.br; agostinhoaa@nupelia.uem.br,"Agostini, Angelo/D-5888-2013; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Petry, Ana/J-6851-2012; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/S-1538-2019; Inau, Inct/J-9853-2013","Agostini, Angelo/0000-0002-4707-9444; Petry, Ana/0000-0001-9039-2738; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/0000-0002-4707-9444; gomes, Luiz/0000-0001-7295-723X; Piana, Pitagoras Augusto/0000-0002-4666-6663",National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [142220/2001-9],"This study is part of the PhD dissertation of ACP, in the Program of Environmental Sciences, of the Maringa State University, in the long-term program PELD Site-6.

By relying on deception, these adaptations increase the chances of avoiding physical contact that may otherwise have very high fitness costs. One such deceptive behaviour is the popularly-known neck flattening, or hooding, observed in some snakes. Hooding consists in the lateral expansion and dorso-ventral flattening of the neck, which creates the impression of a bigger opponent during confrontations. This trait is highly characteristic of cobras (Elapidae family). However, neck flattening is not exclusive to elapids, and has in fact been observed in a few other snake lineages, including some species of the families Lamprophiidae and Colubridae. Here, we present the first report of hooding behaviour in the South American colubrid genus Philodryas, based on field observations conducted on the Chilean species P. chamissonis (the long-tailed snake).

Here we report on studies comparing the aphids Aphis nerii and A. asclepiadis that feed sympatrically on the milkweed Asclepias syriaca in northeastern North America. We sought to identify tradeoffs among species' attributes that might promote coexistence, but in most instances A. nerii was superior to A. asclepiadis. Aphis nerii was 84% more fecund, fed upon 880% more phloem sap, and was affected 70% less by intraspecific competition as compared to A. asclepiadis. In interspecific competition, A. nerii reduced A. asclepiadis abundance by 77%, whereas A. asclepiadis did not affect A. nerii. In dispersal trials, 10% of winged A. nerii but only 1% of A. asclepiadis successfully moved from non-host plants to A. syriaca. We also investigated whether there were differences in aphid interactions with milkweed cardenolides. Jasmonic acid increased milkweed cardenolides by 33%, a realistic amount similar to that induced by several leaf-chewing herbivores. Nevertheless, jasmonate-induced cardenolides failed to affect aphid performance and aphid feeding had no effect on milkweed cardenolide concentration. Yet cardenolides were important for aphid resistance to predators; A. nerii sequestered 25% more cardenolides and was preyed upon 50% less than A. asclepiadis. Interactions with cardenolides thus again favored A. nerii over A. asclepiadis. Given that A. nerii and A. asclepiadis are decidedly not equivalent in their demography, competitive ability, defense and dispersal, our results strongly refute the notion that neutral processes can explain coexistence of these aphids. Based on field observations, we propose two tradeoffs - timing of milkweed colonization and relationships with ants - as putative mechanisms for the coexistence of these congeners.","[Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Mooney, Kailen A.; Jones, Patricia; Agrawal, Anurag A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Mooney, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mooneyk@tritrophic.org,"Agrawal, Anurag A/Y-2497-2019","Agrawal, Anurag A/0000-0003-0095-1220",,,,53,53,59,0,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2008,117,3,,,,,450,458,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16284.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,269FE,WOS:000253634100016,,,,,2021-09-23,

Competition between two species in a metapopulation involves each inhibiting the other's ability firstly to colonize an already occupied area and then to persist in it. Models for regional competition of this kind have 3-D dynamics, from which it has proved difficult to extract useful predictions except for special conditions. We introduce a 2-D general model for species that are equally vigorous at inhibiting the ability of others to remain in an occupied patch as to arrive there. The model covers the full spectrum of competitive interactions, from weak to strong and symmetrical to asymmetrical. Its Lotka-Volterra dynamics extend the general theory of competitive coexistence by generating clear predictions for community structure, amenable to cross-system comparisons and experimental manipulations. 2. Previous 2-D models of interactions between dominant and fugitive species are special cases of the 2-D general model. Moderately asymmetrical competition has two outcomes distinctly different from dominant-fugitive interactions, at both the scale of metapopulation and population: (i) slow growing and weak competitors coexist with faster growing superior competitors, albeit at reduced densities; and (b) habitat removal always yields relative gains in abundance for species with higher growth capacity, but the gains are absolute only for species subjected to competitive impacts that exceed within-species impacts. Extinctions of slow growing and weak competitors provide the most sensitive indication of habitat degradation, and their losses also have the least effect on community structure. 3. The 2-D general model further predicts that highly productive communities will tolerate differences between species in their capacity for population growth, whereas less productive communities will tolerate stronger competitive interactions between species. This prediction applies equally to a population of resource consumers as to a metapopulation of colonists. The model explicitly links local and regional population dynamics to r-K selection in community structure by predicting a prevalence of growth-orientated species in resource-poor habitats and competition-orientated species in resource-rich habitats.","Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Dept Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Doncaster, CP (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Bassett Crescent E, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England.",cpd@soton.ac.uk,"Doncaster, C.

Here, we explored the FRs of two land snails that occur in south-western Ontario, one native (Mesodon thyroidus) and one non-indigenous (Cepaea nemoralis) to Canada. The non-indigenous species appears to have low ecological impact and inferior competitive abilities. Consistent with theory, while both species conformed to Type II functional responses, the native species had a significantly higher attack rate (5.30 vs 0.41, respectively) and slightly lower handling time (0.020 vs 0.023), and hence a higher maximum feeding rate (50.0 vs 43.5). The non-indigenous species exhibited a significantly longer time to contact for a variety of food types, and appeared less discriminating of paper that was offered as a non-food type. The non-indigenous species also ate significantly less food when in mixed species trials with the native snail. These feeding patterns match the known low ecological impact of the introduced snail and are consistent with the view that it is an inferior competitor relative to the native species. However, field experimentation is required to clarify whether the largely microallopatric distributions of the two species in south-western Ontario reflect competitive dominance by the native species or other factors such as habitat preference, feeding preferences or predator avoidance. The relative patterns of feeding behaviour and ecological impact are, however, fully in line with recent functional response theory and application.","[Hoxha, Tedi; Crookes, Steve; MacIsaac, Ian; Chang, Xuexiu; Johansson, Mattias; MacIsaac, Hugh J.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Crookes, Steve] Univ Guelph, Biodivers Inst Ontario, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Chang, Xuexiu; MacIsaac, Hugh J.] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Johansson, Mattias] Univ North Georgia, Dept Biol, Gainesville, GA USA; [Dick, Jaimie T.

The biology of N. diversicolor is brief-iv reviewed and data from field experiments are presented demonstrating significant negative effects of worm abundance on transplanted S. anglica biomass. Laboratory-based experiments demonstrated significant negative effects of N. diversicolor abundance on the survival of S. anglica seeds transplanted to sediment cores.

Where competition interacts with anthropogenic habitat modification, this natural ecosystem process can become a threatening process. Understanding the mechanisms behind competition in such cases is essential for the formulation of cost-effective management responses for biodiversity conservation. According to the resource availability hypothesis of competition, interference competition limits access to resources by species vulnerable to such aggression and wastes energy in evasive responses. Studying competition is notoriously difficult, however, empirical evidence of the resource availability theory is limited, and there are few published experimental studies showing such an effect at larger scales. We present the results of a controlled and replicated empirical study of interference competition at a landscape scale. We removed an aggressive, overabundant native bird, Manorina melanocephala (noisy miner), whose interference competition is a threatening process for small woodland birds in the highly modified agricultural landscapes of eastern Australia. We monitored foraging and harassment rates of small woodland birds before and after removal to indicate if levels of interference competition changed. Due to unexpected immediate recolonisation, abundance of M. melanocephala in treatment sites declined by only 34% relative to control sites. Twenty-four bird species displayed aggressive behaviour towards other birds and 41 bird species were victims of aggression. Manorina melanocephala was responsible for 66% of all aggressive interactions. After removal, we recorded a doubling in foraging rate of small woodland birds in treatment compared to control sites. This appears to confirm the resource availability hypothesis of competition. Paradoxically, however, increased foraging was not accompanied by a decline in harassment. Low detection rates of harassment of small woodland birds, combined with the modest reduction in abundance of M. melanocephala, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between rates of harassment and rates of foraging.","[Beggs, Richard; Pierson, Jennifer; Tulloch, Ayesha I.

We have studied whether these effects could alter the probability of local extinction of three predatory mites naturally associated with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in citrus in Spain and, therefore, disrupt the biological control of this phytophagous mite. Laboratory and semi-field results provide evidence that the natural regulation of T. urticae in citrus can be seriously disrupted in a warmer future. On the one hand, T. urticae populations at conditions representative of future hotter and drier summers, could reach higher population densities than forecasted according to its demographic parameters. On the other hand, T. urticae regulation provided by its predators depended on the environmental conditions, was species-specific, and was affected by interspecific interactions. In some cases, one of the predatory mite species in the system could not be recovered. Because there is evidence that the composition of the community under scrutiny is highly sensitive to local habitat conditions, our results can be taken as evidence that local extinctions may occur more frequently in a warmer future and further contribute to an increasingly higher frequency of T. urticae outbreaks.","[Urbaneja-Bernat, Pablo; Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina; Jaques, Josep A.] UJI, Unitat Associada Entomol UJI IVIA, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Campus Riu Sec,Ave Vicent Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Ibanez-Gual, Victoria] UJI, Dept Matemat, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Montserrat, Marta] Univ Malaga, Inst Hortofruticultura Subtrop & Mediterranea La, Consejo Super Invest Cient IHSM UMA CSIC, Avda Dr Weinberg S-N, Malaga 29750, Spain; [Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina] SAU, Dept Calidad Torres Hnos & Sucs, Pol Ind Agr 2, Almenara 12590, Spain","Jaques, JA (corresponding author), UJI, Unitat Associada Entomol UJI IVIA, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Campus Riu Sec,Ave Vicent Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",josep.jaques@camn.uji.es,"Urbaneja-Bernat, Pablo/K-9298-2014; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/AAG-1438-2020; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/J-7922-2017; Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina/F-6359-2011; Jaques, Josep A./B-8352-2009; Montserrat, Marta/A-7625-2012","Urbaneja-Bernat, Pablo/0000-0002-6995-5468; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/0000-0001-7043-8233; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/0000-0001-7043-8233; Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina/0000-0002-1070-3741; Jaques, Josep A./0000-0003-1353-1727; Montserrat, Marta/0000-0002-6859-4955","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, MINECO [AGL2011-30538-C03-01, AGL2014-55616-C3-3-R]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, MCINNSpanish Government [EEBB-I-14-08555]","This study was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, MINECO, (Grants AGL2011-30538-C03-01 and AGL2014-55616-C3-3-R) and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, MCINN, (Grant EEBB-I-14-08555).",,83,4,4,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

However, some predator-prey relationships may still remain undetected, due to the difficulty of observing rare predation events. We report the first observation of predation of arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) pups by common ravens (Corvus corax). The predation event was witnessed on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, through an automatic camera placed on a den. On June 8, 2013, the day following pup emergence from the den, the complete litter of four was killed and taken away by a pair of ravens despite the intermittent presence of the mother. This event lasted 2.5 h, occurred during a low lemming year, and resulted in the fox pair failing their reproduction. Only two other fox litters were present that summer in our 600 km(2) study area, so this litter predated by ravens accounted for 25 % (4/16) of the pups produced. Our report shows how continuous monitoring of dens using automatic cameras can allow documentation of rare events. In addition to food competition and cache raiding, pup predation contributes to the antagonistic interactions between arctic foxes and ravens in the High Arctic, which may intensify during low lemming years. This observation allows a better understanding of species interactions within the Arctic predator guild.","[Chevallier, Clement; Lai, Sandra; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Ctr Northern Studies, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Chevallier, Clement; Lai, Sandra; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada","Chevallier, C; Berteaux, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Ctr Northern Studies, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.; Chevallier, C; Berteaux, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",chevallier.clement@gmail.com; dominique_berteaux@uqar.ca,"Lai, Sandra/AAL-5346-2021","Lai, Sandra/0000-0003-0128-3738; Chevallier, Clement/0000-0002-0956-5978",Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies (FRQNT); Kenneth M Molson Foundation; Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada ArcticNet; Northern Ecosystem Initiative (Environment Canada); Northern Scientific Training Program (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada); NSERC CREATE training program in northern environmental sciences EnviroNorth; Nunavut Wildlife Management Board; Parks Canada Agency; Polar Continental Shelf Program (Natural Resources Canada)Natural Resources Canada,"We thank the many field workers who collected data on Bylot Island.

Throughout Caribbean reefs, fairy basslets Gramma loreto and blackcap basslets G. melacara are segregated by depth with a narrow zone of overlap. Local populations of these planktivores are found under isolated reef ledges, where fairy basslets compete with conspecifics for access to prime feeding positions at the outer edges. I investigated the existence, mechanisms, and effects of interspecific competition on the local distribution and demography of basslets. I documented aggression and feeding rates of both species and conducted a reciprocal removal experiment comparing the re sponse of each basslet in competitor-removal versus unmanipulated populations of both species. Positioning of both basslets under ledges was consistent with an overall size hierarchy, with larger fish progressively closer to the outer edges of ledges. Fairy basslets were more aggressive, yet competition had symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species. Interference between species drove juveniles further back under ledges, where feeding and growth rates of individuals were reduced. Competition had no effect on the density of basslets during this 8 wk experiment. Aggression occurred between larger basslets, but with no consequential effects on any parameters measured. This study demonstrates sym metrical effects of interspecific competition on juvenile coral-reef fishes, a phenomenon that has rarely been documented previously.","[Kindinger, Tye L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",kindingt@science.oregonstate.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-08-51162, OCE-12-33027]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This study was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants to M.

This may be important in Madagascar, as lemurs face diminishing resources due to deforestation. We examined the range overlap and spatiotemporal relationships of three species of frugivorous lemur in the fragmented forests of Kianjavato, Madagascar. We conducted simultaneous location and behaviour sampling of black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, red-fronted lemurs, Eulemur rufifrons, and red-bellied lemurs, Eulemur rubriventer, at two sites over a period of 11 months. We used Doncaster's index of dynamic interaction to investigate the relative amount of time species spent within 30 m and 100 m of each other, compared to the time expected based on random use of location points. All three species showed low core range overlap compared to home range overlap, and while core overlap was higher between interspecific groups than intraspecific groups, the difference was not substantial. Conversely, no spatiotemporal avoidance was observed, and red-fronted lemurs showed positive association (indicating possible attraction) with both red-bellied and ruffed lemurs. These positive spatiotemporal associations may be related to shared resource use in small forests, or predation avoidance strategies.

Populations of coral reef fish are structurally complex, so it is important to understand how these populations are shaped as a result of an individual's suite of traits and those of its competitors. We conducted a 2 x 2 factorial field experiment that manipulated body condition (high or low, manipulated through a feeding regime) and residency (resident or intruder, where the resident arrived at the habitat 3 h before the intruder) to evaluate effects on competitive ability and survival. Prior residency alleviated the disadvantage of a low body condition with respect to aggression, which was similar between low-condition residents and high-condition intruders. However, high-condition residents displayed a significantly greater level of aggression than intruders, regardless of whether intruders were from high- or low-condition treatments. For intruders to have a high probability of becoming dominant, they needed to have a large body condition advantage. Mortality trajectories suggested that body condition modified the effect of prior residency, and intruders were more likely to suffer mortality if they had a low body condition because residents pushed them away from shelter. Our results highlight that the negative effects of some traits may be compensated for by the positive effects of other traits, and that the specific ecological context an individual faces (such as the characteristics of its competitors) can have a major influence on successful establishment and persistence.","[Poulos, Davina E.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Poulos, Davina E.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Poulos, DE (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",davina.poulos@my.jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council,"We would like to thank L.

Therefore, the effects of predation can be both consumptive and nonconsumptive and prey need to assess and respond appropriately to predation risk which in turn varies with environmental and social contexts. We tested the effects of predator density and diel cycle on the consumption, interspecific interactions and behavioural responses of a prey species, the native Australian glass shrimp, Paratya australiensis, exposed to a predator, the invasive eastern mosquito fish, Gambusia holbrooki. In the laboratory, P. australiensis were exposed to low or high densities of conspecifics or predators and observed during the day and at night. While P. australiensis experienced more interspecific approaches and nips when exposed to a high density of G. holbrooki and during the day, neither predator density nor diel cycle influenced the actual number of P. australiensis consumed. Similarly, while P. australiensis engaged in significantly more shelter use and swam less, there was no difference in these behaviours in relation to predator density and diel cycle. Foraging by P. australiensis was not related to species composition, but instead depended on the overall number of animals present with more P. australiensis foraging when exposed to a high density of conspecifics and G. holbrooki. These results indicate that the mechanisms by which G. holbrooki exerts negative effects on P. australiensis can be multiple and wide ranging, from direct predation to a reduction in activity and competition for resources. However, as neither predator density nor diurnal variation altered predation rate, P. australiensis did behave in an adaptive manner, by only adjusting its behavioural responses in proportion to the direct risk of predation.

For this purpose, we used single-species and two-species occupancy models using records of D. albiventris, considered the dominant species, and D. aurita from a cameratrap survey conducted in an agricultural and conservation landscape in the Atlantic Forest of Argentina. We evaluated which factors determined the probability of species occurrence: habitat preferences or interspecific relationships. We also estimated the overlap in daily activity patterns between species, and evaluated changes in D. aurita activity in response to the occupancy probability of D. albiventris. Didelphis aurita had higher occupancy probabilities in the continuous native forest, whereas D. albiventris had higher occupancy probabilities in fragmented forests with less complex and more open vegetation structure, and greater proximity to buildings. Both opossums were almost absent in pine plantations. Results of the co-occurrence models and the overlap in diel activity suggest that D. aurita is not avoiding D. albiventris. Occurrences of these two opossums most probably reflect different adaptations by each species to different habitats, and competitive interactions seem to play a minor role in shaping their current distributions. Didelphis albiventris may be replacing D. aurita mainly as a result of changing environmental conditions, which become unfavorable to the latter but promote the creation of new habitat for the former.","[Cruz, Paula; Eugenia Iezzi, Maria; De Angelo, Carlos; Varela, Diego; Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, CONICET, Inst Biol Subtrop, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina; [Cruz, Paula; Eugenia Iezzi, Maria; De Angelo, Carlos; Varela, Diego; Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Asociac Civil Ctr Invest Bosque Atlantico, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina; [Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Bertoni 124, RA-3380 Eldorado, Misiones, Argentina","Cruz, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, CONICET, Inst Biol Subtrop, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina.; Cruz, P (corresponding author), Asociac Civil Ctr Invest Bosque Atlantico, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina.",policruz@hotmail.com,,"Varela, Diego/0000-0003-3123-6756","Ministry of Ecology of Misiones Province; Fundacion Vida Silvestre Argentina; National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), Cataratas del Iguazu International Airport, Argentine Army; Department of Forestry and Renewable Forest Resources; ESRI Conservation Program; Society for Conservation GIS - UCAR (Unidad para el Cambio Rural); Ministerio de Agroindustria, Argentina [10102]; ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Argentina) through PICTANPCyT [1904]; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 2012-2014.112-201101-00616]; Project UE IBS [22920160100130CO]; Ministerio de Ecologia de Misiones through Proyecto de Implementacion del Plan de Manejo del Parque Provincial Uruguai [256/09]","We are grateful to all the students and park rangers that helped us with the field activities, especially to J.

We examined the partitioning of cavity resources by Red-and-green Macaws (Ara chloropterus), Blue-and-yellow Macaws (A. ararauna), and Scarlet Macaws (A. macao) in the lowland forest of southeast Peru. Red-and-green Macaws nested primarily in cavities in emergent Dipteryx trees, and Blue-and-yellow Macaws nested predominantly in palm snags. Scarlet Macaws had the broadest nesting niche, and their use of cavities overlapped that of the other two species. These differences in cavity use may be related to differences in size, with Red-and-green Macaws the largest of the three species (90 cm long, 1050-1320 g), followed by Scarlet Macaws (85 cm long, 1060-1123 g) and Blue-and-yellow Macaws (70 cm long, 1086 g). We did not observe interspecific conflicts between Blue-and-yellow Macaws and the other two species. However, Scarlet and Red-and-green macaws frequently compete for cavities, perhaps contributing to the use of a wider range of cavity resources by the smaller, less competitive Scarlet Macaws. For the three macaw species combined, 40 of 84 nests (48%) were successful, fledging either one or two young (mean = 1.4 +/- 0.43). The overall reproductive output (including failed nests) was 0.60 +/- 0.68 fledglings per nesting pair, with no difference between macaw species (P > 0.18). A lack of alternative nest substrates for large macaws may drive resource partitioning by sympatric species, with specialization on either emergent trees or palm snags, whereas less competitive species like Scarlet Macaws need to be flexible and use a variety of nest sites.","[Renton, Katherine] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Estac Biol Chamela, San Patricio 48980, Jalisco, Mexico; [Brightsmith, Donald J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Vet Pathol, Schubot Exot Bird Hlth Ctr, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Renton, K (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Estac Biol Chamela, Aptdo Postal 21, San Patricio 48980, Jalisco, Mexico.",krenton@ibiologia.unam.mx,,"Brightsmith, Donald/0000-0002-3306-6490","Wildlife Conservation Society (Manu); Earthwatch Institute, Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center; Rainforest Expeditions (Tambopata); Nacional de Recursos Naturales (INRENA) in Peru","The research was supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society (Manu), Earthwatch Institute, Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center, and Rainforest Expeditions (Tambopata).

Larval amphibians are model organisms to investigate the balancing of life history trade-offs because individuals must metamorphose before a wetland dries. Therefore, we deployed enclosures in a natural wetland to investigate the interactive effects of Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) density (50 or 100 tadpoles) and Brook Stickleback (Culaea inconstans) presence on survival and growth of tadpoles. We hypothesized that the effects of conspecific density on tadpole survival and growth would be dependent on the presence of fish predators. Stickleback predation significantly decreased Wood Frog survival; however, a trend of higher tadpole survival with fish was detected at high conspecific densities. Wood Frog time to and mass at metamorphosis was not significantly affected by either conspecific density or stickleback presence. Our results demonstrate that Brook Sticklebacks can play a significant role in regulating Wood Frog survival in a Subarctic wetland, but the impact is likely dependent on tadpole density. Therefore, this research highlights the dynamic and complex effects of competition and predation in a Subarctic wetland. Our study also contributes to the limited understanding of factors affecting amphibian community structure in Subarctic wetlands.","[Davenport, Jon M.] Southeast Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, One Univ Plaza, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA; [Seiwert, Phillip A.; Ben Cash, W.] Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Biol, 201 Donaghey Ave, Conway, AR 72035 USA; [Fishback, LeeAnn] Churchill Northern Studies Ctr, POB 610, Churchill, MB R0B 0E0, Canada","Davenport, JM (corresponding author), Southeast Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, One Univ Plaza, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA.",jdavenport@semo.edu; pseiwert1@uca.edu; fishback@churchillscience.ca; wbcash@uca.edu,"Davenport, Jon M/AAG-8457-2020","Davenport, Jon M/0000-0002-9911-2779",CNSC; Earthwatch Institute; University of Central Arkansas,"We thank Earthwatch Institute participants from the summer of 2013 and D.

One such predator is the relict isopod Saduria entomon L., which is faced with a choice of prey organisms of varying ecological origin, including marine or estuarine species on the one hand, and limnic species on the other. In clearly sublittoral areas S. entomon has no principal invertebrate competitors for food, but in shallow water regions odonata larvae may play a similar regulatory role on the benthic community. Against this background, the structuring role of S. entomon for the benthic infauna in shallow brackish waters was tested in relation to (a) one major invertebrate food competitor (Libellula quadrimaculata; Odonata), and (b) prey species of varying ecological origin (marine or estuarine, exemplified by Macoma balthica and Corophium volutator, and limnic, e.g. Asellus aquaticus and larval chironomids). Field and aquarium experiments illustrated that S. entomon is technically capable by predation to exhibit a regulatory pressure on all prey items offered, but that the effects at community level are difficult to distinguish from the natural variation within the ecosystem. On shallow bottoms S. entomon exhibits similar predatory effects to the larvae of the dragonfly L. quadrimaculata. It is concluded that S. entomon in shallow Baltic archipelagoes is something of a universal competitor, capable of affecting populations regardless of their functional origin.","ABO AKAD UNIV,HUSO BIOL STN,SF-20500 TURKU,FINLAND","SANDBERG, E (corresponding author), ABO AKAD UNIV,DEPT BIOL,SF-20500 TURKU,FINLAND.",,,"Bonsdorff, Erik/0000-0001-5070-4880",,,,33,12,12,0,4,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,HELSINKI,"UNIV HELSINKI P O BOX 17 (P.

We present the first simultaneous observations of at-sea behaviour and attendance patterns of 3 synchronously breeding, central place, krill foragers at Bouvetoya-a small, isolated, sub-Antarctic island in the South Atlantic. Time depth recorders and satellite transmitters were deployed during the austral summer of 2007/2008 on 47 lactating Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella (AFS) rearing pups and on 20 macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus (MAC) and 30 chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica penguins (CHIN) rearing chicks. All 3 species showed a strong preference for the west side of the island, and their foraging ranges overlapped markedly. Solar elevation influenced the timing of departures from, and arrivals to, the island with markedly different patterns between the seals and the penguins. Diving patterns also showed significant differences among the 3 species, with the frequency of diving being higher at night for the AFS, while both penguin species dove more frequently during the day. But a common, vertical diel pattern occurred in all 3 species, with shallow diving occurring at night and deep diving during the day, consistent with the vertical migration of krill. MACs targeted 2 depth layers for feeding, including a deep prey layer at similar to 70 m, which was not exploited by AFSs and CHINs. The results suggest that there is potential for competitive overlap among these 3 krill predators at Bouvetoya, but that it is reduced via both spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal partitioning of foraging areas.","[Blanchet, Marie-Anne; Biuw, Martin; Lydersen, Christian; Kovacs, Kit M.] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Hofmeyr, G.

However, the interspecific interactions that result in the negative impacts on native species tend to be poorly understood. One contributing factor to this knowledge gap may be that the vulnerability of native species can vary between different life-history stages. For example, the parental care phase is often risky both for the developing offspring and care-giving parents. Accordingly, we investigated the interactions between invasive mud crabs, Rhithropanopeus harrissii, and native nest-building littoral fish, with a special focus on the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus. Firstly, our field survey demonstrated that while the recently established mud crab and native nest-building fish have different habitat and depth optima, their distributions also have a considerable overlap, with a high potential for interactions between them. Secondly, our laboratory experiments indicate that the crabs are likely to impact the fish negatively, especially by taking over occupied nests, as well as pre-occupying nesting resources that are of very limited supply in the studied population. We did not find evidence for successful predation on eggs guarded by male sand gobies naive to the mud crabs. Collectively, the results suggest that the invasive crabs have high potential to negatively impact native fish. Furthermore, the results support the scenario that the parental phase can be a particularly vulnerable life-history stage in face of novel selection pressures, such as species invasions.","[Lehtonen, Topi K.; Vesakoski, Outi; Yli-Rosti, Juho] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Lehtonen, Topi K.; Saarinen, Anniina] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 25 Rainforest Walk, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Vesakoski, Outi] Univ Turku, Archipelago Res Inst, Turku 20014, Finland; [Saarinen, Anniina; Lindstrom, Kai] Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Tykistokatu 6, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland","Lehtonen, TK (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 25 Rainforest Walk, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",topilehtonen@gmail.com,"Lindstrom, Kai/ABG-4353-2020; Lehtonen, Topi/A-6679-2010; /B-5479-2008","Lindstrom, Kai/0000-0002-8356-5538; Lehtonen, Topi/0000-0002-1372-9509; /0000-0002-8356-5538; Vesakoski, Outi/0000-0002-7220-3347",Finnish Foundation for Nature Conservation; University of Turku; VIPU,"We thank the Finnish Foundation for Nature Conservation and the University of Turku for funding (to T.K.L.), and the Tvarminne Zoological Station staff for logistic support.

However, the possibility of early piscivory is assumed to depend on the hatch timing of the prey and predator. Two species, bream (2006) and roach (2007), were tested as the prey fish. The bream (hatching 12days after perch) were preyed upon by the perch, leading to the predicted development of two sizes of cohorts as well as to cannibalism. With roach (hatching simultaneously with perch), however, no piscivory or cannibalism occurred and the perch population was unimodally distributed. The results of this experimental pond study underpin recent theoretical findings that size differences between predator and prey, determined through differences in the timing of hatching as well as differences in juvenile growth rates, foster the occurrence of early piscivory in YOY perch that may lead to bimodality and finally to intra-cohort cannibalism.","[Heermann, L.; Borcherding, J.] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-46459 Rees Grietherbusch, Germany","Heermann, L (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Gen Ecol & Limnol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-46459 Rees Grietherbusch, Germany.",lisa.heermann@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG BO 1507/5-1, DFG BO 1507/5-2]","Our thanks go to all helping hands in the field and to three anonymous referees for their suggestions that helped to improve the manuscript substantially.

Shared enemies can also mediate non-reciprocal (-,0) indirect effects, i.e. indirect amensalism. whenever one prey species is not affected by the presence of alternative prey. We review 34 studies on terrestrial and freshwater systems to evaluate the extent to which apparent competition has been perceived as a reciprocal (-. -) or non-reciprocal (-,0) interaction. We found only three studies showing reciprocal effects between apparent competitors. Indirect amensalism was documented in 10 studies and could be inferred For 16 other cases (76% in total). The remaining five studies provided insufficient data to determine the form of indirect interaction. The apparent prevalence of non-reciprocal enemy-mediated interactions resembles that observed for resource-based interspecific competition. Amensal indirect effects via shared predation may result from differences in population size, nutritional value, susceptibility to attack, or asynchronous dynamics of alternative prey, or the predator's Feeding preferences. Moreover, experimental protocols may confound the actual form of apparent competition through short-term observations, incomplete designs, or biased consideration of conspicuous interactions, leading to reciprocal effects being overlooked. We conclude that. at present. it is still difficult to determine the relative role of apparent competition vs indirect amensalism in natural food webs because most published studies have failed to document in full interactions via shared enemies.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Chaneton, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Ecol, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,"Bonsall, Michael/0000-0003-0250-0423",,,,78,186,190,0,69,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2000,88,2,,,,,380,394,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880217.x,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,287QV,WOS:000085518000017,,,,,2021-09-23,

We identify 7 long-term studies of population changes in Myodes in North America. Using autoregressive and spectral analysis, we found that only 2 of the 7 show 3- to 5-year cycles like those found in some Eurasian populations. There was no relationship between latitude and cycling. The general lack of cyclicity is associated with two key aspects of their demography that act in tandem: first, poor overwinter survival in most years; second, chronically low densities, with irregular outbreak years. Eight factors might explain why some Myodes populations fluctuate in cycles and others fluctuate irregularly, and we review the evidence for each factor: food supplies, nutrients, predation, interspecific competition, disease, weather, spacing behavior and interactive effects. Of these eight, only food supplies appear to be sufficient to explain the differences between cyclic and non-cyclic populations. Irregular fluctuations are the result of pulsed food supplies in the form of berry crops (M. rutilus) or tree seeds (M. gapperi) linked to weather patterns. We argue that, to understand the cause for the patterns in the respective hemispheres, we must know the mechanism(s) driving population change and this must be linked to rigorous field tests. We suggest that a large-scale, year-round feeding experiment should improve overwintering survival, increase standing densities, and flip non-cyclic Myodes populations into cyclic dynamics that would mimic the patterns seen in the cyclic populations found in parts of Eurasia.","[Boonstra, Rudy] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Krebs, Charles J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Boonstra, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",boonstra@utsc.utoronto.ca; krebs@zoology.ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We dedicate this paper to the memory of William (Bill) A.

For example, altered predator-prey interactions may influence the dynamics of trophic cascades, affecting net primary production. In a three-year field experiment, we manipulated a plant-grasshopper-spider food chain in mesic tallgrass prairie to investigate the effects of temperature and food quality on grasshopper performance, and to understand the direct and indirect tritrophic interactions that contribute to trophic cascades. Because spiders are active at cooler temperatures than grasshoppers in our system, we hypothesized that predator effects would be strongest in cooled treatments, and weakest in warmed treatments. Grasshopper spider interactions were highly context-dependent and varied significantly with food quality, temperature treatment and year. Spiders most often reduced grasshopper survival in the cooled and ambient temperature treatments, but had little to no effect on grasshopper survival in the warmed treatments, as hypothesized. In some years, plants compensated for grasshopper herbivory and trophic cascades were not observed despite significant effects of predators on grasshopper survival. However, in the year they were observed, trophic cascades only occurred in cooled treatments where predator effects on grasshoppers were strongest. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change will require an understanding of how temperature influences species interactions. Our results demonstrate that changes in daily temperature regimes can alter predator-prey interactions among arthropods with consequences for ecosystem processes such as primary production and the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes.","[Laws, Angela Nardoni; Joern, Anthony] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Laws, AN (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",alaws@ksu.edu,,,NSF Kansas EPSCoR Ecological Forecasting Consortium; Kansas State Univ.

Resource availability affects recolonization success and resulting distribution patterns, but top-down processes may also play a role through density-mediated or trait-mediated indirect effects that may exclude a species from otherwise suitable habitat. We predicted that the spatial distribution of recolonizing sea otters, Enhydra lutris, on the Canadian Pacific coastline was explained by resources as well as interspecific interactions - spatial segregation from pinnipeds, the preferred prey of killer whales Orcinus orca. We surveyed the summer occurrence of sea otters and pinnipeds on Vancouver Island, Canada. We quantified coastline density and bathymetry at multiple spatial scales as indices of habitat complexity and foraging habitat availability. We used generalized linear model selection to test hypotheses about sea otters' spatial relationship to resources and heterospecifics. Pinniped presence negatively predicted sea otter presence, even after accounting for complexity and foraging habitat. Sea otters may segregate from pinnipeds due to trait-mediated indirect effects of predation, leading us to hypothesize apparent competition between sea otters and pinnipeds. Research is needed to test this hypothesis; if true, refuge from apparent competitors may be a key component of recolonization habitat for sea otters. Species distribution models should quantify resource landscapes but also species-scapes: the spatial plane of species interactions that combines with resources to drive species distributions. Conservation plans based on recolonization models that include only resources may overestimate available habitat, carrying capacity, and recolonization success. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, trophic-level interactions, such as mesocarnivore release resulting from intraguild predation, may also be important mediators of cascades. From September 2001 to August 2004, we used spatial and seasonal heterogeneity in wolf distribution and abundance in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to evaluate whether mesopredator release of coyotes ( Canis latrans), resulting from the extirpation of wolves ( Canis lupus), accounts for high rates of coyote predation on pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana) fawns observed in some areas. Results of this ecological perturbation in wolf densities, coyote densities, and pronghorn neonatal survival at wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites support the existence of a species-level trophic cascade. That wolves precipitated a trophic cascade was evidenced by fawn survival rates that were four-fold higher at sites used by wolves. A negative correlation between coyote and wolf densities supports the hypothesis that interspecific interactions between the two species facilitated the difference in fawn survival. Whereas densities of resident coyotes were similar between wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites, the abundance of transient coyotes was significantly lower in areas used by wolves. Thus, differential effects of wolves on solitary coyotes may be an important mechanism by which wolves limit coyote densities. Our results support the hypothesis that mesopredator release of coyotes contributes to high rates of coyote predation on pronghorn fawns, and demonstrate the importance of alternative food web pathways in structuring the dynamics of terrestrial systems.","[Berger, Kim Murray] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildlife Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Berger, Kim Murray; Berger, Joel] Univ Montana, No Rockies Field Off, Wildlife Conservat Society, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Gese, Eric M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildlife Resources, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, USDA,Wildlife Serv, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Berger, KM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, No Rockies Field Off, Wildlife Conservat Society, 205 Nat Sci Bldg, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",kberger@wcs.org,"Gese, Eric M/B-4578-2011",,,,,70,122,125,7,228,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2008,89,3,,,,,818,828,,10.1890/07-0193.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,284AS,WOS:000254678200022,18459344,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-23,

Milne-Edwards, 1861), is a relatively recent invader (approx. 10 years) to northeastern New Zealand, and its large size and aggressive nature makes it a potentially formidable competitor with native species. The only endemic, similarly sized, New Zealand paddle crab, Ovalipes catharus (White and Doubleday, 1843), overlaps frequently with C. japonica in both habitat and diet. To understand their probable interactions in the field, we performed a series of experimental behavioral trials in a closed laboratory system to determine whether the crabs interact antagonistically over a shared prey resource (Perna canaliculus (Gmelin, 1791) - green-lipped mussel). In interspecific trials, C. japonica frequently displaced both sexes of O. catharus from the prey, while O. catharus usually failed to acquire prey from feeding C. japonica. In addition, male C. japonica dominated both male and female O. catharus in one-on-one competition for food, regardless of which crab possessed the food initially. Overall, male C. japonica behaved aggressively towards O. catharus and conspecifics of equal size when competing for a prey item; O. catharus showed low levels of aggression throughout all trials and increased time spent evading C. japonica as compared to C. japonica's high levels of aggression. Our research highlights the importance of understanding how aggressive behavior may influence establishment success of invading species.","[Fowler, Amy E.] Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Warkworth 0941, New Zealand; [Muirhead, Jim R.; Taylor, Richard B.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Fowler, AE (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",fowlera@si.edu,,"Muirhead, Jim/0000-0002-0264-3662",J.

Predation is one factor that can have widespread effects on the mean trait value in a prey population because predators can impact prey traits through a number of processes. Predators can directly induce prey phenotypes through visual and chemical cues, predators can indirectly alter prey phenotypes by thinning the prey population (thereby reducing competition), and predators can cause selection on prey phenotypes through nonrandom killing. Ecologists are beginning to understand each of these three processes in isolation, but these processes act on prey phenotypes simultaneously, and we lack information on the relative importance of these processes in determining the final phenotype of prey. I used a system of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) and dragonfly predators (Anax longipes) to determine the separate and combined impacts of induction, thinning, and selection on the behavior, morphology, and growth of tadpoles reared in aquatic mesocosms. Using combinations of hand thinning, cues emitted from caged predators, and lethal predators, I demonstrated that the impact of lethal predators on growth was mediated primarily through thinning, the impact on morphology was primarily through induction, and the impact on behavior was affected similarly through thinning and induction. Surprisingly, while we know from numerous studies that the dragonflies kill tadpoles nonrandomly, selection did not have a significant impact on the final phenotypes of the tadpoles. This work appears to be the first study that identifies the relative magnitudes of the three predatory processes on a suite of prey phenotypes. The three processes can have opposing or supporting effects, the relative magnitudes of which likely differ among systems, illustrating why we often observe contradictory results when we examine the impact of lethal predators on prey phenotypes. Thus, it is important that we identify the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of predation, rather than simply observing the outcomes and then inferring which processes are responsible.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea+@pitt.edu,,,,,,65,76,79,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2002,83,7,,,,,1953,1964,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1953:TMFOPH]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,571LD,WOS:000176718100015,,,,,2021-09-23,

During CM periods, many plant species from various families synchronously flower and subsequently undergo community-level fruiting. Seed predation is a key factor in understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors affecting CM. Masting is proposed to decrease seed mortality due to predation in two ways: by depressing predator abundance through extended and unpredictable absences of seeds; and by satiating predators via mass seed production (predator satiation hypothesis). If the hypothesis is valid in these rainforests, the incidence of seed predation will be higher in a fruiting event that occurs soon after a previous fruiting event, because the intervening period of seed absence would be inadequate to starve the predators. In this study, we examined seed predation by insects, focusing on five dipterocarp species that exceptionally reproduced twice during an extended CM period. All of the five species suffered more intense seed predation in the second fruiting event, consistent with the prediction expected from the predator satiation hypothesis. Weevils, bark beetles and mammals were the main cause of increased seed predation in three, one and one plant species, respectively. However, seed predation intensity did not increase during the second fruiting event in a few combinations of predator and plant species. We discuss the possibility that competition for seeds among predators and/or the interspecific differences in life history traits among predators might affect the varying intensities of seed predation among dipterocarp species by different seed predators.","[Iku, Asano; Itioka, Takao] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Nihonmatsu Cho, Kyoto 6068316, Japan; [Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1530041, Japan; [Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko] Coll Arts & Sci, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1530041, Japan; [Shimizu-kaya, Usun; Sakai, Shoko] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Mohammad, Fatimah Bte; Hossman, Mohamad Yazid; Bunyok, Azimah; Abd Rahman, Mohd Yusuf; Meleng, Paulus] Forest Dept Sarawak, Res Dev & Innovat Div, KM 10 Jalan Datuk Amar Kalong Ningkan, Kuching 93250, Sarawak, Malaysia","Iku, A (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Nihonmatsu Cho, Kyoto 6068316, Japan.",asano_iku@yahoo.co.jp,,"Sakai, Shoko/0000-0002-4267-8405","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and CultureMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [21255004]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16J08043] Funding Source: KAKEN","This study was conducted in accordance with memorandums of understanding signed in November 2005 by the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC, Kuching, Malaysia) and the Japan Research Consortium for Tropical Forests in Sarawak (JRCTS, Sendai, Japan), and in December 2012 by the Sarawak Forest Department (SFD, Kuching, Malaysia) and JRCTS.

Foraging niche shifts of these species were studied when they foraged alternately in mature pine forest and in areas with saplings. In the saplings, where flying predators are unable to attack prey in the lower part of the canopy because of the dense branch structure there. Crested Tits switched to forage in the lower parts. As the subordinate species, Willow Tits foraged lower in the mature forest and higher up in the saplings, thus in both cases using more exposed parts of the canopy. Predation risk from Sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus seemed to be high. Since Crested Tits used the safest sites in both habitats, tits seem able to evaluate predation risk and adjust their habitat use.

In this study, we take advantage of the similar semiochemical communication of TF and TC to evaluate the abundance of adults of the two species concurrently using grids of traps baited with pheromone and host volatiles in stands of spruce. Adult TF emerged on average 2 wk before TC both in the field and under controlled laboratory conditions. This observation, combined with the early reproduction of emergent females, implies that the smaller (younger) larvae of native TC may be at increased risk of intra-guild predation by TF. The high spatial association between male and female TF in dense, aggregated populations suggests that the rate of mate encounter is depressed in sparse populations toward the edge of the invasive range. The higher level of spatial aggregation for TF than TC, particularly at high population density, suggests a higher propensity of adult TF to congregate at landmarks. Considering the broader range of host conditions, earlier seasonal emergence, and presumably more effective mate encounter for TF than TC, the exotic TF may be a superior competitor with the potential to displace or reduce the abundance of TC.","[Rhainds, Marc; Heard, Stephen B.; Sweeney, Jon D.; Silk, Peter; Flaherty, Leah] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada","Rhainds, M (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, POB 4000, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada.",mrhainds@nrcan.gc.ca,"Sweeney, Jonathan/Q-5281-2019; Heard, Stephen/C-2737-2012",,Natural Resources CanadaNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Canadian Forest ServiceNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Canadian Food Inspection Agency; Forest Protection Limited New Brunswick; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Nova Scotia Ministry of Natural Resources; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank G.

Salvelinus alpinus, however, inhabit environmental extremes ranging from lakes and rivers in the High Arctic to deep multi-fish species lakes far outside the polar region. Long-term responses to post-glacial environmental variations and successively increased interspecific interactions reveal an essential degree of natural ecological resilience and phenotypic flexibility. Case studies in Scandinavia and Newfoundland illustrate the alternate trophic roles of S. alpinus, and its flexible niche use and life-history changes in order to regain or maintain body size in gradients of lakes with increasing fish species diversity. While allopatric in northern low-productive upland lakes, landlocked populations are commonly structured by cannibalism. In sympatry with other fish species, S. alpinus mostly serve as prey, with their decreasing growth and body size reflecting the successive diet shift from littoral macro-benthos to zooplankton and profundal microbenthos as interspecific competition for food and habitat intensifies. Interactions with natural and introduced superior zooplankton feeders and ultimate predators finally become detrimental. Consequently, the niche of S. alpinus is increasingly compressed in lakes along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, although certain natural key conditions offer S. alpinus temporary asylum in the inescapable process towards local and regional extinction. The water temperature drop during winter allows S. alpinus to temporarily resume the richer littoral dietary and spatial niche use in low diversity lakes. In southern lowland and coastal lakes with more complex fish communities, access to key prey species such as profundal macro-crustaceans and smelt Osmerus spp. allow S. alpinus to regain its original niche space and characteristics as a large piscivore. In conclusion, S. alpinus along its evolutionary landscape demonstrates associated alterations of life-history characteristics, such as body size and longevity, and thus reproductive traits demonstrating similarities between northern cannibals and southern piscivores. Although including a high degree of natural resilience, obviously differing among S. alpinus populations along its range, differences seen in extreme marginal populations may have been adaptive and the product of an evolutionary response with optimized growth resulting from natural selection due to ultimate intra or inter-specific competition and predation.

Males used small holes as spawning nests, usually staying at the nest and maintaining the area while showing exclusive behaviors. Their home ranges were limited to areas within 30 cm distance from the nest for over 2 months. Four heterospecific fishes were threatened when they approached to within 6-14 cm of the nest holes, and two species of carnivorous snails were removed at points 0-30 cm from the nest entrance. There were no significant differences between the distances from the nest entrances to the points defended against fish and those used for foraging. As the four heterospecific species have similar feeding habits to those of N. bryope, the area defended against fishes may function as a foraging territory. At 24 h following the removal of nest owners, carnivorous snails had gathered to actively prey on eggs, indicating that the area defended against snails may function as a territory for protection against egg predators. Although the positions of females where males started courtship displays were significantly farther than the foraging points and the positions of threatened fishes, males displayed no territoriality against conspecific males. The fact that males did not leave the nest hole during the courtship suggests that it may be costly to maintain a courtship territory. These results show that males of tube blenny maintain territories for egg guarding and for protecting food resources around their nest holes in the spawning season.","[Murase, Atsunobu; Sunobe, Tomoki] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Fish Behav Ecol, Tateyama Stn, Field Sci Ctr, Chiba 2940308, Japan","Murase, A (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Fish Behav Ecol, Tateyama Stn, Field Sci Ctr, 670 Banda, Chiba 2940308, Japan.",atsunobum@yahoo.co.jp,,,,,,32,3,4,0,12,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",0289-0771,,,J ETHOL,J.

The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway. 2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species' selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area. 3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1.5% could hold all four large carnivores together. 4. Synthesis and applications. A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.","[May, Roel; van Dijk, Jiska; Swenson, Jon E.; Linnell, John D.

Camponotus modoc Wheller could not be categorized. Structure of the ant mosaic was very stable. Field surveys and pitfall traps showed that foraging territories of the ant species did not change over four years. There was considerable overlap in the spatial territories of the ant species. All six species foraged in pear trees and collected psylla honeydew, and all but C modoc also were predators of pear psylla. However, they differed in their reliance on these food sources.

In St. Joseph Bay, FL, USA, pen shells [Atrina rigida (Sol.)] are preyed on by horse conchs [Pleuroploca gigantea (Kiener)]. The shells of dead Atrina are subsequently used as shelters and/or nest sites by a suite of benthic species, including crabs, octopi, and fish. By influencing the rate of new shelter availability, horse conchs may indirectly affect the distribution or reproduction of shell-occupant species. Feeding observations and an exclosure experiment indicate that Atrina are the primary prey of large horse conchs. The abundance of occupant species is strongly correlated to Atrina shell abundance, suggesting that shelter availability may influence population distributions. Experimental additions of new shelters mimicking freshly-killed pen shells caused an increase in the abundance of occupant species. Among these species, the blennies Hypsoblennius hentzi (Leseuer) and Chasmodes saburrae J. & G. and the clingfish Gobiesox strumosus Cope showed an increase in both abundance and frequency of egg-guarding, suggesting an important indirect effect of horse conchs on the distribution and reproductive output of these fish. Because the addition of new shells affected blennies and clingfish more strongly than other occupant species, community composition is influenced by shelter availability. In habitats where biogenic structures are prominent, such as mollusc shells in soft-sediment marine communities, this type of nontrophic indirect effect may be an important component of population and community regulation.",,"KUHLMANN, ML (corresponding author), FLORIDA STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI B142,TALLAHASSEE,FL 32306, USA.",,,,,,,47,13,13,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

The study was conducted in tall open forest near Melbourne, Australia, from April to August 1997. Microhabitat was investigated bq use of live trapping and fluorescent pigment tracking. The influence of light on spatial and temporal activity was investigated by comparing microhabitat use in the field at two extremes of moonlight intensity, full and new moon, and by manipulating light intensity in the field. Antechinus agilis were trapped in and tracked through dense microhabitats in a greater proportion than was available, although this pattern was evident only in the vegetation stratum below one metre from the ground. Furthermore, animals did not respond to the microhabitat at the Feint of capture, but responded to a larger microhabitat scale radiating 10 m from the trap. However, light intensity appears to have little influence on the spatial or temporal activity of A. agilis at this site. Therefore A. agilis appear not to differentially use denser microhabitats in relation to light intensity. Habitat complexity, prey availability, interspecific competition and predation are discussed as possible reasons why ii. agilis differentially use denser microhabitats.","Monash Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia","Predavec, M (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia.",martin.predavec@sci.monash.edu.au,"Sutherland, Duncan/E-7763-2011","Sutherland, Duncan/0000-0003-0893-4425",,,,85,22,28,0,21,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",0004-959X,1446-5698,,AUST J ZOOL,Aust.

Under conditions of abundant fruit, A. spatulata was the dominant exploiter at the population level, as shown by its ability to infest the largest number of fruits of the three herbivores and substantially displace its moth competitors. In a separate experiment, when resource-partitioning species were excluded, A. spatulata infested twice as many fruits as the two moth species (44.3%). Field observations examined the ability of A. spatulata to locate suitable fruits. We found that, the variation in fruit characters influenced fruit suitability in relation to its size (4.1261 +/- 0.0272 mm [mean +/- SE]) and weight (0.0618 +/- 0.0005 mg [mean +/- SE]).

Competition for limiting resources is a fundamental and well-established driver of niche partitioning, which in turn promotes species coexistence and biodiversity. Although contests are a well-known behavioural mechanism by which organisms compete over limiting resources, there has been surprisingly little application of contest theory to understanding interspecific interactions, niche partitioning, species coexistence and biodiversity. 2. We investigated the link between contest dynamics and community structure using two intertidal rockpool fishes, Bathygobius cocosensis (Gobiidae) and Lepidoblennius haplodactylus (Tripterygiidae), as model species. We assessed the abundance and distribution of the two species on intertidal rocky shores of South-East Australia, and whether distribution patterns were related to abiotic variables. We then conducted interspecific contest experiments between pairs of B. cocosensis and L. haplodactylus of varying size and sex under high and low dissolved oxygen levels to assess the competitive dominance of the species. To relate these results to community structure, we quantified temporal patterns of rockpool fidelity of each species in situ. 3. Field surveys revealed that B. cocosensis was most prevalent in rockpools with higher dissolved oxygen, and L. haplodactylus was most prevalent in rockpools that contained no B. cocosensis. Contest experiments revealed that B. cocosensis displayed higher resource holding power than L. haplodactylus regardless of size asymmetry, sex or dissolved oxygen concentration, although contest intensity was influenced by relative body size of competing individuals. Furthermore, the microhabitat preference of L. haplodactylus was modulated in the presence of B. cocosensis. In the field, B. cocosensis displayed higher rockpool fidelity than L. haplodactylus. 4. In light of these findings, we propose that B. cocosensis is the superior competitor but persistence of both species is likely facilitated by low-cost contest resolution strategies, plasticity in microhabitat preference, negative spatial co-variation and interspecific variation in dispersal and corresponding home range sizes. 5. By using contest theory to understand the dynamics of interspecific contests, insight has been gained into how habitat is partitioned, species coexist and ultimately how biodiversity is maintained.","[Paijmans, Kai C.; Wong, Marian Y.

Augmentative releases of EPN have been used to enhance biological control of pests in agroecosystems. Pest managers strive to achieve a trophic cascade whereby natural-enemy effects permeate down throguh the food web to suppress host herbivores and increase crop production. Although trophic cascades have been studied in diverse aboveground arthropod-based systems, they are infrequently investigated in soil systems. Moreover, no overall quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of EPN in suppressing hosts with cascading benefits to plants has been made. Toward synthesizing the available but limited information on EPN and their ability to suppress prey and affect plant, yield, we surveyed the litrerature and performed a meta-analysis of 35 published studies. Our analysis found that effect sizes for arthropod hosts as a result of EPN addition were consistently negative and indirect effects on plants were consistently positive. Results held across several different host metrics (abundance, fecundity and survival) and across measures of plant performance (biomass, growth, yield and survival). Moreover, the relationship between plant and host effect sizes was strikingly and significantly negative. That is, the positive impact on plant responses generally increased as the negative effect of EPN on hosts intensified, providing strong support for the mechanism of trophic cascades. We also review the ways in which EPN might interact antagonistically with each other and other predators and pathogens to adversely affect host suppression and dampen trophic cascades. We conclude that the food web implications of multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN are little studied, but, as management techniques that promote the long-term persistence of EPN are improved, antagonistic interactions are more likely to arise. We hope that the likely occurrence of antagonistic interactions in soil food webs should stimulate researchers to conduct field experiments explicitly designed to examine multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN and their cascading effects to hosts and plants.","[Denno, Robert F.; Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kaplan, Ian] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Denno, RF (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dsgruner@umd.edu,"Gruner, Daniel S./A-5166-2010","Gruner, Daniel S./0000-0002-3153-4297",,,,128,44,46,0,40,SOC NEMATOLOGISTS,MARCELINE,"PO BOX 311, MARCELINE, MO 64658 USA",0022-300X,,,J NEMATOL,J.

A 2-factor laboratory experiment was conducted, where juveniles (0+) and adults (1+) were kept in experimental jars for 2 mo at densities of 2000, 4000 and 8000 ind. m(-2), which corresponds to natural abundances in the Baltic Sea. The amphipods were fed on a mixture of naturally occurring algae at 3 food levels: zero, medium (representing a diatom spring-bloom) and high (representing a 2 x diatom spring-bloom). The level of food added to the experimental jars determined whether food competition occurred, both within and between the 2 age classes. Growth of juveniles was riot density-dependent, at any food level, in the absence of adults, but clearly dependent on presence or absence of fresh algal material. In presence of high adult densities, the growth of juveniles was significantly reduced at food levels that corresponded to a single and twice a diatom spring-bloom, while such reduction was not found in jars without added algae. Growth of adults was both density- and food-dependent. Juveniles did not affect the survival and growth of adults. As high densities of amphipods in jars without added food affected neither growth nor mortality, we conclude that crowding effects such as predation or directly damaging interference are not important regulating mechanisms. The results indicate that exploitative intraspecific competition for food occurs both between and within year classes, but depends on the resource levels and is likely to be most intense under a regime of low to medium input of phytodetritus. The experiment lends support to the hypothesis that intraspecific competition for food acts as an important process causing fluctuations in the Baltic Sea populations of M. affinis.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Wenngren, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.wenngren@zoologi.su.se,"Olafsson, Emil/D-4916-2012",,,,,56,15,15,0,2,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

It has the potential to shape population dynamics and community structure. Although there is much empirical evidence for the occurrence of intraguild predation in natural ecosystems, the study of its effects is mainly limited to short-term microcosm experiments. There is, therefore, certain skepticism about its actual significance in nature. A relevant concern is that there is no consensus regarding criteria to evaluate the possible occurrence of intraguild predation in short-term experiments, and methodological differences may therefore underlie apparent inconsistencies among studies. Our purpose here was to evaluate existing criteria to offer guidance for the design of experiments to determine whether two species may potentially engage in intraguild predation. The criteria are based on the condition that intraguild predators need to experience immediate energetic gains when feeding on the intraguild prey. Thus, a relevant experimental design must quantify predation but also fitness benefits of feeding on the other species, i.e. increases in reproduction, somatic growth, or survival.","[Fonseca, Morgana Maria; Pallini, Angelo] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Montserrat, Marta; Guzman, Celeste; Torres-Campos, Inmaculada] IHSM UMA CSIC, Inst Mediterranean & Subtrop Hort La Mayora, Malaga 29750, Spain; [Guzman, Celeste] EEZA CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",arne.janssen@uva.nl,"Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012; Torres-Campos, Inmaculada/AAF-4983-2020; Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Montserrat, Marta/A-7625-2012; Guzman, Celeste/L-4519-2014; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/Z-3908-2019","Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545; Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Montserrat, Marta/0000-0002-6859-4955; Guzman, Celeste/0000-0003-2053-4213; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/0000-0002-2135-8488; Torres-Campos, Inmaculada/0000-0002-8775-7537",CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [151777/2013-6]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [CBB-3000309]; MINECO [CGL2015-66192-R],"We thank two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments.

Predator environments (i.e., isolated predators, conspecific pairs, and interspecific pair) were used to identify multiple predator effects on prey by comparing observed predation to that predicted from the multiplicative risk model. Behavioural data and per capita consumption rates provided insight into mechanisms underlying observed multiple predator effects on prey. Experiments were conducted at various spatial scales in the laboratory and field. In all experiments, dogwhelks reduced or ceased feeding when a green crab was present compared to isolated dogwhelks, although overall predation was not influenced. Independent multiple predator effects on prey, where observed and predicted consumption did not differ, were usually maintained because crabs and whelks forage on dissimilar time scales. Contrary to other studies, interference competition through aggressive encounters was not observed for dogwhelk and green crab conspecifics, or the interspecific pair, and non-independent multiple predator effects on prey in the form of risk reduction did not result. Spatial scale appeared to influence some outcomes of predator interactions. In large tanks, green crab conspecifics and the interspecific pair caused risk enhancement for prey. This resulted from increased search time, increased per capita consumption rate, and decreased handling time per prey of crabs, and was likely induced by longer residence time of water in the large tanks compared to smaller tanks. In small tanks, dogwhelks with a conspecific had higher per capita consumption rates than isolated dogwhelks, suggesting risk enhancement for prey. However, dogwhelks were unable to consume enough prey over the experiment to allow detection of a non-independent multiple predator effect on prey by comparing observed to predicted consumption. Predator species that operate on different time scales of predation may have independent multiple predator effects on prey even when changes to individual predator behaviours or per capita consumption rates occur. Examination of predator behaviours and per capita consumption rates, in addition to the full suite of predator environments, is essential to fully understand dynamics among multiple conspecific and interspecific predators, particularly when predator species forage on dissimilar time scales.

To gain insight into ensuing mechanisms that might alter indirect species interactions, we examined how behavioural responses to an upper-level predatory fish might differ between mesopredator species with different life histories. In rocky reefs of the northeast Pacific Ocean, adult lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are upper-level predators that use a sit-and-wait hunting mode. Reef mesopredators that are prey to adult lingcod include kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus), younger lingcod, copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and quillback rockfish (S. maliger). Across these mesopredators species, longevity and age at maturity increases and, consequently, the annual proportion of lifetime reproductive output decreases in the order just listed. Therefore, we hypothesized that the level of risk taken to acquire resources would vary interspecifically in that same order. During field experiments we manipulated predation risk with a model adult lingcod and used fixed video cameras to quantify interactions between mesopredators and tethered prey (Pandalus shrimps). We predicted that the probabilities of inspecting and attacking tethered prey would rank from highest to lowest and the timing of these behaviours would rank from earliest to latest as follows: kelp greenling, lingcod, copper rockfish, and quillback rockfish. We also predicted that responses to the model lingcod, such as avoidance of interactions with tethered prey, would rank from weakest to strongest in the same order. Results were consistent with our predictions suggesting that, despite occupying similar trophic levels, longer-lived mesopredators with late maturity have stronger antipredator responses and therefore experience lower foraging rates in the presence of predators than mesopredators with faster life histories. The corollary is that the fishery removal of top predators, which relaxes predation risk, could potentially lead to stronger increases in foraging rates for mesopredators with slower life histories.","[Frid, Alejandro; Marliave, Jeff] Vancouver Aquarium, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, Dept Biol Sci, N Miami, FL USA","Frid, A (corresponding author), Vancouver Aquarium, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",alejfrid@gmail.com,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003",Florida International University Division of Research,"The study was funded in its entirety through a Seed Funds Award to Michael R Heithaus from the The Florida International University Division of Research.

Females should choose to oviposit in habitats where risk of predation and competition are low. The ovipositional responses of a mosquito, Culiseta longiareolata, to a predator and to species sharing the same trophic level as this mosquito (controphic species) were assessed experimentally in outdoor artificial pools. 2. The predator, larval Anax imperator, which strongly reduced larval C. longiareolata survival, resulted in a 52% reduction of C, longiareolata egg rafts. The controphic species (primarily Daphnia magna), which had a small but statistically significant negative effect on the survival of C. longiareolata larvae, did not have a statistically significant influence on the number of egg rafts. 3. Laboratory trials indicated that only a small fraction of the reduced number of egg rafts seen in predator pools may be due to consumption of the egg rafts by A. imperator. 4. The experimental evidence indicates that the reduced number of C. longiareolata egg rafts found in the presence of A. imperator is due largely to oviposition habitat selection, i.e. C, longiareolata females choose pools with low risk of predation for their offspring.","Univ Haifa, Lab Community Ecol, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Biol Chem Lab, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Lab Community Ecol, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",,,,,,,61,79,81,1,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The common spiny mouse (A. cahirinus) is nocturnally active whereas the golden spiny mouse (A. russatus) is diurnally active. An early removal study suggested that competition accounts for this pattern of temporal partitioning: the golden spiny mouse is forced into diurnal activity by its congener. Theoretically, temporal segregation should facilitate coexistence if the shared limiting resources differ at different times (primarily among predators whose prey populations have activity rhythms), or if they are renewed within the period of the temporal segregation. We studied food preferences of the two Acomys species in a controlled cafeteria experiment in order to assess resource overlap and the potential for competition for food between the two species. We found no significant difference in food preferences between species. The dietary items preferred by both were arthropods. We also carried out a seasonal study of the percentage and identity of arthropods taken in the field by individuals of the two species. Individuals of both species took on annual; average a high percentage of arthropods in their diets. Seasonal diet shifts reflect seasonal abundance of arthropods at Fin Gedi during day and night. Diurnal activity may also reduce interspecific interference competition between A. russatus and A. cahirinus. However, the strong interspecific dietary overlap in food preference, the heavy reliance on arthropods in spiny mouse diets, and the seasonal and circadian differences in arthropod consumption suggest that prey partitioning may be a viable mechanism of coexistence in this system.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Kronfeld-Schor, N (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",Kronfeld@bu.edu,"Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/AAU-3792-2020","Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/0000-0002-5224-3341",,,,52,81,85,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1999,121,1,,,,,123,128,,10.1007/s004420050913,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245WT,WOS:000083131600014,28307881,,,,2021-09-23,

In some contexts, the aggressive behaviours shown in these interspecific interactions are very similar to those shown in intraspecific interactions. It is still an open question whether intra- and interspecific aggression share common causality. We studied a year-round territorial species the jewel damselfish, (Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus), which cultivate algae they feed on. Territory holders aggressively defend these algae that are an attractive resource for many other species. In this study, we recorded territorial aggression in free-living individuals and recorded aggressive responses to a standardized territorial intrusion test in captive individuals. Field observations indicated that territorial aggression was selectively targeted towards food competitors. Independent of the size of the species, aggression was more frequent towards common species around their territories. This relationship was confirmed experimentally by confronting the jewel damselfish with novel objects to which the subjects were exposed either frequently or rarely. We suggest that jewel damselfish have to learn which species are competitors and therefore should be chased. In a standardized intrusion test with captive individuals, no significant differences were found in territorial responses towards intra- or interspecific intruders. Neither territorial aggression nor the intrusion showed any relationship with plasma androgen levels. Together, these data suggest that experience might be more important in non-seasonal territorial aggression than circulating hormonal factors.","[Di Paola, Valentina; Vullioud, Philippe; Demarta, Lanila; Ros, Albert F.

We found that 86% of the overwintering invertebrates in traps were predators, which were dominated by spiders (72%) of different guilds and different body sizes. Spiders had spatially segregated in the traps so that smaller specimens hid in an interstitial space that was inaccessible to larger specimens. Spiders of the bark-dwelling guild, Anyphaena and Philodromus, are winter-active and can prey on other smaller spiders. Analysis of their abundance in traps indicated a negative relationship between Anyphaena and Philodromus or other spiders. Inspection of traps during winter revealed an influx of spider specimens confirming their winter-activity. In a semi-field experiment, where overwintering in cardboard bands was studied under controlled conditions, we observed mortality of both winter-active Philodromus and Anyphaena spiders due to their interspecific predation. The mortality was affected by their size ratio - larger specimens consumed smaller ones. Presence of alternative prey, theridiid spiders, did not affect their mortalities, but the presence of shelters (interstitial spaces) did. In boards with interstitial spaces smaller spiders suffered lower mortality than in boards without the interstitial spaces. Obtained results suggest that intraguild predation between overwintering spiders can decrease their population density during winter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, predation is a strong mortality factor for members of the tit guild and predation risk may restrict the selection of foraging sites and organisation of the mixed-species tit flock. We evaluated pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) predation on North European tits and goldcrests. A literature analysis of six areas showed clearly that pygmy owls feed more heavily on those species that forage on exterior tree parts (coal tit P. ater and goldcrest Regulus regulus). These species are also subdominant in mixed-species flocks. The dominant species, crested tit (P. cristatus) and willow tit (P. montanus) were killed less frequently by pygmy owls. These two species forage on the inner parts of trees. The predation or competition hypothesis cannot alone explain the foraging site selection by the dominant species. There is more arthropod food on the outer parts ot branches and predation pressure is also higher on the outer parts of the tree. The most dominant species. crested tit, forages in the middle part of branches. We suggest that in the Parus guild there is a trade-off between predation risk and interspecific competition for food.

Hypothesized reasons for these divergences vary, but most relate a taxon's morphology to its ecological niche. Morphology is known to diverge when species co-occur with competitors or predators and when species occur across different habitats and environments. A less understood divergence from ecogeographic trends is niche fixation, wherein species become locked into particular niches due to their community interactions or foraging ecology. A form of niche fixation has been hypothesized in the theory of interspecies social dominance mimicry (ISDM), in which mimics maintain relatively constant size ratios with models to perpetuate their mimicry. If true, mimics should display variation and trends in tandem with their models. Here, I use mass as a proxy for body size and examine ecogeographic trends in two sets of woodpeckers (Picidae): a Nearctic group which has been reported to interact via ISDM, and a Neotropical group which, based on similar appearances and overlapping distributions, is a potential ISDM system. I found ecogeographic trends suggestive of differential evolutionary responses, and I found evidence against niche fixation in the Nearctic clade. The Neotropic clade showed limited evidence for tandem size evolution between models and mimics, but inconsistencies in the size ratios between mimic and model populations. Here, I discuss the implications of observing divergent ecogeographic trends within mimicry systems, with specific emphasis on how environment, ecology, and community interactions guide evolution.","[Cooper, Jacob C.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Cooper, Jacob C.] Field Museum, Integrat Res Ctr, Life Sci Sect, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Cooper, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Cooper, JC (corresponding author), Field Museum, Integrat Res Ctr, Life Sci Sect, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",jccooper@uchicago.edu,"Cooper, Jacob/AAV-1207-2020","Cooper, Jacob/0000-0003-2182-3236",Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the Univ. of Chicago,"This work was funded by my graduate program, the Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the Univ. of Chicago.",,79,0,0,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0908-8857,1600-048X,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

Such competition can be minimized through niche dimensions: mechanism of resource partitioning based on prey choice and foraging tactic. This study compared habitat use patterns of 5 top predators (bottlenose dolphins, double-crested cormorants, osprey, brown pelicans and terns) within Florida Bay with respect to each other, their prey and habitat variability. Foraging dolphins, osprey and pelicans exhibited similar habitat use patterns in shallow, turbid, productive waters with high proportions of mud and mudbank bottom types. These same habitat characteristics also described the distribution of their major prey items: mullet and catfish. Competition between these 3 predators is likely diluted by foraging tactic variation. Conversely, the habitat use patterns of cormorants showed strongest association with deeper water, with low chlorophyll a and turbidity levels, less mud and mudbank habitat, and greater proportions of hardbottom and seagrass bottoms. Those prey items of cormorants with less competition from other predators examined displayed the same habitat associations. Cormorants in Florida Bay may concentrate their foraging efforts on less competitive prey, occurring more frequently in habitats where these prey items dominate. Despite Florida Bay's limited bathymetric relief, habitat use patterns of top predators are significantly influenced by depth, and subsequently bottom type. Sighting rates of all predators, except non-foraging dolphins, peaked in shallow mudbank habitats. This pattern of strong habitat overlap among predators implies currently adequate resource availability and/or niche dimensions among interspecific competitors.","[Torres, Leigh G.] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA","Torres, LG (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, 301 Evans Bay Parade,Greta Point,Private Bag 14-9, Wellington 6021, New Zealand.",l.torres@niwa.co.nz,,,"Everglades National Park [EVER-2003-SCI-0042, EVER2004-SCI-0062, EVER-2005-SCI-0062]; Duke University Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) [911-1466, 572-1639]; SERC-FIU; SFWMD/SERC [C-15397]; EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [X994621-940]; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; NOAA/Coastal OceanNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Dolphin Ecology; Duke University Marine","This research was conducted under Everglades National Park permits EVER-2003-SCI-0042, EVER2004-SCI-0062, and EVER-2005-SCI-0062, General Authorizations 911-1466 and 572-1639, and approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC).

Three predatory chironomid species constituted numerically 8.8% (+/- 95% CL 2.2) of the macro-and meiobenthic community at the sediment surface and in the hyporheic zone of Oberer Seebach, a gravel stream in Lower Austria. Larvae of Thienemannimyia geijskesi (Goetghebuer) and Nilotanypus dubius (Meigen) occurred in higher densities in sediment depths between 10) and 40 cm, whereas Conchapelopia pallidula (Meigen) achieved higher densities at the sediment surface. The three species completed one generation in a year. 2. A total of ninety-seven prey species and instars were identified by gut analyses, of which forty-one benthic rotifer species constituted 69.5% of individuals and twenty-three chironomid species and their instars, 22.9%. The three tanypod species showed shifts from mainly rotifer species in early instars to chironomids and diverse other meio- and macrofaunal taxa in later instars. Rather than shifting towards larger prey sizes, growing predators expanded their upper size thresholds and continued to include smaller prey species in their diet. The extent to which tanypod instars fed on similar prey size classes declined with increasing larval size. Predation by tanypods amounted to 2.2% (+/- 95% CL 0.1) of the combined prey densities and prey consumption averaged 1.32 (bootstrap 95% CL 1.26-1.39) individuals per predator individual. 3. Preferences for microhabitat flow differed between predator species and in the prey assemblage. Prey densities and densities of T. geijskesi and C. pallidula were highest in pool areas, whereas N. dubius achieved high densities in riffle sites. 4. Tanypod larvae fed non-selectively among prey types. To test the significance of observed size(instar)-specific spatial and dietary overlap values amongst tanypod species, simulations were generated from random models for pairs of intra-and interspecific associations of individuals and groups of prey and predator species. Groups and individuals of tanypod instars fed near randomly on groups of prey types and a high proportion (P > 0.60) of prey individuals are quasi-randomly chosen by tanypods in those patches. Tanypod instar-pairs did not show a sustained trophic resource partitioning in time, thus reducing the degree of competitive interactions for food in this predator guild. Spatially segregated and non-segregated tanypod instars formed random aggregations independent of each other at different flow microhabitats. 5. Species-rich prey assemblages such as benthic rotifers and larval chironomids increased the probability of non-selective feeding upon a wide spectrum of prey species by tanypods. Prey choice was governed by prey availability and tanypod individuals fed on many species at rather even proportions independent of each other.",,"Schmid, PE (corresponding author), AUSTRIAN ACAD SCI, INST LIMNOL, BIOL STN LUNZ, SEEHOF 4, A-3293 LUNZ AM SEE, AUSTRIA.",,,,,,,58,49,51,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Corophium volutator (Pallas), a burrowing amphipod abundant in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, frequently interacts with the eastern mudsnail, Ilyanassa obsoleta (Say), as both species utilize similar habitats and food resources. Typically these interactions result in negative effects on C. volutator. There is evidence that Corophium species exhibit avoidance behaviour when interacting with other species, but whether such a response occurs in the presence of I. obsoleta is unknown. To investigate C. volutator response to I. obsoleta. total C. volutator abundance and vertical distribution within the sediment was examined in a field experiment involving I. obsoleta enclosures and exclosures at two mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy. I. obsoleta densities were manipulated between June and August 2008 and their effects on C. volutator abundance and vertical distribution observed. Results varied between mudflats and C volutator size classes. At Peck's Cove, total C volutator abundance was largely unaffected by I. obsoleta. No size class exhibited a distribution shift in response to I. obsoleta, though both mid-sized individuals and adults occupied deeper layers of sediment late in the summer. Abundance of C. volutator in all size classes at Grande Anse was reduced in July in direct proportion to exposure to I. obsoleta, and adults occupied higher sediment layers in July when L obsoleta were excluded, suggesting that I. obsoleta curtailed use of these upper layers. juvenile abundance rebounded in August, possibly due to the mass dispersal of a newly produced juvenile cohort. Adults were reduced in all treatments in August, probably as a result of normal seasonal mortality. Differences in C. volutator responses between mudflats highlight the site-specific nature of such interactions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

I experimentally evaluated the impact of a native omnivorous predator and of habitat structural complexity on the structure of a freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate community. Perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged vegetation present or absent. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, size structure, and diversity as well as gut contents of perch were monitored over a 2-mo summer period. Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost exclusively during the whole experiment, whereas in the absence of vegetation, perch successively increased their consumption of microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria (Insecta: Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had an effect on the diversity (Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity) of only nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates (i.e., potential prey), vegetation had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all macroinvertebrates. The results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. Perch may have affected nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores simultaneously through direct consumption and through indirect release from invertebrate predation, which could explain the lack of a perch effect on nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores. Complex interactions between the omnivorous predator, intermediate consumers, and resource species (macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores) may explain the relationship between perch density and macroinvertebrate diversity. The reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone. Predatory invertebrates may thus play a more important role in food web dynamics of littoral than of pelagic communities.",,"DIEHL, S (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,102,357,369,1,224,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1992,73,5,,,,,1646,1661,,10.2307/1940017,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP740,WOS:A1992JP74000014,,,,,2021-09-23,

Tapes philippinarum occurred at significantly higher densities and occupied a deeper stratum in the sediment than Anomalocardia squamosa, which is a species protected by a much thicker shell. Both species showed an aggregated pattern of spatial distribution over the scale of 10(1) to 10(-2) m. There was no correlation between the densities of the two bivalves nor was there any relationship between body condition and burying depth of Tapes philippinarum. However, individuals of Anomalocardia squamosa residing in the 2-4 cm depth stratum had a significantly higher condition index than their counterparts in the 0-2 cm stratum. The three-dimensional distribution pattern of the two bivalves in relation to density and presence of the other species was investigated by using tagging experiments in the laboratory whereby the exact three-dimensional position of the individuals was recorded in the form of an x,y,z coordinate. The same relative vertical distribution pattern of the bivalves as in the field was maintained while nearest neighbour analysis using the three- (x,y,z coordinates) or two-dimensional (only the x,y coordinates) data yielded different conclusions about the distribution pattern of the bivalves. The three-dimensional analysis consistently suggested an aggregated pattern whereas horizontal distribution was mostly random in the sediment matrix. Both horizontal, vertical and total displacement by individuals of Tapes philippinarum, but not Anomalocardia squamosa, were significantly affected by manipulations of the densities of conspecifics and/or A. squamosa. The latter species, however, was responsive to manipulations in terms of their burying depth. Both species showed considerable movements over the 2-week experimental period. The presence of a predator Portunus pelagicus did not significantly change the vertical distribution pattern of the two bivalves but the mortality of Tapes philippinarum was significantly higher than that of Anomalocardia squamosa. The results suggest that short-term responses such as emigration may be an important response to potential competitive interaction among infaunal bivalves and that such interaction may reduce the usefulness of long-term indicators such as growth and mortality. Whereas burying depth of infaunal bivalves may be influenced intra-specifically by trade-off between predation risk and hunger level, the soft tissue: shell weight (approximate to defence) ratio seems to be a more general predictor of vertical distribution in intra- as well as inter-specific comparisons.","UNIV HONG KONG,SWIRE INST MARINE SCI,HONG KONG,HONG KONG","Lee, SY (corresponding author), UNIV HONG KONG,DEPT ECOL & BIODIVERS,POKFULAM RD,HONG KONG,HONG KONG.",,"Lee, Joe S.

The barred owl (Strix varia), a species historically restricted to eastern North America, has recently expanded its range to completely overlap that of the northern spotted owl. Recent evidence suggests that barred owls may compete with northern spotted owls and may be one cause for recent declines in some northern spotted owl populations. Our focus was to examine whether barred owls have the potential to competitively exclude northern spotted owls from their territories through interference competition. We used a playback experiment to quantify aggressive vocal and physical behavior of barred and northern spotted owls during territorial defense. Experimental trials consisted of displaying northern spotted or barred owl taxidermy mounts, and broadcasting recorded vocalizations of the corresponding species, in both barred and northern spotted owl territories. The frequency of interspecific interactions was lower compared to intraspecific interactions between northern spotted owls alone. However, barred owls responded with higher levels of vocal and physical aggression than did northern spotted owls when agonistic interspecific interactions occurred. Our results suggest that barred owls are likely to assume the dominant role during interspecific interactions with northern spotted owls. Thus, interference competition is a plausible mechanism by which barred owls could contribute to observed population declines of northern spotted owls in areas where the species co-occur.

In soybean, the velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hubner), and the soybean looper, Chrysodeixis includens (Walker), are described as key pests, sharing the same feeding guild. We assessed the intraguild interactions of these species under laboratory conditions. Fitness cost study was conducted to examine the influence of competition on insect development. A video tracking system was used to evaluate behavioral parameters during larval interactions in scenarios with and without food availability. RESULTS In the fitness cost assay, pupal weight was not significantly affected, regardless of sex. However, larval and pupal survival were influenced by the competition, especially in third versus fifth instar scenarios. We detected 40.00% cannibalism and 46.67% predation when A. gemmatalis and C. includens third instars competed with A. gemmatalis fifth instar, respectively. Distance moved, distance between larvae, body contact (food available) and frequency in food of C. includens larvae were negatively affected by interactions. Anticarsia gemmatalis larvae showed highly active behavior, moving twice or more the distance compared to C. includens larvae, and A. gemmatalis spent more time in body contact with food. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that A. gemmatalis has a competitive advantage over C. includens. This study provides important information regarding lepidopteran behavior in soybean. We recommended that additional studies are necessary to understand the effects of interactions, especially in field conditions.","[Ongaratto, Sabrina; Baldin, Edson L.

This reduction occurs although no mortal injuries to workers can occur (conspecifics are separated by mesh), and despite ad libitum food availability. Thus, decreased brood biomass is a consequence of behavioural decision(s) rather than food limitations or reduced numbers of brood tenders.

Aggression in hermit crabs has been well studied in shell acquisition circumstances, yet less is known about hermit crabs' competitive behavior in other contexts, especially as they relate to feeding. As active foragers, competition for food resources may be a major determinant of hermit crab aggression and fighting behavior, particularly in intertidal marine environments, where protein-rich carrion may be limiting. Here, we measured aggressive, competitive interactions between hermit crabs [Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857)] that were presented with carrion in the laboratory, immediately after they were collected from the field. Aggregations of three crabs were provided with either mussel or gastropod flesh. Both forms of carrion naturally indicate food availability, though only the latter may correlate with potential shell availability. We found that levels of aggression rose significantly in response to both carrion conditions, but not in response to a control condition involving the introduction of a non-eatable object. Larger individuals displayed the highest levels of aggressive behavior, but levels of aggression did not differ between crabs provided with the gastropod and the mussel flesh. These results reveal that food-independent of a shell resource-can be a powerful motivator for competitive behavior in hermit crabs. Further studies of food-related aggression between different hermit crab species could shed light on how interspecific competition might lead to potential specializations on different carrion or prey resources.","[Greggor, Alison L.; Laidre, Mark E.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Greggor, Alison L.; Laidre, Mark E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Greggor, Alison L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England","Laidre, ME (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.; Laidre, ME (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mark.laidre@dartmouth.edu,"Greggor, Alison/H-6956-2019","Greggor, Alison/0000-0003-0998-618X",Miller Institute at Berkeley,"We thank the Bodega Marine Laboratory and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for permission to conduct this research.

Here, we compared seed dispersal fitness in two co-occurring plant species (Armeniaca sibirica and Amygdalus davidiana) that inhabit warm temperate deciduous forest in northern China. We tested the hypothesis that seed trait-mediated selection by rodents may influence mutualistic interactions with rodents and then seedling establishment of co-occurring plant species. A. davidiana seeds are larger and harder (thick endocarps) than A. sibirica seeds, but they have similar levels of nutrients (crude fat, crude protein), caloric value and tannin. More A. sibirica seedlings are found in the field. Semi-natural enclosure tests indicated that the two seed species were both harvested by the same six rodent species, but that A. sibirica had mutualistic interactions (scatter hoarding) with four rodent species (Apodemus peninsulae, A. agrarius, Sciurotamias davidianus, Tamias sibiricus), and A. davidiana with only one (S. davidianus). Tagged seed dispersal experiments in the field indicated that more A. sibirica seeds were scatter-hoarded by rodents, and more A. sibirica seeds survived to the next spring and became seedlings. A. sibirica seeds derive more benefit from seed dispersal by rodents than A. davidiana seeds, particularly in years with limited seed dispersers, which well explained the higher seedling recruitment of A. sibirica compared with that of A. davidiana under natural conditions. Our results suggest that seed dispersers may play a significant role in seedling recruitment and indirect competition between co-occurring plant species.","[Zhang, Hongmao] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Anim Behav Res Grp, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongmao; Yan, Chuan; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chang, Gang] Shaanxi Inst Zool, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Anim Behav Res Grp, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Zhang, HM; Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhanghm@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; yanc@ioz.ac.cn; snow1178@snnu.edu.cn; zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31372212, 31172102, 31330013]; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KJZD-EW-TZ-L01]","We thank Fusheng Wang, Wei Wang and Xianying Shang for assistance with seed collection and field studies.

We manipulated perch type and density by the addition of artificial perches to patches of coastal prairie grasslands, varying perch height in the first year and canopy density in the second year. American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) used areas with artificial perches more often than they used natural woody vegetation and areas without woody perches. Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus) patch use did not vary with treatment type. Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) used areas of natural woody vegetation more than patches with artificial perches and patches with no perches. Patch use by Loggerhead Shrikes was also influenced by the presence of complex woody vegetation and interspecific interactions, whereas American Kestrel use was limited by landscape matrix and ground cover density. We believe that predation by Northern Harriers limited Loggerhead Shrikes to patches with escape cover, while competition from American Kestrels prevented Loggerhead Shrikes from concurrent patch use.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA","Kim, DH (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Forestry Wildlife & Fisheries, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",dkim1@utk.edu,,,,,,45,10,10,0,23,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

In recent years the population of fur seals has increased, whereas that of macaroni penguins has declined. Both species feed on krill of similar size ranges, dive to similar depths and are restricted in their foraging range at least while provisioning their offspring. In this study we test the hypothesis that the increased fur seal population at South Georgia may have resulted in greater competition for the prey of macaroni penguins, leading to the decline in their population. We used: (1) satellite-tracking data to investigate the spatial separation of the Bird Island populations of these two species whilst at sea during the breeding seasons of 1999 and 2000 and (2) diet data to assess potential changes in their trophic niches between 1989 and 2000. Foraging ranges of the two species showed considerable overlap in both years, but the concentrations of foraging activity were significantly segregated spatially. The size of krill taken by both species was very similar, but over the last 12 years the prevalence of krill in their diets has diverged, with nowadays less krill in the diet of macaroni penguins than in that of Antarctic fur seals. Despite a significant degree of segregation in spatial resource use by the study populations, it is likely that the South Georgia populations of Antarctic fur seal and macaroni penguin exploit the same krill population during their breeding season. For explaining the opposing population trends of the two species, the relative contributions of independent differential response to interannual variation in krill availability and of interspecies competition cannot be resolved with available evidence. The likely competitive advantage of Antarctic fur seals will be enhanced as their population continues to increase, particularly in years of krill scarcity.","British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Croxall, JP (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",,"Brierley, Andrew S/G-8019-2011; Staniland, Iain/I-4725-2012","Brierley, Andrew S/0000-0002-6438-6892; Staniland, Iain/0000-0003-2736-9134",,,,60,81,85,2,42,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

We consider here a generalization with four species, the minimum number of species allowing other interactions beyond the single loop (one predator, one prey). We show that, contrary to the mean field prediction, on a square lattice the model presents a transition, as the parameter setting the rate at which one species invades another changes, from a coexistence to a state in which one species gets extinct. Such a dependence on the invasion rates shows that the interaction graph structure alone is not enough to predict the outcome of such models. In addition, different invasion rates permit to tune the level of transitiveness, indicating that for the coexistence of all species to persist, there must be a minimum amount of intransitivity.

Substratum selection by the burrowing larvae of the dragonfly Onychogomphus uncatus was examined in an artificial laboratory stream at different larval densities and in the presence of one of three other dragonfly species. 2. The larvae of O. uncatus, as well as those of the other species, clearly preferred gravelly sand substratum rather than gravel or stone. 3. At low larval density (71.4 m(-2)) in the stream, 83% of the O. uncatus were found in gravelly sand. An increase of larval abundance in the stream to 202.4, specimens m(-2) resulted in greater density in all substrata, but this increase was proportionally lowest in gravelly sand. 4. The presence of a second species had various effects on the microdistribution of O. uncatus. In the presence of Gomphus simillimus or Cordulegaster boltonii immaculifrons the distribution of O. uncatus changed significantly; their density increased in the normally less preferred substrata.

Thus, similar-sized carnivores are likely to compete for food. We compared the summer diets of snow leopards Panthera uncia and wolves Canis lupus in Sarychat-Ertash Reserve in the Tien-Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan, based on analysis of genetically confirmed scats. Abundances of the principal prey species, argali Ovis ammon and Siberian ibex Capra sibirica, were estimated from field surveys. The diets consisted of few species, with high interspecific overlap (Pianka's index = 0.91). Argali was the predominant prey, with > 50% frequency of occurrence in both snow leopard and wolf scats. This was followed by Siberian ibex and marmots Marmota baibacina. Being largely unavailable, remains of livestock were not detected in any of the scats. In the snow leopard diet, proportions of argali and ibex were in line with the relative availabilities of these animals in the Reserve. This was in contrast to the diet of wolf, where argali occurred according to availability and ibex was significantly underrepresented. The high diet overlap indicates that the two predators might compete for food when the diversity of profitable, large prey is low. Competition may be more intense in winter, when marmots are not available. Hunting of argali and ibex outside the Reserve may be unsustainable and therefore reduce their abundances over time. This will affect both predators negatively and intensify competition for food. Reduction in ibex populations will directly affect the snow leopard, and the wolf is likely to be indirectly affected as a result of increased snow leopard predation of argali.","[Jumabay-Uulu, Kubanychbek] Snow Leopard Fdn Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Wegge, Per] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Mishra, Charudutt; Sharma, Koustubh] Snow Leopard Trust, Mysore, Karnataka, India; [Mishra, Charudutt; Sharma, Koustubh] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore, Karnataka, India","Wegge, P (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway.",per.wegge@umb.no,,,Panthera; Snow Leopard Trust,"The study was funded by Panthera and the Snow Leopard Trust.

The expanding range of T piniperda, its ability to develop and shoot-feed in most North American pine species, and its relatively early spring activity have generated questions about its potential interactions with native competitors and natural enemies. Our objectives were to compare phenology of T piniperda with native phloem-feeding insects and to evaluate phenological synchrony between T. piniperda and native predators in red pine forest stands. We monitored adult beetle activity using baited funnel traps and observations of insect activity on freshly cut red pine logs in four to eight stands in southwestern and northern lower Michigan during two field seasons. Logs were periodically returned to the laboratory and individually caged. Phloem-feeders, predators and parasitoids emerging from logs were identified. Tomicus piniperda was collected only in southwestern stands and was consistently the first scolytid collected in funnel traps. Ten native phloem-feeding species were collected in funnel traps or reared from logs; at least two native species were actively colonizing logs concommitently with T piniperda in early spring. We observed adults of the predatory clerid Thanasimus dubius (F.) actively moving on logs and preying on T piniperda adults and other scolytids early in spring, roughly 3-4 A before this species was first collected in funnel traps. Other native scolytid predators including Cucujus clavipes F. and three staphylinids were also active early in spring. Results suggests that T piniperda is likely to encounter interspecific competitors and natural enemies in North America, but further research will be needed to demonstrate how these interactions affect T piniperda population dynamics.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Kennedy, AA (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,56,15,16,0,11,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

In this study, we examine the impacts of the trophic ecology of non-native fishes on the three species' in the San Rafael River, Utah, USA. We employ a suite of abundance comparisons, stable isotope techniques and size-at-age back-calculation analyses to compare food web structure and growth rates of the three species' in study areas with and without established populations of non-native species. We found that the three species' are more abundant in areas with few non-native fishes present, regardless of habitat complexity. Stable isotope analyses indicate non-native fishes lengthen the food chain by 0.5 trophic positions. Further, the trophic niche spaces of the native fishes shift and are narrower in the presence of non-native fishes, as several non-native species' trophic niche spaces overlap almost entirely with each of the three species' (bluehead sucker and flannelmouth sucker 100%, roundtail chub 98.5%) indicating strong potential for competition. However, the three species' demonstrated no evidence of reduced growth in the presence of these non-native fishes. Collectively, these results suggest that while non-native fishes alter the food web structure presenting novel sources of predation and competition, mechanisms other than competition are controlling the size-structure of three species' populations in the San Rafael River.","[Walsworth, Timothy E.; Budy, Phaedra; Thiede, Gary P.] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Walsworth, TE (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",tewalsworth@gmail.com,,,United States Bureau of Reclamation Activities to Avoid Jeopardy Program; S.E. and Jessie E.

American toads arrive at breeding ponds 4-10 wk after wood frogs and typically select breeding sites that lack wood frog tadpoles. In an experiment conducted in seminatural ponds, adult toads completely avoided ovipositing in ponds with wood frog tadpoles. Additional experiments strongly suggest that predation of wood frog tadpoles on toad eggs and larvae is the primary reason for the evolution of adult avoidance behavior in toads. In one set of experiments, toad eggs and hatchlings suffered complete mortality within two days after being placed in artificial ponds containing natural densities of wood frog tadpoles. Similar mortality occurred when eggs and hatchlings were introduced into natural breeding sites. In one experiment in which 2000 toad hatchlings were added to natural ponds, all were killed and consumed within 45 min by wood frog tadpoles. Although tadpoles of most anurans are considered to be microphagous suspension feeders that occupy lower trophic levels of food chains, a growing body of evidence indicates that many tadpoles can temporarily shift feeding modes to become upper level, macrophagous predators. Because facultative predators such as wood frog tadpoles often reach far higher densities in ponds than do top predators, their role in structuring aquatic communities via opportunistic predation may be more important than previously realized.",,"PETRANKA, JW (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA,DEPT BIOL,ASHEVILLE,NC 28804, USA.",,,,,,,33,92,98,0,14,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS BUSINESS OFFICE,CARBONDALE,"SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT ZOOLOGY, CARBONDALE, IL 62901-6501",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,AUG 17,1994,,3,,,,,691,697,,10.2307/1447185,,,7,Zoology,Zoology,PD127,WOS:A1994PD12700012,,,,,2021-09-23,

We investigated habitat use patterns using landscape and microhabitat variables. In addition, we explored a previously postulated competition hypothesis involving the Black-breasted Puffleg and the Gorgeted Sunangel Heliangelus strophianus. Our results suggest that landscape variables may play a role in the habitat selection process; specifically the distance to nearest forest border seems to have a significant effect on our habitat model. We speculate that, as the species is known to perform seasonal movements, the avoidance of forest border might reduce the physiological stress caused by altitudinal migration. At microhabitat level, Black-breasted Puffleg seems not sensitive to forest structure variables. Our findings suggest that ensuring forest tract connectivity, between the altitudinal extremes of the species' range at the north-western flanks of the Pichincha volcano, might be crucial for survival of the species during its annual cycle. However, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) indicates that Black-breasted Puffleg and the Gorgeted Sunangel do not overlap spatially, but this finding is not conclusive considering our field observations.","[Guevara, Esteban A.] Area Invest Monitoreo Avifauna Aves & Conservac B, Quito, Ecuador; [Guevara, Esteban A.; Duivenvoorden, Joost F.] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 HX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bonaccorso, Elisa] Univ Tecnol Indoamer Machala & Sabanilla, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Cambio Climat, Quito, Ecuador","Guevara, EA (corresponding author), Area Invest Monitoreo Avifauna Aves & Conservac B, Pasaje Joaquin Tinajero E3-05 & Jorge Drom Casill, Quito, Ecuador.",eguevara@avesconservacion.org,,"Bonaccorso, Elisa/0000-0002-7262-9356; Guevara, Esteban/0000-0002-2220-1298","EcoFondo (Fondo Ambiental Nacional); BirdLife's Preventing Extinction Programme; Ecuadorian National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation SENESCYT","We deeply thank Aves y Conservacion staff for logistical support.

Muskrat populations have been reduced in some streams where North American river otters (Lontra canadensis) were reintroduced, and it has been hypothesized that otter reintroduction could be used as a tool for conservation of mussels. We used occupancy estimation methods to evaluate the ecological relationship between muskrats and otters by collecting presence-absence data based on field sign found at bridge crossings in eastern and central Kentucky. Mean detection probabilities (ps) and occupancy probabilities (psi s) for muskrats were 0.692 (SE = 0.045) and 0.723 (SE = 0.071) and for otters were 0.623 (SE = 0.036) and 0.662 (SE = 0.069), respectively. Otter occupancy was related negatively to distance from release sites, which suggests that the otter population is still expanding its range. A 2-species interaction model indicated that the occupancy by muskrats and river otters was independent, and we conclude that river otter reintroduction would not be an effective strategy for conserving mussels.","[Williamson, Ryan] Univ Tennessee, Dept Forestry Wildlife & Fisheries, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Clark, Joseph D.] Univ Tennessee, US Geol Survey, Leetaon Sci Ctr, So Appalachian Res Branch, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Clark, JD (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Forestry Wildlife & Fisheries, 274 Ellington Plant Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",jclark1@utk.edu,,,"United States Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; National Park Service; University of Tennessee, Knoxville","Funding for this project was provided by the United States Geological Survey, the National Park Service, and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Recent changes in both climate and vertebrate community assemblages have created a unique opportunity to examine the impacts of two dynamic forces on population regulation. We examined the effects of warming winter conditions and the reestablishment of a previously extirpated predator, the fisher (Martes pennanti), on regulatory mechanisms in a northern-adapted mammal, the porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), along their southern range boundary. Using a long-term (17-year) capture-recapture data set, we (1) quantified the impacts of climate change and increased fisher predation on the survival of adult porcupines at their regional southern terminus, (2) assessed recruitment (via both adult fecundity and juvenile survival) of porcupines, and (3) modeled the relative importance of predation and winter conditions on the demography and population growth rate (lambda). Severe winters and abundant predators interacted synergistically to reduce adult survivorship by as much as 44%, while expanding predator populations led to near reproductive failure among porcupines. Increasing predatory pressure, disruptions in this community module, and more frequent extreme winter weather events led to predicted extirpation within 50 years, whereas in the absence of predators, the population was viable. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding behind distributional shifts resulting from climate change and may be broadly relevant for predicting future distributional shifts in other northern-adapted mammalian species.","[Pokallus, John W.; Pauli, Jonathan N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Pokallus, JW (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jnpauli@wisc.edu,,,Plum Creek Foundation; University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; University of Wisconsin-Madison Graduate School Fall Competition,"We sincerely thank Richard P.

Discussions about the use of biomolecular tools indicate that gene expression analysis with rotifers should be available in the next few years. Such analyses will be a great asset as they enable ecotoxicologists to study molecular mechanisms of toxicity. Rotifers also appear as useful tools in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites that find their way into aquatic ecosystems because their sensitivity to some of these substances is higher than that of cladocerans and algae. The nature and extent of the impact of potential endocrine disruptors on aquatic invertebrates is another poorly resolved issue for which rotifers are a promising tool. Indeed, rotifers seem to be particularly sensitive to androgenic and anti-antiandrogenic substances, whereas copepods and cladocerans are typically more affected by estrogens and juvenile hormone-like compounds. Besides their usefulness in these emerging fields of aquatic ecotoxicology, it was emphasized that research with rotifers on basic issues like, e.g., toxicant interference with predation, competition, or interspecific and interclonal variation in ecotoxicological tests is still needed.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Univ Liege, Lab Anim Ecol & Ecotoxicol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium","Snell, TW (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",terry.snell@biology.gatech.edu,,,,,,33,56,68,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,NOV,2007,593,,,,,,227,232,,10.1007/s10750-007-9045-x,,,6,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,206TF,WOS:000249205100025,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-23,

First, a field survey was carried out where different habitat variables and the densities of both species were quantified and subjected to principal components analysis. Then the abundance of stone loach was related to the scores of the retained axes (eigenvalues >1). The abundance of stone loach was positively correlated to substrate particle size, amount of shade, temperature, discharge and current velocity, but negatively correlated to brown trout abundance. Secondly, a month-long field enclosure experiment in a stream was performed to test for any negative effects of brown trout on stone loach growth. Four treatments were used: intraspecific competition (stone loach at double density), interspecific competition (stone loach + small trout), predation (stone loach + large trout) and a control (stone loach alone). The results showed that large trout tended to have negative effects on final stone loach biomass. The absence of a negative effect of large trout on resource density suggests that nonlethal effects rather than resource competition caused this trend.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.persson@limnol.lu.se,,,,,,37,8,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

In particular, competition with older and larger conspecifics and heterospecifics may influence the number and characteristics of individuals successfully making the transition. We investigated whether the availability of enemy-free space mediated the interaction between adult goldspot gobies (Gnatholepis thompsoni), a common tropical reef fish, and juvenile conspecifics that had recently settled from the plankton. We added rocks, which provide refuge from predators, to one-half of each of five entire coral reefs in the Bahamas and measured the survival and growth of recent settlers in relation to adult goby densities. We also evaluated whether mortality was selective with respect to three larval traits (age at settlement, size at settlement, and presettlement growth rate) and measured the influence of refuge availability and adult goby density on selection intensity. Selective mortality was measured by comparing larval traits of newly settled gobies (<= 5 d postsettlement) with those of survivors (2-3 week postsettlement juveniles). We detected a negative relationship between juvenile survival and adult goby density in both low- and high-refuge habitats, though experimental refuge addition reduced the intensity of this density dependence. Juvenile growth also declined with increasing adult goby density, but this effect was similar in both low- and high-refuge habitats. Refuge availability had no consistent effect on selective mortality, but adult goby density was significantly related to the intensity of size-selective mortality: bigger juveniles were favored where adults were abundant, and smaller juveniles were favored where adults were rare. Given the typically large difference in sizes of juveniles and adults, similar stage-structured interactions may be common but underappreciated in many marine species.","[Samhouri, Jameal F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Steele, Mark A.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Forrester, Graham E.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Samhouri, JF (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",jameal.samhouri@noaa.gov,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X; Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 0222087]; American Museum of Natural History; American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists; International Women's Fishing Association; Sigma Xi; UC Regents; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; NOAA-NURPNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [CMRC-05-PRRV-01-05A, CMRC-01-NRME-010-3C, CMRC-03-NRME-01-04A, CMRC-03-NRME-01-05C]","Many thanks to those who helped us with field work, including R.

In the Iberian Peninsula, the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans, and other exotic freshwater turtles have been introduced, competing and displacing the native endangered terrapins (the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, and the Spanish terrapin, Mauremys leprosa). Although the nature of competitive interactions remains unclear, direct competition for food is likely to occur. Both native and invasive freshwater turtles are common predators of amphibian tadpoles. Naive amphibian tadpoles are known to recognize and respond to local predators with no prior experience, but tadpoles might not recognize new predatory species, since they have not shared a long evolutionary history with them. We examined the ability of four species of Iberian anuran tadpoles to recognize and respond to chemical cues from invasive and native freshwater predatory turtles. Three of the four tadpole species tested reduced their swimming activity when cues from native turtles were present in water, but not when cues belonged to exotic turtles. This inability of tadpole prey to respond innately to chemicals from introduced predatory turtles might be one of the causes that explains the displacement of native populations of Iberian terrapins by invasive exotic turtles, and may help clarify why alien predators sometimes prosper better in new habitats than locally adapted predators.

However, plant quality may also be crucial in mediating herbivore interspecific interactions. This is especially true when competition occurs between distantly related herbivore species, given that small terrestrial herbivores (e.g., insect herbivores) appear to be more sensitive to alterations of plant quality than plant quantity. In this study, we first tested in the field whether large vertebrate herbivores (cattle Bos taurus) exerted a negative effect on smaller insect herbivores (grasshopper Euchorthippus unicolor) through their overlapping foraging preferences for a dominant grass Leymus chinensis. We measured changes in grass quantity, grass quality, and microclimatic conditions in response to vertebrate grazing and conducted additional manipulative studies in the field and the laboratory to identify potential mechanisms underlying the interaction. Our results showed that grazing by large herbivores caused a significant decline in grasshopper population density and individual performance (survival, size, and weight of both female and male E. unicolor), despite a 38% increase in grass nitrogen (N) content in grazed plots. Experiments manipulating N levels of L. chinensis in the field and the laboratory confirmed that enriching plant N had a negative effect on grasshopper individual performance and population size. Therefore, enhanced quality (N content) of plant resources appears to be an important driver in mediating the negative effect of vertebrate grazing on grasshoppers. Synthesis. We document that phylogenetic relatedness and trait similarity can be poor predictors of interaction strength in some cases, since distantly related herbivores of disparate size can interact indirectly via changes in plant quality. Counter-intuitively, the observed negative effect of cattle on grasshoppers was mediated, at least in part, by an increase in plant quality in cattle grazed areas. The implication is that light to moderate grazing, a common management strategy, may contribute to suppression of grasshoppers in the Eurasian steppe grassland system by altering plant nutrient supplies.","[Zhu, Yu; Zhong, Zhiwei; Wang, Deli; Ma, Quanhui; Hassan, Nazim; Zhu, Hui; Wang, Ling] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Sch Environm, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol,Minist Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yu] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pages, Jordi F.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Isle Of Anglesey, Wales; [Finke, Deborah] Univ Missouri, Div Plant Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Wang, D (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Sch Environm, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol,Minist Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wangd@nenu.edu.cn,"Pages, Jordi F/E-7107-2013; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Pages, Jordi F/0000-0001-9346-8312; Liu, Chen/0000-0002-9916-2346; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; ZHU, HUI/0000-0003-0348-5560","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500602]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31230012, 31302012, 31700357]; Program for Introducing Talents to Universities [B16011]; Program for Innovative Research Team in University [IRT-16R11]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2412016KJ023]; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for WalesUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Higher Education Funding Council for England","National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0500602; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31230012, 31302012 and 31700357; Program for Introducing Talents to Universities, Grant/Award Number: B16011; Program for Innovative Research Team in University, Grant/Award Number: IRT-16R11; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2412016KJ023; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales",,69,11,12,9,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We manipulated breeding pool size in order to demonstrate experimentally that breeding habitat selection strategy has evolved in concert with changes in parental care and mating system. We also manipulated intra- and interspecific larval interactions to demonstrate that larval adaptation to the use of very small pools for breeding affected the evolution of larval competition and cannibalism. Our results illustrate the intimate connection between breeding pool ecology, parental care and mating strategies in Peruvian poison frogs.","[Brown, J.

To locate hosts for their offspring, parasitic wasps, or parasitoids, use plant odour blends induced by herbivore feeding. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) may also be used by competitors and predators. Therefore, offspring of parasitoids that respond to the most conspicuous odours may find themselves more frequently involved in competition or predation risk. We studied cultivars of Brassica oleracea that are known to differ in volatile production that underlies attractiveness to parasitoids and asked whether variation in this parameter is associated with a heterogeneous distribution of intrinsic competition among parasitoid larvae and predation risk by hyperparasitoids that parasitize parasitoid larvae or pupae. We inoculated field-grown plants with Pieris caterpillars and, thereafter, exposed them to the natural parasitoid community. We measured the frequency of multiple incidences of parasitism in these herbivores. Cocoons of the parasitoids were collected to identify the degree of hyperparasitism associated with different Brassica cultivars. Pieris caterpillars on cultivars that were more attractive to Cotesia parasitoids were more commonly parasitized by several females of the same (superparasitism) or different wasp species (multiparasitism) than caterpillars on less attractive plants. Cocoons of parasitoids on attractive plants also more frequently produced hyperparasitoids. Our results show that there is heterogeneity in intrinsic competition and risk of hyperparasitism for parasitoids on different cabbage cultivars and that this heterogeneity is likely generated by variation in attraction of parasitoids to HIPVs of these cultivars. We conclude that parasitoids may find themselves between a rock and a hard place as cues for host presence may also predict high levels of competition and risk of predation. We speculate that this affects selection on parasitoid responses to plant odours and enhances selection on traits that make wasps better intrinsic or extrinsic competitors as well as selection for adaptive traits - such as crypsis - that protect them against hyperparasitoids.

In this paper, I describe how the competitive interaction between two species of gall forming fly, Lipara lucens and L. rufitarsis, is modified as a consequence of interactions with a host plant and natural enemies. The results of field experiments and observations of wild populations show that the two species compete strongly for stems of the common reed, Phragmites australis. L. lucens is competitively inferior, having significantly increased mortality in the presence of heterospecifics. No lasting negative effects of interspecific competition on L. rufitarsis could be found. In fact, the results show that L. rufitarsis can benefit from the presence of heterospecifics. It can usurp the galls of L. lucens, and experiences reduced mortality and increased fecundity as a result. Thus, L. rufitarsis can be described as a kleptoparasite. Kleptoparasitism in this system is mediated by the host plant and by the principal parasitoid of L. rufitarsis. L. rufitarsis can only benefit from the presence of its competitor because L. lucens induces P. australis to form a large, robust gall that repels the attacks of the ichneumonid wasp Endromopoda phragmitidis. These results show how facultative kleptoparasitism can modify the ecological consequences of interspecific competition for both individuals and populations.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England","Reader, T (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.",,"Reader, Tom/B-5518-2008","Reader, Tom/0000-0001-7586-8814",,,,50,15,16,0,16,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2003,103,1,,,,,101,112,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12575.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,735LZ,WOS:000186118000011,,,,,2021-09-23,

The exposed sandy beach is an example of a physically rigorous environment where biological interactions have long been considered insignificant. We examined the interaction between the infaunal clam, Donax variabilis, and the hydroid, Lovenella gracilis, on exposed sandy beaches in North Carolina. Epibiotic occupation of Donax by hydroids has been repeatedly observed on ocean beaches but rarely investigated. By providing a stable substrate for attachment, the clam facilitates the persistence of the hydroid in the intertidal beach; however, benefits or costs experienced by the host as a result of this association are unknown. By exposing clams with and without hydroid colonies to multiple types of clam predators, we tested the effectiveness of the hydroid, which possesses stinging nematocysts, in defending its host. The hydroid defended the clam against one common predator, the Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus). Against speckled crabs (Arenaeus cribrarius) and ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata), however, the hydroid offered no protection for its host and instead facilitated predation. The epibiotic hydroid, which projects above the surface of the sand, allowed the crabs to more readily detect clams below the surface. In the field, we evaluated the effect of the hydroid on the tidally synchronized migrations and bur-rowing speed of the clam. The hydroid, which can form large colonies on the posterior end of the clam, had no effect on Donax burrowing speed, but did reduce the speed of transport of clams by wave swash. Depending on relative predation pressure, the occupation of D. variabilis by L. gracilis can alternately be characterized as beneficial or detrimental to the host.","Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Manning, LM (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, 3431 Arendell St, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA.",,,,,,,61,19,22,1,12,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2003,134,3,,,,,415,422,,10.1007/s00442-002-1134-y,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,657BG,WOS:000181645100016,12647150,,,,2021-09-23,

Interpretation of field survey data can be difficult, however, because species numbers in any case change with time and location, as a result of density dependence acting through or together with changing levels of food supply, predation, parasitism, interspecific competition, migration, environmental variables, and so on. As a first step toward resolving these difficulties it is argued that single-species microcosm experiments are needed that establish the joint effects on populations of stress levels and population density. Inter alia these will show how carrying capacity changes with stress levels in the absence of variation in other physical and biotic variables. Until now population effects of stressors have generally been assessed experimentally by calculating population growth rates in Life Table Response Experiments (LTREs), but these are time consuming and labor intensive and have only been performed at low population density. It is argued that measurements made at low density may underestimate population stress responses. To undertake the proposed experiments, faster and more efficient techniques for measuring population growth rates and their associated confidence intervals are needed, and some suggestions are made as to hew these might be achieved.","Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Div Zool, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England","Sibly, RM (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Div Zool, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England.",,,"Sibly, Richard/0000-0001-6828-3543",,,,17,57,60,0,9,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

However, small predators may also be obliged to avoid potentially agonistic encounters with larger predators due to interspecific competition and intraguild predation. We used occupancy models and indices of temporal overlap to evaluate whether the occurrence of prey species, ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) and top predators (puma Puma concolor and jaguar Panthera onca) influenced the habitat use and activity patterns of the northern tiger cat (Leopardus tigrinus) and jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) in a region of the semi-arid Caatinga biome in Bahia, northeastern Brazil. The occurrence of prey had a positive influence on the use of habitat by the small felids. The northern tiger cat was nocturnal-crepuscular and presented a high degree of temporal overlap with Spix's cavy (Galea spixii) and the rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris). The jaguarundi was diurnal, by contrast and overlapped temporally with the agouti (Dasyprocta nigriclunis). The occurrence of the ocelot did not influence the habitat or daily activity pattern of the jaguarundi, but presented a high degree of temporal overlap with the northern tiger cat, which adopted a strategy of spatial segregation to avoid direct contact with this dominant competitor. The top predators did not influence the spatiotemporal distribution of the small felids, indicating that their niches are segregated by dietary parameters related to differences in body size. Our results indicate that the availability of prey has a more profound influence on the spatiotemporal ecology of the small felids than the occurrence of the top predators, although the presence of the northern tiger cat appeared to be correlated negatively with that of the ocelot. We believe that environmental factors, such as the conservation status, size and isolation of native habitats, may have a fundamental influence on the strategies adopted by the northern tiger cat to mediate its coexistence with the ocelot.","[Dias, D.

In long-lived plants, however, lifetime patterns and mechanisms of density dependence are difficult to study. Here, we examine effects of intraspecific and community density on the lifetime fecundity of two long-lived shrub species from South African Fynbos: Protea repens (animal-pollinated, hermaphroditic) and Leucadendron rubrum (wind-pollinated, dioecious). Both species are serotinous, retaining seeds in cones until fire kills the mother plant. We measured lifetime fecundity as the product of cone number, proportion of cones that are not damaged by predation and seed set (fertile seeds per intact cone). Intraspecific and community densities were quantified by counting individuals of target species and all Proteaceae in small- and large-scale neighbourhoods (10 m and 50 m radius) around each focal individual. Additionally, we determined the age and size of focal individuals. We found that lifetime fecundity of the wind-pollinated L rubrum is density independent. In contrast, the lifetime fecundity of the animal-pollinated P. repens increases with large-scale intraspecific density and shows a hump-shaped relationship to large-scale community density. Community density has a hump-shaped effect on seed set (probably through partial absence of generalized pollinators at low and competition for pollinators at high densities) and negatively affects cone number per individual. For both species, plant age decreases seed set while increasing lifetime fecundity. The qualitative differences in the density dependence of lifetime fecundity may arise from differences between animal and wind pollination. In particular, interactions with generalized animal pollinators may cause community-level Allee effects with profound consequences for the future dynamics of long-lived plant populations and communities.

While such studies on nonprimate taxa have continued at a steady pace, they have only crept forward for primate species (Fig.1). In the intervening time, the field of macroecology (Box 1) rapidly developed and has resulted in several books and the establishment of new research institutes.

We compare them with selected, co-occurring fish species, including threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) among others, and both benthic and limnetic invertebrates. Field sites: Subarctic lakes in two regions that differ greatly in colonization history (ten in Iceland and four in Alaska). Methods: We used natural variation in the stable isotope ratios delta C-13 and delta N-15 to estimate trends in trophic position and relative use of benthic and limnetic carbon sources with body size among lakes and among species x morph x body size brackets within lakes. Results: (1) In subarctic lakes with low levels of fish diversity, food chains lengthened via insertion of intermediate prey. (2) Ecosystem attributes, including the presence of competitors and competitor resource use, were associated with allometric shifts in Arctic charr resource use.

Many coral reef fish species settle preferentially to live coral at the end of their larval phase where they interact with other species that recruited to the same habitat patch at a similar time. Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities.","[McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",mark.mccormick@jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"Research was funded through the Australian Research Council.

Acomys cahirinus is nocturnal and A. russatus is diurnal. although it becomes nocturnal if its congener is experimentally removed, suggesting that the temporal partitioning is driven by interspecific competition. Such extreme temporal partitioning within the diel cycle has not previously been recorded elsewhere among mammals. Using artificial food patches. we studied microhabitat use and foraging efficiencies under seasonally variable predator regimes and physiological pressures to assess the roles that habitat structure and foraging behavior might play in coexistence. The two species showed trade-offs in foraging efficiency leading to different strategies of microhabitat use that may help promote coexistence. A. cahirinus is a cream skimmer, a relatively inefficient forager that gives up at relatively high giving-up densities, and a habitat generalist: whereas A. russatus is a habitat specialist, perhaps compensating for this restricted niche by foraging very efficiently to low giving-up densities. Seasonal shifts in foraging microhabitat suggest that the response to predation risk from snakes in summer overrides and opposes the effects of physiological costs and risk from owls and diurnal raptors, leading to increased predatory risk and foraging microhabitat overlap in summer. Temporal partitioning of the food resource may compensate for decreased partitioning of the habitat resource in summer. Provision of cover was more important than escape distance in determining habitat and microhabitat use. Boulder fields in rocky deserts provide a physical structure that is more complex and provides more continuous cover than is available in open deserts, where most research on community structure of desert rodents has been carried out. We propose that this physical structure of rocky deserts, in conjunction with the desert adaptations of A. russatus, may enable the extreme temporal partitioning to opposite parts of the diel cycle and, therefore, contributes to coexistence in this community.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Jones, M (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Div Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Jones, Menna E/J-7975-2012","Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022",,,,70,84,88,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2001,82,8,,,,,2164,2176,,10.2307/2680223,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,462ZP,WOS:000170452600006,,,,,2021-09-23,

An ecological model for the community was developed by means of interspecific relationship including competition and predation to calculate the APDP. As a case study, we reported here the ecotoxicological effects of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) collected from Bohai oil field on densities of two algae, Platymonas subcordiformis and Isochrysis galbana, a rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, and of a cladocera, Penilia avirostris, in single species and a microcosm experiment Time scales expressing toxic effect increased with increasing levels of toxic effect from molecule to community. Remarkable periodic changes in densities were found during the tests in microcosm experiment, revealing a strong species reaction. The minimum time scale characterizing toxic effect at a community level should be the common cycle of population densities of the microcosm. In addition, the cycles of plankton densities shortened in general with increasing PHC, showing an evident toxic effect on the microcosm. Using APDP as the endpoint, a threshold concentration for the modeled microcosm was calculated to be 0.404 mg-PHC-1. The APDP was found to be more sensitive and reliable than the standing crops of populations as the endpoint This indicated that the APDP, an endpoint at the community level, could be quantitatively related to the endpoints at the population level, and led to the quantitative concentration-toxic effect relationship at the community level.","[Wang, Changyou; Wang, Siwen; Luo, Zhuhua; Mao, Longjiang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Xinming] Jiangsu Environm Monitoring Ctr, Nanjing 210036, Peoples R China; [Yang, Bin] Beibu Gulf Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Marine Disaster Beibu Gulf, Qinzhou 535011, Peoples R China; [Liang, Shengkang] Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Marine Chem Theory & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China","Wang, CY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",chy.w@hotmail.com,,,Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2020r028]; National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC1402101]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This study was supported by the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST (Project No. 2020r028), the National Key Research and Development Program (Project No. 2016YFC1402101), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,83,0,0,5,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-6513,1090-2414,,ECOTOX ENVIRON SAFE,Ecotox.

We selected, a priori, three species pairs consisting of species that are morphologically and taxonomically similar and may therefore be likely to engage in interspecific, consumptive competition. We then examined a large-scale database of snake detection/nondetection data and used occupancy modelling to determine whether these species occur together more or less frequently than expected by chance while accounting for variation in detection probability among species and incorporating important habitat categories in the models. For some snakes, we obtained evidence that the probabilities that habitat patches are used are influenced by the presence of potentially competing congeneric species. Specifically, timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) were less likely than expected by chance to use areas that also contained eastern diamond-backed rattlesnakes (Crotalus adamanteus) when the proportion of evergreen forest was relatively high. Otherwise, they occurred together more often than expected by chance. Complex relationships were revealed between habitat use, detection probabilities and occupancy probabilities of North American racers (Coluber constrictor) and coachwhips (Coluber flagellum) that indicated the probability of competitive exclusion increased with increasing area of grassland habitat, although there was some model uncertainty. Cornsnakes (Pantherophis guttatus or Pantherophis slowinskii) and ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis, Pantherophis spiloides, or Pantherophis obsoletus) exhibited differences in habitat selection, but we obtained no evidence that patterns of use for this species pair were influenced by current interspecific interactions. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that competitive interactions influence snake assemblage composition; the strength of these effects was affected by landscape-scale habitat features. Furthermore, we suggest that current interspecific interactions may influence snake occupancy, challenging the paradigm that contemporary patterns of snake co-occurrence are largely a function of diet partitioning that arose over evolutionary time.","[Steen, David A.; Brock, Jean C.; Smith, Lora L.] Joseph W Jones Ecol Res Ctr, Newton, GA 39870 USA; [Steen, David A.; McClure, Christopher J.

By contrast, the relevance of environmental stressors for the spread of resistance during pesticide exposure has not been studied. Moreover, the consequences of interactions between different stressors have not been considered. Here we show that stress through intraspecific competition accelerates microevolution, because it enhances fitness differences between adapted and non-adapted individuals. By contrast, stress through interspecific competition or predation reduces intraspecific competition and thereby delays microevolution. This was demonstrated in mosquito populations (Culex quinquefasciatus) that were exposed to the pesticide chlorpyrifos. Non-selective predation through harvesting and interspecific competition with Daphnia magna delayed the selection for individuals carrying the ace-1(R) resistance allele. Under non-toxic conditions, susceptible individuals without ace-1(R) prevailed. Likewise, predation delayed the reverse adaptation of the populations to a non-toxic environment, while the effect of interspecific competition was not significant. Applying a simulation model, we further identified how microevolution is generally determined by the type and degree of competition and predation. We infer that interactions with other species-especially strong in ecosystems with high biodiversity-can delay the development of pesticide resistance.","[Becker, Jeremias Martin; Liess, Matthias] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Becker, Jeremias Martin; Liess, Matthias] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Anal, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Becker, JM (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",jeremias.becker@ufz.de,"Liess, Matthias/A-8582-2009","Liess, Matthias/0000-0002-3321-8909; Becker, Jeremias/0000-0003-1496-0312",Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE); Helmholtz strategic research funding (POF III),This work was supported by Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE) and by the Helmholtz strategic research funding (POF III).,,49,19,19,0,49,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

We tested this hypothesis by studying a small teleost (nine-spined stickleback, Pungitius pungitius) from four marine and five lake (diverse fish community) and nine pond (impoverished fish community) populations. In line with theory, pond fish tended to be larger than their marine or lake conspecifics, sometimes reaching giant sizes. In two geographically independent cases when predatory fish had been introduced into ponds, fish were smaller than those in nearby ponds lacking predators. Pond fish were also smaller when found in sympatry with three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) than those in ponds lacking competitors. Size-at-age analyses demonstrated that larger size in ponds was achieved by both increased growth rates and extended longevity of pond fish. Results from a common garden experiment indicate that the growth differences had a genetic basis: pond fish developed two to three times higher body mass than marine fish during 36 weeks of growth under similar conditions. Hence, reduced risk of predation and interspecific competition appear to be chief forces driving insular body size evolution toward gigantism.","[Herczeg, Gabor; Gonda, Abigel; Merila, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Herczeg, G (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",gabor.herczeg@helsinki.fi; abigel.gonda@helsinki.fi; juha.merila@helsinki.fi,"Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008; Herczeg, Gabor/AAF-9978-2020","Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072; Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Ministry of Education and Centre for International Mobility (CIMO),"We thank Victor Berger, Goran Englund, Tuomas Leinonen, Daniel Lussetti, and Pirkko Siikamaki for their help in obtaining the samples.

Yet, very little is known how animals gather and integrate information about environmental factors to fine tune investment. Observing the decisions and success of other individuals, particularly when those individuals initiate breeding earlier, may provide a way for animals to quickly arrive at better breeding investment decisions. Here we show, with a field experiment using artificial nests appearing similar to resident tit nests with completed clutches, that a migratory bird can use the observed high and low clutch size of a resident competing bird species to increase and decrease clutch size and egg mass, accordingly. Our results demonstrate that songbirds can discriminate between high and low quantity of heterospecific eggs, and that social information can have long-term physiological consequences affecting reproductive strategies.

In particular, escape from parasitoids, predators and competitors could mediate a successful host shift by compensating for decreased feeding performance on a new plant. Here I investigate the effects that two braconid wasp parasitoids (Opius lectus and Biosteres melleus) have on sympatric host races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) infesting apple (Malus pumila) and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) at a field site near Grant, Michigan, USA. Levels of parasitoid attack were much lower for fly larvae infesting the derived host apple (13%) compared to the ancestral host hawthorn (46%). At least three factors contributed to apples being a relatively safe haven from parasitoids for maggots. First, apples were larger (mean fruit width = 5.2 cm) than hawthorns (mean width = 1.6 cm). Apples therefore provided greater physical protection for fly larvae than hawthorns because the ovipositors of female wasps were too short to reach a majority of maggots feeding within apples. Second, apples had an earlier fruiting phenology than hawthorns and the seasonal distribution of O. lectus parasitoids was asynchronous with the development of larvae in apples. Third, hawthorn fruits were infested by various species of caterpillars (tortricids and an agonoxenid) and a curculionid weevil to a much greater degree than apples (65% compared to 11%). These heterospecific insects forced fly larvae to feed near the surface of hawthorn fruits where they were more prone to detection and attack from braconids (73% of larvae feeding in hawthorns with heterospecific insects were parasitized compared to 34% of larvae infesting hawthorns without caterpillars and weevils). Data from other Rhagoletis and tephritid species suggest that escape from parasitoids may be a common theme in host range expansion and race formation for these flies.",,"FEDER, JL (corresponding author), UNIV NOTRE DAME,DEPT BIOL SCI,NOTRE DAME,IN 46556, USA.",,,,,,,31,139,141,0,51,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1995,76,3,,,,,801,813,,10.2307/1939346,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QU358,WOS:A1995QU35800011,,,,,2021-09-23,

Throughout their range, observations have been made of a dominance shift favouring D. r. bugensis where the two species co-occur. Although both dreissenids have been widely studied, the mechanisms driving this dominance shift are not completely understood. Our long-term and short-term field experiments assessed a selection of species traits related to growth and settlement, which may be linked to a competitive benefit for either of both species. We assessed relative population densities in time and space, mortality, and inter- and intraspecific interactions in relation to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, and light intensity, using 14 x 14 cm PVC settlement plates. Dreissenids were identified, counted and measured over 11 years in the waterbody where D. r. bugensis was first discovered in Western Europe. Dreissena polymorpha appeared to have a competitive benefit over D. r. bugensis by being able to settle earlier, i.e. in spring, while other studies indicate the opposite. As salinities in the study region were relatively high in spring, this discrepancy may be explained by a higher salinity tolerance of D. polymorpha, as is known from the literature. In addition, Common Coots predated D. r. bugensis clusters. Dreissena polymorpha were not usually found in such clusters. Regardless of these competitive benefits for D. polymorpha, D. r. bugensis is the dominant species in the region. One possible explanation could be the fact that D. r. bugensis was found in similar densities on both light exposed and shaded fouling plates. Dreissena polymorpha on the other hand, was practically absent on light-exposed plates after 12 months. Therefore, a wider range of habitats seems to be suitable for the settlement of D. r. bugensis. Another driver of the dominance shift can be linked to it having faster growth than D. polymorpha, especially during spring. More generally, D. r. bugensis occurred in higher population densities on plates with D. polymorpha than on plates with only D. r. bugensis. Dreissena polymorpha individuals may thus induce the settlement of additional individuals of D. r. bugensis. A final reason for the dominance of D. r. bugensis concerns its low winter mortality. While the number of D. polymorpha individuals more than halved over the winter 2016-2017, no significant decrease in numbers of D. r. bugensis was recorded.","[D'Hont, Anouk; Gittenberger, Adriaan] GiMaRIS Marine Res Inventory & Strategy Solut, Rijksstr Weg 75, NL-2171 AK Sassenheim, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Nat Biodivers Ctr, Dept Marine Zool, Pesthuislaan 7, NL-2333 BA Leiden, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Leiden Univ, Ctr Environm Studies CML, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol Leiden, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Hendriks, A.

Squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus, and C. apella form ubiquitous interspecific associations, but the reason remains debatable. With a large biogeographic field study, we tested the degree to which the distribution and abundance of Cebus and S. sciureus is determined by habitat type, fruit availability, and geography (i.e., determinants of the fundamental niche) relative to interspecific interactions, such as competition and facilitation (i.e., the realized niche). We used the competition between the two capuchin monkeys as a natural experiment that subjected S. sciureus to C. apella and C. olivaceus treatments'. Using spatial regression models and principal components analysis, we found that S. sciureus was associated with seasonally flooded forests, and was correlated with fruit abundance and diversity (fundamental niche), but was also correlated with C. apella density even when accounting for habitat and fruit availability (realized niche). Saimiri sciureus density was unrelated to C. olivaceus density. Cebus apella was associated with a variety of forest types, but particularly included disturbed and edge habitats such as logged forests, seasonally flooded forests, and upland savanna, in addition to mature forest. Cebus apella was also positively correlated with S. sciureus density and negatively correlated with the density of C. olivaceus. In contrast, C. olivaceus avoided riparian areas and was associated with mixed-height forests on sloped mountainous terrain. In sum, interspecific interactions such as competition between species of Cebus and facilitation between C. apella and S. sciureus were as important as habitat and fruit availability in determining the distribution and abundance of these primates.","[Levi, Taal] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Levi, Taal] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Silvius, Kirsten M.] Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Oliveira, Luiz F.

Host-parasite interactions are shaped by the broader web of community interactions, from interspecific competition to predator-prey dynamics. Heterospecific scavengers might also affect parasite transmission from infectious carcasses, which can be an important source of infections for some wildlife diseases. 2. A robust scavenger community can quickly remove carcasses and tissue and thus prevent secondary transmission by necrophagy or contact with infectious carcasses. Alternatively, by spreading infectious particles and tissues throughout the environment, scavengers may increase rates of casual contact with pathogens and thus overall transmission. However, there has been little empirical consideration of the contrasting roles that scavengers might play in infectious disease dynamics. 3. We carried out a series of studies to determine the efficiency with which scavenging invertebrates remove carcasses of Long-toed Salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) larvae and their role in the transmission of frog virus 3 (Genus: Ranavirus, Family: Iridoviridae) from carcasses. We then estimated the functional response of one efficient invertebrate scavenger (Family: Dytiscidae) to increasing carcass densities in field conditions in order to determine the capacity of scavenging invertebrates to consume large amounts of carcass tissue, as may be present at high prevalence sites. 4. We found that removal of infectious carcasses by scavengers strongly reduced transmission to naive larvae. Scavengers were as effective at reducing transmission from a carcass as a physical barrier preventing contact with the carcass. There was little evidence that scavenging released sufficient infectious tissues into the water column to rival direct contact as a route of infection. Moreover, while scavenging rates saturated at increasing carcass densities, consistent with a type II functional response, there were sufficient densities of dytiscid larvae, not to mention other scavenging invertebrates, in a surveyed pond to theoretically prevent transmission from carcasses. 5. Our results suggest that at least in systems in which conspecific necrophagy is common, the scavenger community can play an important role in reducing transmission.","[Le Sage, Mitchell J.; Towey, Bailey D.; Brunner, Jesse L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Le Sage, MJ (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",mitchell.lesage@vumc.org,"Brunner, Jesse L./B-1692-2013","Brunner, Jesse L./0000-0003-4894-8274",Washington State University School of Biological Sciences Carl H.

The community consisted of 17 hoverfly species feeding on 20 aphid species occurring on 14 species of dominant herbaceous plants. In terms of larval prey preference, the dominant eight species of hoverfly were categorized into three groups: a polyphagous 'generalist' group consisting of four species, Episyrphus balteatus, Betasyrphus serarius, Syrphus vitripennis and Sphaerophoria sp.; an oligophagous 'specialist' group consisting of three species, Metasyrphus hakiensis, Dideoides latus and Paragus hemorrhous and Leucopis puncticornis, which showed a preference for two aphid species on the plant Torilis scabra. The prey aphids of the second group have behavioral or morphological defense mechanisms that are effective for preventing attacks by generalist hoverflies; two prey aphids are aggressive toward generalist predators and the others are protected by ant-attendance. The specialist hoverflies seem to be adapted to overcome these defense mechanisms. The prey ranges overlapped little between the generalist and the specialist groups, while those within the generalist group overlapped greatly.","Nagoya Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Lab Appl Entomol, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 46401, Japan","Itioka, T (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Lab Appl Entomol, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 46401, Japan.",,,,,,,33,21,22,0,24,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

A wide range of models is already available for this type of analysis, and the field is still under active development. One of the most needed development concerns models that better account for the effect of within-and between-clade interspecific interactions on trait evolution, which can result from processes as diverse as competition, predation, parasitism, or mutualism. Here, we begin by developing a very general comparative phylogenetic framework for (multi)-trait evolution that can be applied to both ultrametric and nonultrametric trees. This framework not only encapsulates many previous models of continuous univariate and multivariate phenotypic evolution, but also paves the way for the consideration of a much broader series of models in which lineages coevolve, meaning that trait changes in one lineage are influenced by the value of traits in other, interacting lineages. Next, we provide a standard way for deriving the probabilistic distribution of traits at tip branches under our framework. We show that a multivariate normal distribution remains the expected distribution for a broad class of models accounting for interspecific interactions. Our derivations allow us to fit various models efficiently, and in particular greatly reduce the computation time needed to fit the recently proposed phenotype matching model. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our framework by developing a toy model for mutualistic coevolution. Our framework should foster a new era in the study of coevolution from comparative data.","[Manceau, Marc] Museum Natl Hist Nat, F-75005 Paris, France; [Lambert, Amaury] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Lab Probabil & Modeles Aleatoires, F-75005 Paris, France; [Manceau, Marc; Lambert, Amaury] Coll France, CNRS UMR 7241, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Biol, F-75005 Paris, France; [Manceau, Marc; Morlon, Helene] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS UMR 8197, Inst Biol, F-75005 Paris, France","Manceau, M (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.",marc.manceau@ens.fr,,"Helene, MORLON/0000-0002-3195-7521",Ecole Normale Superieure; Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (College de France); ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission,"M.M. acknowledges his Ph.D. funding from the Ecole Normale Superieure; A.L. acknowledges funding from the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (College de France); H.M. acknowledges funding from ERC, [grant ERC-CoG PANDA].",,62,30,30,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1063-5157,1076-836X,,SYST BIOL,Syst.

Though intraguild competition and predation can limit the set of species that coexist, most carnivores have traits that decrease the impacts of interspecific competition on fitness, a pattern that promotes coexistence. An increasing human population and demand for natural resources (e.g. farming) has fragmented landscapes, reduced available prey, and elevated rates of conflict. These anthropogenic pressures tend to eliminate large carnivores first, which can have cascading effects on ecosystem function (e.g. mesopredator release). Anthropogenic pressures might also affect mesocarnivores directly, but this hypothesis has received little research attention to date. Here, we used camera surveys to describe spatial and temporal patterns of carnivore occupancy in a mixed-use landscape in Kenya. This landscape included a community conservation area and seasonally occupied human settlement and livestock grazing areas. We detected 21 carnivore species and examined occupancy patterns for the 12 most frequently detected. Differences among species in responses to environmental conditions supported a hypothesis of spatial niche partitioning. Differences in the temporal activity patterns of the apex predators and mesocarnivores supported a hypothesis of temporal niche partitioning. Human land use altered occupancy patterns in 10 of 12 species. Apex predator occupancies were lower in more anthropogenically disturbed areas, but mesocarnivore occupancies were not inversely related to apex predators, contrary to the mesopredator release hypothesis. Our results suggest that a diverse carnivore community persists in this mixed use landscape because of seasonal variation in human land use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In central Oklahoma, two species of predaceous, pit-building ant lion larvae (Myrmeleon immaculatus and M. crudelis) coexist in a narrow, high-density (> 50 animals/m2) zone at the base of sandstone cliffs, where they are sheltered from rain and afternoon sun. Although larval movement is frequent and abundance within the zone varies seasonally, ant lions are rarely found > 2 m from the cliff base. I used field experiments and observations to test four hypotheses that could explain the maintenance of the ant lion zone: (1) zonation because of habitat availability; (2) zonation because of food availability; (3) zonation because of increased surface temperatures in exposed microhabitats; (4) zonation because of increased soil moisture and disturbance in exposed microhabitats. Ant lions are probably not limited to the cliffbase by the presence of rocks or vegetation, because there was no correlation between ant lion density and available habitat. The availability of prey also does not appear to limit ant lion distribution: ant abundance in pitfall traps was significantly higher outside the ant lion zone than within. Outside the ant lion zone, soil surface temperatures reach lethal levels in the afternoon sun. However, third-instar larvae of M. immaculatus transplanted in dry, sifted soil suffered little mortality over a 4-d period. Larvae transplanted into exposed sites gained significantly more mass than larvae transplanted into the ant lion zone, probably because of differences in food availability. Small-scale manipulations within the ant lion zone revealed that ant lion numbers decreased significantly over a 5-d period in response to both moisture (misting) and disturbance (pit-filling). In a recolonization experiment, the recovery time of patches exposed to a single ''rainfall'' treatment was extremely long: defaunated ''rainfall'' patches did not achieve the pit densities of defaunated control patches until after 84 d. Rainfall limits ant lion distribution through an interaction with temperature. Transplant experiments on natural substrata revealed the nature of this interaction. Within the ant lion zone, the soil remains dry and ant lion larvae bury themselves more rapidly in the sun than in the shade. Outside the ant lion zone, rainfall leads to the formation of a persistent soil crust. Larvae are unable to penetrate this crust, and they succumb to high temperatures in the sun. Because both species of ant lions are restricted to a narrow spatial zone, the probability of interspecific and intraspecific interactions (including competition, predation, and cannibalism) is increased. Such interactions may affect the density of both species within the ant lion zone. The abundances of M. crudelis and M. immaculatus were negatively correlated in quadrats from the center of the ant lion zone. Across the ant lion zone, the relative abundance of the two species also differed significantly, although the differences were not consistent among sites. Because of overriding abiotic constraints, neither species can achieve an ideal free distribution with respect to food resources. High-density predator aggregations may also affect prey community structure. Arthropod abundance was low within the ant lion zone, perhaps because of direct predation by ant lions or predator avoidance behavior by prey. Although the ant lion zone is caused by the interaction of abiotic factors, high-density predator aggregations have important biotic consequences for the population dynamics of the predators and the spatial distribution of their prey.","UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA",,,,,,,,48,85,89,0,29,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,226,237,,10.2307/1939517,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500023,,,,,2021-09-23,

Hard clams emigrated more in the presence of G. gemma than in its absence in both laboratory and field experiments. The overall effect of reduced food was increased emigration. Presence of G. gemma in sand enhanced hard clam growth while not affecting survival, but in muddy sand growth and survival decreased. Hard clams grew best in muddy sand without gem clams. In further experiments hard clams grew faster in shallower sediments and slower with addition of G. gemma biodeposits. We conclude that undisturbed post-settlement M mercenaria grow more slowly than they are capable of because they spend part of the time buried, presumably to avoid surface predators. Clams that are kept near the sediment surface, either because of sedimentary properties or interaction with spatial competitors, grow considerably faster than undisturbed clams in sand. This interpretation implies a trade-off between opposing selective pressures such that clams partition time between the necessary risk of feeding and the safe but energetically unprofitable sub-surface refuge from predation.","SUNY, MARINE SCI RES CTR, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA; KOREA OCEAN RES & DEV INST, POLAR RES CTR, SEOUL 425600, SOUTH KOREA; OREGON STATE UNIV, OREGON SEA GRANT INST, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,,,,,38,15,15,0,2,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In the Salt River, in western Kentucky, U. S. A., pulmonates were fairly common in headwater streams, and were replaced in larger order tributaries by prosobranch snails. The literature suggests that pulmonates have tolerance and capacity adaptations to variation in physicochemical variables like temperature or dissolved oxygen. Only one of the two pulmonates tested in the laboratory, however, had quicker righting responses and rates of movement, important in recolonizing ephemeral habitats. A competition experiment in an artificial stream indicated that the large-river prosobranch, Lithasia obovata (Say, 1829), suffered less reduction in growth than the pulmonate Helisoma trivolvis (Say, 1817). Both the literature and experiments we have performed suggest that prosobranchs are less vulnerable to predators. We interpret these results to suggest pulmonates are more common in temporary headwater streams, or shallow littoral margins of lotic systems, because of greater physiological adaptation, while prosobranchs are more common in larger rivers (or in spring-fed rivers) because of greater competitive ability, lower risk of predation, or less-variable physicochemical regimes.","Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Brown, KM (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",,,,,,,71,42,44,0,22,AMER MALACOLOGICAL UNION,WILMINGTON,"DELAWARE MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, BOX 3937, WILMINGTON, DE 19807-0937 USA",0740-2783,,,AM MALACOL BULL,Am.

This has led to significant challenges in teasing apart the various mechanisms thought to underpin multispecies groups. One potentially useful approach for gaining an understanding of this process is to identify the rules that best predict the observed distribution of individuals across these groups. In order to gain an insight into the decision-making process that might generate patterns of heterospecific associations, we collected data on the number and distribution of nests in breeding colonies that contained 3 species of weaverbird. We found no evidence of segregation by species, either within or between colonies. Using agent-based simulations of males applying different rules of attraction and repulsion to conspecifics or heterospecifics, we found that the best-fitting rule contained no heterospecific attraction. In this rule, individuals picked colonies based on an optimal distribution of conspecific nests. Given that nests are an important sexual signal in weavers, our findings suggest that this rule is biologically relevant: Males are seeking an optimal trade-off between attracting females via lekking and competing for mates if too many conspecific nests are present.","[Farine, Damien R.; Downing, Philip A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Downing, Charles P.] Uganda Virus Res Inst, Entebbe, Uganda","Downing, PA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",philip.downing@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Farine, Damien R./Y-2454-2019; Downing, Philip/AAZ-7086-2020","Farine, Damien R./0000-0003-2208-7613; Downing, Philip/0000-0002-5286-3153",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [AdG 250164]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [1222007] Funding Source: researchfish,D.R.F. was funded by an European Research Council grant (AdG 250164) awarded to Prof. Ben C.

Both juveniles and adults of these two species are closely associated in low elevation headwater streams in western Virginia. I explored the effects of competition between juveniles of the two species, and the effects of heterospecific adults on juvenile performance, in a controlled, replicated experiment in artificial streams. Effects of competition were determined for three measures of juvenile performance that can be potentially related to reproductive output, and hence, to population dynamics: survival, growth and relative condition. Juveniles of C. bairdi and E. flabellare competed at densities well within the range observed in their natal streams. Adult E. flabellare had a positive effect on the survival of juvenile C. bairdi, the origin of which is unknown. Adult C. bairdi had no effect on juvenile E. flabellare. The most interesting result was that competition between juveniles of the two species was characterized by a qualitative asymmetry; C. bairdi responded with a reduction in growth, both in total length and mass, while E. flabellare responded with a decrease in relative condition, but no decrease in growth. These differences in response were clearly reflected in mass/length regressions. Unless responding variables can be precisely translated into quantitative effects on population dynamics, such qualitative asymmetries in competitive interactions greatly complicate the determination of competitive symmetry and the possible prediction of competitive outcomes, especially in species where r is difficult to determine directly.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27708",,,,,,,,72,18,19,0,14,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,1997,78,3,,,,,429,439,,10.2307/3545605,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WU941,WOS:A1997WU94100003,,,,,2021-09-23,

In this paper, we describe responses of benthic, trout stream communities to replicated, whole-ecosystem perturbations resulting from pathogen-induced reductions in populations of a dominant grazer the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior. Previous small-scale experiments suggested that Glossosoma had strong competitive effects on other grazers (through exploitation) and small-bodied filter-feeders (through interference). Glossosoma populations collapsed in a number of Michigan trout streams since the late 1980s and have been maintained at low levels by recurrent pathogen outbreaks. Here we address the effects on periphyton, grazers, and filter-feeders of parasite-induced Glossosoma reductions in six streams for which considerable pre-and post-collapse data are available, and we compare the results of this large-scale perturbation to responses predicted from a small-scale experiment that had been previously conducted in one of these streams. Periphyton and most grazers and filter-feeders showed marked increases in abundance following reduction in Glossosoma populations. Several grazers that were rare or absent prior to Glossosoma collapse have established sizable populations, suggesting that they had been excluded by competition with Glossosoma. The small-scale experiment successfully predicted the direction of response of most taxa to whole-stream reductions in Glossosoma abundance, but it tended to underestimate the extent and magnitude of Glossosoma's effects in the community. In these systems, observations at larger spatial and temporal scales have been essential to developing a clearer understanding of the mechanisms structuring communities.","UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH NAT RESOURCES & ENVIRONM, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA","Kohler, SL (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA.",,"Wiley, Michael/A-6853-2012",,,,,62,111,113,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1997,78,7,,,,,2164,2176,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2164:PORLSE]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XZ789,WOS:A1997XZ78900020,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-23,

On intertidal mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, mechanisms underlying the negative correlation between the densities of two dominant macro-invertebrates, the mud snail Ilyanassa obsolete and the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator, are unclear. We investigated the effect of mud snail density on survival, growth and fecundity of C volutator in 2-wk experiments in the laboratory and field, and observed behavioral interactions between the two species. Snails negatively affected juvenile and adult survival of amphipods, juvenile growth, and proportion of females. that were ovigerous. Behavioral observations revealed that snails are active predators of C. volutator, both juveniles and adults. We documented several attack methods by snails. As well, we observed that C volutator could become entangled in laid mucus trails of snails, leaving them vulnerable to attack from snail trail-followers or other predators. Snail predation, in combination with increased C. volutator migration in the presence of snails, appears to be a primary short-term mechanism for the observed negative correlation between these invertebrate species. Competition (likely through interference), resulting in lowered growth and fecundity, may be a longer-term mechanism for this negative correlation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Salmonid species are typical examples of native invaders whose abundance is increased after stocking with hatchery fish. This study evaluated the effects of hatchery chum salmon fry on sympatric wild masu salmon fry, benthic invertebrate prey, and algae, after a single stocking event in Mamachi stream, Hokkaido, northern Japan. The results suggested that the stocked hatchery chum salmon fry decreased the foraging efficiency and growth of the wild masu salmon fry through interspecific competition, and depressed the abundance of Ephemerellidae and total grazer invertebrates (Glossosomatidae, Heptageniidae, and Baetidae) through predation. Also, the hatchery chum salmon fry may increase algal biomass through depression of grazer abundance by predation (top-down effect). These results suggested that a single release of hatchery chum salmon fry into a stream may influence the recipient stream ecosystem.","[Hasegawa, Koh; Takahashi, Satoru] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan; [Ohta, Tamihisa] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038047, Japan","Hasegawa, K (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan.",hasekoh@affrc.go.jp,"Hasegawa, Koh/H-9926-2019",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP16K07857]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K07857] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank the staff of the Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute for helping with the field work, and Dr Yoshikazu Takashima for sorting and identifying benthic invertebrates.

Few studies have assessed the importance of biological interactions in structuring these communities. In the present study, benthic diatom community structure in relation to manipulated food webs was assessed using in situ mesocosms, whereby predator-free environments and environments comprising two different fish species were assessed. Zooplankton abundance, settled algal biomass and the diatom community were monitored over a 12-day period across each of the three trophic scenarios. Differences among treatments over time were observed in zooplankton abundances, particularly copepods. Similarly, the benthic diatom community structure changed significantly over time across the three trophic treatments. However, no differences in total algal biomass were found among treatments. This was likely the result of non-diatom phytoplankton contributions. We propose that the benthic diatom community structure within the mesocosms was influenced by trophic cascades and potentially through direct consumption by the fish. The study highlights that not only are organisms at the base of the food web affected by predators at the top of the food web, but that predator identity is potentially an important consideration for predator-prey interaction outcomes with consequences for multiple trophic levels.","[Wasserman, R.

Ponto-Caspian gobies are a good example of a territorial species, which can have negative impact on native species with similar biology due to competitive interactions. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential impact of the invasive Ponto-Caspian western tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris on the native stone loach Barbatula barbatula through shelter competition. We used male and female gobies in their reproductive season to test whether they would be more aggressive towards native stone loach, accounting for different light conditions in a limited shelter competition scenario. The results of our study showed that both tested species occupied the shelter mostly during the daylight. Only male goby reduced the shelter occupancy of stone loach despite the fact that interspecific aggressive acts were very rare. It was associated with the nest guarding by male gobies, considering that the study was conducted during their reproductive season. Based on our results, it is possible that, under natural conditions, male tubenose goby would force stone loach to stay away from the shelter, especially in late spring and early summer, when gobies are in reproductive state. This might affect stone loach populations by devoiding them of optimum sites and increasing their exposure to predators.","[Blonska, Dagmara; Grabowska, Joanna] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Ul Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland","Grabowska, J (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Ul Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",joko@biol.uni.lodz.pl,"Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Grabowska, Joanna/K-8305-2013","Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Grabowska, Joanna/0000-0001-9924-0650; Blonska, Dagmara/0000-0002-2200-3347","University of Lodz [5811/E-345/M/2015, 5811/E-345/M/2016]","The study was supported by an internal grant from the University of Lodz (5811/E-345/M/2015, 5811/E-345/M/2016).

In this study, we analysed the alarm call system of lesser spot-nosed monkeys, a primate that spends most of its time in mixed-species groups while occupying the lowest and presumably most dangerous part of the forest canopy. In contrast to other primate species, we found no evidence for predator-specific alarm calls. Instead, males gave one general alarm call type ('kroo') to three main dangers (i.e., crowned eagles, leopards and falling trees) and a second call type ('tcha-kow') as a coordinated response to calls produced in non-predatory contexts ('boom') by associated male Campbell's monkeys. Production of 'kroo' calls was also strongly affected by the alarm calling behaviour of male Campbell's monkeys, suggesting that male lesser spot-nosed monkeys adjust their alarm call production to another species' vocal behaviour. We discuss different hypotheses for this unusual phenomenon and propose that high predation pressure can lead to reliance on other species vocal behaviour to minimise predation. Significance statement Predation can lead to the evolution of acoustically distinct, predator-specific alarm calls. However, there are occasional reports of species lacking such abilities, despite diverse predation pressure, suggesting that evolutionary mechanisms are more complex. We conducted field experiments to systematically describe the alarm calling behaviour of lesser spot-nosed monkeys, an arboreal primate living in the lower forest strata where pressure from different predators is high. We found evidence for two acoustically distinct calls but, contrary to other primates in the same habitat, no evidence for predator-specific alarms. Instead, callers produced one alarm call type ('kroo') to all predator classes and another call type ('tcha-kow') to non-predatory dangers, but only as a response to a specific vocalisation of Campbell's monkeys ('boom'). The production of both calls was affected by the calling behaviour of Campbell's monkeys, suggesting that lesser spot-nosed monkey vocal behaviour is dependent on the antipredator behaviour of other species. Our study advances the theory of interspecies interactions and evolution of alarm calls.","[Le Floch, Auriane; Bouchard, Alice; Gallot, Quentin; Zuberbuhler, Klaus] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Zuberbuhler, Klaus] Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol & Neurosci, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland","Le Floch, A (corresponding author), Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Neuchatel, Switzerland.",aurianelefloch@me.com,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X","Universite de Neuchatel; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [310030_185324, 31003A_166458]; Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Cote d'Ivoire; University of Neuchatel; `NCCR Evolving Language', Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [51NF40_180888]","Open Access funding provided by Universite de Neuchatel.

We measured biotic interaction strengths between an invasive and a native endemic snail species in 2 streams in the western United States. The invasive freshwater New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, was the dominant snail in a 3(rd)-order order stream, and a closely related endemic snail, Pyrgulopsis robusta, was the dominant snail in a 1(st)-order tributary stream. We compared consumer-resource (C-R) and consumer-consumer (C-C) per biomass interaction strengths in both streams using field enclosure experiments. Consumer effects on algal resources were strong and equivalent for both snail species in both streams. Invasion success of P. antipodarum could not be attributed to an unusually high rate of resource acquisition at either site because the 2 snails exerted equivalent C-R interaction strengths. However, C-C interactions were asymmetric; the invasive snail significantly limited growth of the native snail, whereas the native snail facilitated growth of the invasive snail. These effects were stronger in the stream where P. antipodarum was dominant. Thus, per biomass interaction strengths indicated that asymmetric interactions could be contributing to patterns of dominance by invasive and endemic stream snails.","[Riley, Leslie A.; Dybdahl, Mark F.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99163 USA; [Hall, Robert O., Jr.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Riley, LA (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99163 USA.",leslie_riley@wsu.edu; dybdahl@wsu.edu; bhall@uwyo.edu,"Dybdahl, Mark/B-8649-2012",,"University of Wyoming/National Park Service Research Station; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 9907373, 0296049]","We thank B.

Bark beetles Dendroctonus brevicomis and D. frontalis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are known to have common pheromone components, except for exo-brevicomin, which is produced by D. brevicomis. We predicted that D. frontalis would not respond to exo-brevicomin outside of the zone of sympatry with D. brevicomis. We conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of exo-brevicomin on attraction of D. frontalis and associated species in Mississippi. We determined whether D. frontalis pheromone production differed inside and outside the sympatric zone and compared the pheromone profiles with D. brevicomis within the sympatric zone. Trapping studies revealed that D. frontalis can perceive and respond positively to exo-brevicomin, an aggregation pheromone of a sympatric congener (D. brevicomis), at locations hundreds of kilometers outside the sympatric zone. Qualitative pheromone profiles showed that both species emit similar pheromone components: frontalin, endo-brevicomin, exo-brevicomin, trans-verbenol, verbenone, and myrtenol. Although not previously reported, D. frontalis males from Arizona produced exo-brevicomin. The predator Thanasimus dubius did not discriminate traps baited with exo-brevicomin and was most attracted to traps with frontalin. Hylastes beetles were significantly attracted to traps baited with exo-brevicomin in combination with other compounds. Our results raise new practical and evolutionary questions on the role of exo-brevicomin in the behavioral ecology of D.frontalis. The addition of exo-brevicomin to the current lure might increase the efficiency of trapping programs in the southeastern United States.","[Hofstetter, Richard W.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Pureswaran, Deepa S.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Sullivan, Brian T.] USDA, US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Pineville, LA 71360 USA","Hofstetter, RW (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Box 15018, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",rich.hofstetter@nau.edu,"Pureswaran, Deepa/G-8074-2019",,,,,69,19,20,1,5,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"10001 DEREKWOOD LANE, STE 100, LANHAM, MD 20706-4876 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

It has been suggested that this phenomenon is caused by common environmental perturbations, mobile predators or dispersal movements. However, very little focus has been given to how the physical properties of the geographic area over which synchrony occurs, such as landscape composition and climate, affect spatial population dynamics. This study reports on the spatial and temporal properties of vole population fluctuations in two areas of western Finland: one composed of large interconnected areas of agricultural farmland interspersed by forests and the other highly dominated by forest areas, containing more isolated patches of agricultural land. Furthermore, the more agricultural area exhibits somewhat milder winters with less snow than the forested area. We found the amplitude of vole cycles to be essentially the same in the two areas, suggesting that the relative amount of predation on small rodents by generalist versus specialist predators is similar in both areas. No seasonal differences in the timing of synchronization were observable for Microtus voles, whereas bank vole populations in field habitats appeared to become synchronized primarily during winter. Microtus populations in field habitats exhibited smaller spatial variation and a higher degree of synchrony in the more continuous agricultural landscape than in the forest-dominated landscape. We suggest that this inter-areal difference is due to differences in the degree of interpatch connectivity, with predators and dispersal acting as the primary synchronizing agents. Bank vole populations in field habitats were more synchronized within the forest-dominated landscape, most likely reflecting the suitability of the inter-patch matrix and the possibility of dispersal. Our study clearly indicates that landscape composition needs to be taken into account when describing the spatial properties of small rodent population dynamics.","Turku Univ, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland","Huitu, O (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland.",ohuitu@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,93,56,59,0,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2003,135,2,,,,,209,220,,10.1007/s00442-002-1171-6,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,676LQ,WOS:000182753900006,12698342,,,,2021-09-23,

Testing multiple hypotheses about sleeping site selection permits examination of the relative strength of distinct ecological factors and expands our ability to understand how selection pressures influence primate sleeping behavior. Here we examine how avoidance of biting insects, thermoregulation, foraging efficiency, tree stability, and interspecific competition influence selection of sleeping sites by proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) in Indonesian Borneo. We collected data on relative insect abundance, temperature, rainfall, food availability, group size, sleeping site location, and presence of other primates for 12 mo. Using formal model comparison and information criteria, we analyzed the relative importance of these ecological factors in determining one aspect of sleeping site location: distance from the river. Our models supported the avoidance of biting insects and the foraging efficiency hypotheses. Proboscis monkeys slept further inland on nights when the abundance of sandflies was high along the river, and when less food was available along the river. Many studies suggest that primates select sleeping trees and locations to reduce predation risk; our study indicates that additional factors may also be important in determining sleeping site selection.","[Feilen, Katie L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Feilen, Katie L.] Disneys Anim Programs, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Program Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Feilen, KL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Feilen, KL (corresponding author), Disneys Anim Programs, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830 USA.",katie.l.feilen@disney.com,,,"U.S. Fulbright Student Fellowship; Boren Fellowship; University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System; Davis Department of Anthropology; Primate Conservation, Inc.","We thank the Indonesian government, the State Ministry of Research and Technology (RISTEK), and the mayor of Sungai Tolak for giving us permission to conduct this research.

We tested for the importance of priority effects on the interactions between immatures of the mosquito, Culiseta longiareolata, and immatures of the green toad, Bufo viridis, the two most abundant species of many temporary pools of the Negev Desert, Israel. Previously, we reported that when these two taxonomically distant species were placed together as early stage larvae, they competed strongly and when Culiseta larvae had the size advantage, they preyed on Bufo hatchlings. Here, we tested the interaction between these two species in artificial pools when Bufo enters first and develops prior to Culiseta entering. 2. We also tested for intra-specific competition and for the impact of both mosquito larva and tadpole on invading species. 3. We assessed these interactions by experimentally manipulating various combinations and densities of Bufo and Culiseta. We introduced early stage Bufo larvae 12 days prior to introducing first instar Culiseta larvae. 4. Bufo exhibited a strong intraspecific density-dependent effect: tadpoles were smaller and reached metamorphosis later at the higher density. We did not demonstrate an intraspecific density-dependent effect in Culiseta. 5. Culiseta larvae affected neither survival nor development rates of the larger Bufo. Early stage Culiseta larvae were vulnerable to predation by the larger Bufo but later instar Culiseta larval were no longer vulnerable. Bufo reduced larval development rate of Culiseta but did not affect pupal size. 6. Bufo tadpoles virtually eliminated, and Culiseta larvae strongly reduced, the number of individuals of an invading ceratopogonid midge species reaching the pupal stage. 7. The work here, combined with our previous work, demonstrates the importance of priority effects with respect to the outcome of competition and intraguild predation.","UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,LAB COMMUNITY ECOL,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,DEPT BIOL,LAB BIOL CONTROL,POB 653,IL-84105 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,48,96,99,1,58,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

There is no theoretical limit to the number of levels in a facilitation cascade, yet the existence of more than two has rarely been examined. We manipulated biogenic substrate produced by a primary facilitator (cockle shells) and a secondary facilitator (barnacles and their empty tests) in a space-limited subtidal community to test the hypothesis that solitary ascidians would be the third-level facilitator. In the field, most ascidians were found on barnacles, and most barnacles occupied cockle shells. To produce this pattern, barnacles could nurse ascidians (a longer 'facilitation chain') or outcompete them from cockle shells (a shorter chain). Experimental results clearly supported the nursing hypothesis providing evidence for a facilitation cascade with three hierarchical levels of foundation species. Our findings confirm that like predation and competition, positive interspecific interactions nest into multi-tier hierarchies with numerous levels. While the number of foundation species should increase community stability and resilience as it increases diversity and reduces environmental stress, facilitation chain length may have the opposite effect.","[Yakovis, Eugeniy; Artemieva, Anna] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia","Yakovis, E (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",eugene@yakovis.com,"Artemieva, Anna/AAD-9578-2019; Yakovis, Evgeny/M-8540-2019","Yakovis, Evgeny/0000-0003-3489-3671; Artemieva, Anna/0000-0002-1935-7021","Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [02-04-50020, 05-04-48927, 05-04-63041, 06-04-63077, 07-04-10075, 08-04-01373, 08-04-10109, 09-04-10092, 10-04-10094, 11-04-01248, 11-04-10031, 12-04-10059, 13-04-10178, 14-04-00972, 14-04-10124, 17-04-00651]","We thank Michael Fokin, Michael Smirnov, Vladimir Krapivin,.arina Varfolomeeva, Dmitry Grebelniy, Sergey Grebelniy, Vladislav Dzhurinskiy, Anna Kuritsina, Alexey Filinovitch, Nastasia Arkhipova, Anastasia Koval, Michael Yakovis, Natalia Shunatova and Alexey Grishankov for their assistance in the field.

Because there have been limited studies to determine how snakes regulate prey populations, and because Kingsnake declines may result in ecosystem impacts, we evaluated the hypothesis that Kingsnakes regulate the abundance of one of their prey, the venomous Copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix). We generated a database of captures of the two species across the southeastern United States and, while controlling for large-scale habitat preferences, identified a negative relationship between the relative abundance of Kingsnakes and the relative abundance of Copperheads. Our results are correlative but consistent with the hypothesis that Copperhead populations experience a release from predation pressure where Kingsnake abundances are low. We suggest that Kingsnake declines, which are occurring for unknown reasons, are having ecological effects in affected ecosystems. We further highlight the potential role that snakes play in influencing the population dynamics of their prey.","[Steen, David A.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [McClure, Christopher J.

Additional treatments included altering food concentration and reversing an initial size advantage of one of the species. There was no evidence of intraspecific interference competition in either species. There were strong asymmetric interspecific effects; the leopard frog depressed growth of the wood frog in mixed-species treatments whereas the wood frog had no negative effects on the leopard frog. These interspecific effects appear to be largely due to exploitative competition. Reversing initial size advantages of the species did not affect the qualitative outcome of competition, though the effect of the leopard frog on the wood frog was diminished when wood frogs were initially 30% larger. The leopard frog was consistently more active than the wood frog; I argue that this difference in activity contributes to the competitive superiority of the leopard frog in these experiments.

The model consists of community matrices with density-dependent species interactions and a limit on the total population of each species. A general natural pattern forms the basis of the model: organisms which are most similar compete, those which are less similar may enter into a predator-prey relationship, and those which are most different may be mutualistic. In this model, contrary to some previously published studies, increasing the number of species increased stability of community matrices. The rate of change in phenotype was varied to assess the response of community characteristics. At the highest rate of random phenotypic change there were the most species; the minimum number of species was found at intermediate rates of change. The models were run in the absence of predation, competition, or mutualism. The absence of mutualism led to more extinction. The absence of competition caused communities to quickly reach a population ceiling.

Climate warming often leads to shifts in the strength and sign of agonistic interactions among species, which in turn may change their distribution ranges. Notwithstanding the ubiquity of this phenomenon, there is scant literature about how interspecific agonistic behaviour changes with altered thermal regime, especially for invasive species such as three widespread North American crayfishes in Europe (Orconectes limosus, Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus). 2. We conducted a laboratory study to analyse some descriptors of agonistic behaviour in fighting dyads of similarly sized males of the three species' combinations, both at 20 degrees C (the current maximum water temperature in the study area, central France) and 27 degrees C (the maximum expected in the next 80years under the more pessimistic IPCC greenhouse gas emission scenario). 3. The results showed significantly different responses to warming by the three crayfishes. At 27 degrees C, O. limosus spent more time motionless and P.leniusculus was more often the subordinate, independent of the opponent. On the contrary, the agonistic strategy of P.clarkii did not change with temperature: when engaged in fighting, this species outcompeted both O.limosus and P.leniusculus. 4. Caution should be taken when extrapolating laboratory studies to the field, but these results, combined with outputs of previous modelling exercises, suggest that European catchments will become dominated by P.clarkii with climate warming. Ultimately, this might lead to impoverished biodiversity, simplified food webs and altered ecosystem services.","[Gherardi, Francesca; Spigoli, Daniele; Aquiloni, Laura] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Biol, I-50125 Florence, Italy; [Souty-Grosset, Catherine] Univ Poitiers, Poitiers, France","Aquiloni, L (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dipartimento Biol, Via Romana 17, I-50125 Florence, Italy.",laura.aquiloni@unifi.it,,,Regional Council of Poitou-Charentes (France) within the Programme Regional de Bourses de Chercheur Invite' at the University of PoitiersRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine,This work was made possible by a grant to F.G. by the Regional Council of Poitou-Charentes (France) within the 'Programme Regional de Bourses de Chercheur Invite' at the University of Poitiers.

We measured the extent to which the diets of barn owls (Tyto alba) and long-eared owls (Asio otus) in Israel overlap and examined whether yearly differences in diet overlap correlate with barn owl breeding success. Pianka's index of niche overlap was positively related to barn owl population size but not to its breeding success. The number of breeding barn owls was higher when long-eared owls consumed more rodents, suggesting that diet overlap most likely increased when rodents became more abundant. Therefore, in Israel, when these two owl species prey more often on rodents, their diets are more similar and interspecific competition is reduced. Unlike sympatric populations in Europe, in years when rodents are less abundant in Israel long-eared owls switch to hunting alternative prey (e.g., birds), perhaps to avoid competition with barn owls.","[Charter, Motti] Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, IL-1290000 Katzrin, Israel; [Izhaki, Ido] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Roulin, Alexandre] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Charter, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, IL-1290000 Katzrin, Israel.",chartermotti@gmail.com,"Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019; Charter, Motti/AAQ-9529-2021","Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683; Charter, Motti/0000-0003-3861-6356",Israel Hoopoe Foundation; Society for the Protection of Nature Israel; Israel Ministry of Agriculture; Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection; Addax and Oryx Foundation; University of Haifa; Minerva Center for Movement Ecology; Israel Meteorological Center for weather data,"We thank Maria Novoslov, Yuval Cohen, Tomer Chen, Inbal Segev, Hadas Sela for pellet cleaning, Kobi Meyrom for field assistance and Simon Birrer and Andrew Wolfenden for comments on the paper.

We investigated the foraging strategy of a widely spread community consisting of Desert hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii), Midday gerbils (Meriones meridianus), Northern three-toed jerboas (Dipus sagitta) and Long-eared hedgehogs (Hemiechinus auritus) in the Alashan Desert, China. The aim was to analyse foraging as a result of biotic and abiotic factors in undisturbed habitats, i.e. we did not manipulate any surrounding conditions and all animals were free ranging. Three habitats were investigated, named after the dominant species: Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, Corispermum sp. and Zygophyllum pterocarpum. The following results can be summarised: (1) we found no or only slight differences for the GUD within the habitats between open and sheltered places; (2) lunar illumination affected foraging during waxing and waning moon phases within the first part of the night; (3) ambient temperature and the presence of moonlight resulted in changes in the interspecific competition that impacted the GUD; and (4) we determined prominent differences amongst habitats within the four moon phases, especially between the more covered habitats Ammopiptanthus and Zygophyllum, in contrast to the Corispermum habitat with its sparse coverage ratio. In general, foraging effort was elevated in the more covered habitats. We found a preferred foraging activity in warm and dark parts of the night which may lead to elevated inter-individual competition resulting in higher GUDs. Warmer periods were preferred in nights with constant light conditions, although resource competition was again elevated. We concluded that the foraging strategy was mainly affected by habitat, whereas moonlight and temperature modulate the resulting GUD in undisturbed environments. The availability of vegetal shelters influences foraging only in detail.","[Roschlau, C.] Univ Stuttgart, Dept Anim Physiol, Stuttgart, Germany; [Scheibler, E.] Univ South Wales, Sch Appl Sci, Treforest, Wales","Scheibler, E (corresponding author), Univ South Wales, Sch Appl Sci, Fac Comp Engn & Sci, Alfred Russel Wallace Bldg, Glyntaff Treforest CF37 4AT, Wales.",elke.scheibler@southwales.ac.uk,,,"Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Margarete-von-Wrangell programme; Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany","This work was supported by the Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg and the European Social Fund, by the Margarete-von-Wrangell programme.

While utilizing several natural enemies may enhance control, there is also the potential for disruptive interspecific interactions. Such interactions may be studied in the laboratory by focusing on the details of the interactions themselves and attempting to infer population level consequences from their sum, or by focusing more directly on the overall effects on natural enemy populations: we term these approaches 'reductionist' and 'holistic.' Here we conduct a holistic laboratory study on interactions between three species of parasitoid wasps that are parasitoids of the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae): Cephalonomia stephanoderis Betrem, C. hyalinipennis Ashmead and Prorops nasuta Waterston (all Hymenoptera: Bethylidae). We find evidence for both intra- and inter-specific resource competition. Interactions between C stephanoderis and P. nasuta, both indigenous to Africa, appear to be approximately symmetrical, while C hyalinipennis, naturally found in the coffee plantations of Chiapas, Mexico, may exert a disruptive influence. C hyalinipennis also has a low population growth rate. We now consider it to be a detrimental invader of the Mexican coffee agro-ecosystem that should not be encouraged by augmentative release or introduced into other regions. Overall, the most successful species, in terms of both emergence and female production, was P. nasuta. We compare these results with those from prior reductionist and holistic studies, and with observations on patterns of establishment of these bethylid species in the field. Given that it is increasingly clear that disruptive inter-specific interactions are generally common when multiple species are deployed in biological control, screening of potential agents should consider such interactions alongside the more 'traditional' focus on host specificity.

The degree of individual specialization in resource use differs widely among wild populations where individuals range from fully generalized to highly specialized. This interindividual variation has profound implications in many ecological and evolutionary processes. A recent review proposed four main ecological causes of individual specialization: interspecific and intraspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. 2. Using the isotopic signature of subsampled whiskers, we investigated to what degree three of these factors (interspecific and intraspecific competition and ecological opportunity) affect the population niche width and the level of individual foraging specialization in two fur seal species, the Antarctic and subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella and Arctocephalus tropicalis), over several years. 3. Population niche width was greater when the two seal species bred in allopatry (low interspecific competition) than in sympatry or when seals bred in high-density stabilized colonies (high intraspecific competition). In agreement with the niche variation hypothesis (NVH), higher population niche width was associated with higher interindividual niche variation. However, in contrast to the NVH, all Antarctic females increased their niche width during the interbreeding period when they had potential access to a wider diversity of foraging grounds and associated prey (high ecological opportunities), suggesting they all dispersed to a similar productive area. 4. The degree of individual specialization varied among populations and within the annual cycle. Highest levels of interindividual variation were found in a context of lower interspecific or higher intraspecific competition. Contrasted results were found concerning the effect of ecological opportunity. Depending on seal species, females exhibited either a greater or lower degree of individual specialization during the interbreeding period, reflecting species-specific biological constraints during that period. 5. These results suggest a significant impact of ecological interactions on the population niche width and degree of individual specialization. Such variation at the individual level may be an important factor in the species plasticity with significant consequences on how it may respond to environmental variability.","[Kernaleguen, Laetitia; Arnould, John P.

However, it is relatively unknown how potential competitive interactions could be taking place. In many freshwater turtles, semiochemicals from different glands might facilitate species and sex recognition. We hypothesized that chemosensory detection of competitor species might affect space use and habitat selection by freshwater turtles. We analyzed whether T. scripta and M. leprosa turtles recognized chemical cues from male and female conspecifics and heterospecifics in water. We compared time spent by turtles in clean water pools vs. water pools containing the different chemical stimuli. Introduced T. scripta did not avoid nor prefer water pools with chemical stimuli of native M. leprosa terrapins, which might favor the expansion of the invasive species. In contrast, M. leprosa preferred water with chemical stimuli of conspecifics and avoided water with chemical cues of T. scripta, which suggests that chemical cues could be used by native M. leprosa to avoid water pools occupied by introduced T. scripta. We suggest that this avoidance behavior of native M. leprosa may be one of the causes that contribute to the observed displacement of their populations by invasive T. scripta.","[Polo-Cavia, Nuria; Lopez, Pilar; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Martin, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",Jose.Martin@mncn.csic.es,"Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014; , Nuria/L-5372-2014; Lopez, Pilar/K-6221-2014","Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; Lopez, Pilar/0000-0001-6577-1509",Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2005-00391/BOS]; El Ventorrillo'' C.S.I.C.,"We thank an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments, the Grupo de Rehabilitacion de la Fauna Autoctona y su Habitat'' ( GREFA) for providing sliders, and El Ventorrillo'' MNCN Field Station for use of their facilities.

Existing theory suggests that high resource competition can lead to mutualism. However, this is based on an analysis that need only apply near equilibrium, and experimental demonstrations of such mutualism are rare. Two alternative approaches to measuring food web mutualism are examined here. These are based on the population level effects of adding or removing a consumer species or on the amount of additional mortality that can be applied to one consumer without excluding it. Both measures suggest that mutualism is likely to be confined to two situations: when overlap in resource use by the consumers is very low and when the consumers are inefficient users of their resources. Competition between resources is also likely to increase the occurrence and magnitude of hypercompetition between consumers, where the reduction in population size caused by the introduced consumer is greater than that caused by a consumer that is identical to the resident species. Competition between resources can also increase the negative interaction between consumers by destabilizing the dynamics of the system. Such destabilization can cause negative indirect interactions between specialist consumers having no overlap in resource use.","Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; Natl Inst Environm Studies, Res Ctr Environm Risk, Ecol Risk Res Sect, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Zool Bldg,25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",abrams@zoo.utoronto.ca; mifuyun@hawaii.edu,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008; Nakajima, Mifuyu/N-5337-2015","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X; Nakajima, Mifuyu/0000-0001-7778-2029",,,,54,19,20,0,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

The introduced North American crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is currently replacing the native crayfish Astacus astacus in a Swedish lake. Using field data from co-occurring populations on life-history traits and population size structure of the two species, this study evaluated possible mechanisms behind the replacement. 2. Pacifastacus showed a higher capacity for population increase; the species had a higher individual growth rate, reached sexual maturity at a smaller size and lower age, and had a higher per capita egg production than Astacus. 3. A higher frequency of non-lethal injuries in Astacus suggested the predominance of Pacifastacus in interference interactions. These results support a competitive exclusion hypothesis. 4. A dramatic change in relative abundance of the two species in recent years was the result of an almost complete cessation in recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) in Astacus. Poor recruitment in Astacus was probably caused by the combined effects of interspecific competition and predation, resulting in increased mortality among YOY Astacus, and by reproductive interference, suppressing the less common species. 5. The results support the hypothesis that the observed replacement of Astacus by Pacifastacus is governed by a combination of several interacting mechanisms, of which (sic)","UPPSALA UNIV,INST LIMNOL,S-75236 UPPSALA,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,66,100,104,1,37,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

In various studies, sympatric lady beetles differ in habitat-use at the scales of landscapes, single agricultural fields, and single plants. Species also differ in their seasonal and diel activity-patterns. These spatiotemporal differences in habitat-use should lead to complementary impacts on prey, by encouraging different predator species to attack different subsets of the prey population. This in turn should lead to stronger biological control at higher predator diversity levels. Indeed, experimental manipulations of predator species richness in communities that include coccinellids have generally revealed stronger prey suppression with greater predator biodiversity. In these experimental studies, lady beetles sometimes filled unique niches as particularly voracious predators, and often also complemented or facilitated prey capture by other species. Intraguild predation was rarely found to be a strongly disruptive force, perhaps because spatiotemporal niche differences reduced encounters among species. In summary, coccinellid species both respond to and affect their communities in unique ways, generally to the benefit of herbivore suppression. Thus, the best niche fit for coccinellids may be that of a complement to other species, contributing to improved biological control with greater predator biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

During the growing season of 1990, plots with average densities of 10-11 grasshoppers per m(2) were treated with carbaryl bran bait (carbaryl plots) or bran bait without carbaryl (control plots). The grasshoppers fed particularly heavily on alfalfa, driving the percent cover of this species to essentially zero by mid-August. Application of carbaryl significantly reduced the densities of three of the four major grasshopper species present (Oedaleonotus enigma, Melanoplus sanguinipes, and M. packardii),and slowed the rate with which these insects consumed the standing crop of alfalfa. In contrast, densities of the fourth major grasshopper species present, M. bivittatus, were not reduced by application of carbaryl but instead were greatly elevated. This population response may have arisen in large part as adults of M. bivittatus aggregated in carbaryl plots in response to the reduced rate of defoliation of alfalfa by other species. Greater numbers of M. bivittatus nymphs also occurred in 1991 in plots treated with versus without carbaryl in 1990 (no carbaryl was applied in 1991), as did greater numbers of O. enigma nymphs (despite there having been fewer adult females present in these plots the previous year). But the densities of grasshoppers of all species were low in all plots in 1991 (approximately 1 per m(2) by mid-summer), and no differences in percent cover of alfalfa or other Vegetation were detected in plots treated the previous year with versus without carbaryl. The striking positive response of M. bivittatus to application of carbaryl bran (and associated reductions in population sizes of competing grasshopper species) strongly suggests that intense interspecific interactions occurred at the study site in 1990.",,"EVANS, EW (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,33,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1995,73,1,,,,,73,78,,10.2307/3545727,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RH161,WOS:A1995RH16100010,,,,,2021-09-23,

Most of the analysis is based on a consumer-resource model introduced by Robert MacArthur. Contrary to many statements in the literature and in textbooks, measures of competition may decrease as similarity increases and may be greatest when similarity of the two species' sets of resource capture rates is very low. High competition with low similarity may occur whether competition is measured by a competition coefficient near equilibrium or is measured by the proportional increase in a species' population density when its competitor is removed. However, these two measures may differ considerably and may change in opposite directions with a given change in similarity. The general conditions required for such counterintuitive relationships between similarity and competition are that the consumer species have relatively low resource requirements for successful reproduction and that the resources be self-reproducing. These same conditions also frequently lead to exclusion of one or more resources via apparent competition, and this is always true of MacArthur's model. A variety of other models of competition are analyzed, and circumstances most likely to produce large competitive effects with little overlap are identified.","Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,46,71,74,0,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5801 S ELLIS AVENUE, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

In this non-native environment, the species has flourished and has become the dominant apex predator on many reefs. In the present study, a comparison of non-native populations of C. argus in the MHI with native populations in Moorea showed that mean total length (32.0 vs. 26.9 cm), mass (722 vs. 326 g), growth, and body condition were each significantly elevated in the MHI. In addition, while an ontogenetic shift towards larger prey occurred in both locations, it was faster and more consistent in Moorea than in the MHI. As a result, while small C. argus of comparable size in the 2 locations consumed similar-sized prey, large C. argus in Moorea consumed significantly longer and deeper-bodied prey than their counterparts in the MHI. This pattern was unrelated to the size distributions of available prey and may thus reflect stronger intra-and interspecific competition for small prey in Moorea. Although ecological release in a broader sense (i.e. a combination of predator release, parasite release, and competitive release) may play a role, the most direct explanation for the observed differences between C. argus in native habitats in Moorea (with many competing grouper species) and non-native habitats in the MHI (few competitors) would be competitive release (here used in the sense of benefits resulting from the reduction of interspecific competition).","[Meyer, Amanda L.; Dierking, Jan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Dierking, J (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Marine Sci IFM GEOMAR, Evolutionary Ecol Marine Fishes Grp, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",jdierking@ifm-geomar.de,"Dierking, Jan/C-5170-2014","Dierking, Jan/0000-0002-4660-6919",Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l'Environnement (CRIOBE); National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA05NOS4261157]; University of Hawaii Arts and Sciences Advisory Council; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Fulbright Program,"We are grateful to C.

The Great Lakes contain numerous potential predators of lake trout eggs and fry, some of which are recent invaders, and most of which were probably absent when lake trout most recently re-invaded the Great Lakes after the last ice age. Simple quantitative models of predation suggest that plausible assumptions about prey densities, predator feeding rates, and duration of exposure of predator to prey can lead to very high estimates of predation mortality, in some instances approaching 100%. Indirect evidence from inter-Great Lake comparisons and inland lake examples also suggest that biotic factors may impede successful lake trout colonization. Our synthesis of the evidence leads to recommendations for research to better define field feeding rates of lake trout egg and fry predators and comparative studies of densities of potential egg and fry predators on lake trout spawning reefs. Management options should be designed to provide useful information as well as achieve short-term goals. From a management standpoint we recommend that: newly constructed lake trout reefs should be placed well away from concentrations of potential predators; offshore spawning reefs should be stocked; salmonine stocking, nutrient abatement, and commercial harvest of alewives should all be considered as options to enhance survival of young lake trout; hatchery lake trout should nor be stocked at sites where wild lake trout are showing signs of recovery; and exotic species expansions or introductions must be curtailed to maintain or improve on our recent successes in lake trout rehabilitation.","NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES SCI CTR,ANN ARBOR,MI 48105; ONTARIO MINIST NAT RESOURCES,MAPLE,ON L6A 1S9,CANADA; NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES SCI CTR,LAKE SUPERIOR BIOL STN,ASHLAND,WI 54806; LOYOLA UNIV,DEPT BIOL,CHICAGO,IL 60626; UNIV MICHIGAN,CTR GREAT LAKES & AQUAT SCI,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109; NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES CTR,LAKE ONTARIO BIOL STN,OSWEGO,NY 13126","Jones, ML (corresponding author), ONTARIO MINIST NAT RESOURCES,AQUAT ECOSYST RES,RURAL ROUTE 4,PICTON,ON K0K 2T0,CANADA.",,,"Hudson, Patrick/0000-0002-7646-443X",,,,80,45,46,1,27,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2200 BONISTEEL BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109-2099",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Fouling epifauna are generally believed to reduce the settlement of interspecific larvae through competitive exclusion and predation. Studies of these interactions, however, often utilize artificial settlement panels, which can exhibit different recruitment patterns to those observed on natural substrates. Native (Crassostrea virginica) and non-native (Crassostrea ariakensis) oyster larvae were exposed to reef-collected shells, each supporting a single species of reef-associated fauna, over a series of laboratory microcosm studies. The presence of adult bryozoans (Membranipora tenuis) had little effect on rates of larval settlement or mortality. The boring sponge (Cliona sp.) significantly decreased oyster larval settlement, and generally increased oyster mortality. Barnacles (Balanus improvisus) typically facilitated settlement. Barnacle molds and empty barnacle tests, intended to mimic the surface area and rugosity of live barnacles, did not significantly affect settlement. In some trials, adult barnacle bathwater enhanced settlement of oyster larvae, highlighting the importance of waterborne cues. Barnacle bathwaters, adult clam worm (Neanthes succinea) bathwaters and bathwaters created using adult oysters were all found to cause oyster larval mortality. Predation by clam worms, which were observed at very high densities on field-collected oyster shells, caused significant oyster larval mortality in these experiments. The combined effects of positive and negative interactions between oyster larvae and resident invertebrate reef fauna require enumeration under field conditions. The results from this study highlight the need for a more thorough understanding of settlement behavior and mortality sources of recruiting oyster larvae. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

I report the results of an artificial pond experiment testing for interactions between the red spotted newt, Notophthalmus viridescens and the banded sunfish, Enneacanthus obesus. Increased E. obesus density reduced growth and survival of N. viridescens, but increased N. viridescens density did not significantly affect growth or survival of E. obesus. Increased intraspecific density reduced the growth of both species. There were no significant density effets of either Notophthalmus or Enneacanthus on the number, mass at metamorphosis, or larval period of N. viridescens efts, perhaps due to low reproduction in all treatments. Reproduction of E. obesus varied greatly among replicates, and did not respond to density treatments. A negative correlation between number of juvenile fish and mass indicated competition among juvenile E. obesus. Correlations among mass of adult and juvenile newts and fish were also negative, further suggesting competition between newts and fish. The strong negative effect of Enneacanthus on Notophthalmus provides a possible mechanism for the absence of newts from ponds in the Pine Barrens that contain sunfish.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",,,,,,,,32,12,13,0,5,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 7,1991,,1,,,,,1,8,,,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,EY838,WOS:A1991EY83800001,,,,,2021-09-23,

This simplifying assumption is often justified by the perception that variation among individuals does not have significant effects on the dynamics of whole populations. However, this perception may be skewed by a historic focus on studying single populations. A true evaluation of the extent to which among-individual variation affects the dynamics of populations requires the study of multiple populations. In this study, we examined variation in the dynamics of populations of a live-bearing, marine fish (black surfperch; Embiotoca jacksoni). In collaboration with an organization of citizen scientists (Reef Check California), we were able to examine the dynamics of eight populations that were distributed throughout similar to 700km of coastline, a distance that encompasses much of this species' range. We hypothesized that genetic variation within a local population would be related to the intensity of competition and to the strength of population regulation. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether genetic diversity (measured by the diversity of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes) was related to the strength of population regulation. Low-diversity populations experienced strong density dependence in population growth rates and population sizes were regulated much more tightly than they were in high-diversity populations. Mechanisms that contributed to this pattern include links between genetic diversity, habitat use, and spatial crowding. On average, low-diversity populations used less of the available habitat and exhibited greater spatial clustering (and more intense competition) for a given level of density (measured at the scale of the reef). Although the populations we studied also varied with respect to exogenous characteristics (habitat complexity, densities of predators, and interspecific competitors), none of these characteristics was significantly related to the strength of population regulation. In contrast, an endogenous characteristic of the population (genetic diversity) explained 77% of the variation in the strength of population regulation (95% CI: 27-94%). Our results suggest that the genetic and phenotypic composition of populations can play a major role in their dynamics.","[Johnson, D.

Dominant ant species are known to determine the structure of ant communities by interfering in the foraging of other ant species. Using bait and pitfall trapping experiments, we performed a pattern analysis at a fine spatial scale of an ant community in a very simplified and homogeneous agroecosystem, that is, a single-crop banana field in Martinique (French West Indies). We found that the community structure was driven by three dominant species (Solenopsis geminata, Nylanderia guatemalensis, and Monomorium ebeninum) and two subdominant species (Pheidole fallax and Brachymyrmex patagonicus). Our results showed that dominant and subdominant species generally maintained numerical dominance at baits across time, although S. geminata, M. ebeninum, and B. patagonicus displayed better abilities to maintain dominance than P. fallax and N. guatemalensis. Almost all interspecific correlations between species abundances, except those between B. patagonicus and N. guatemalensis, were symmetrically negative, suggesting that interference competition prevails in this ground-dwelling ant community. However, we observed variations in the diurnal and nocturnal foraging activity and in the daily occurrence at baits, which may mitigate the effect of interference competition through the induction of spatial and temporal niche partitioning. This may explain the coexistence of dominant, subdominant, and subordinate species in this very simplified agroecosystem, limited in habitat structure and diversity.","[Carval, Dominique; Cotte, Violaine; Resmond, Remi; Perrin, Benjamin] CIRAD, UPR GECO, Le Lamentin, Martinique, France; [Tixier, Philippe] CIRAD, UPR GECO, Montpellier, France; [Tixier, Philippe] CATIE, Dept Agr & Agroforesteria, Turrialba, Costa Rica","Carval, D (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR GECO, Le Lamentin, Martinique, France.",dominique.carval@cirad.fr,"Tixier, Philippe/C-2119-2008","Tixier, Philippe/0000-0001-5147-9777; Carval, Dominique/0000-0002-1525-2855; Resmond, Remi/0000-0003-4805-9688",CIRAD; E.U.

Intra-guild predation between early larval instars of two co-existing dragonflies, Sympetrum fonscolombii and Trithemis kirbyi , was investigated with respect to temporal advantage and growth. Three situations were simulated experimentally: (1) Sympetrum fonscolombii began development 11 days before T. kirbyi . (2) Trithemis kirbyi began development 11 days before S. fonscolombii . (3) Both species began on the same day. 2. With a temporal advantage of 11 days to the second species, the resulting larval density of the respective first species was significantly higher than that of the second species. 3. Without a temporal advantage, the survival of S. fonscolombii was higher than that of T. kirbyi , and S. fonscolombii had a larger size due to faster growth than T. kirbyi . Hence, it is assumed that survival depended on early oviposition as well as on larval growth. 4. To test the relevance of the laboratory results, observations at artificial ponds in the Namibian semi-desert were conducted. Trithemis kirbyi was the first species colonising these ponds while S. fonscolombii arrived 15 days later. In field samples, many more Trithemis larvae than Sympetrum larvae were found, a pattern similar to the laboratory experiments in which T. kirbyi enjoyed a temporal advantage.","Tech Univ Braunschweig, Inst Zool, D-38102 Braunschweig, Germany","Suhling, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Braunschweig, Inst Zool, Fasanenstr 3, D-38102 Braunschweig, Germany.",f.suhling@tu-bs.de,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261",,,,40,32,37,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

We then investigated the evidence for crowding due to habitat loss by comparing densities within juvenile aggregations on natural reefs with high and low cover of the preferred habitat. Finally, we used a manipulative patch-reef experiment to measure the potential effects of crowding on mortality of juvenile C. parasema. Surveys revealed that 97% of juvenile C. parasema were associated with Acropora corals. Furthermore, C. parasema densities were closely related to the cover of bottlebrush Acropora, the preferred growth form. Contrary to predictions, there was no evidence of crowding on natural reefs with low coral cover, but rather, reefs with abundant Acropora cover supported larger aggregations with double the density of juveniles. We hypothesized that low densities of C. parasema on natural reefs with low coral cover could be explained by intense intraspecific competition. Experimental manipulations showed that juvenile mortality was density-dependent, with mortality 20% higher on high-density experimental patch-reefs compared to low-density reefs. Behavioural observations on the patch-reefs revealed that the frequency of agonistic interactions and distance to shelter were both unrelated to conspecific densities, highlighting the need for further research into mechanisms underpinning density dependent mortality. These results suggest that intraspecific competition may play an important role in reducing reef fish abundance as a consequence of habitat loss. Given that coral reef systems are currently under threat, with a global decline in coral cover, this study adds to the growing body of knowledge of how disturbances to habitat may affect reef fish communities.

G. complanata breeds in advance of H. stagnalis and maintains a body size advantage throughout their annual life-cycle. In experiments, conducted at 14-degrees-C and a photoperiod of 16 hrs L: 8 hrs D, three size classes of leeches of each species were each exposed to each of three size classes of each of five prey species, viz. Tubifex sp., Chironomus sp., Asellus aquaticus, Lymnaea peregra and Potamopyrgus jenkinsi. For each prey species, three different types of experiments were performed: one leech exposed to four prey individuals; four leeches of the same species with sixteen prey; and two leeches of each species with sixteen prey. In the first experiment, all sizes of G. complanata were capable of feeding on all sizes of the prey types offered; the same was true for H. stagnalis with exceptions of feeding on large A. aquaticus and large L. peregra. For both species, but especially for G. complanata, there was a trend within each size class of leech for decreasing proportions of fed leeches with increasing prey size, and within each size class of prey for an increasing proportion of fed leeches with increasing leech size; however there were several exceptions to these trends. Both leeches fed extensively on Tubifex sp. but there were significant differences in the proportions feeding on other prey types; G. complanata fed more on A. aquaticus and the two snail species, and less on Chironomus, than H. stagnalis. The effect of increasing the number of leech individuals from one to four individuals, of the same or mixed species, had little effect on the proportion of leeches which had fed. It is concluded that large G. complanata will have access to large individuals of certain prey taxa denied H. stagnalis, which may lessen the intensity of interspecific competition.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,29,7,7,0,4,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN 21,1994,273,2,,,,,67,75,,10.1007/BF00006848,,,9,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,MX529,WOS:A1994MX52900001,,,,,2021-09-23,

Studies have demonstrated the influence of localized competition and predation among stream fishes, but researchers have been largely unable to determine to what extent interspecific interactions act to control fish assemblage structure. Recent declines to geographic range and abundance of Plains Topminnow (Fundulus sciadicus (Cope)) have been anecdotally attributed to altered fish assemblages and potential competitive or predatory associations; however, important species interactions have yet to be identified. Variation among fish assemblage structure at 473 locations known to historically support Plains Topminnow was described in Nebraska to demonstrate the role of assemblage dynamics in regulating species occurrence. Nonrandom patterns of fish assemblage composition in terms of Plains Topminnow persistence were apparent statewide, and multiple relationships were recognized as regionally influential (e.g., Niobrara River: Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede)). Strong correlations were described relating Plains Topminnow extirpation to nonnative species establishment (Common Carp Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus), Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis (Baird and Girard)), and several potential predatory (Esocidae, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque)) or competitive interactions (Western Mosquitofish, Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus (Rafinesque), Sand Shiner Notropis stramineus (Cope), Red Shiner Cyprinella lutrensis (Baird and Girard)) were identified. Positive relationships are attributed to similar reliance of particular abiotic conditions (Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides (Rafinesque)) or habitat types (Gasterosteidae, Green Sunfish Lepomis cyanellus (Rafinesque), Iowa Darter Etheostoma exile (Winn)). Other identified species will require research to elucidate potential biotic interactions with Plains Topminnow. Resultant models are hypothesized to reflect biotic processes, and thereby provide analytical insight into the long-term influence of fish assemblage structure on a rare species. Identified relationships provide preliminary recognition of potentially important interspecific interactions involving an unfamiliar species from which further hypotheses can be evaluated to ascertain casual relationships.","[Schumann, D.

Passerine birds represent an intriguing case because differing theories yield the possibility of an antagonistic interaction between nest predation risk and food delivery rates on evolution of growth rates. We test this possibility among 64 Passerine species studied on three continents, including tropical and north and south temperate latitudes. Growth rates increased strongly with nestling predation rates within, but not between, sites. The importance of nest predation was further emphasized by revealing hidden allometric scaling effects. Nestling predation risk also was associated with reduced total feeding rates and per-nestling feeding rates within each site. Consequently, faster growth rates were associated with decreased per-nestling food delivery rates across species, both within and among regions. These relationships suggest that Passerines can evolve growth strategies in response to predation risk whereby food resources are not the primary limit on growth rate differences among species. In contrast, reaction norms of growth rate relative to brood size suggest that food may limit growth rates within species in temperate, but not tropical, regions. Results here provide new insight into evolution of growth strategies relative to predation risk and food within and among species.","[Martin, Thomas E.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Lloyd, Penn] Univ Cape Town, Percy Fitzpatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Bosque, Carlos] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Biol Organismos, Caracas, Venezuela","Martin, TE (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",tom.martin@umontana.edu; penn.lloyd@gmail.com; carlosb@usb.ve; daniel.barton@umontana.edu; luis.biancucci@gmail.com; yirucheng@gmail.com; zvoneb@libero.it,"Bosque, Carlos/AAX-6038-2020; Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [INT-9906030, DEB-9981527, DEB-0543178, DEB-0841764]; United States Geological Survey Climate Change Research ProgramUnited States Geological Survey; National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-02817]; FONACIT [DM/0000237]; INPARQUES [PA-INP-005-2004]; Ministerio del Ambiente [01-03-03-1147]","We thank R.

Each of these myrmecophiles has adapted in a highly specific way to the lifestyle of its host. We studied this diverse myrmecophile fauna of L. distinguenda as a new model for multispecies parasitism to gain a better understanding of fundamental coevolutionary processes. Our study focused on behavioural and on chemical integration and exploitation strategies of the different symbiont species. In addition, we examined potential counterstrategies of the host ant. Myrmecophiles were studied both in large free-living L. distinguenda colonies and in more detail in parts of colonies separated for observation. We found that at least five myrmecophile species imposed cost on their host by exploiting its resources. Their impact varied considerably depending on both the type of resources exploited and their abundance. Myrmecophile species were well integrated into host societies either by chemical mimicry of host cuticular hydrocarbons or by remaining chemically insignificant, lacking most characteristic recognition cues. Despite these chemical integration strategies, host ants were able to recognize and kill the alien intruders to various degrees. This important finding demonstrates that symbiont populations are actively counter-regulated by the host. By constructing a host-parasite interaction network, we finally suggest that host defences can maintain myrmecophile diversity by keeping parasite populations small. This reduces interguild competition, comparable to top-down effects of predators on lower trophic levels in ecological food webs. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We conducted two manipulative field experiments in the soft-bottom intertidal zone during 19901991 in eastern Maine to assess effects of predation, intraspecific competition, and initial planting size on the survival and growth of cultured individuals of Mya. Experiment I (23 June 1990 to 13 June 1991) tested interactive effects of two planting sizes (small=8.5 mm shell length (SL); large=11.8 mm SL) and protective netting on fate and growth of clams. Animals of each size were added to separate experimental units within each of 60 1-m(2) areas delimited by a wooden box. To deter predators, 50 boxes were covered with a specific type of plastic netting that differed in aperture size (4.2, 6.4 and 12.8 mm) and degree of rigidity (flexible vs. extruded) while 10 boxes served as controls (without netting). Small clams grew at a faster rate than large clams, but both added approximately 18 mm of new shell by the end of the study. Growth was unaffected by netting size and rigidity, but 13% more clams were recovered alive after a year in protected vs. unprotected treatments (84% vs. 71%). Survival was independent of netting type. The presence of netting resulted in nearly a 3 x enhancement of wild spat (<15 mm SL) compared to unprotected controls (568.8+/-24.4 vs. 199.6+/-22.8 m(-2)). This result suggests that the decline of wild stocks in eastern Maine may not be related to recruitment failure, but to post-settlement events, such as predation, which remove clams from the intertidal. In Experiment II (15 April to 6 October 1991), clam (14.6+/-0.2 mm SL) density was manipulated across four levels from 333 to 2664 m(-2) in protected (extruded netting, 12.8 mm aperture) and unprotected 1-m(2) boxes. Survival within unprotected boxes was independent of stocking density (79%), but was inversely density-dependent in protected boxes (77% in the lowest density treatment increasing to a mean of 88% in the other three treatments). A negative cubic relationship explained the effect of density on growth. We present the first mariculture strategy for public stock enhancement or private entrepreneurs interested in rearing M. arenaria in Maine and the northeast US. Hatchery-reared juveniles 8-10 mm SL should be planted in the spring near or below mid tide levels at densities between 333 and 666 m(-2) and protected with flexible netting (6.4 mm aperture) raised several centimeters above the sediment surface. Netting should be removed from mud flats in the late fall before the threat of ice and severe winter storms. Animals should attain sizes between 25 and 30 mm SL during this time and reach a size refuge from burrowing and other predators. Growth to legal, commercial size (50.8 mm SL) should take another 2-4 years depending on geographic location and mean seawater temperature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Correlated with an estimated decline of similar to 89% in the red colobus population was an increase in encounter rates with chimpanzee parties. Our data, along with the unusually high rates of predation by chimpanzees on red colobus at Ngogo and the fact that the chimpanzee community at Ngogo is the largest ever recorded, support the conclusion that the red colobus decline was caused primarily by chimpanzee predation. This seems to be the first documented case of predation by one nonhuman primate causing the population decline in another. We evaluated disease and interspecific competition as other possible causes of the red colobus decline, but judged them to be relatively insignificant compared with predation by chimpanzees. Notable changes in encounter rates with other primate species may have resulted from forest expansion. Those for mangabeys, redtails, and black and white colobus increased significantly. Encounter rates increased for l'Hoest's monkeys too, but the increased sightings may have been an artifact of increased habituation. Sightings of blue monkey and baboon groups declined. There was no significant change in encounter rates for all species combined. The Ngogo primate community seemed to be in a nonequilibrium state, changing from one dominated by two species, a folivore (red colobus) and a frugivorous omnivore (redtails), to one dominated by three species of frugivorous omnivores (redtails, mangabeys, and chimpanzees). This study demonstrates the importance of long-term monitoring in understanding population dynamics and the role of intrinsic variables in shaping the species composition of a community. Am. J.

In particular, the influence of small takes on fish assemblages is poorly understood. Field surveys and stable-isotope analyses were used to evaluate the impact of differing levels of flow abstraction on fish assemblage structure, and native-non-native patterns of coexistence, associated with small surface water abstractions in four streams in New Zealand. Study design accounted for longitudinal processes (spatial autocorrelation) to isolate the effects of abstractions on fish assemblages. Reaches with reduced flows downstream of abstraction points had significantly lower fish abundances per metre of stream length, probably because of decreased habitat size, altered interspecific interactions and barriers to movement. The loss of larger fish in reaches with high abstraction resulted in shallower mass-abundance slopes and shorter stable isotope-derived food-chain lengths, likely to have been caused by fewer trophic links in the food web. The large fish absent from these reaches were flow-sensitive introduced salmonids, resulting in higher relative abundances of small-bodied native fish, probably as a result of predatory and competitive release. Quantification of metrics designed to characterize ecosystem functioning as well as abundance and species composition indicated that small water abstractions can alter both the structure and composition of stream fish assemblages and modify the outcomes of native-non-native species interactions. Thus, a better understanding of the effects of small abstractions could be used to improve the strategic management of fish in invaded riverscapes.","[Boddy, Nixie C.; Fraley, Kevin M.; Warburton, Helen J.; Kelly, Dave; McIntosh, Angus R.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Jellyman, Phillip G.; Booker, Doug J.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand","Fraley, KM (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",kvnfraley@gmail.com,"Fraley, Kevin/J-5107-2019; McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011","Fraley, Kevin/0000-0001-5068-5616; McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813; Jellyman, Phil/0000-0002-5239-8239",NIWA Sustainable Water Allocation Programme; UC,"We thank Dr Richard White and other members of the University of Canterbury (UC) Freshwater Ecology Research Group for field assistance and advice during this project, and Gawler Downs Station for allowing access to sampling sites.

However, detailed information is still scarce for Niviventer confucianus and Apodemus draco in the Hengduan Mountains on their habitat requirements. Data on habitats utilized by sympatric N. confucianus and A. draco were collected using transect line sampling from April to December 2008 in Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve, China. The results indicated that both mammals exhibited an obvious habitat preference across seasons. In spring, N. confucianus preferred habitats at lower elevations, with thicker leaf litter, lower bamboo cover, shorter total length of fallen logs and higher tree diversity, and A. draco preferred habitats at lower elevations and with higher percentage of nut trees. In summer-autumn, N. confucianus frequently occurred at sites with lower elevations and thicker leaf litter, while A. dram preferred habitats with thicker leaf litter and higher percentage of nut trees. In winter, N. confucianus preferred sites with lower elevations and dead tree density, and higher canopy and percentage of nut trees. In contrast, A. draco preferred habitats with thicker leaf litter and higher shrub density. Variables closely relating to food availability and predation risks contributed more to discriminating habitat plots from control ones, implying that the two factors played an important role in shaping their process of habitat selection. In addition, both mammals exhibited a distinct habitat use pattern from each other, and some variables, such as elevation, contributed more to their habitat separation across seasons, which can potentially reduce interspecific competition and further facilitate their coexistence in sympatry.","[Yuan, Shibin; Mu, Huaqiang; Cao, Shanshan; Zhang, Mingchun; Yang, Xuyu; Hui, Jinchu; Zhang, Zejun] China West Normal Univ, Inst Rare Anim & Plants, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xiaodong] Sichuan Forestry Bur, Wildlife Conservat Div, Chengdu 610081, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZJ (corresponding author), China West Normal Univ, Inst Rare Anim & Plants, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China.",zhangzj@ioz.ac.cn,"Yuan, Shibin/W-5289-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30970382, 31270570]; Giant Pandas International Cooperation Foundation of State Forestry Administration; Foundations of the National Ministry of Education for New-Century Distinguished Talents","This project was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (30970382, 31270570), Giant Pandas International Cooperation Foundation of State Forestry Administration, and Foundations of the National Ministry of Education for New-Century Distinguished Talents.

If two species are distributed across an environmental gradient, and differ in their ability to cope with environmental conditions, the outcome of competitive interactions may be dependent on prevailing abiotic conditions. Two closely related species of poison frogs in north-central Peru were observed to occupy parapatric distributions across an elevation gradient. Ameerega bassleri is a highland endemic restricted to a small region of Peru, and A. trivittata is distributed throughout lowland Amazonia. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of an abiotic factor (elevation) on two biotic factors (intraspecific and interspecific competition), by measuring growth and survival in the larvae of A. trivittata and A. bassleri. Using mesocosm experiments arranged in a fractional factorial design, we found that (1) A. bassleri had a strong negative effect on the growth and survival of A. trivittata regardless of elevation, (2) A. trivittata had no effect on the growth of A. bassleri at either elevation, but did appear to reduce the survival of A. bassleri more strongly in the lowlands than highlands, (3) lowland conditions uniformly reduced survival in all treatments and in both species, and (4) competition was strongly asymmetric between A. bassleri and A. trivittata. We conclude that the perceived low density of A. trivittata in highland sites may be influenced by the presence of A. bassleri, but the lower limit to the distribution of A. bassleri cannot be explained by competition with A. trivittata and may be due to physiological constraints imposed by lowland conditions.","[Twomey, Evan; Summers, Kyle] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Morales, Victor] Univ Ricardo Palma, Fac Ciencias Biol, Lima, Peru","Twomey, E (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",emt0424@mail.ecu.edu,,,,,,66,14,15,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2008,117,8,,,,,1175,1184,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16676.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,335KE,WOS:000258288700006,,,,,2021-09-23,

We tested for fine-scale competition over foraging space between sympatric pursuit-diving seabirds, Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus (J.F. Gmelin, 1789)) and Common Murre (Uria aalge (Pontoppidan, 1763)). We simultaneous assessed the effects of inter- and intra-specific competition among these predators, predicting that the larger Common Murres would out-compete the smaller Marbled Murrelets for foraging space. A theodolite was used to map the fine-scale (+/- 2 m) distributions of birds on the water; distance from shore measurements and nearest-neighbour spatial statistics quantified the spatial overlap and segregation between species. Species distributions differed with respect to distance from shore, but overlapped extensively within 1200 m of the shoreline. Nearest-neighbour statistics, assessed with randomization tests, showed Marbled Murrelets foraging farther from Common Murres (mean distances 294 m) than from other Marbled Murre lets (95 m), but groups of Common Murres foraged with similar spacing among conspecifics (266 m) and competitors (186 m). These results suggest avoidance of Common Murres by Marbled Murrelets (interspecific competition) but intraspecifc competition among Common Murres. Avoidance behaviour may minimize the impacts of aggression or competition, but by avoiding Common Murres, the Marbled Murrelets may also be reducing their foraging opportunities.","[Ronconi, R.

Although intraguild prey are hypothesized to exhibit faster growth rates than intraguild predators and, therefore, outgrow predation risk through time, intraguild predation also is associated with significant increases in predator growth rates that are hypothesized to increase the potential for future predation. Given these conflicting hypotheses, how predation among amphibian larvae early in development should influence size disparities and ontogenetic shifts in predation risk is unclear. To clarify the effects of intraguild predation on predator and prey growth, we quantified size variation among larval salamanders (Ambystomatidae) in forested ephemeral ponds while concurrently monitoring seasonal patterns of intraguild predation through gut content analyses. Intraguild predation had no discernible effect on either interspecific size disparities between intraguild predators and prey, or intraspecific size variation within predator populations, and factors of larval density, tadpole density, and pond area were more important than larval size variation in predicting IGP. Our results do not support previous assertions regarding the consequences of intraguild predation for predator-prey size disparities, because top predators not actively engaging in IGP appeared to maintain growth rates equivalent to successful conspecific IG predators, and the frequency of intraguild predation did not significantly change during larval ontogeny. The lack of consistent increases or decreases in predator-prey size disparities suggests that intraguild prey may not experience predictable ontogenetic shifts in intraguild predation risk.","[Mott, Cy L.; Sparling, Donald W.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Mott, Cy L.] Valdosta State Univ, Dept Biol, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA","Mott, CL (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.; Mott, CL (corresponding author), Valdosta State Univ, Dept Biol, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA.",clmott@valdosta.edu,,,Delyte and Dorothy Morris Fellowship,"We thank S.

The biotic interactions are thus considered to be a possible driver of differential geographical distributions often observed between closely related sexuals and asexuals: a pattern referred to as geographical parthenogenesis (GP). We tested the RQH in Hieracium alpinum L., a vascular plant species exhibiting a striking pattern of GP, by assessing the frequency and intensity with which seed predator specialists occur and the level of interspecific plant-plant competition expressed through both the surrounding vegetation density and the species richness across its distributional range. Furthermore, we tested whether there were negative associations between intra-population genetic diversity, as assessed by amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, and incidences of seed predation. Our results indicate no significant differences in frequency and intensity of seed predation nor in the level of interspecific plant-plant interactions between diploid sexual and triploid asexual populations. Furthermore, there were no consistent latitudinal and/or altitudinal patterns for the assessed parameters. Contrary to our expectations, there were either positive or non-significant associations between genetic diversity and the level of seed predation. To conclude, the RQH cannot thoroughly explain the GP in H. alpinum, and other alternative scenarios should be considered and tested.","[Hartmann, Matthias; Stefanek, Michal; Zdvorak, Pavel; Chrtek, Jindrich; Mraz, Patrik] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12800 Prague, Czech Republic; [Herman, Petr] Krivoklat 190, CZ-27023 Krivoklat, Czech Republic; [Chrtek, Jindrich] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic","Hartmann, M (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12800 Prague, Czech Republic.",m.hartmann301187@gmail.com,"Mraz, Patrik/ABD-9484-2020; Hartmann, Matthias/AAL-8753-2021; Mraz, Patrik/I-5965-2016; Hartmann, Matthias/A-8142-2018","Mraz, Patrik/0000-0002-1415-070X; Hartmann, Matthias/0000-0001-9721-0925; Mraz, Patrik/0000-0002-1415-070X; Hartmann, Matthias/0000-0001-9721-0925",Czech Science Foundation (GACR)Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-02858S],"We thank V.

We investigated why surf-zone fishes, which are introduced to the island ponds during periodic wash-over events, are unable to persist for extended periods. We simulated over-wash events by collecting fishes from the shallow surf-zone and introducing them into 0.56 m(2) field enclosures. During summer months. surf-zone fishes typically died within 24 h. Levels of dissolved oxygen and temperature frequently exceeded the tolerance limits of the surf-zone fishes (demonstrated in a series of laboratory experiments), suggesting that these variables were responsible for fish mortality. In non-summer months, when dissolved oxygen and temperature stresses were ameliorated, surf-zone fishes could survive for months in the ponds. We conducted field-enclosure experiments at 3 fish densities in order to evaluate the survival and condition of a common surf-zone fish, Membras martinica (the rough silverside): (1) 8 M. martinica (14 fish m(-2)), (2) 16 M, martinica (28 fish m(-2)), and (3) 8 M. martinica + 8 Fundulus heteroclitus (28 fish m(-2)). After approximately 1 mo during the spring, fall and winter, survival and condition of fishes in Treatments 2 and 3 were significantly reduced, suggesting that biological interactions were an important cause of surf-zone fish mortality.

Mechanistic definitions consider an animal's home range to be the spatial expression of a cognitive map that is kept up-to-date with the status of critical resources that contribute to animal fitness. We assumed there are two major determinants structuring the home range of cats as apex predators in insular ecosystems: the distribution of critical food resources and conspecific distribution. We hypothesized that cats structure their home ranges by optimizing the use of staple critical food resources and that as a consequence of the presence of rich resources cats tend to socialise, aggregate and share space. We carried out spatial analyses using location data for feral cats tracked using lightweight GPS collars in conjunction with the suitability value of rabbit patches and their associated ownership costs for cats within a New Zealand braided-river environment. Cat home ranges and spatial distribution, especially for females, were related to the inclusion of rabbit patches within home ranges with higher mean value than the average of neighbourhood patches in the landscape. Cats showed solitary behaviour but tolerance to conspecific presence by sharing high-use areas and high-value rabbit patches, mostly at different times, resulting in occasional encounters among males and females. Home range size and patterns of spatial overlap were dependant on sex and season. Solitary spacing patterns as consequence of innate preferences together with resource constraints may regulate feral cat population densities.","[Recio, Mariano R.] Univ Otago, Sch Surveying, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Recio, Mariano R.; Seddon, Philip J.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Recio, MR (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",mariano.recio@otago.ac.nz,"Seddon, Philip/G-8659-2011","Seddon, Philip/0000-0001-9076-9566; /0000-0002-9449-2952",Department of Zoology Research Grant; School of Surveying Research Funds (PBRF); University of Otago,We thank Richard Maloney and the Department of Conservation staff in Twizel for the logistic support; Simon Stevenson for the assistance in the field; Godley Peaks and Lylibank Station for access permission to their lands; Emilio Virgos for providing helpful discussions and assistance.

There have, however, been no studies on the cost of sharing an intermediate host with other parasites in terms of reduced adult parasite fecundity. Even if larval parasites suffer a reduction in size, caused by crowding, virtually nothing is known about longer-lasting effects after transmission to the definitive host. This study is the first to use in vitro cultivation with feeding of adult trematodes to investigate how numbers of parasites in the intermediate host affect the size and fecundity of adult parasites. For this purpose, we examined two different infracommunities of parasites in crustacean hosts. Firstly, we used experimental infections of Maritrema novaezealandensis in the amphipod, Paracalliope novizealandiae, to investigate potential density-dependent effects in single-species infections. Secondly, we used the crab, Macrophthalmus hirtipes (Ocypodidae), naturally infected by the trematodes, M. novaezealandensis and Levinseniella sp., the acanthocephalan, Profilicollis spp., and an acuariid nematode. These four helminths all develop and grow in their crustacean host before transmission to their bird definitive host by predation. In experimental infections, we found an intensity-dependent establishment success, with a decrease in the success rate of cercariae developing into infective metacercariae with an increasing dose of cercariae applied to each amphipod. In natural infections, we found that M. novaezealandensis-metacercariae achieved a smaller volume, on average, when infrapopulations of this parasite were large. Small metacercariae produced small in vitro-adult worms, which in turn produced fewer eggs. Crowding effects in the intermediate host thus were expressed at the adult stage in spite of the worms being cultured in a nutrient-rich medium. Furthermore, excystment success and egg-production in M. novaezealandensis in naturally infected crabs were influenced by the number of co-occurring Profilicollis cystacanths, indicating interspecific interactions between the two species. Our results thus indicate that the infracommunity of larval helminths in their intermediate host is interactive and that any density-dependent effect in the intermediate host may have lasting effects on individual parasite fitness.

Recent laboratory studies have reached opposite conclusions regarding the dominance relationship between these species, even documenting a reversal of roles as predator and prey. Interestingly, these contradicting results involved crab populations from different regions in Atlantic Canada (St. George's Bay in the Northumberland Strait and Passamaquoddy Bay in the Bay of Fundy), which are genetically different and presumed to be the result of different invasion events. In this study we housed juvenile lobsters and adult green crabs together in 3-m diameter flow-through tanks, and monitored their mortality, growth and behaviour from September through December 2009. The experiment involved five treatments, three experimental treatments with 2.5 lobsters/m(2) housed with an equal density of green crabs from one of three regions (Passamaquoddy Bay, St. George's Bay or Chedabucto Bay on the Scotian Shelf) and two control treatments with lobsters alone stocked at either 2.5 or 5 individuals/m(2). Chedabucto Bay was chosen as a third region as crabs there are genetically similar to conspecifics in St. George's Bay, but experience environmental conditions more similar to Passamaquoddy Bay. Green crabs had a significant and negative impact on lobster survival during the experiment, and the magnitude of this impact varied in relation to the green crabs' geographic origin, as mortality was significantly higher for lobsters paired with St. George's Bay and Chedabucto Bay crabs than Passamaquoddy Bay crabs. These differences in lobster mortality patterns lead to two important conclusions. First, the greater predatory impact of green crabs from St. George's Bay relative to Passamaquoddy Bay is consistent with the contrasting results recently reported in the literature, suggesting that these are of biological significance and not simply the result of procedural differences between studies. Second, the fact that the predatory impact of Chedabucto Bay green crabs was similar to that of conspecifics from St. Georges Bay, but greater than those from Passamaquoddy Bay, suggests that these differences in interspecific dominance patterns are correlated with genetic differences between green crab populations related to their invasion history in Atlantic Canada. The mechanisms underlying the effect of crab geographic origin on its interaction with juvenile lobster remain elusive, however, as no differences in crab behaviour or morphology were found that correlated with the pattern of lobster mortality.

A previous study showed that fallow deer can actively exclude roe from feeding areas. Here I show that 81% out of 42 aggressive interactions were fallow-roe deer aggressions, whereas 19% were roe-fallow aggressions. No aggressive interaction involved physical contact between opponents and roe deer were displaced in all events. When roe deer avoided fallow deer, the probability of remaining feeding increased significantly with respect to when aggression occurred. Fallow deer males, especially yearlings, were more aggressive than females to all roe deer sexes/age classes. For fallow deer, aggression was an efficient way to monopolise the access to foraging space. For roe deer, spatial avoidance of fallow was a way to remain at feeding areas.","Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Ferretti, F (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, Via T Pendola 62, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",francescoferretti@libero.it,,"Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0002-0414-1615",MRP Agency,"I am indebted to S.

Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a widely adapted aphid in the agroecosystems and is one of the main bell pepper pests. In the present study, we determined the spatial and temporal dynamics and the regulatory factors of M. persicae populations in bell pepper crops. The number of aphids and their natural enemies were evaluated during 2 years in four commercial bell pepper fields. Myzus persicae density data were related to temperature, rainfall, and natural enemies by multiple regression analysis and were then submitted to geostatistical analysis. The density of M. persicae was higher during the plant's reproductive growth stage. Rainfall, Chrysoperla spp., and Toxomerus spp. regulate M. persicae populations. Initial infestations of this pest occur along the edges of the fields and subsequently spread towards the center. This information is useful for integrated management programs aimed at anticipating periods of higher abundance of M. persicae and identifying arthropods to be prioritized in biological control.","[Soares, J.

Meta-analysts will vary in the criteria they use to screen studies and select data within studies, even when addressing exactly the same question. We summarize some of the many decisions that an ecologist must make in deciding what data to include in a synthesis. We then show, using multiple meta-analyses taken from the same literature on stream predation experiments, that meta-analytic conclusions can be colored by selection criteria that are not specifically a function of the relevance of the data. As a consequence, we recommend that meta-analysts perform several meta-analyses using different selection criteria to examine the robustness of reported findings. We also advise ecological meta-analysts to minimize use of selection criteria that are based on judgments of study quality when extracting data from the literature, because of the potential for unconscious bias. The influence of quality criteria on patterns in the data set can then be examined empirically. Our comparisons of mean effect size,for studies included vs. excluded on the basis of quality criteria, provided no evidence that rejected studies were aberrant or more variable than acceptable studies. One result of excluding such studies was a loss of statistical power. We urge ecologists to be more explicit about how data are selected for a meta-analysis, to examine the robustness of the patterns they report, and to conduct meta-analyses to describe as well as to infer.","Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Englund, G (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",,"Englund, Goran/A-7434-2008","Englund, Goran/0000-0001-5634-8602",,,,40,132,140,1,46,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1999,80,4,,,,,1132,1141,,10.2307/177060,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,215EG,WOS:000081368500004,,,,,2021-09-23,

Contrarily, interspecies violence has mainly been investigated in the context of predation and received most research attention in carnivores. Here, we provide the first information of two lethal coalitionary attacks of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) on another hominid species, western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), that occur sympatrically in the Loango National Park in Gabon. In both events, the chimpanzees significantly outnumbered the gorillas and victims were infant gorillas. We discuss these observations in light of the two most widely accepted theoretical explanations for interspecific lethal violence, predation and competition, and combinations of the two-intraguild predation and interspecific killing. Given these events meet conditions proposed to trigger coalitional killing of neighbours in chimpanzees, we also discuss them in light of chimpanzees' intraspecific interactions and territorial nature. Our findings may spur further research into the complexity of interspecies interactions. In addition, they may aid in combining field data from extant models with the Pliocene hominid fossil record to better understand behavioural adaptations and interspecific killing in the hominin lineage.","[Southern, Lara M.; Pika, Simone] Univ Osnabruck, Comparat BioCognit, Inst Cognit Sci, Artilleriestr 34, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany; [Southern, Lara M.; Deschner, Tobias] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Interim Grp Primatol, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Pika, S (corresponding author), Univ Osnabruck, Comparat BioCognit, Inst Cognit Sci, Artilleriestr 34, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany.",spika@uos.de,,,Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX; ERC Consolidator GrantEuropean Research Council (ERC) [772000],"We thank the Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique of Gabon for their collaboration and permission to conduct research in the Loango National Park.

We conducted laboratory experiments to examine behavioral and chemical interference competition between tadpoles of the southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia) and those of the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea). Water preconditioned by R. utricularia tadpoles significantly decreased the growth and increased the mortality of H. cinerea tadpoles compared with control treatments. In addition, R. utricularia tadpoles inhibited the feeding rate of H, cinerea tadpoles by harassing them, and these interactions significantly decreased the growth and increased the mortality of the H. cinerea tadpoles. Rana utricularia tadpoles apparently use both chemical interference and aggressive behavior in securing a competitive advantage over H. cinerea tadpoles, and the H. cinerea tadpoles suffer from these interactions. Intraspecific chemical and behavioral interference competition also significantly decreased the growth of larval H. cinerea. In natural ponds, R. utricularia ia tadpoles that inhibit the growth and increase the mortality of H. cinerea tadpoles may increase their own chances of survival and metamorphosis, while H. cinerea tadpoles that avoid interactions with conspecifics and with R. utricularia tadpoles may increase their own chances of survival and metamorphosis.","Univ SW Louisiana, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA; Univ Virginia, Mt Lake Biol Stn, Pembroke, VA 24136 USA","Faragher, SG (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",sf9@dana.ucc.nau.edu,,,,,,70,32,37,0,20,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Most studies of species co-occurrence have focused on negative association patterns (segregation presumed to arise from competition), often ignoring positive aggregations, although positive and negative associations may arise from multiple mechanisms. We used a pairwise approach to identify co-occurrence patterns of 76 fish species across almost 9500 lakes, followed by a meta-analytic approach to compare the co-occurrence pattern of each species pair across watersheds and determine their cumulative species associations. Biological information relating to species' phylogeny, habitat preferences, and diet was used to group species into relevant subsets in order to test community assembly processes of competition, predation, and habitat filtering. We found consistent non-random patterns of co-occurrence in nearly half the species pairs and more extremely aggregated than segregated species pairs. Observed co-occurrence patterns indicated the importance of shared habitat requirements and predation, rather than competition, driving positively aggregated and negatively segregated species associations, respectively. Our meta-analytic approach incorporating important biological attributes permitted the testing of specific mechanisms of community assembly, providing novel insights into the major determinants of fish community structure and their generality across a vast set of lakes.","[Cordero, Ruben D.; Jackson, Donald A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","Jackson, DA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",don.jackson@utoronto.ca,"Cordero, Ruben/AAV-8025-2021","Cordero, Ruben/0000-0002-2128-6904",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We would like to thank H.

However, later demographic changes could be explained by within-community ecological processes, not detected in presence of human gatherers. Competition for food, predation and recruitment, were explanatory hypothesis for such changes, and they were tested at the study site for two species: Fissurella picta and Fissurella limbata. At present, F. limbata does not occur at areas protected of the north winds, and F. picta shows a decreasing density in exposed areas. The competition hypothesis was tested at the exposed area through enclosure experiments. Predation over adult individuals was examined by means of a diet analysis for five predator species, from our data base of the Marine Reserve and other studies in that area and from other localities of the Chilean coast. Recruitment failure was studied on a long-term basis, using data on size structure accumulated in our data base. No inter or intraspecific competition was detected between the two species in the enclosure experiment, since neither species affected survivorship or biomass of the other. No evidence of an alternative to man predator of adults was found, but only a very low predation exerted by Larus dominicanus, Sicyases sanguineus. Stichaster striatus and Rattus rattus. A recruitment failure was detected for F. picta at the exposed area, and we detected the entry of individuals smaller than 30 mm during the last three years in the protected area.

One fundamental pattern in macroecology is the interspecific relationship between local abundance and regional range size, which is generally considered to be positively linear. Here, we examine structural details of the relationship between abundance and range size in cyclic populations of small mammals and its long-term temporal variation. Location Finland. Methods We analysed 39years of trapping data of Rodentia and Soricomorpha collected in field and forest habitats across Finland. Abundance was measured as the mean population density of individuals, and range size as the number of grid cells occupied and sample occupancy. Data were analysed using linear mixed models. Results The relationship between mean local density and sample occupancy was generally linear, whereas the relationship between density and the number of grid cells occupied was generally curvilinear (U-shaped) for both habitats, being negative for species with small range sizes and positive for species with larger ranges. The curvilinearity was temporally consistent in both habitats. Main conclusions The interspecific relationship between abundance and range size varies depending on how range size is measured. Interestingly, the curvilinear relationship between density and range size was found in an assemblage in which many of the species have fluctuating (cyclic) populations. Future research on abundancerange size relationships should focus on long-term temporal variation to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop macroecological theory.","[Komonen, Atte] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Henttonen, Heikki] Finnish Forest Res Inst, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland; [Huitu, Otso] Finnish Forest Res Inst, FI-77600 Suonenjoki, Finland; [Nissinen, Kari] Univ Jyvaskyla, Finnish Inst Educ Res, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Komonen, A (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",atte.komonen@jyu.fi,,,,,,39,4,4,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

We assessed species-specific habitat suitability based upon nutrient characteristics using larval survival rates (SR) and wing lengths (WL) from floating habitat enclosures. Anopheles albimanus showed a high SR (81%) in all three habitats, while An. vestitipennis had a similarly high SR in its own habitat (82%) and An. darlingi's habitat (8 1 %). Anopheles darlingi only showed high SR (85%) in its own habitat. Both An. vestitipennis and An. darlingi showed very low SR in the An. albimanus habitat. There were no significant WL differences among field-caught, laboratory-reared, and experimental populations of An. vestitipennis and An. albimanus, with the exception of An. vestitipennis experimental populations and An. vestitipennis field populations placed in the An. albimanus habitat. Habitat quality indicators, particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic nitrogen (PON), were consistently higher in An. vestitipennis habitats than in the habitats of the other two species. Correspondingly, An. vestitipennis adults were larger when measured both as dry mass and from WL. There were no differences in dry mass, lipids, or protein content among the same species reared at different locations. We compared SR and WL among mosquitoes from shaded and unshaded containers to test whether the high mortality rates for An. vestitipennis and An. darlingi in the An. albimanus habitat were due to intense sun exposure. There were no significant differences among developmental times, survivorship, or adult size for shaded versus sun-exposed populations. This indicates that other factors such as larval toxins, predator avoidance, interspecific species competition, etc. may be responsible for the higher mortality rates in those species not adapted to this particular habitat.","[Grieco, John P.; Achee, Nicole L.; Klein, Corinne N.; Andre, Richard; Roberts, Donald] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biometr, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Rejmankova, Eliska] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Grieco, JP (corresponding author), Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biometr, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",,,"Grieco, John/0000-0002-2080-8598",,,,38,16,17,0,21,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,CORONA,"1966 COMPTON AVE, CORONA, CA 92881 USA",1081-1710,1948-7134,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

The gradient in pond canopy cover strongly influences freshwater species distributions. This study tested the effects of canopy cover on the performance of two species of larval anurans, a canopy cover generalist (Rana sylvatica, the wood frog) and an open-canopy specialist (R. pipiens, the leopard frog), and tested which factors co-varying with canopy cover mediate these effects. 2. A field transplant experiment demonstrated that canopy cover had negative performance effects on both species. However, leopard frogs, which grow faster than wood frogs in open-canopy ponds, were more strongly affected by closed-canopy pond conditions. 3. Closed-canopy ponds had lower temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and food nutritional quality as indicated by carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C : N) analysis of field-sampled food types, and of gut contents of transplanted larvae. 4. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that higher temperature and food quality but not DO substantially increased larval growth. However, only food quality increased growth rates of leopard frogs more than wood frogs. 5. The strong correlation of growth rates to gut content C : N in the field, and the similarity of growth curves as a function of resource quality in the field and laboratory, strongly suggest that resources are of primary importance in mediating intraspecific, and especially interspecific differences in performance across the canopy cover gradient.","Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Schiesari, L (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Arts Sci & Humanities, EACH, Av Arlindo Betio 1000,Parque Ecol Tiete, BR-03828080 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lschiesa@usp.br,"Schiesari, Luis C/E-8624-2012","Schiesari, Luis C/0000-0003-0814-591X",,,,30,89,90,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Further, a range of density-dependent and density-independent biotic and abiotic processes affect the phenology of mosquito populations, with potentially large knock-on effects for vector dynamics and disease transmission. Whilst it is understood that density-independent and density-dependent processes affect seasonal population levels, it is not clear how these interact temporally to shape the population peaks and troughs. Due to this, the paucity of high-resolution data for validation, and the difficulty of parameterizing density-dependent processes, models of vector dynamics may poorly estimate abundances, which has knock-on effects for our ability predict vector-borne disease outbreaks.ResultsWe present a rich dataset describing seasonal abundance patterns of each life stage of Culex pipiens, a widespread vector of West Nile virus, at a field site in southern England in 2015. Abundance of immature stages was measured three times per week, whilst adult traps were run four nights each week. This dataset is integrated with an existing delay-differential equation model predicting Cx. pipiens seasonal abundance to improve understanding of observed seasonal abundance patterns. At our field site, the outcome of our model fitting suggests interspecific predation on mosquito larvae and temperature-dependent larval mortality combine to act as the main sources of population regulation throughout the active season, whilst competition for resources is a relatively small source of larval mortality.ConclusionsThe model suggests that density-independent mortality and interspecific predation interact to shape patterns of mosquito seasonal abundance in a permanent aquatic habitat and we propose that competition for resources is likely to be important where periods of high rainfall create transient habitats. Further, we highlight the importance of challenging population abundance models with data from across all life stages of the species of interest if reliable inferences are to be drawn from these models, particularly when considering mosquito control and vector-borne disease transmission.","[Ewing, David A.; Purse, Bethan V.; Schafer, Stefanie M.; White, Steven M.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Benson Lane, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Ewing, David A.; Cobbold, Christina A.] Univ Glasgow, Dept Math & Stat, Univ Pl, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Ewing, David A.] Biomath & Stat Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell Bldg,Peter Guthrie Tate Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Cobbold, Christina A.] Univ Glasgow, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [White, Steven M.] Radcliffe Observ Quarter, Math Inst, Wolfson Ctr Math Biol, Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England","Ewing, DA (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Benson Lane, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.; Ewing, DA (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Dept Math & Stat, Univ Pl, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.; Ewing, DA (corresponding author), Biomath & Stat Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell Bldg,Peter Guthrie Tate Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland.",david.ewing@bioss.ac.uk,"Schafer, Stefanie/H-3070-2016; Purse, Bethan V/I-6640-2012","Schafer, Stefanie/0000-0002-8748-7725; Purse, Bethan V/0000-0001-5140-2710; Ewing, David/0000-0002-9974-8179",Natural Environment Research Council Doctoral Training Grant [NE/L501645/1]; Natural Environment Research Council National Capability allocation [NEC05100 HARM]; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/P004202/1],This work was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council Doctoral Training Grant (Grant no.

This lake is sited outside the natural range of the ruffe and has a lower fish diversity and a different fish species composition than within its native range. From June through September the ruffe was planktivorous and mainly caught at 4 to 6 m depth in the benthic zone. At other times of year ruffe was feeding on zoobenthos and caught deeper in the benthic zone. Ruffe was mainly day active. Zooplankton feeding during summer is the dearest difference compared to ruffe populations living within its natural range. Presence of large zooplankton organisms available for ruffe is suggested as the main reason for the difference found in food choice. The availability of large zooplankton is probably due to community structure caused by a predator and lack of interspecific competition for zooplankton in the deeper parts of the lake. Piscivorous brown trout, Salmo trutta, restrict the habitat of threespined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to the zone of littoral vegetation, allowing high densities of larger zooplankton species like Bythotrephes longimanus to be present in the lake. Brown trout is present only in the upper light and well oxygenated parts of the lake, leaving a refuge for the ruffe, where they can feed on the rich zooplankton community.",,"KALAS, S (corresponding author), UNIV BERGEN,INST ZOOL,DEPT ANIM ECOL,ALLEGATEN 41,N-5007 BERGEN,NORWAY.",,,,,,,52,22,23,2,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

We used traditional (morphological) and novel molecular methods of diet analysis to study the diet of two cryptic bat species that are sympatric in southern England (Plecotus austriacus and P. auritus) (Fig. 1). Using Roche FLX 454 (Roche, Basel, CH) high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and uniquely tagged generic arthropod primers, we identified 142 prey Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) in the diet of the cryptic bats, 60% of which were assigned to a likely species or genus. The findings from the molecular study supported the results of microscopic analyses in showing that the diets of both species were dominated by lepidopterans. However, HTS provided a sufficiently high resolution of prey identification to determine fine-scale differences in resource use. Although both bat species appeared to have a generalist diet, eared-moths from the family Noctuidae were the main prey consumed. Interspecific niche overlap was greater than expected by chance (O-jk = 0.72, P < 0.001) due to overlap in the consumption of the more common prey species. Yet, habitat associations of nongeneralist prey species found in the diets corresponded to those of their respective bat predator (grasslands for P. austriacus, and woodland for P. auritus). Overlap in common dietary resource use combined with differential specialist prey habitat associations suggests that habitat partitioning is the primary mechanism of coexistence. The performance of HTS is discussed in relation to previous methods of molecular and morphological diet analysis. By enabling species-level identification of dietary components, the application of DNA sequencing to diet analysis allows a more comprehensive comparison of the diet of sympatric cryptic species, and therefore can be an important tool for determining fine-scale mechanisms of coexistence.","[Razgour, Orly; Clare, Elizabeth L.; Zeale, Matt R.

In this study, I quantified the predator avoidance trait burst swim speed and related traits for 14 anuran species found in three pond types and within three taxonomic families. Absolute swim speed differed significantly among species and among taxonomic families. Inclusion of size in the model revealed a three-way interaction between size, habitat and taxonomic family. Tail beat frequency and body shape differed significantly among species, but with no pattern by family or habitat. Functional relationships among traits also did not differ among family by habitat groups. The evolution of swim speed was significantly correlated with the evolution of increased size.

Species' preferences for nest-sites have presumably evolved in relation to local habitat resources and/or interactions with other species. The importance of these two components in the nest-site selection of the Eurasian Honey Buzzard Pernis apivorus was assessed in two study areas in eastern Austria. There was almost no difference in macro- and micro-habitat features between nest-sites and random plots, suggesting that Honey Buzzards did not base their choice of nest-site on habitat characteristics. However, nests were placed significantly further from nests of Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis than would be expected if nest-sites had been chosen at random. Furthermore, in one study area Honey Buzzards appeared to favour areas close to human settlements, perhaps indicating a mechanism to avoid Goshawks, which tend to avoid the proximity of humans. No habitat variable was significantly associated with the loss of Honey Buzzard young, but predation was higher in territories closer to breeding pairs of Goshawks at both study sites. Although Honey Buzzards are restricted to nesting in forests, their choice of nest-site therefore appears to be largely dictated by the distribution of predators. Studies of habitat association may yield misleading results if the effects of predation risk on distribution are not considered.","[Gamauf, Anita] Museum Nat Hist Vienna, Zool Dept 1, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Gamauf, Anita] Univ Vienna, Dept Integrat Zool, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Tebb, Graham] Univ Vet Med, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Nemeth, Erwin] Univ Vienna, Dept Behav Biol, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Nemeth, Erwin] BirdLife Austria, A-1070 Vienna, Austria","Gamauf, A (corresponding author), Museum Nat Hist Vienna, Zool Dept 1, Burgring 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",anita.gamauf@nhm-wien.ac.at,,"Nemeth, Erwin/0000-0001-9438-1411",Hochschuljubilaumsstiftung [H-1133/04]; Nationalparkplanung Donau Auen,"The study was funded by the Hochschuljubilaumsstiftung H-1133/04 and the Nationalparkplanung Donau Auen.

We studied the spatial distribution of avian microtine predators using data from 19 study areas on the tundra of northern Siberia. 2. Numbers of snowy owls, and long-tailed skuas and pomarine skuas depended strongly on Iemming density. However, a significant relationship between lemming density and number of rough-legged buzzards appeared first after removal of the effect of snowy owl abundance on the distribution of rough-legged buzzards. 3. We applied a recently developed method (Manly 1995) to examine co-occurrences of species and found that rough-legged buzzards and snowy owls did not co-occur while snowy owls, long-tailed skuas and pomarine skuas did. 4. There are large differences in nest construction and chick behaviour between rough-legged buzzards and the three other species. Moreover, the snow owl is a polyphagous predator preying also on large birds including raptor chicks. Therefore, we propose that reduced risk of nest predation favours rough-legged buzzards nesting away from snowy owls. 5. Variations in abundance of the two lemming species did not seem to influence the distributions of snowy owls and rough-legged buzzards. Neither was it likely that latitudinally related factors such as breeding season length affected the distribution of rough-legged buzzards.","Gothenburg Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Anim Ecol, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Lund, Dept Anim Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Wiklund, CG (corresponding author), Gothenburg Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Anim Ecol, Med Aregatan 18, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,"Wiklund, Christer G/0000-0003-3898-0289",,,,58,26,26,0,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Some animals gain information about nearby predators by eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls. Despite having well-developed ears, most lizards do not use vocal information for intraspecific communication, and few studies have shown practical use of the ears in wild lizards. Here, we show that the Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana (Oplurus cuvieri cuvieri) obtains auditory signals for predator detection. The Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana and the Madagascar paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone mutata) are syntopic inhabitants of the Ampijoroa dry deciduous forest of Madagascar. The iguana and the flycatcher have neither a predator-prey relationship nor resource competition, but they have shared predators such as raptors and snakes. Using playback experiments, we demonstrated that the iguana discriminates mobbing alarm calls of the flycatcher from its songs and then enhances its vigilance behaviour. Our results demonstrate the occurrence of an asymmetrical ecological relationship between the Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana and the paradise flycatcher through eavesdropping on information about the presence of predators. This implies that indirect interspecific interactions through information recognition may be more common than generally thought in an animal community.","[Ito, Ryo; Mori, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Ito, R (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",r.ito@ethol.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Yang, Ruizhe/G-5801-2011",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Global COE ProgramMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A06]","The original idea for this study was inspired during discussions with M.

We studied the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), an efficient predator, and wolverine (Gulo gulo), an opportunistic predator and scavenger, that coexist in the reindeer husbandry area in northern Sweden. Both species are major predators on semidomestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), but wolverines frequently scavenge ungulate carcasses. We examined the composition and use of food resources by wolverines and in particular the relative importance of lynx-killed reindeer in wolverine diet. We also examined the influence of wolverine scavenging on lynx kill rate. We found that 52% of carcasses visited by wolverines were lynx-killed reindeer, but only 11% were wolverine-killed reindeer. Of all wolverine locations at carcasses, 28% were on lynx-killed and 24% on wolverine-killed reindeer. Remaining locations were mainly on reindeer that died from accidents (23%) or were killed by unknown carnivores (9%). Lynx predation rate on reindeer was nine times higher than that of wolverines. Wolverines scavenged 68% of available lynx-killed reindeer, 29% of which were still being used by lynx at wolverine arrival. Still, wolverine scavenging had a limited influence on lynx kill rate. Time to next kill decreased only when the lynx kill was an adult reindeer in forest; however, most lynx-killed reindeer were found on tundra. Wolverines appear to benefit from coexistence with lynx through increased scavenging opportunities. We suspect that lynx presence reduces wolverine predation on reindeer due to increased scavenging opportunities. These results may have important implications for carnivore management in reindeer husbandry areas.","[Mattisson, Jenny; Andren, Henrik; Persson, Jens; Segerstrom, Peter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Dept Ecol, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden","Mattisson, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway.",jenny.mattisson@nina.no,"Andren, Henrik/C-8995-2015; Mattisson, Jenny/X-4750-2019","Mattisson, Jenny/0000-0001-6032-5307; Persson, Jens/0000-0003-1405-7561; Andren, Henrik/0000-0002-5616-2426","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management; World Wide Fund for Nature (Sweden); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)Swedish Research Council Formas; private foundations Olle och Signhild Engkvists Stiftelser and Marie-Claire Cronstedts Stiftelse","We thank Geir Rune Rauset, Gustaf Samelius, Einar Segerstrom, and Hakan Falk for their contribution to data collection in the field.

Partitioning of space and time can reduce competition by decreasing the frequency of interspecific encounters that exploit a common resource base. We investigated temporal and spatial partitioning of tigers (Panthers tigris), leopards (Panthera pardus), dholes (Cuon alpinus), and their ungulate prey in Thung Yai Naresuan (East) Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand from April 2010 to January 2012. We collected camera trap data from 106 locations over 1,817 trap nights. Kernel density estimation and Spearnian's rank correlation were used to quantify temporal and spatial activity patterns. Pianka's index was used to investigate the temporal and spatial overlap for each species pair. Tigers (crepuscular activity pattern) showed no temporal correlation with leopards (mostly diurnal) or dholes (strongly diurnal), but leopard activity appeared to correlate positively with dhole activity. Tigers exhibited temporal overlap with larger gaur (Bos gaurus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor); leopards did so with barking deer (Muntiacus munqak) and wild boar (Sus scrota); and dholes did so with barking deer and wild boar. The spatial correlations of tigers, leopards, and dholes did not significantly overlap, though numerically overlap was higher between felids than with the canid. None of the three predators significantly correlated with prey distribution, except for dholes with sambar. Our findings suggest that tigers, leopards, and dholes co-occur with spatial and temporal partitioning due to differences in prey activity and low overlap in space use correlated to prey preference. The partition in space and time between tigers and leopards can minimise their competition-associated prey activity, while leopards and dholes seem to be more generalist and not spatially correlated with each other.","[Vinitpornsawan, Supagit; Fuller, Todd K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Vinitpornsawan, Supagit] Wildlife Conservat Off, Natl Pk Wildlife & Plant Conservat Dept, 61 Paholyathin Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand","Fuller, TK (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",tkfuller@eco.umass.edu,,,"Wildlife Conservation Society; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Rhino-Tiger Conservation Fund; Thailand Wildlife Research Division, Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation","We acknowledge the Wildlife Conservation Society; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Rhino-Tiger Conservation Fund; and the Thailand Wildlife Research Division, Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation for supporting this work.

In 1971-1989, the vendace stock was strong and exhibited a two-year cycle. In 1990-1999, extreme weather conditions and predation resulted in recruitment failures, after which overfishing kept year-classes small. From 2000 onwards, the two-year oscillations were re-established at a lower level. Here, we show that the two-year cyclicity prevalent in the 1980s was consistent with the hypothesis of asymmetric competition between adults and juveniles. Food consumption by juveniles of strong year-classes retarded growth and weakened condition of the co-occurring adults, resulting in less abundant year-classes. In 2000-2018, the role of intraspecific competition diminished due to interspecific competition from increased populations of other planktivorous fish, preventing vendace from attaining higher abundance. Elevated temperature probably confounded the effects of competition, but its direct role was masked by simultaneous gradual eutrophication and fish assemblage changes.","[Sarvala, Jouko] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Helminen, Harri] Luostarinkatu 3, FI-20700 Turku, Finland","Sarvala, J (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",jouko.sarvala@utu.fi,,,"Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [09/109, 09/074, 1071004]; Foundation for the Study of Natural Resources in Finland; Lake Pyhajarvi Fisheries Management Association; Water Protection Association for SW Finland; Lake Pyhajarvi Collaborative Task Force; municipality of Sakyla; Department of Biology, University of Turku","This work was funded mainly by grants from the Academy of Finland to JS (09/109, 09/074, 1071004).

Sulfur, predatory mites, and powdery mildew have long been studied separately regarding their impacts on spider mites, but knowledge of their combined influence in that context is also needed to aid integrated pest and disease management. Therefore, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments to study the main and the interaction effects of sulfur, P. persimilis, P. aphanis, and T. urticae in strawberry leaf disc bioassays. The results showed that the predatory mite, powdery mildew, and sulfur had additive effects on reducing egg number and population growth of T. urticae. Compared to the control, populations of T. urticae on the leaf discs were decreased by 83%, 76%, and 61% after 5 days of treatment with sulfur + powdery mildew + predatory mites, mildew + predatory mites, and predatory mites alone, respectively. The survival and egg production of T. urticae females was affected to the greatest extent by P. persimilis, followed by powdery mildew. Residual sulfur had a short-term suppressive effect on T. urticae egg production but did not influence survival and reproduction of P. persimilis. If these findings also apply under field conditions, controlling powdery mildew will not reduce the need for spider mite control in strawberry, as has been suggested for other fruit crops.

Interspecific diversity among Pacific salmon species (Oncorhynchus spp.) creates staggered spawning events across space and time, thereby prolonging availability to terrestrial wildlife. We sought to understand how such variation might influence consumption by terrestrial predators compared with resource abundance and intra- and interspecific competition. Using stable isotope analysis, we investigated how the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of male black bears (Ursus americanus; n = 405) varies with species diversity and density of spawning salmon biomass, while also accounting for competition with sympatric black and grizzly bears (U. arctos horribilis), in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We found that the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of black bears was approximate to 40% higher in the absence of grizzly bears, but detected little effect of relative black bear density and salmon biomass density. Rather, salmon diversity had the largest positive effect on consumption. On average, increasing diversity from one salmon species to similar to four (with equal biomass contributions) approximately triples the proportion of salmon in diet. Given the importance of salmon to bear life histories, this work provides early empirical support for how resource waves may increase the productivity of consumers at population and landscape scales. Accordingly, terrestrial wildlife management might consider maintaining not only salmon abundance but also diversity.","[Service, Christina N.; Bateman, Andrew W.; Adams, Megan S.; Artelle, Kyle A.; Paquet, Paul C.; Darimont, Chris T.] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Service, Christina N.; Adams, Megan S.; Artelle, Kyle A.; Darimont, Chris T.] Hakai Inst, Heriot Bay, BC, Canada; [Service, Christina N.; Adams, Megan S.; Artelle, Kyle A.; Paquet, Paul C.; Darimont, Chris T.] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC, Canada; [Service, Christina N.] Spirit Bear Res Fdn, Klemtu, BC, Canada; [Bateman, Andrew W.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Bateman, Andrew W.] Salmon Coast Field Stn, Echo Bay, BC, Canada; [Artelle, Kyle A.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Reimchen, Thomas E.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada","Service, CN (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada.; Service, CN (corresponding author), Hakai Inst, Heriot Bay, BC, Canada.; Service, CN (corresponding author), Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC, Canada.; Service, CN (corresponding author), Spirit Bear Res Fdn, Klemtu, BC, Canada.",christina.service@gmail.com,"Adams, Megan S/AAV-8907-2020","Adams, Megan S/0000-0003-3586-774X; Service, Christina/0000-0001-7448-7251; Artelle, Kyle/0000-0002-8399-5693",Raincoast Conservation Foundation; Spirit Bear Research Foundation; Willow Grove Foundation; Tides Canada; Nature Conservancy; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Vanier FellowshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Mitacs Accelerate Fellowship; NSERC Industrial Postgraduate ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC postdoctoral fellowshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Killam postdoctoral fellowship; NSERC Vanier Fellowship; Tula Foundation; NSERC Operating GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [NRC 2354]; Wilburforce Foundation; Raincoast Research Chair; NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [435683],"We are thankful for collaborations with the Haitzaqv, Kitasoo/Xai'xais, Nuxalk, and Wuikinuxv First Nations.

I studied prey type and predator size-prey size relationships of these snakes in four swamp-forest areas of southeastern Nigeria (West Africa): only N. fuliginoides was found in two of these areas, whereas both species were common in the other two areas. The feeding ecology of N. fuliginoides shifted greatly in the presence of its potential competitor, N. variegata, in terms of prey-type preferences and predatory behaviour as well as in terms of predator size-prey size relationships. In particular, the effects of the potential competitor on the feeding ecology of N. fuliginoides were (i) a shift toward eating many invertebrates from a diet based on many small vertebrates, (ii) a shift toward eating many terrestrial organisms from a diet based on many aquatic organisms, and (iii) a shift in mean prey size for females toward relatively larger prey from a diet based on smaller prey. The resulting effect was a clear partitioning of food resources between the two predator species in both the areas where they are sympatric, whereas N. fuliginoides had a wider dietary spectrum (covering that of the two species together) in the areas where its competitor is not found. The role of intraspecific competition seems less strong, as no apparent resource partitioning in prey type or prey size was observed between males and females of either species or in any study area. However, mean prey size was significantly greater for females than for males of both species and in all study areas, but depended on the significant reverse sexual size dimorphism observed in both species.","Italian Fdn Vertebrate Zool Ecol, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Inst Environm Studies Demetra, I-00139 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Italian Fdn Vertebrate Zool Ecol, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,39,29,30,0,7,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

The predator effects may vary with diet specialisation, the associated risk posed to prey and, if multiple predators are present, the predator-predator interactions. We examined the spatiotemporal distribution of the herbivorous spider mite Tetranychus urticae and the associated specialist and generalist predators Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus on bean plants. Tetranychus urticae is a key pest on numerous agricultural crops. Both predators are used singly and in combination for biological control of spider mites. Population development and within-plant distribution of the spider mites and the predators were compared among five treatments: T. urticae without predators, with either predator alone and with both predators in combination at full and half densities. The spider mites were suppressed to zero density in both predator combination treatments but not in the single predator treatments. The predators determined the spatiotemporal distribution of the spider mites through density- and behaviour-mediated effects, and these effects were linked to diet specialisation. The specialist P. persimilis exerted stronger density-mediated effects on the spider mite distribution than did the generalist N. californicus. Either predator induced in the spider mites early upward migration on plants. The predators also affected each other's distribution. The aggregation level of N. californicus was lowered by P. persimilis but not vice versa.

The species was first detected in the northeastern United States in 1998 and has rapidly spread throughout much of eastern North America. in addition to used tire casings, Oc. j. japonicus develops in a wide variety of artificial and natural container habitats, especially rock pools along stream beds. In an effort to evaluate the invasion success and impact of Oc. j. japonicus on populations of native container dwelling species, waste tire disposal sites and natural rock pool habitats were sampled for mosquito larvae throughout Connecticut in 2005, and data were compared with results from prior surveys made in 1987 and 1999. Oc. j. japonicus was the predominant species collected at the waste tire disposal sites regardless of surrounding landscape features, accounting for 55.9% of all larvae. A comparison with collections from prior surveys revealed a 90% reduction in the relative abundance of larval populations of Oc. triseriatus (Say) and significant reductions among larval populations of Oc. atropalpus (Coquillett) and Culex restuans Theobald. Oc. j. japonicus was also the most abundant mosquito collected in rock pool habitats, accounting for nearly 80% of all collected larvae, except where water temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C. This was concomitant with significant declines in the relative abundance of Oc. atropalpus and Cx. restuans. We conclude that Oc. j. japonicus is a potentially effective competitor in rock pool and tire environments and may be responsible for reducing populations of several native species occupying these habitats through interspecific competition for limited resources. The exclusion of Oc. j. japonicus from warm water pools further suggests that a temperature barrier may exist for Oc. j. japonicus and that populations may not be able to colonize southern regions of the United States with relatively high summer temperatures.","[Andreadis, Theodore G.; Wolfe, Boger J.] Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, New Haven, CT 06504 USA","Andreadis, TG (corresponding author), Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, 123 Huntington St,POB 1106, New Haven, CT 06504 USA.",theodore.andreadis@ct.gov,,,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [U50/CCU6806-01-1, 58-6615-1-218]; USDA-administered Hatch [CONH00768]","We wish to acknowledge John Shepard and Michael Thomas; The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, for assistance in establishing collections sites and in collecting, processing and identifying mosquitoes; and Christopher Samorajczyk, CT Department of Environmental Protection for assistance in field collections.

Alternatively, they may represent the end product of historical processes acting over long time frames (fundamental niche partitioning). Niche partitioning is often detected by analysing patterns of resource use within communities, but experiments are rarely conducted to test whether patterns of non-overlapping resource use reflect realized or fundamental niche partitioning. We studied a community of restio leafhoppers from the genus Cephalelus and their host plants, the Restionaceae (restios). We used network and experimental approaches to determine whether network modularity (a measure of niche partitioning within local communities) reflects fundamental or realized niche partitioning. Using a weighted modularity index for two party networks (e.g. insect-plant), we determined whether the network of this community is modular (i.e. consists of groups of species interacting strongly, with weak interactions between groups). We also aimed to identify specific Cephalelus - restio modules (groups). Using knowledge of module membership to design experiments, we tested whether Cephalelus species from two different modules, Cephalelusuncinatus and Cephaleluspickeri, prefer and perform better on restios from their own modules vs. restios from other modules. These experiments were performed under controlled conditions, eliminating the influences of competition and predation on host choices. The Cephalelus - restio community was modular, implying niche partitioning. Cephalelus also preferred and performed better on restios from their own modules in the absence of local contemporary factors. Most niche partitioning in the investigated Cephalelus community is not caused by local interactions, and thus, host use patterns represent fundamental niches. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding local community structure in the light of processes extrinsic to the local community context.","[Augustyn, Willem J.; Anderson, Bruce; Ellis, Allan G.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Augustyn, WJ; Ellis, AG (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",wjaugustyn@gmail.com; agettis@sun.ac.za,"Ellis, Allan/H-1105-2011","Ellis, Allan/0000-0001-6310-2870; Anderson, Bruce/0000-0002-7264-4505",NRF South African Biosystematics Initiative [74458]; Stellenbosch University,"We acknowledge Genevieve Theron, Andre Vermeulen and Caroli de Waal for field assistance and several anonymous reviewers for useful comments on the manuscript.

We estimated the population sizes of all species by using distance sampling. There was no effect of the year on the population sizes of all the species, but, when 5-year-period groups were analyzed, there were significant fluctuations over time intervals for at least some of the species. Generalized Linear Models on the interspecific relationships (either positive or negative) between pairs of species would suggest that interannual population size fluctuations of the various ungulates were likely attributable to fluctuations in poaching intensity, the influences of rainfall regimes (for at least three browser species), and negative density dependence.","[Hema, Emmanuel M.; Guenda, Wendengoudi] Univ Ouaga 1 Prof Joseph KI ZERBO CUPD, Lab Biol & Ecol Anim, 09 BP 848, Ouagadougou 09, Burkina Faso; [Hema, Emmanuel M.] GEGEBAO, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Ouedraogo, Boukare; Belemsogbo, Urbain] Off Natl Aires Protegees, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Di Vittorio, Massimiliano; Petrozzi, Fabio] Ecol Applicata Italia Srl, Palermo, Italy; [Hema, Emmanuel M.; Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] IDECC, via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Luiselli, Luca] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, Niger Delta Ecol & Biodivers Conservat Unit, PMB 5080 Nkpolu, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), IDECC, via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy.; Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, Niger Delta Ecol & Biodivers Conservat Unit, PMB 5080 Nkpolu, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.",l.luiselli@ideccngo.org,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020; Dendi, Daniele/AAO-8569-2020","Dendi, Daniele/0000-0003-1417-9091",NGR authorities; Office National des Aires Protegees (OFINAP),"We thank NGR authorities and the Office National des Aires Protegees (OFINAP) for supporting the long-term field surveys, and two anonymous referees for having greatly improved the submitted draft.",,59,1,1,0,9,SOC NATL PROTECTION NATURE ACCLIMATATION FRANCE,PARIS 5,"57 RUE CUVIER, 75005 PARIS 5, FRANCE",0249-7395,,,REV ECOL-TERRE VIE,Rev.

The vehicle of analysis was the construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or interaction chains, since little information was available on other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response, environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong) interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web species richness. Less expected, when these measures were adjusted to a per species basis, positive relationships with species richness were still observed for all measures but the number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity, each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect, including the seven previously identified types. Many of the 76 additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if the original definitions of these ''classic'' types were expanded to include interactions having similar effects but differing in the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference competition and inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect, termed ''apparent predation'' and ''indirect defense'' were also identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these, keystone predation (35%) and apparent competition (25%) were most common and exploitation competition (2.8%) was least common in these webs. Two methods of analysis suggested that indirect effects accounted for approximate to 40% of the change in community structure resulting from manipulations, with a range of 24-61%. The proportion of change due to indirect effects was constant with web species richness, indicating that strong direct interactions and indirect effects produce roughly the same level of alteration of community structure regardless of the lever of web complexity. Several potential artifacts and biases were evaluated. Most importantly, neither variation in level of taxonomic resolution nor intensity of experimentation varied significantly with web size (species richness). Despite a bias toward manipulation of consumers over manipulation of basal species, some predator-initiated indirect effect types were scarce while some basal species-initiated types were common. While the frequency of exploitation competition may have been underestimated, it is unlikely that the frequency of this indirect effect would change dramatically: changes due to this effect should have been detected in many of the studies and reported: and the most intensively studied individual webs did not report frequencies differing much from the average. This analysis suggests investigators effectively identified and first manipulated those species responsible for most indirect effects and that more experiments added decreasing numbers of indirect effects. Moreover, the frequencies and importance of indirect effects may be more predictable than expected on the basis of theory.",,"MENGE, BA (corresponding author), OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA.",,"Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012",,,,,146,576,595,2,279,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

To examine how non-native brook trout may affect threatened juvenile Chinook salmon, we compared feeding behaviours and aggressive encounters between these sympatric fish in Summit Creek, Idaho. Snorkelers observed 278 focal fish and examined diets from 27 fish in late summer 2003. Differences in feeding behaviours and diets suggest that there was minimal current competition for prey, although individual Chinook feeding activity declined as their encounter rate with other fish increased. While difference in size between fish generally determined the outcome of encounters (larger fish 'winning'), it was surprising that in some interspecific encounters aggressive Chinook displaced slightly larger brook trout (< 20 mm longer). We suggest that in late summer, frequent intraspecific interactions may be more important than interspecific interactions in potentially limiting Chinook growth in Summit Creek and perhaps in other oligotrophic streams where they co-occur.","[Macneale, K.

This study investigated the interaction between egos of the lizard Mabuya longicaudata Hallowell and two species of ant: a lizard egg commensalist (Paratrechina longicornis Latreille), and an egg predator (Pheidole taivanensis Forel). The ecological interaction between P. longicornis and lizard eggs was tested, and it was predicted that when the interaction was removed, lizard eggs would be attacked by P. taivanensis. 2. Field observations showed that both ant species actively searched for lizard eggs, and that P taivanensis typically found new lizard nests earlier than P. longicornis did. Left undisturbed, P taivanensis predation dramatically reduced lizard egg survival. While P. longicornis usually found nests later, they were able to displace P taivanensis. As a result, proportional egg survival was higher in nests with P. longicornis (0.95 +/- 0.04 eggs) compared to nests without either ant species (0.65 +/- 0.09 eggs), or nests occupied by P. taivanensis (0.07 +/- 0.02 eggs). 3. When P. longicornis ants were experimentally excluded from lizard nests, the proportion of eggs surviving significantly decreased because of increased P. taivallensis predation. Paratrechina longicornis benefits from water that condenses on the eggs. When this resource disappears P. longicornis abandons the nest, leading to predation of the eggs by P. taivanensis.","[Huang, Wen-San] Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, 1 Kuan Chien Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan; [Huang, Wen-San] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA","Huang, WS (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, 1 Kuan Chien Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",wshuang@mail.nmns.edu.tw,,"Huang, Wen-San/0000-0003-0073-3557",,,,15,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

These changes may affect discontiguous trophic levels via adjacent trophic levels. The invasion of an exotic host species may provide the opportunity to observe the dynamics of changing interspecific interactions among parasitoids belonging to different trophic levels. The exotic large white butterfly Pieris brassicae invaded Hokkaido Island, Japan, and quickly spread throughout the island. Prior to the invasion, the small white butterfly P. rapae was the host of the primary parasitoid Cotesia glomerata, on which both the larval hyperparasitoid Baryscapus galactopus and the pupal hyperparasitoid Trichomalopsis apanteroctena depended. At the time of the invasion, C. glomerata generally laid eggs exclusively in P. rapae. During the five years following the invasion, however, the clutch size of C. glomerata in P. rapae gradually decreased, whereas the clutch size in P. brassicae increased. The field results corresponded well with laboratory experiments showing an increase in the rate of parasitism in P. brassicae. The host expansion of C. glomerata provided the two hyperparasitoids with an opportunity to choose between alternative hosts, that is, C. glomerata within P. brassicae and C. glomerata within P. rapae. Indeed, the pupal hyperparasitoid T. apanteroctena shifted its preference gradually to C. glomerata in P. brassicae, whereas the larval hyperparasitoid B. galactopus maintained a preference for C. glomerata in P. rapae. These changes in host preference may result from differential suitability of the two host types. The larval hyperparasitoid preferred C. glomerata within P. rapae to C. glomerata within P. brassicae, presumably because P. brassicae larvae attacked aggressively, thereby hindering the parasitization, whereas the pupal hyperparasitoid could take advantage of the competition-free resource by shifting its host preference. Consequently, the invasion of P. brassicae has changed the host use of the primary parasitoid C. glomerata and the pupal hyperparasitoid T. apanteroctena within a very short time.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Tanaka, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",sing@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp; nishida@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp; ohsaki@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,49,25,27,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,AUG,2007,61,8,,,,,1791,1802,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00165.x,,,12,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,198AV,WOS:000248600300001,17683423,Bronze,,,2021-09-23,

Using a large-scale field manipulation, we monitored changes in small mammals, plants, and vertebrate predators. We documented important top-down predation effects on some small-mammal species, and small-mammal effects on some plant species resulting from experimental exclusions. However, periodic El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events caused several high rainfall episodes during this interval, resulting in large bottom-up increases in both plants and animals. Therefore, we suggest that instead of exclusive top-down or bottom-up control, this system undergoes shifting control, with relatively greater importance of biotic interactions in wet years and of resource limitation in dry ones. Because intervals between ENSO events are long and responses are slow, long-term studies are essential for understanding such effects in semiarid or and systems.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat, Davis, CA 95696 USA; Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Natl Pk Serv, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile","Meserve, PL (corresponding author), No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",pmeserve@niu.edu,"Bond, Alexander L/A-3786-2010",,,,,64,201,213,1,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0006-3568,1525-3244,,BIOSCIENCE,Bioscience,JUL,2003,53,7,,,,,633,646,,10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0633:TYOSTA]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,699XT,WOS:000184082900008,,Bronze,,,2021-09-23,

Studies of zonation often focus on invertebrate macrofauna in the sub or inter-tidal regions; rarely has zonation of small mammal communities been considered in dunes. In this study we use 10 years of mammal trapping data and show that a diverse small mammal community was present within a coastal dune system. Nine species were captured within the dune, only one of which was introduced. The invasive house mouse was limited to a narrow band above the beach/dune interface, while the native small mammal assemblage dominated in the rest of the dune field. This clear zonation may result from habitat preference, interspecific competition, predation, species-specific predator risk tolerances, marine or beach subsidies or a combination of these influences. We demonstrate the conservation value of dune systems and highlight the presence of zonation within a mobile small mammal community.","[Rendall, Anthony R.; Cooke, Raylene; White, John G.; Weston, Michael A.] Deakin Univ Geelong, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood Campus, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Weston, MA (corresponding author), Deakin Univ Geelong, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood Campus, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",mweston@deakin.edu.au,,"Rendall, Anthony/0000-0002-7286-9288; White, John/0000-0002-7375-5944; Weston, Michael/0000-0002-8717-0410; Cooke, Raylene/0000-0002-8843-7113",,,,38,3,3,0,11,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0272-7714,1096-0015,,ESTUAR COAST SHELF S,Estuar.

A key challenge is to understand variation in species interactions along environmental gradients. Thestress gradient hypothesisposits that positive interactions increase and competitive interactions decrease with increasing consumer pressure or environmental stress. This hypothesis has received extensive attention in plant community ecology, but only a handful of tests in animals. Furthermore, few empirical studies have examined multiple co-occurring stressors. Here we test predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis using the occurrence of mixed-species groups in six common grazing ungulate species within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. We use mixed-species groups as a proxy for potential positive interactions because they may enhance protection from predators or increase access to high-quality forage. Alternatively, competition for resources may limit the formation of mixed-species groups. Using more than 115,000 camera trap observations collected over 5 yr, we found that mixed-species groups were more likely to occur in risky areas (i.e., areas closer to lion vantage points and in woodland habitat where lions hunt preferentially) and during time periods when resource levels were high. These results are consistent with the interpretation that stress from high predation risk may contribute to the formation of mixed-species groups, but that competition for resources may prevent their formation when food availability is low. Our results are consistent with support for the stress gradient hypothesis in animals along a consumer pressure gradient while identifying the potential influence of a co-occurring stressor, thus providing a link between research in plant community ecology on the stress gradient hypothesis, and research in animal ecology on trade-offs between foraging and risk in landscapes of fear.","[Beaudrot, Lydia] Rice Univ, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, BioSci Dept, W100 George R Brown Hall,6100 Main St,MS-140, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Palmer, Meredith S.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Anderson, T.

However, these behavioral interactions within (intraspecific) and between (interspecific) species are costly as they can be energetically expensive and cause injury or death. To avoid these agonistic interactions, numerous species alter their behaviors and resource requirements. Spatial variation in nest site competition allows for investigation of concurrent variation in territorial defense behavior. Further, among species with bi-parental nest defense, behavioral similarity in territorial defense may benefit pairs. Here, we studied territorial aggression between two eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) populations (North Carolina and Alabama, USA) that differ in avian community structure; those in North Carolina have recently begun to experience strong interspecific competition for nesting cavities by tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a competitive pressure that is relatively new for North Carolina bluebirds (similar to 35-40 years) and is absent in Alabama populations. We found that bluebirds in North Carolina are more aggressive to simulated territorial intrusions compared to their Alabama counterparts. Behavioral similarity (here, in aggression) between partners is strong and similar in both populations. These results suggest that bluebirds in North Carolina may have to maintain higher baseline aggression during territory establishment and nest construction to co-occur with highly aggressive tree swallows, but that, in both populations, behavioral similarity between partners may be adaptive. Finally, we acknowledge the preliminary nature of this study and the need for expanding the behavioral studies to other sites in the southeastern United States. Greater regional coverage would exclude the possibility of alternative drivers of the observed behavioral differences between the North Carolina and Alabama populations.","[Albers, Alexandria N.; Jones, John Anthony; Siefferman, Lynn] Appalachian State Univ, Biol Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Jones, John Anthony] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Siefferman, L (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Biol Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",sieffermanlm@appstate.edu,,"Jones, John/0000-0003-2615-1248","Appalachian State University, Office of Student Research","We thank Wendy Hood for logistical assistance at the Alabama population.

Such species are expected to display community drift dynamics analogous to neutral alleles undergoing genetic drift. While entire communities of species are not ecologically equivalent, recent field experiments have documented the existence of guilds of such neutral species embedded in real food webs. What demographic outcomes of the interactions within and between species in these guilds are expected to produce ecological drift versus coexistence remains unclear. To address this issue, and guide empirical testing, we consider models of a guild of ecologically equivalent competitors feeding on a single resource to explore when community drift should manifest. We show that community drift dynamics only emerge when the density-dependent effects of each species on itself are identical to its density-dependent effects on every other guild member. In contrast, if each guild member directly limits itself more than it limits the abundance of other guild members, all species in the guild are coexisting, even though they all are ecologically equivalent with respect to their interactions with species outside the guild (i.e. resources, predators, mutualists). Hence, considering only interspecific ecological differences generating density dependence, and not fully accounting for the preponderance of mechanisms causing intraspecific density dependence, will provide an incomplete picture for segregating between neutrality and coexistence. We also identify critical experiments necessary to disentangle guilds of ecologically equivalent species from those experiencing ecological drift, as well as provide an overview of ways of incorporating a mechanistic basis into studies of species coexistence and neutrality. Identifying these characteristics, and the mechanistic basis underlying community structure, is not merely an exercise in clarifying the semantics of coexistence and neutral theories, but rather reflects key differences that must exist among community members in order to determine how and why communities are structured.","[McPeek, Mark A.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",mark.mcpeek@dartmouth.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021","McPeek, Mark/0000-0001-7794-9466",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1748945],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1748945",,71,8,8,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Scincid lizards use both chemosensory and visual cues in tasks such as mate location, shelter-site selection, and predator evasion. Published literature has focused primarily on the use of chemosensory information by these lizards, but our experiments reveal an alternative scenario. Water skinks (Eulamprus heatwolei) are sympatric with larger black rock skinks (Egernia saxatilis) in southeastern Australia, and use similar long-term retreat-sites. However, Eulamprus avoid shelter-sites occupied by Egernia because of the risk of attack and injury. We conducted laboratory trials to clarify the kinds of information used by Eulamprus to avoid already-occupied shelters. In the field, shelter-sites might provide three types of information about prior occupancy: either scent deposited by a previously present Egernia; evidence of the current presence of an Egernia, perhaps involving visual, chemical, and/or auditory information; or a direct behavioural interaction with a resident lizard (potentially involving an attack). In our trials, Eulamprus based their shelter-site avoidance only on direct interactions. Thus, Eulamprus reacted strongly to Egernia with which they were able to interact physically, but not to either Egernia scent deposits, or a (caged) Egernia with which they could not physically interact. The behaviour of the resident was critical, in that Eulamprus fled from the crevice in response to bites, movements, or open-mouth displays by the resident Egernia. We suggest that Eulamprus base their shelter-site choices on the presence of an actual resident animal rather than more indirect cues (such as scent), because only a direct encounter provides reliable information about the magnitude of threat associated with crevice occupancy.","Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Langkilde, T (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",langkild@bio.usyd.edu.au; rshine@mail.usyd.edu.au,"Langkilde, Tracy/L-8696-2017; Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008","Langkilde, Tracy/0000-0001-7014-2432; ",,,,34,13,14,0,12,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,FEB,2005,142,,2,,,,203,216,,10.1163/1568539053627659,,,14,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,925TE,WOS:000229075400005,,,,,2021-09-23,

The recent expansion of the pine marten into the intensively cultivated plain of the River Po (NW Italy), where previously only stone marten occurred, offered an interesting opportunity to analyse their relationships. We studied the distribution and diet of Martes species and trophic niche overlap between martens and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in two study areas, each with two pseudoreplicates, by analysing genotyped faeces. Our results seem to confirm the displacement of the stone marten from one study area, the pine marten being the only Martes species occurring where previously the stone marten had been reported. We found a large food niche overlap between red fox and both stone and pine martens, but with evidence of size-related differences in the consumption of some food items. We hypothesised that, due to the poor prey-base of the environment, highly altered by intensive crop cultivation, intense interspecific competition originally occurred between the red fox and stone marten. The heightening of interspecific competition caused by the entry of the pine marten in the predator guild may have caused the displacement of the stone marten, at least temporarily. The mechanism of such displacement needs to be clarified through further surveys in areas where the three species occur sympatrically.","[Remonti, Luigi; Balestrieri, Alessandro; Capelli, Enrica; Prigioni, Claudio] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz; Gomez-Moliner, Benjamin J.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Zool & Anim Cell Biol, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz; Gomez-Moliner, Benjamin J.] Univ Basque Country, CIEA Lucio Lascaray Ctr Res & Adv Studies, Systemat Biogeog & Populat Dynam Res Grp, Vitoria 01006, Spain","Remonti, L (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Taramelli 24, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",luigi.remonti@gmail.com; alebls@libero.it; aritz.ruiz@ehu.es; benjamin.gomez@ehu.es; capelli@unipv.it; prigioni@unipv.it,"GONZALEZ, ARITZ RUIZ/P-3384-2019; Gomez, Benjamin/AAA-4119-2019","GONZALEZ, ARITZ RUIZ/0000-0001-7409-4634; GOMEZ MOLINER, BENJAMIN JUAN/0000-0002-3054-8806","River Po Park (Vercelli province); River Po Park (Alessandria province); Basque Government through the Research group on Systematics, Biogeography and Population Dynamics [IT317-10, GIC10/76]; Dept. of Education Universities and Research of the Basque Government [BFI09.396]","This study has been partially supported by the River Po Park (Vercelli and Alessandria provinces) and by the Basque Government through the Research group on Systematics, Biogeography and Population Dynamics (Ref.

Several cases emphasize the fact that chemical signals or defence may modulate interspecific interactions. Notably, it has been shown that diatoms, unicellular algae and key primary producers in aquatic ecosystems produce a wide range of bioactive metabolites. Among these compounds, polyunsaturated short-chain aldehydes in vitro strongly impair the reproduction of various potential grazers. In the field, the relationship between aldehyde production and reproductive failure in copepods remains unclear. Recent studies have suggested that these putative defence compounds may also be involved in intercellular communication and in interactions with competitors. Potential effects of the aldehyde precursors on various organisms have also been described. This review presents an overview of various results obtained in the last decade that could help us to understand the role of polyunsaturated aldehydes and their precursors in the ecology of diatoms. It is focused on the dichotomy between freshwater and marine environments. Indeed, most of the results on anti-proliferative aldehydes concern marine planktonic diatoms, whereas they are also known to be produced by benthic and freshwater species.","[Leflaive, Josephine; Ten-Hage, Loic] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, UMR 5245, Lab Ecol Fonct EcoLab,INPT, F-31062 Toulouse 09, France","Leflaive, J (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, UMR 5245, Lab Ecol Fonct EcoLab,INPT, Bat 4R3,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 09, France.",leflaive@cict.fr,"Ten-Hage, Loic/T-2789-2019; Leflaive, Josephine/F-2075-2018","Leflaive, Josephine/0000-0003-3605-349X",,,,103,56,58,2,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,,2009,184,4,,,,,794,805,,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03033.x,,,12,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,517UP,WOS:000271644500007,19754636,Bronze,,,2021-09-23,

Here, we explore the premise that dense established populations of the invasive spinycheek crayfish slowed round goby colonization of the St. Lawrence River. We performed a series of videotaped laboratory experiments to determine if round gobies suffer from aggressive attacks or alter their behaviour (e.g. use of shelter and movement) in the presence of spinycheek crayfish. We also assessed the prolonged effects of food and shelter competition by comparing changes in the submerged mass of juvenile round gobies and spinycheek crayfish in conspecific and heterospecific pairs. Contrary to our predictions, round gobies more frequently initiated aggressive encounters with spinycheek crayfish, whereas the crayfish were more likely to flee or be evicted from their shelters. Furthermore, round gobies gained more body mass than spinycheek crayfish, regardless of conspecific or heterospecific pairing. Rather than impeding round goby colonization, spinycheek crayfish appear more likely to suffer energetic costs and an increased exposure to predation in the presence of round gobies.","[Church, Kathleen] Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Iacarella, Josephine C.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada","Ricciardi, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada.",tony.ricciardi@mcgill.ca,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN),"The authors are grateful to N.

We studied the activity patterns and strategies of the Siberian jerboa (Orientallactaga sibirica) in the Alxa desert region to better understand the habitats and behavioural ecology of xeric rodents. We conducted an experiment using three plots to monitor the duration, time, and frequency of the active period of the Siberian jerboa using infrared cameras in the Alxa field workstation, Inner Mongolia, China in 2017. The relationships between the activity time and frequency, biological factors (perceived predation risk, food resources, and species composition), and abiotic factors (temperature, air moisture, wind speed) were analysed using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Our results showed that: (1) relative humidity mainly affected activities in the springtime; temperature, relative humidity and interspecific competition mainly affected activities in the summertime; relative humidity and perceived predation risk mainly influenced activities in the autumn. (2) The activity pattern of the Siberian jerboa altered depending on the season. The activity of the Siberian jerboa was found to be bimodal in spring and summer, and was trimodal in autumn. The activity time and frequency in autumn were significantly lower than the spring. (3) Animals possess the ability to integrate disparate sources of information about danger to optimize energy gain. The jerboa adapted different responses to predation risks and competition in different seasons according to the demand for food resources.","[Ji, Yu; Yuan, Shuai; Fu, Heping; Yang, Suwen; Bu, Fan; Li, Xin; Wu, Xiaodong] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yu; Yuan, Shuai; Fu, Heping; Yang, Suwen; Bu, Fan; Li, Xin; Wu, Xiaodong] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Rodent Res Ctr, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yu; Yuan, Shuai; Fu, Heping; Yang, Suwen; Bu, Fan; Li, Xin; Wu, Xiaodong] Minist Educ, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Fu, Heping] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hohhot, Peoples R China","Fu, HP; Wu, XD (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China.; Fu, HP; Wu, XD (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Rodent Res Ctr, Hohhot, Peoples R China.; Fu, HP; Wu, XD (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Hohhot, Peoples R China.; Fu, HP (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hohhot, Peoples R China.",fuheping@126.com; wuxiaodong_hgb@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [32060256, 32060395, 31772667]; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [2018MS03014, 2019MS03012]; Key Project of the Education Department of Inner Mongolia [NJZZ17055]; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Grassland Resources","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 32060256, 32060395, 31772667], the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [grant numbers 2018MS03014, 2019MS03012], the Key Project of the Education Department of Inner Mongolia [grant number NJZZ17055], and the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Grassland Resources.

Previous studies have suggested that Enallagma damselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) invaded aquatic habitats with large dragonflies as the top predators at least twice, and large changes in morphological structures (e.g., caudal lamellae acid abdomen), which should increase swimming speed, are associated with these invasions. This is significant because these species swim away from attacking predators, whereas species in the ancestral habitat (habitats with fish as the top predators) do not swim from attacking predators. We quantified swimming speed over a large ontogenetic size range for larvae of seven Enallagma species, two in dragonfly lakes and five in fish lakes. Results of analysis of covariance and a modification of Felsenstein's method of evolutionary contrasts indicate that a large evolutionary increase in the slope of the ontogenetic relationship between swimming speed and log(e)(body length) is associated with invasions into dragonfly lakes, and this shift results in larvae of dragonfly-lake species being faster swimmers, especially in larger size classes, than larvae of fish-lake species. We also present experimental results demonstrating that damselflies with larger lamellae are faster swimmers and have higher survival when exposed to dragonfly predation. The results of this study indicate that the change in selective environment associated with habitat shifts into dragonfly lakes promoted adaptations for increased swimming speed in Enallagma lineages. The potential ramifications of this adaptation for community structure are discussed.","BUCKNELL UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LEWISBURG, PA 17837 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Three different populations of this species were sampled during the reproductive (July 2014) and non-reproductive (October 2014) periods to assess shell use patterns in the field by different demographic groups in absence of interspecific competition for shell-resource use. Irrespective of sampling sites and periods considered, sex ratios were female-biased (2.3 on average), and mean sizes of males were greater than those for females. At least shells from 31 different gastropods were used by C. erythropus in the Gulf of Cadiz. Shell selection was largely determined by the sizes of the hermit crab and shells. As result, a generalist pattern of shell use was displayed by this species. Most hermit crabs with shield length > 4.5 mm were males and the less abundant larger shells were occupied by these large males. Statistically significant sex-related (males vs. females) and size -related (small males vs. large males) differences in shell use were observed at two sampling sites with higher shell diversity, suggesting partial intraspecific partitioning of shell resource. There was a negative effect of carrying relatively heavy/large shells on the stage condition (males and females) and on clutch size of ovigerous females, suggesting that protection from predators was prioritised.","[Perez-Miguel, Marta; Cuesta, Jose A.; Manzano, Raquel; Drake, Pilar] ICMAN CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia, Ave Republ Saharaui 2, Cadiz 11519, Spain","Cuesta, JA (corresponding author), ICMAN CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia, Ave Republ Saharaui 2, Cadiz 11519, Spain.",jose.cuesta@icman.csic.es,"Cuesta, Jose A./A-1132-2008; Cuesta, Jose A./P-7142-2019; MANZANO, RAQUEL/AAB-1709-2020","Cuesta, Jose A./0000-0001-9482-2336; Cuesta, Jose A./0000-0001-9482-2336; MANZANO, RAQUEL/0000-0002-7477-8742",,,,40,3,4,0,25,CRUSTACEAN SOC,SAN ANTONIO,"840 EAST MULBERRY, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78212 USA",0278-0372,1937-240X,,J CRUSTACEAN BIOL,J.

This work aims primarily on effects of intraspecific interactions. Agonistic and unequally strong interactions among conspecifics should make the within-population distribution of individuals to be characterised by spatial avoidance of potentially risky conspecifics, according to the individual risks perceived. This process should affect individual performance and involve individual tradeoffs, as failing to adequately avoid risky conspecifics could incur unnecessary costs, while, at the same time, successful conspecific avoidance may reduce access to patches favourable for e.g. foraging or sheltering. Intraspecific agonistic behaviours, such as cannibalism and competition, are likely to have prominent effects in size-structured populations. It is therefore reasonable to assume spatial avoidance of intraspecific risks according to individuals' size relationships in such populations. With this field investigation I show that individuals of northern pike spatially avoid larger conspecifics. This avoidance creates a size-influenced and spatially clumped distribution pattern among pike individuals. At low pike densities, however, distances between individuals increase, allowing for an even distribution pattern to appear. The spatial distribution patterns among piscivore individuals should affect both the individual performance of predators and the potential for spatial antipredatory responses of their prey, and hence be a factor in consumer-resource interactions.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Nilsson, PA (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.nilssson@limnol.lu.se,"Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014","Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835",,,,38,44,44,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2006,113,2,,,,,251,258,,,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,044EO,WOS:000237655400006,,,,,2021-09-23,

I sampled vegetation and counted birds in 90 hayfields of various ages (i.e. number of years since planting) and sizes that were originally planted to a legume-dominated seed mixture. I also resampled a subset of these fields two years later. Over time, these hayfields changed from tall, dense, homogeneous stands of legume-dominated vegetation to short, sparse, patchy stands of grass-dominated vegetation. Fields of all ages were dominated by introduced plant species. Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), the most common bird species breeding in these fields, were most common in fields of intermediate ages, whereas numbers of Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), the second most abundant species, increased logarithmically with field age. Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and Henslow's Sparrows (A. henslowii) were most abundant in the oldest hayfields, whereas abundances of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis, the third most common species) did not differ in fields of different ages. Bird-species richness and diversity increased linearly with hayfield age. Three species (Red-winged Blackbird, Bobolink, Savannah Sparrow) accounted for more than 90% of the breeding individuals. Vegetation structure, composition, and patch size were the most important proximate correlates of habitat selection for these species. Hayfield size was positively correlated with abundance for five of the seven most common species. Furthermore, those species that nested late in the season (Bobolinks, Grasshopper Sparrows, and Henslow's Sparrows) had low breeding densities in fields with early mowing dates the previous year.","CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NAT RESOURCES, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA",,,,,,,,53,72,73,1,20,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,JUL,1995,112,3,,,,,720,730,,,,,11,Ornithology,Zoology,TZ356,WOS:A1995TZ35600015,,,,,2021-09-23,

Most studies examine relationships of newcomers with native species, but interactions among introduced species could also affect community shifts. As early ontogenetic stages are particularly vulnerable to biotic interactions, we explored direct and indirect interactions across early life-history stages in space-dominating marine invertebrates. We used introduced ascidians and both native and introduced mussels. To increase generality, we ran our experiments in 2 distant locations, one in the northern and one in the southern hemisphere (Mediterranean and South Africa). We found no sperm interference between the ascidians, nor were there interspecific effects on settlement or metamorphosis success. However, larvae of the ascidian species reacted to each other by shifting from aggregated to random settlement. Juvenile mussels consumed large numbers of ascidian larvae, though larvae that avoided mussel predation showed higher settlement success. Mussel species in the southern hemisphere locality (native Perna perna and introduced Mytilus galloprovincialis) consumed more ascidian larvae than mussels in the northern locality (native M. galloprovincialis), with a tendency for ascidian larvae to avoid settling close to mussels in the northern locality. We conclude that larval consumption by mussels affects the establishment of ascidians, but that the magnitude of this effect is context dependant. These results emphasize the importance of the composition of the receiving community in determining its susceptibility to invasion. Whether the species comprising this community are native or introduced is, however, less important than what manner of species they are.","[Ordonez, Victor; Pascual, Marta] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Genet, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Rius, Marc] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [McQuaid, Christopher D.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Pineda, M.

Current theory suggests that an increase in habitat generalist predators in response to landscape change is partially responsible for these declines. However, empirical tests have failed to reach a consensus on how and through what mechanisms landscape change affects nest predation. We tested one hypothesis, the Additive Predation Model, with an artificial nest experiment in fragmented landscapes in southern Queensland, Australia. We employed structural equation modelling of the influence of the relative density of woodland and habitat generalist predators and landscape features at the nest, site, patch and landscape scales on the probability of nest predation. We found little support for the Additive Predation Model, with no significant influence of the density of woodland predators on the probability of nest predation, although landscape features at different spatial scales were important. Within woodlands fragmented by agriculture in eastern Australia, the presence of noisy miner colonies appears to influence ecological processes important for nest predation such that the Additive Predation Model does not hold. In the absence of colonies of the aggressive native bird, the noisy miner, the influence of woodland predators on the risk of artificial nest predation was low compared with that of habitat generalist predators. Outside noisy miner colonies, we found significant edge effects with greater predation rates for artificial nests within woodland patches located closer to the agricultural matrix. Furthermore, the density of habitat generalist predators increased with the extent of irrigated land-use, suggesting that in the absence of noisy miner colonies, nest predation increases with land-use intensity at the landscape scale.","[Robertson, Oliver; Maron, Martine; McAlpine, Clive] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne; McAlpine, Clive] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [House, Alan] Ecosure, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Robertson, O (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia.",olyrobertson@gmail.com,"Maron, Martine/D-9699-2011; Buckley, Yvonne/B-1281-2008","Maron, Martine/0000-0002-5563-5789; Buckley, Yvonne/0000-0001-7599-3201; McAlpine, Clive/0000-0003-0457-8144","Cotton CRCAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Stuart Leslie Bird Research Award",These data were collected with permission from the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (reference no. 811108) and a scientific purposes (non-protected areas) permit (permit no.

These studies have found that increasing enemy diversity can strengthen, weaken, and not affect prey suppression, demonstrating that multi-enemy effects on prey are context-dependent. Here we ask how one factor, plant species identity, influences multi-enemy effects on prey. We focused on two plant species of agricultural importance, potato (Solanum tuberosum), and collards (Brassica oleracea L.). These species share a common herbivorous pest, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), but vary in structural and chemical traits that affect aphid reproductive rates and which may also influence inter-enemy interactions. In a large-scale field experiment, overall prey exploitation varied dramatically among the plant species, with enemies reducing aphid populations by similar to 94% on potatoes and similar to 62% on collards. Increasing enemy diversity similarly strengthened aphid suppression on both plants, however, and there was no evidence that plant species identity significantly altered the relationship between enemy diversity and prey suppression. Microcosm experiments suggested that, on both collards and potatoes, intraspecific competition among natural enemies exceeded interspecific competition. Enemy species showed consistent and significant differences in where they foraged on the plants, and enemies in the low-diversity treatment tended to spend less time foraging than enemies in the high-diversity treatment. These data suggest that increasing enemy diversity may strengthen aphid suppression because interspecific differences in where enemies forage on the plant allow for greater resource partitioning. Further, these functional benefits of diversity appear to be robust to changes in plant species identity.","[Straub, Cory S.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99163 USA","Straub, CS (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",straub@entomology.wisc.edu,,"Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102",,,,49,80,82,2,94,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2008,89,6,,,,,1605,1615,,10.1890/07-0657.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,310OZ,WOS:000256540300014,18589525,,,,2021-09-23,

In the Great Lakes, the exotic round goby (Apollonia melanostoma) is very abundant in littoral areas used by the native yellow perch (Perca flavencens). We examined yellow perch-round goby interactions using multiple approaches. Field surveys analyzing dietary overlap among three size classes of yellow perch and round goby detected significant overlap only between juvenile perch (< 95 mm TL) and gobies (< 60 mm TL). laboratory experiments using juvenile stages tested for habitat preference differences (open sand, macrophytes and dreissenids) in solitary, intraspecific (2 perch) and interspecific (1 perch, 1 goby) treatments. In macrophyte and dreissenid habitats, we tested for treatment differences in fish behavior (intraspecific vs. interspecific) and yellow perch growth (solitary, intraspecific and interspecific). Round goby consistently preferred complex habitats. Yellow perch showed diurnal preference of complex habitats, but increased nocturnal use of sand in the solitary and interspecific treatments. Activity was greater in dreissenid than macrophyte habitat, but prey attacks showed the opposite trend. Activity and prey attacks were greater in the intraspecific than interspecific treatments. The trend was due to lower prey attacks executed by round goby. In macrophytes, individual yellow perch growth was lower in the intraspecific than in the solitary and interspecific treatments. In dreissenids, intraspecific and interspecific competitors equally decreased yellow perch growth. Our results suggest differences in diet, habitat preference and behavior between juvenile round goby and yellow perch may allow their coexistence in nearshore areas.

A field study, spanning the 1990s, describes a rapid decline of the Fucus spp. stands along the wave-exposed Swedish southeast coast. During this period, a relative dominance of Fucus vesiculosus L. shifted to a relative dominance of Fucus serratus L. The decline of F. vesiculosus coincided with observations of large numbers of the grazing isopods Idotea baltica (Pallas) and Idotea granulosa Rathke, or with field observations of frequent grazing marks on Fucus fronds. I. baltica, but not I. granulosa, tended to aggregate in the declining Fucus spp. stands, indicating a strong preference for Fucus spp. In a mesocosm experiment I. baltica, when given a choice, grazed both Fucus species at weak water motion. At strong water motion grazing was concentrated on F. vesiculosus. It is hypothesized that one of the reasons I. baltica preferred F. vesiculosus to F. serratus at strong water motion may have been differences in habitat quality, like width of thallus, influencing the ability to cling to the plant. Smaller thallus, as in F. vesiculosus, thus is the preferred habitat for grazing of I. blatica. We postulate that the existence of F. serratus in the area may be favoured by strong wave action and moderate but not strong grazing by I. baltica, relaxing the interspecific competition from F. vesiculosus.","Kalmar Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Engkvist, R (corresponding author), Kalmar Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.",roland.engkvist@hik.se,,,,,,48,21,21,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

Intraguild prey may evolve antipredator defenses, superior competitive ability on shared resources, or the ability to use an alternative resource, any of which may alter the structure of the food web. We tested for evolutionary responses by threespine stickleback to a benthic intraguild predator, prickly sculpin. We used a comparative morphometric analysis to show that stickleback sympatric with sculpin are more armored and have more limnetic-like body shapes than allopatric stickleback. To test the ecological implications of this shift, we conducted a mesocosm experiment that varied sculpin presence and stickleback population of origin (from one sympatric and one allopatric lake). Predation by sculpin greatly increased the mortality of allopatric stickleback. In contrast, sculpin presence did not affect the mortality of sympatric stickleback, although they did have lower growth rates suggesting increased nonpredatory effects of sculpin. Consistent with their morphology, sympatric stickleback included more pelagic prey in their diets, leading to depletion of zooplankton in the mesocosms. These findings suggest that intraguild prey evolution has altered food web structure by reducing both predation by the intraguild predator and diet overlap between species.","[Ingram, Travis; Svanbaeck, Richard; Kratina, Pavel; Southcott, Laura; Schluter, Dolph] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ingram, Travis; Svanbaeck, Richard; Kraft, Nathan J.

We hypothesized that in response to artificial illumination A. cahirinus will decrease its activity and A. russatus will increase its activity, and thus temporal overlap and interspecific competition could increase. Our study took place in 4 field enclosures: the 1st and 3rd months were controls with natural light, and in the 2nd month artificial illumination, simulating low levels of light pollution, was set for the first 3 h of the night. We implanted temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters to monitor mouse activity, and individual identification tags with automonitored foraging patches were used to track foraging behavior. A. cahirinus decreased activity and foraging with artificial lighting, restricting movement particularly in less-sheltered microhabitats, probably because of increased predation risk. Because illumination restricted both activity time and space, intraspecific encounters of A. cahirinus over foraging patches increased during and following the illuminated hours. However, diurnal A. russatus did not expand its activity into the illuminated hours, possibly due to the presence of competing A. cahirinus, or to nonfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, overt interspecific competition was not affected by experimental light pollution. Light pollution had a negative influence by reducing overall activity and producing a relatively underexploited temporal niche, which may promote invasion of alien species that are less light sensitive; and by increasing intraspecific overlap in foraging A. cahirinus.","[Rotics, Shay; Dayan, Tamar; Kronfeld-Schor, Noga] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Rotics, S (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",shayroti@post.tau.ac.il,"Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/AAU-3792-2020","Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/0000-0002-5224-3341",,,,59,57,58,1,68,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

We measured delta C-13 and delta N-15 of five sympatric cyclopoid copepod species and of bulk POM from a eutrophic lake over a one-year period, to determine if stable isotope derived-data from the field supported the hypotheses from feeding studies. Cyclops abyssorum and C. vicinus differed significantly in delta N-15 but not in delta C-13, inferring assimilation from similar carbon sources but differentiation in their trophic position. Cyclops abyssorum delta N-15 typically was 1-2% higher than C. vicinus, suggesting a more predatory feeding mode compared to its congener. The summer species Mesocyclops leuckarti, Thermocyclops oithonoides and Diacyclops bicuspidatus exhibited considerable differences in delta C-13. The lower delta C-13 of the hypolimnetic D. bicuspidatus compared to the two epilimnetic species indicates a food niche differentiation by vertical separation. All copepod delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures showed seasonal fluctuations, with low values in winter and high values in summer. The delta C-13 of seston was generally higher than copepod delta C-13. We regard selective feeding from the bulk POM, spatial separation of feeding and assimilation of C-13 depleted food sources responsible for this phenomenon.","Max Planck Inst Limnol, D-24302 Plon, Germany; Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England","Santer, B (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Limnol, Post Box 165, D-24302 Plon, Germany.",Santer@mpil-ploen.mpg.de; n.sommerwerk@the-blue.net; j.grey@qmul.ac.uk,"Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012","Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271",,,,59,19,20,0,9,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

In recent studies, habitat traits have emerged as stronger predictors of species occupancy, abundance, richness and diversity than competition. However, in many cases, it remains unclear whether habitat also mediates processes more subtle than competitive exclusion, such as growth, or whether intra- and interspecific interactions among individuals of different species may be better predictors of size. 2. To test whether habitat traits are a stronger predictor of abundance and body size than intra- and interspecific interactions, we measured the density and body size of three species of larval salamanders in 192 ponds across a landscape. 3. We found that the density of larvae was best predicted by models that included habitat features, while models incorporating interactions among individuals of different species best explained the body size of larvae. Additionally, we found a positive relationship between focal species density and congener density, while focal species body size was negatively related to congener density. 4. We posit that salamander larvae may not experience competitive exclusion and thus reduced densities, but instead compensate for increased competition behaviourally (e.g. reduced foraging), resulting in decreased growth. The discrepancy between larval density and body size, a strong predictor of fitness in this system, also highlights a potential shortcoming in using density or abundance as a metric of habitat quality or population health.","[Ousterhout, Brittany H.; Anderson, Thomas L.; Drake, Dana L.; Peterman, William E.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Peterman, William E.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Ousterhout, BH (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 110 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",BOusterhout@gmail.com,"Peterman, William/H-7809-2013","Peterman, William/0000-0001-5229-9268; Ousterhout, Brittany/0000-0001-5303-515X",NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Life Sciences Fellowship; Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [SERDP RC-2155],"We thank J.

In this study, we assessed the utilization of space, time and prey resources by tigers Panthera tigris, leopards P. pardus and dholes Cuon alpinus in Manas National Park (MNP), India - a site where prey densities are not limiting, yet anthropogenic influences alter the spatial and temporal behaviour of prey. We use photographic capture data and predator scats collected over three sampling years (2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17) to assess patterns of (a) spatial use using a multispecies species occupancy framework, (b) time-activity patterns and overlap between predators and prey using non-parametric circular kernel-density functions, (c) fine-scale spatio-temporal behaviour by comparing time-to-encounters of subsequent events and (d) predator diets by analysing prey remains in predator scats. Our results highlight that the predators segregate through fine-scale spatio-temporal avoidance rather than displaying population-level changes in space-use, activity patterns or food habits. Overlap in space-use between tigers and leopards was high and time-activity patterns of the predators closely matched those of prey, suggesting that predators likely maximize resource acquisition in this prey-rich environment. Ungulate prey dominated the diet of predators, resulting in the high dietary overlap. From our results, we infer patterns of sympatry among large carnivores in the face of anthropogenic influences and highlight the need to understand interspecific interactions within a community before initiating conservation actions aimed at recovering these endangered species.","[Lahkar, D.; Ahmed, M.

These patterns of overlap may be sustained through entire seasons of lizard activity. Profile shapes included distributions that were unimodal and strongly skewed, bimodal, and uniform with roughly equivalent proportions of low, intermediate, and high overlaps. Spatial overlap profiles are idiosyncratic, neither characterizing a particular pair of lizard species, nor typifying a specific habitat type. The observations provide insight into the results of experimental studies that show weak or undetectable effects of competition at the population level, but may include asymmetric effects targeted at specific individuals.

Examining competition for carrion in a risk-reward framework allows for a better understanding of how predator guilds compete for and benefit from carrion. We used trail camera data to compare wintertime carrion use and vigilance behavior of four carnivores in Denali National Park and Preserve. We found that carrion use was dominated by wolves (Canis lupus) and wolverines (Gulo gulo), followed by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and coyotes (Canis latrans). Wolves and wolverines were twice as likely to visit a carcass as foxes and coyotes, and their visits were longer and more numerous. Our results suggest scavenging animals reduced their risk exposure primarily by reducing their use of carrion, with some evidence of increased vigilance at busy sites. We found that carrion use and behavior at carcass sites were influenced by the mortality type of the carcass, the age of the carcass, and the long-term intensity of wolf use in the area. Our results also suggest that wolves are the top scavenger, and indicate that intraguild competition for carrion strongly affects which species benefit from carrion, with larger and more aggressive species dominating.","[Klauder, Kaija J.; Sivy, Kelly J.; Prugh, Laura R.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Coll Environm, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Borg, Bridget L.] Natl Pk Serv, Denali Natl Pk & Preserve, POB 9, Denali Natl Pk, AK 99755 USA","Klauder, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Coll Environm, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kaijaklauder@gmail.com,,,National Park Service (CESU) [P15AC01013]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1652420],"The authors thank T.

In the western Canadian boreal forest, restoration of seismic lines-linear corridors cut for oil exploration-has been proposed to mitigate declines in woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) driven by altered predator-prey dynamics in industrialized landscapes. Seismic lines fragment caribou habitat, facilitate predator (wolves Canis lupus and black bears Ursus americanus) movements, and may enhance apparent competition from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces). Here, we tested the assumption that restoration provides immediate wildlife conservation benefits, using a caribou-boreal forest case study. We used camera traps to monitor seismic line use by caribou, their competitors, and predators following restoration in northeastern Alberta. We assessed species responses to four line strata: two restored (active and passive) and two unrestored (human-use and control). Three-to-six years after restoration, white-tailed deer preferred unrestored seismic lines over actively restored lines, while wolves preferred human-use lines but did not avoid restored lines. Caribou preferred lines in lowland habitat and lines surrounded by low linear density regardless of restoration. Species responses to restoration were muted, indicating that restoration alone may not be immediately effective in stabilizing threatened caribou populations. Our results highlight that wildlife responses to restoration must be tested. We recommend rigorous wildlife monitoring following restoration, particularly when the indirect, interspecific effects of habitat change drive species endangerment or recovery.","[Tattersall, Erin R.; Burgar, Joanna M.; Burton, A.

We implemented an innovative trophic interaction framework for novel communities and quantified the interaction strength and impact potential of a truly novel species (marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis) with a resident non-native counterpart (spiny-cheek crayfish Faxonius limosus). As prey, we used Dreissena mussels, which are non-native as well and now hold a key position in many European and North American aquatic ecosystems. For both crayfish species, we predicted functional responses based on a mechanistic model that we parameterised with a set of experimental observations of foraging behaviour and satiation. We compared these predicted functional responses to empirically observed responses. In addition, we incorporated behavioural traits such as aggression, activity, and boldness in the comparisons between the species and individuals to determine their influence on functional responses. We tested individuals from aquarium stocks as well as naturalised individuals from invaded water bodies. Altogether, we performed 1,095 experiments with 26 individual crayfish. We found that per capita predation of spiny-cheek crayfish exceeded that of marbled crayfish from aquaria and naturalised individuals. Functional responses differed between species and were mostly higher for spiny-cheek crayfish males. Marbled crayfish, however, were more voracious and reached satiation more slowly. Consumption rates correlated with aggression for marbled crayfish and with an aggressive threat response for spiny-cheek crayfish. We conclude that spiny-cheek crayfish can reach higher short-term consumption rates than marbled crayfish, but both species probably do not substantially affect Dreissena mussel populations in the field. For marbled crayfish, high long-term consumption, interspecific aggression, and reproduction rates can promote their establishment and spread. Risk assessments of these invaders should be improved by considering numerical responses, and different prey organisms and predators.","[Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Chem Pharm, Berlin, Germany; [Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany","Linzmaier, SM (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.",stefan.linzmaier@gmail.com,"Jeschke, Jonathan M/A-2707-2008","Jeschke, Jonathan M/0000-0003-3328-4217","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [JE 288/9-1, JE 288/9-2]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: JE 288/9-1 and JE 288/9-2",,132,3,3,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Although populations harbour considerable diversity, most ecological studies still assume they are homogeneous. However, mounting evidence suggests that intraspecific diversity is not only common, but also important for interactions with community members. Here, intraspecific variation in Daphnia dentifera in haemoglobin content is shown to be a marker of hypolimnion use. 2. Hypolimnion use differed substantially within and among D. dentifera populations. Daphnia dentifera with haemoglobin resided primarily in the hypolimnion, while D. dentifera lacking haemoglobin migrated vertically. These 'deep' and 'migratory' D. dentifera had different seasonal phenologies and dynamics. 3. Deep and migratory D. dentifera had qualitatively different relationships with an important competitor, Daphnia pulicaria. Deep D. dentifera density was negatively correlated with D. pulicaria density, whereas migratory density was not correlated with D. pulicaria density. 4. Given that D. pulicaria tends to reside in the hypolimnion, this negative correlation probably reflects competition between D. pulicaria and the deep D. dentifera. This pattern would have been missed if only the relationship between the overall lake populations of D. dentifera and D. pulicaria had been studied. 5. Abundances of deep D. dentifera and D. pulicaria were both correlated with the size of the hypolimnetic refuge from fish predation, but in opposite directions. Lakes with large refuges generally had high D. pulicaria and low deep D. dentifera densities.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Duffy, MA (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",duffy@gatech.edu,"Duffy, Meghan A/E-6867-2016; Duffy, Meghan A/A-9376-2008","Duffy, Meghan A/0000-0002-8142-0802; ","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0235119, DEB-0827396]; George Lauff Research Award; Georgia Institute of Technology","This study would not have been possible without assistance in the field and laboratory from Bob Duffy, Spencer Hall and Pam Woodruff.

This study examined habitat use of four carnivores in the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve, Belize. We calculated photographic trap success (TS) rates for jaguars Panthera onca, pumas Puma concolor, ocelots Leopardus pardalis, grey foxes Urocyon cinereoargenteus, potential prey and humans at 47 remote camera stations spaced along roads and trails within the 139 km2 study site. At each station, we used manual habitat sampling in combination with geographic information systems to estimate habitat characteristics pertaining to vegetation cover. We used negative binomial models to analyse species-specific TS as a response to habitat (including vegetation and landscape variables, prey activity and human activity) and co-predator activity rates. Jaguars [TS=7.56 +/- 1.279 (se) captures per 100 trap-nights (TN)] and grey foxes (31.5 +/- 6.073 captures per 100 TN) were commonly captured by cameras, while pumas (0.66 +/- 0.200 captures per 100 TN) and ocelots (0.55 +/- 0.209 captures per 100 TN) were rare. Model selection via Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that models including habitat variables generally performed better than models including co-predator activity. Felid captures were positively associated with small bird TS and with the width or length of surrounding roads, while fox counts showed few habitat associations. Ocelot activity was positively related to jaguar captures, an effect probably explained by their shared preference for areas with more roads. Pumas were negatively related to human activity and jaguars showed a similar, though non-significant, trend, suggesting that these felids may be sensitive to human disturbance even within protected areas. Results suggest that these predators do not spatially partition habitat and that the jaguar could function as an umbrella species for smaller sympatric carnivores.","[Davis, M. L.; Kelly, M.

Coincident with intense anthropogenic disturbance, the abundance of the Coastal Plain Toad (Incilius nebulifer) has increased significantly in degraded habitats. Subsequently, A. fowleri is found only in forested areas near permanent water bodies that are not preferred breeding habitat of I. nebulifer. We hypothesized that larval competition with I. nebulifer, a species that breeds in extremely ephemeral habitat commonly found in disturbed areas, contributed to A. fowleri's decline. We raised tadpoles in intra- and interspecific competition in artificial ponds under simulated permanent and temporary breeding habitat conditions. Competition with I. nebulifer tadpoles, but not pond drying, resulted in a decrease in body size measures and a lower rate of survival to metamorphosis for A. fowleri tadpoles. Incilius nebulifer tadpoles were slightly larger in drying than in permanent ponds and were larger and had a higher rate of survival to metamorphosis in interspecific tanks than in intraspecific tanks, suggesting that it is easier for I. nebulifer to outcompete other species than conspecifics. The Coastal Plain Toad's superior competitive ability in temporary breeding sites may have resulted in ecological displacement and is potentially contributing to a decline of regionally sympatric populations of Fowler's Toad in degraded landscapes.","[Vogel, Laura S.; Pechmann, Joseph H.

Several conservation initiatives are aiming to improve the status of the rapidly dwindling populations of tiger Panthera tigris. However, possible cascading effects of intra-guild competition on other sympatric carnivores are rarely considered while planning such recovery programmes. 2. In this study, we examine how, following the reduction of anthropogenic pressures by relocation of pastoralists, a recovering tiger population affects leopards Panthera pardus in the Chilla Range of Rajaji National Park (RNP), India. By combining data gathered over 4 years (2004-2005 to 2007-2008) on prey availability, food habits and population density of the two predators, we investigate some of the mechanisms of niche partitioning. 3. Based on existing information, we predicted that there would be high dietary overlap between the two predators. Over time, optimal habitats would be dominated by tigers forcing leopards to the periphery of the protected area where they would subsist on small prey and domestic livestock. Consequently, leopards would occur at a lower density where sympatric with tigers. 4. Our results confirmed that annual dietary overlap (0 center dot 89, 0 center dot 82, 0 center dot 78, 0 center dot 77) between the two predators was high during the study. As expected, we observed a shift in the diet of leopards towards a significantly higher intake of domestic prey (similar to 6 center dot 8% to similar to 31 center dot 8%) and small prey (similar to 9% to similar to 36%). Mean leopard density declined from 9 center dot 76 animals per 100 km2 in 2004-2005 to 2 center dot 07 per 100 km2 in 2007-2008, while the mean density of tigers increased from 3 center dot 31 per 100 km2 to 5 center dot 81 per 100 km2 over the same period. 5. Synthesis and applications. Although based on small sample sizes, our study revealed that over the 4 years following the relocation of pastoralists out of RNP, the tiger population recovered but leopard densities declined sharply. The concurrent shift in leopard diet indicated heightened livestock depredation from the surrounding area. Therefore, it is important that conservation initiatives targeting the recovery of tigers should be preceded by careful examination of interspecific interactions with sympatric carnivores. Comprehensive human-carnivore conflict management measures like monitoring the extent of livestock depredation, improving livestock management and providing adequate compensation and/or insurance schemes are critical for successfully implementing such conservation efforts.","[Harihar, Abishek; Pandav, Bivash; Goyal, Surendra P.] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Harihar, Abishek] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Dept Anthropol, Canterbury CT2 7NR, Kent, England","Harihar, A (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, POB 18, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",harihar.abishek@gmail.com,"Harihar, Abishek/AAY-5092-2020","Harihar, Abishek/0000-0002-2446-6345",Save the Tiger Fund; WII; WWF-International; Kaplan Graduate Award; Kathryn Fuller Doctoral Fellowship,"We wish thank the Director and Dean of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and the Uttarakhand Forest Department for providing permissions.

Ecologists have argued about the commonness and strength of interspecific competition between insect herbivores, but facilitation between herbivores has received much less consideration. We previously found that when two species of folivorous caterpillars co-occurred on a shared host plant, feeding by early season tiger moth caterpillars reduced the growth and reproduction of later season tussock caterpillars. However, densities of tussock caterpillars in summer were positively correlated with densities of tiger moth caterpillars the following spring. 2. In this study, we experimentally manipulated numbers of feeding tussock caterpillars and found that they facilitated tiger moth caterpillars. 3. The depth of the litter layer beneath host lupine bushes was positively correlated with the number of tussock caterpillars feeding on each bush. Experimental additions of litter beneath lupine canopies during summer resulted in increased numbers of tiger moth caterpillars in the following spring, indicating a causal role of litter. Litter potentially provides food, habitat and protection from desiccation and predation. We failed to find evidence that tussock caterpillars facilitated tiger moth caterpillars by mechanisms independent of litter. 4. Our study demonstrates that facilitation may operate between insect herbivores, across life-stages through indirect interactions that are non-trophic. Facilitation operated by a novel mechanism, the accumulation of litter which was a by-product of feeding by one species was valuable to a second species. Facilitation persisted in time and space far beyond the creation of litter by tussock caterpillars which should be considered important ecosystem engineers from the point of view of tiger moths. Facilitations that involve habitat modification may generally connect species that do not interact directly or trophically, and have not previously been considered to affect one another.","[Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Grof-Tisza, Patrick] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Karban, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rkarban@ucdavis.edu,"Grof-Tisza, Patrick/AAY-7318-2020; Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009","Grof-Tisza, Patrick/0000-0002-0217-4253; Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [LTREB-0639885]; Division Of Graduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [0841297] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank Claire Karban and Tawny Mata for help with field work and Susan Harrison, Bitty Roy and two anonymous reviewers for improving the manuscript.

Habitats in study areas were old fields with patches of tallgrass prairie and fragments of oak woodland. By monitoring 150 nest boxes from 1989 to 1993, we studied a total of 334 nests, including those of Carolina chickadees (Parus carolinensis), tufted titmice (P. bicolor), Bewick's wrens (Thryomanes bewickii), eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), and house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Carolina chickadees and tufted titmice were single-brooded and nested early in the breeding season. The parids had the highest nesting success of the species studied. Nest initiations for eastern bluebirds extended from early March to late July, and eastern bluebirds were generally double-brooded and occasionally triple-brooded. Bewick's wrens and house sparrows had the lowest nesting success. Nest failures increased as the breeding season progressed primarily due to an increase in snake predation and nest abandonment. Except for bluebirds and house sparrows, interspecific competition for nest sites is unlikely given differences in habitat preferences and timings of nesting among the five species.",,"POGUE, DW (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA,OKLAHOMA BIOL SURVEY,NORMAN,OK 73019, USA.",,,,,,,0,2,3,1,15,SOUTHWESTERN ASSN NATURALISTS,SAN MARCOS,"SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOLOGY, 601 UNIVERSITY DR, SAN MARCOS, TX 78666",0038-4909,,,SOUTHWEST NAT,Southw.

For many animals, optimal habitats differ across age or size classes, and individuals shift habitat use through ontogeny. Although many studies document ontogenetic habitat shifts for various taxa, most are observational and do not identify the causal factor of size-specific habitat variation. Field observations of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) show that juveniles perch on shorter and thinner vegetation than adults. We hypothesized that this variation is due to adult males forcing smaller juveniles to less preferred habitat. To test this assertion, we manipulated adult male densities in mesh enclosures with artificial trees to examine the response of juvenile microhabitat choice. We found that adult male density had strong effects on juvenile perch height, perch width, and substrate use, suggesting that age-class competition contributes to the observed ontogenetic differences in habitat choice. We also found that time of day significantly affected juvenile perch height and substrate use. In many cases, our results suggest that juveniles distance themselves from adults using different microhabitats from those used in our control no-adult' treatment. However, these findings were often body size dependent and varied depending upon time of day. This study highlights the complexity of juvenile perching behavior and demonstrates the role of intraspecific interactions in shaping habitat use by juvenile animals.","[Delaney, David M.; Warner, Daniel A.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Delaney, David M.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Warner, Daniel A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Delaney, DM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dmdelane@iastate.edu,"Delaney, David/J-4135-2019","Delaney, David/0000-0002-7010-840X; Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785",,,,79,12,12,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,FEB,2017,123,2,,,,,157,167,,10.1111/eth.12586,,,11,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,EJ4JL,WOS:000393182800007,,,,,2021-09-23,

We posited that biotic interactions, particularly predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory assumed a primary top-down role in affecting small mammals and annual plants here. Using a multi factorial design we selectively excluded vertebrate predators (principally carnivores and raptors) and a large small mammal herbivore, the degu (Octodon degus), from replicated 0.56 ha exclosures located in a valley near the coast in Bosque Fray Jorge National Park. Evidence initially supported effects of predator exclusion on O. degus but not for other small mammals in the assemblage (e.g., Phyllotis darwini, Abrothrix olivaceus). Subsequent years of monitoring have documented that predation has temporary effects on degu numbers, but that populations of this and other small mammals are much more strongly influenced by environmental bottom-up factors (i.e., rainfall). Further, our experimental manipulation has provided no evidence for negative interspecific competition effects on numbers of any small mammal in this assemblage. Degu exclusions, however, have had negative indirect effects on exotic annuals; native annuals appear to outcompete exotics especially during drought years The effect is magnified in all-small mammal exclusions. Since about 2002, selective exclusions of lagomorphs and small mammals have resulted in changes in cover of some perennial shrubs. Also notable has been a fundamental shift in the small mammal composition following the last major El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event in 2000 2002; degus now comprise a majority of small mammal biomass in the assemblage, and their numbers have become more stable and less temporally variable. This appears to have been caused by a shift in rainfall periodicity from strong interannual fluctuations in response to periodic ENSOs, to a more equitable pattern with more consistent annual rainfall. This represents one of the first documented cases of system-wide biotic phase shifts to a relatively modest change in rainfall regime. This may be indicative of ongoing climate change in the Chilean semiarid region, and we expect that further changes in the community will occur if those trends continue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In inland Queensland, however, Noisy Miners dominate avian assemblages throughout extensive forest areas as well as fragmented landscapes, and our understanding of the factors influencing their behaviour and habitat selection in such relatively intact landscapes is limited. I investigated how road edges influenced Noisy Miners by comparing the species' aggressive and foraging behaviour, and location of nests, between road-edge and interior transects in a southern Queensland forest. I also investigated Noisy Miner foraging microhabitat preferences and targets of aggression. Noisy Miner nests were more likely to be located near to road edges, but foraging and aggressive interactions occurred with similar frequency near and far from road edges. Such interactions selectively targeted close competitors and a nest predator. Most foraging activity was in the canopy, and selectively within ironbarks (Eucalyptus spp.), suggesting that higher densities of Noisy Miners in more open areas of the forest are unlikely to be related to facilitation of ground-foraging activity. Despite some evidence of a preference for nesting near road openings, road edges do not appear to influence Noisy Miners as strongly as edges between forest and agricultural land do elsewhere in eastern Australia.","[Maron, Martine] Univ So Queensland, Australian Ctr Sustainable Catchments, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Maron, Martine] Univ So Queensland, Dept Biol & Phys Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia","Maron, M (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",m.maron@uq.edu.au,"Maron, Martine/D-9699-2011","Maron, Martine/0000-0002-5563-5789",University of Southern Queensland Early Career Researcher Grant,"I would like to thank Gloria Glass, Simon Kennedy and Andrea Kennedy for assistance in the field.

An attempt was made to determine whether these factors affected the distribution of these cottids, testing the following hypotheses: (1) Species do not differe in selection of depth, substrate, or cover type; (2) Species do not differ in the way in which they use refugia or in locomotory activity. When given a choice of deep (xBAR = 43 cm) or shallow (xBAR = 20 cm) water, the species differed in the percentage of individuals using deep water and were ranked rough sculpin (greatest use of deep water) > marbled sculpin > Pit sculpin. When offered a choice of sand or cobble substrate, all species chose cobble substrate more often than sand substrate; however, use of sand increased from marbled sculpin to rough sculpin to Pit sculpin. When given the choice of cobbles or plants as cover, the species did not exhibit a preference. Marbled sculpin used refugia most often, and there was a significant positive correlation between size of marbled sculpin and use of refugia. Pit sculpin were more active than marbled and rough sculpin. The results for depth selection were consistent with field studies, but those for substrate and cover were not. The difference in habitat choice and behavior among the species could not explain their field distribution. Differences in behavior among the species may result in differential vulnerability to predators in different habitat types. This may explain the absence of Pit sculpin from areas dominated by the other species.",,"BROWN, LR (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT WILDLIFE & FISHERIES BIOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,31,24,25,0,9,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS BUSINESS OFFICE,CARBONDALE,"SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT ZOOLOGY, CARBONDALE, IL 62901-6501",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,AUG 1,1991,,3,,,,,810,819,,10.2307/1446408,,,10,Zoology,Zoology,FZ812,WOS:A1991FZ81200024,,,,,2021-09-23,

Thus, competitive interactions may take place. Fish have been introduced to many formerly fishless lakes, which has profoundly affected the competitive and predatory relations in these waters. In this paper we review recent findings on duck fish competitive interactions in boreal lakes. On a general level, analyses based on presence/absence data of fish have indicated that ducks can be negatively affected by fish. More rigorous studies where fish density has been considered have corroborated the pattern emerging from presence/absence studies. For the Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) and Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis), the effect of competition has been tested experimentally. In general, it appears that diving ducks such as Common Goldeneye, which forage in open water, are the most affected by fish, Common Teal (Arias crecca) is intermediate, whereas Mallard (A. platyrhynchos), which forage among the shore vegetation, is little affected. Likelihood or the strength of competition between ducks and fish may also depend on habitat productivity and structure. Numbers of invertebrates are higher among vegetation where there are less fish preying on them. Duck fish interactions are important to take into account when planning wetland creation and restoration for ducks. There is also an urgent need to mitigate the effects of fish introductions in wetlands.","[Nummi, Petri; Vaananen, Veli-Matti; Holopainen, Sari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Poysa, Hannu] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Yliopistokatu 6, Joensuu 80100, Finland","Nummi, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petri.nummi@helsinki.fi,"Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021","Holopainen, Sari/0000-0002-3271-4468; Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633",,,,80,13,13,0,17,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,2016,93,1,,,,,67,76,,,,,10,Ornithology,Zoology,DL3FU,WOS:000375520400008,,,,,2021-09-23,

Observations were made for 72 consecutive hours in each of eight ice-free months and include extensive, relatively nonintrusive field observations of pumpkinseed behavior at night. We tallied numbers of passes above the substrate and numbers of substrate strikes (at substrate or at vegetation). Variation among months accounted for 40-50% of the total variation in rates of daytime passing and substrate striking, which peaked in May and September. Among-day variation in daytime foraging activity within months was high, accounting for 50-57% of the total variance, and the variances we measured can be used to plan replication levels necessary to achieve adequate statistical power in future studies involving measurements of daily ration or comparisons of exploitation rates in different habitats. Simultaneous video monitoring at multiple sites allows one to factor out the day-to-day variance and provides a sensitive way to compare foraging variables in different sites or habitats. Although pumpkinseeds are usually considered diurnal feeders, some foraging occurred at night in each month. The median rate of fish passing at night was about half the median diurnal and crepuscular rates. Rates of substrate striking were much lower at night than during the day, but planktonic feeding at night was higher, so that nocturnal striking rates on plankton plus substrate were more than 75% of the diurnal values. Nocturnal feeding by other visually feeding fishes is more important than we currently acknowledge, and needs to be incorporated into our thinking about interspecific competition and predation among littoral fishes.",,"COLLINS, NC (corresponding author), UNIV TORONTO,ERINDALE COLL,DEPT ZOOL,MISSISSAUGA L5L 1C6,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,"Collins, Nicholas C/F-2704-2010","Collins, Nicholas C/0000-0002-6901-6604",,,,32,19,21,1,10,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Field experimentation to identify density dependent effects is often cost and time prohibitive. Thus, assimilation of existing knowledge into a balance of probabilities can serve as a surrogate for experimental research. A case study of such a process is found in the mule deer Odocoileus hemionus herds of Colorado. Wildlife managers and hunters expressed concern over a recent decline in western Colorado mule deer herds, yet the underlying cause of this decline is yet to be determined. In response to this management concern, we conducted a review of scientific evidence on Colorado's mule deer population dynamics. This review was done in the context of a conceptual model that portrays population growth as a function of population size, per capita growth rate and population carrying capacity. Similar declines that occurred during the 1960s and early 1990s resulted in similar reviews that identified research and management topics that would benefit mule deer. These topics included: harvest, predation, intraspecific competition, disease, interspecific competition, and habitat loss and degradation. Between the late 1990s and present time, many of these topics were addressed by research. The conventional working hypothesis in Colorado is that mule deer herds are limited by winter range habitat. We identify new gaps in knowledge and suggest potential, future research topics, as well as potential management strategies. We suggest a focus on integrated studies of multiple herbivores with density reduction experiments to address intra- and inter- specific competition. In addition, we suggest focused experiments that address the roles of mountain lion predation, black bear predation, and disease in mule deer population dynamics.","[Bergman, Eric J.; Holland, A.

They can respond either by being attracted to (potential mates, preferred habitats) or avoiding (predators, competitors) the source of the stimuli. Coral reef fishes use chemical cues to detect habitats, avoid predators and recognise conspecifics. However, the extent to which chemical cues are used to detect and respond to potential competitors, has received little attention. Here we test olfactory preferences for conspecifics and heterospecifics in newly settled juvenile coral reef fishes. Juveniles of 4 common coral-associated damselfish species: Dascyllus melanurus, Dascyllus reticulatus, Chrysiptera arnazae and Pomacentrus moluccensis, were subjected to olfactory choice tests. Three of the 4 species (excluding P. moluccensis) demonstrated preferences for waterborne conspecifics odours. All species exhibited an avoidance towards heterospecific odours; this aversion was consistently greatest towards P. moluccensis. A neutral response toward heterospecifics was only evident in two instances (1) between the two congeneric Dascyllus species, with D. melanurus toward D. reticulatus, and (2) with C. arnazae toward D. melanurus. While it is already known that the presence of conspecifics plays a vital role in settlement site selection, we show here that the presence of heterospecifics may also be key in determining the spatial distributions of juveniles across areas of coral reef.

I evaluate these assertions and amend information about this South American case study. Categorizing deer along narrow characteristics may be too restrictive to allow accurate predictions about interactions. More effective is considering the magnitude of plasticity (behavioral, phenotypic, genetic). The dichotomy of native versus exotic deer masks situations where prevailing ecological conditions are far from 'native', such as absence of predators, and such results from artificial settings have limitations. Studies used to contrast effects on vegetation from exotic red deer (Cervus elaphus) versus native huemul did not analyze native deer and provided no data to support conclusions in the review. Huemul were concluded to have high trophic overlap with red deer whose diet, however, was determined in another habitat where the food item of supposed major overlap was absent, and suggesting that red deer might cause exploitation competition was not supported by cited data. There was no mention that huemul are foremost exposed to livestock rather than exotic deer. Concluding that exotic prey including red deer increase predator density resulting in increased predation of huemul (apparent competition), was not supported by cited studies. To the contrary, high-density puma (Puma concolor) could not prevent guanaco (Lama guanicoe) from increasing > 13-fold, nor that huemul expanded into these sites. Not only were those studies opposite to conclusions in the review, but none had studied huemul nor predator population trends. Data from little known species like huemul should be used with reservations when aiming at generalizations.","[Flueck, Werner T.] Univ Atlantida Argentina, Inst Nat Resources Anal, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Flueck, Werner T.] Natl Council Sci Res, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Flueck, Werner T.] Univ Basel, Swiss Trop Inst, Basel, Switzerland","Flueck, WT (corresponding author), Univ Atlantida Argentina, Inst Nat Resources Anal, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",wtf@deerlab.org,"Andrei, Graciela/V-7721-2017; Snoeck, Robert/V-3867-2017","Andrei, Graciela/0000-0003-2609-4896; Snoeck, Robert/0000-0002-7586-5434","El Retorno; Bariloche; Cyon GmbH, Switzerland","I thank Andrea Taylor, Associate Editor for Wildlife Research, for constructive criticism during four revisions involving five additional anonymous reviewers, which substantially improved the paper, although in the end it was declined.

The short time required to hatch and develop from egg to adult, usually in temporary pools, suggests a strategy which allows for exploitation of transient pools, thus evading predation and interspecific competition. Under these conditions intra specific competition could represent a major density-dependent source of larval mortality, but the relative importance of density-dependent regulation of mosquito populations has generated controversy. Therefore we examined the effects of larval density on basic population characteristics of Ae. albifasciatus in the laboratory. Larvae were obtained by synchronous hatching of eggs laid by field-trapped females. Emerging larvae (L1) were used to build cohorts of different initial densities, kept in plastic trays with 400 ml of distilled water, and food supplied daily during the first 10 days (0.1 g per larvae day(-)1). Age-specific development time and specific and relative mortality were estimated, and their relation to initial larval density was assessed through linear and non-linear regressions and correlation analysis. First hatching was registered 3 h after flooding the eggs. Higher levels of pre-adult mortality were detected in groups with higher densities. Specific mortality and average time to enter a stage of L1 to L3 could directly be related to initial larval density, but no significant relations were found for L4 and pupae. Results suggest that crowding could be a factor capable of regulating the density of natural populations of Ae. albifasciatus.","Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, Mendoza & Entre Rios, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina","Gleiser, RM (corresponding author), Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, Mendoza & Entre Rios, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina.",,"Gorla, David/AAX-3360-2020","Gorla, David/0000-0002-9323-9365",,,,17,22,25,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

In coastal Newfoundland, Canada, capelin Mallotus villosus is the focal forage fish species that many top predators feed on during the summer: however, inshore availability varies throughout the boreal summer when abundant aggregations migrate inshore to spawn. We investigated the interactions and responses of Great Shearwaters Ardenna gravis and Sooty Shearwaters A. grisea during their non-breeding season to supplemental food supply under changing natural prey availability (higher and lower capelin availability) by conducting an at-sea experiment during July-August (2015/2016) in coastal Newfoundland. Supplemental food was offered every 30 s over 10 min (`experimental period'), which was preceded and followed by 10-min control periods (i.e., no food provided). The number of both species increased during the experimental periods, indicating that both species were attracted to the food supplementation experiment. Great Shearwaters were 7.6-13.8 times more likely than Sooty Shearwaters to land near the experimental platform and 95.2 times more likely than Sooty Shearwaters to fight over supplemental food items with individuals of the same or different species. These species-specific tendencies remained consistent as prey availability varied within years, but both species increased in their abundance and interactions with other species (including Herring Gulls Larus argentatus and Northern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialis) during prey capture at lower relative to higher prey availability, as evidenced by lower proportions of flying birds and a greater likelihood of landing on the water. Overall, we suggest that when Great and Sooty shearwaters feed in close association, Great Shearwaters are the more competitively dominant species, which may lead to higher risks of by-catch mortality, especially when the availability of natural prey decreases.","[Carvalho, Paloma C.; Maynard, Laurie D.; Davoren, Gail K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Carvalho, PC (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",ccpaloma@gmail.com,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2014-06290, 470195-2015, 486208-2016]; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program; Manitoba Graduate Fellowship; CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education PersonnelCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001203/2013-04]","This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (2014-06290) to GKD; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Ship Time Grants (470195-2015, 486208-2016) to GKD; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program grants (2015-2016) to GKD; Manitoba Graduate Fellowship to LDM, and CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (001203/2013-04) to PCC.

The present study determined the daily and seasonal foraging patterns, the spatial distribution, the feeding sources and the associations with honeydew-producing Hemiptera of three ant species that forage in citrus canopies. The dominant ants Pheidole pallidula (Nylander) (Myrmicinae) and Lasius grandis Forel (Formicinae) foraged in mutually exclusive territories within the field, although they both shared their territory with the subordinate Plagiolepis schmitzii Forel (Formicinae), a distribution pattern known as 'ant mosaic'. The observed mean overlap for the spatial distribution was significantly lower than the generated by null models, providing strong evidence of spatial interspecific competition, especially between the two dominants. Ants ascended to the canopies from April until November. Colony nutritional requirements and temperature probably shape their seasonal foraging patterns. The daily activity pattern of P. schmitzii was strictly diurnal, whereas L. grandis and P. pallidula were active during the entire day. The ants' diet in the canopies consisted principally of hemipteran honeydew, whereas citrus nectar and predation/scavenging did not represent important food sources. More than 60% of the total honeydew sources and 100% of the citrus mealybug Planococcus citri colonies were tended by ants during spring and summer.","[Pekas, Apostolos; Tena, Alejandro; Aguilar, Amparo; Garcia-Mari, Ferran] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Valencia 46022, Spain","Garcia-Mari, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Cami Vera 14, Valencia 46022, Spain.",fgarciam@eaf.upv.es,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Garcia-Mari, Ferran/K-6982-2012; Pekas, Apostolos/J-8823-2017","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Garcia-Mari, Ferran/0000-0001-5798-1805; Pekas, Apostolos/0000-0002-8209-3882",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia of SpainSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [AGL2005-07155-C03-03],We are very grateful to N.

Thus, interspecific competition affects different age classes differently. Adults of sympatric species often show distinct foraging niche segregation, but juvenile resource use might overlap with adult competitors of similar body size. Resultant negative effects on juveniles can have important consequences for population dynamics, yet such interactions have received little attention in studies of mammalian communities. Using GPS tracking devices, time-depth recorders and stable isotope data, we compared diving depth, activity time, trophic position and foraging habitat characteristics to investigate foraging niche overlap between similar-sized sympatric juvenile Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) and adult Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and compared each group with much larger-bodied adult Galapagos sea lions. We found little indication for direct competition but a complex pattern of foraging niche segregation: juvenile sea lions and adult fur seals dived to shallow depths at night, but foraged in different habitats with limited spatial overlap. Conversely, juvenile and adult sea lions employed different foraging patterns, but their foraging areas overlapped almost completely. Consistency of foraging habitat characteristics between juvenile and adult sea lions suggests that avoidance of competition may be important in shaping foraging habitat utilization. Resultant specialization on a limited habitat could contribute to low sea lion numbers that contrast with high fur seal abundance. Our data suggest that exploitation by multiple predators within spatially restricted foraging ranges of juveniles might negatively impact juvenile foraging success and ultimately influence population dynamics.","[Jeglinski, Jana W.

Recent analyses suggest a strong likelihood of competition between eutherian predators and the endangered spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), although experiments are required to confirm this. If competition does occur, what are its likely effects on the long-term survival of spotted-tailed quoll populations? We used population viability analysis (PVA) to predict the fate of a hypothetical quoll population under various scenarios of competition. PVA showed that spotted-tailed quoll populations may be susceptible to extinction when faced with high densities of competitors. Model scenarios simulating exploitation competition and/or intraguild killing greatly reduced the population's probability of survival, leading in the worst-case scenario to almost certain extinction.","[Glen, A.

Parasitism may be an important factor determining the coexistence of closely related species. Although host-parasite interactions can affect the ecology and distribution of the host species, virtually nothing is known about how other interspecific interactions affecting the host, such as competition or predation, relate to the parasite burden of the host. 2. We studied parasite-mediated competition between two closely related Calopteryx damselflies, C. virgo L. and C. splendens Harris. We investigated a total of 31 populations, including 18 allopatric and 13 sympatric populations. We measured the occurrence of gut parasites, eugregarines. 3. We found that the prevalence of gregarines was higher in C. virgo than in C. splendens. On average, more than half of the C. virgo individuals were infected by eugregarines both in allopatric and sympatric populations. However, hardly any allopatric C. splendens populations had gregarines, but most of sympatric populations had infected individuals. 4. According to our results, co-existence of the host species affects the likelihood of the subordinate species showing higher levels of parasitism. Interspecific aggression, lower species genetic heterozygosity, and the difference in host species immunity are proposed as possible explanations for greater parasite burdens in the inferior species at sympatric sites.","[Ilvonen, Sini; Ilvonen, Jaakko J.; Kaunisto, Kari M.; Suhonen, Jukka] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; [Krams, Indrikis] Daugavpils Univ, Inst Systemat Biol, Daugavpils, Latvia","Suhonen, J (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",juksuh@utu.fi,"Ilvonen, Jaakko J./AAG-4842-2019; Krams, Indrikis/B-5788-2017","Ilvonen, Jaakko J./0000-0002-2311-7039; Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108",Suomen Biologian Seura Vanamo ry; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank Oskari Harma, Linda Laakso, Kalle Laitila, Pipsa Lappalainen, Juhana Suhonen and Talvikki Suhonen for their help during the field and laboratory work.

We report that introduced Ship Rats Ratios ratios constructed arboreal dome-shaped nests and secondarily used open-cup nests of the Bull-headed Shrike Lanius bucephalus for roosting or rearing young in trees within hedgerows along sugarcane fields of Minami-daito Island (northwest Pacific). We found that temporal nest utilization by Ship Rats forced Bull-headed Shrikes to abandon their nests before egg-laying. We suggest that kleptoparasitism applies to the interaction between Bull-headed Shrikes and Ship Rats, which usurp shrike nests during their breeding period.

This condition is commonly believed to be associated with the morphology or behavioral ecology of avian predators, and numerous theoretical explanations have been presented to account for its evolution. Most tests of these ideas have been theoretical or based on comparative analyses. We present tests of specific hypotheses of RSD based on field studies of Great Skuas (Catharacta skua) and Parasitic Jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) breeding in Shetland. We also present a comparative analysis of foraging behavior and degree of RSD within the Stercorariinae. We found no support for the popular theories that claim that RSD evolved as a result of specialized roles during breeding. Large females were not more fecund, nor were they the main defenders of the nest. Male body size was not correlated with any breeding parameter. In addition, interspecific comparisons did not support the idea that the degree of RSD is related to foraging behavior during the breeding season (as opposed to morphology). Female dominance within pairs did not affect any breeding parameters. Support was found for theories that RSD is linked to sexual selection. Large females had an advantage when pairing with older males, which could be a result of intrasexual competition for mates. There was assortative mating for size, indicating that small males could also have an advantage in pairing, because large males seem to be rejected by small females. Given the disparate results of several previous studies, we conclude that a large body of empirical evidence will be needed before we can draw firm conclusions about the main selective factors that act to maintain current levels of RSD in natural populations of raptorial birds.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Appl Ornithol Unit, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Phillips, RA (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Appl Ornithol Unit, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",r.a.phillips@durham.ac.uk,"Catry, Paulo/I-5408-2013","Catry, Paulo/0000-0003-3000-0522",,,,50,38,39,0,18,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,,,AUK,AUK,JAN,1999,116,1,,,,,158,168,,10.2307/4089462,,,11,Ornithology,Zoology,160RJ,WOS:000078244500015,,,,,2021-09-23,

Results showed that spatial overlap (Lloyd's index and spatial distribution) was higher among adults of both species at the lower tidal elevation of l'Anse-a-l'Orignal (north-east oriented). Results also suggest weaker interspecific interactions among juveniles of both species because of limited spatial overlap, In Baie-du-Ha!Ha! (south-west oriented), spatial overlap was greater than that observed in 1'Anse-8-l'Orignal and appeal-ed important in adults as well as in juveniles. Levins' directional measure of competition indicated an asymmetric spatial overlap between N. virens and N. caeca in Baie-du-Ha!Ha! and a symmetric overlap in l'Anse-a-l'Orignal. The intraspecific encounter values, estimated from Lloyd's mathematical expression, were significantly higher than values of interspecific interactions only in l'Anse-a-l'Orignal. Moreover, no vertical stratification was found inside the sediment, with no effect of the densities and individual body weights of the polychaetes. Juveniles of both species mainly inhabited the organic-rich upper portion of the sediments (O to 12 cm), while adults colonised greater depths( > 25 cm) where organic matter content was lower. A complementary field experiment was conducted in 1993 to investigate interspecific interactions (predation and competition) existing between N. virens and N. caeca. Results from this experiment depend on which species was first-introduced and showed an important variation in mortality rates between allopatric and sympatric conditions. The influence of competition and predation on the structure of these populations is also discussed in relation to their spatial overlap.","UNIV LAVAL,GIROQ,DEPT BIOL,ST FOY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA; MUSEUM NATL HIST NAT,LAB MARITIME,F-35801 DINARD,FRANCE","Caron, A (corresponding author), UNIV QUEBEC,DEPT OCEANOG,CTR OCEANOG RIMOUSKI,310 ALLEE URSULINES,RIMOUSKI,PQ G5L 3A1,CANADA.",,,,,,,83,13,17,1,19,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Understanding these interactions is thus essential for correctly predicting species' responses to climate change. We focussed on an avian forest guild of four hole-nesting species with differing sensitivities to climate that show a range of well-understood reciprocal interactions, including facilitation, competition and predation. We modelled the potential distributions of black woodpecker and boreal, tawny and Ural owl, and tested whether the spatial patterns of the more widespread species (excluding Ural owl) were shaped by interspecific interactions. We then modelled the potential future distributions of all four species, evaluating how the predicted changes will alter the overlap between the species' ranges, and hence the spatial outcomes of interactions. Forest cover/type and climate were important determinants of habitat suitability for all species. Field data analysed with N-mixture models revealed effects of interspecific interactions on current species abundance, especially in boreal owl (positive effects of black woodpecker, negative effects of tawny owl). Climate change will impact the assemblage both at species and guild levels, as the potential area of range overlap, relevant for species interactions, will change in both proportion and extent in the future. Boreal owl, the most climate-sensitive species in the guild, will retreat, and the range overlap with its main predator, tawny owl, will increase in the remaining suitable area: climate change will thus impact on boreal owl both directly and indirectly. Climate change will cause the geographical alteration or disruption of species interaction networks, with different consequences for the species belonging to the guild and a likely spatial increase of competition and/or intraguild predation. Our work shows significant interactions and important potential changes in the overlap of areas suitable for the interacting species, which reinforce the importance of including relevant biotic interactions in predictive climate change models for increasing forecast accuracy.","[Brambilla, Mattia; Scridel, Davide; Iemma, Aaron; Pedrini, Paolo; Assandri, Giacomo] Museo Sci, Sez Zool Vertebrati, Trento, Italy; [Brambilla, Mattia; Bazzi, Gaia; Ilahiane, Luca] Fdn Lombardia Ambiente, Settore Biodiversita & Aree Protette, Seveso, MB, Italy; [Scridel, Davide; Bogliani, Giuseppe; Assandri, Giacomo] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Terra & Ambiente, Pavia, Italy; [Bassi, Enrico] Parco Nazl Stelvio, Bormio, SO, Italy; [Bionda, Radames] Parco Nat Alpe Veglia & Devero Alta Valle Antrona, Varzo, Italy; [Genero, Fulvio] Riserva Nat Reg Lago Cornino, Cornino, UD, Italy; [Teufelbauer, Norbert] BirdLife Austria, Vienna, Austria; [Vrezec, Al] Natl Inst Biol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kmecl, Primoz; Mihelic, Tomaz] DOPPS BirdLife Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Schmid, Hans] Schweiz Vogelwarte, Sempach, Switzerland; [Pontarini, Renato] Progetto Lince Italia, Tarvisio, UD, Italy; [Braunisch, Veronika; Arlettaz, Raphael] Univ Bern, Div Conservat Biol, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Bern, Switzerland; [Chamberlain, Dan] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Biol Sistemi, Turin, Italy","Brambilla, M (corresponding author), Museo Sci, Sez Zool Vertebrati, Trento, Italy.",brambilla.mattia@gmail.com,"Scridel, Davide/Q-9430-2019; Bazzi, Gaia/AAP-9154-2020; Braunisch, Veronika/AAH-8260-2020; Assandri, Giacomo/H-6962-2019; Chamberlain, Dan/K-1809-2015","Scridel, Davide/0000-0003-3849-1178; Braunisch, Veronika/0000-0001-7035-4662; Assandri, Giacomo/0000-0001-5161-5353; Brambilla, Mattia/0000-0002-7643-4652; Chamberlain, Dan/0000-0002-5381-2024; BAZZI, GAIA/0000-0002-7220-6054",RDP Trento province; Parco Naturale Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino; Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P1-0255],"RDP Trento province; Parco Naturale Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino; Slovenian Research Agency, Grant/Award Number: P1-0255",,94,8,9,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, recent reviews have shown that competitors, unlike predators and parasites, have rarely been documented to cause extinctions. There is a need for better understanding of competitive interactions between nonindigenous species and native competitors across systems where NIS reach high densities. In this paper we examine competitive interactions between the exotic, invasive New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and native estuarine invertebrates. P. antipodarum is often described as a freshwater snail but can occur in brackish water as well; it has been established in the Columbia River Estuary for over ten years. We addressed competition in this estuarine system using three approaches: field surveys of the benthic invertebrate community, stable isotope analysis of overlap in resource use by common invertebrates, and a laboratory competition experiment that tested the strength of competition between P. antipodarum and the isopod, Gnorimosphaeroma insulare, which overlap in resource use. We found no evidence of negative competitive impacts of P. antipodarum on native benthic invertebrates in this estuarine system. Densities of P. antipodarum and common native epibenthic invertebrates are positively correlated in the intertidal, likely due to shared habitat preferences. The competition experiment showed that the effect of interspecific competition from P. antipodarum on the foraging and survival of G. insulare was significantly less than the effect of intraspecific competition between isopods. The presence of the isopod G. insulare reduced foraging in P. antipodarum, but this change did not result in reduced survival and growth of snails. Hence, interspecific competition is weak despite high densities achieved by the invading species. Finally, we discuss several possible explanations for the observation that P. antipodarum does not have an obvious negative competitive impact on native benthic invertebrates.","[Brenneis, Valance E.

Ecological interactions that involve aggressive confrontations between animals are important in shaping the evolution of morphology, behaviour and life history. However, as such confrontations are rarely witnessed, direct quantification of the intensity of these processes in natural populations is notoriously difficult. While the utilization of the frequency of non-lethal injuries is fraught with difficulties, it may provide information concerning different types of interaction, such as predation, intraspecific aggression and interspecific interference competition. 2. In this paper, we report on an exceptionally large difference in toe loss incidence between two populations of Podarcis sicula lizards living on small, neighbouring islands in the Adriatic Sea. We caught 900 lizards and recorded the number and location of missing toes. Subsequently, we investigated five non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning differences in bite force capacity, bone strength, predation intensity, average age and intraspecific aggression that may provide proximate explanations for the observed differences in injury frequencies. 3. Bite force differences differed considerably between the populations, but bone strength was found to be stronger in the populations with a higher frequency of natural scars. Predation pressure clearly differed between the populations, but we found higher injury rates under predation relaxation. 4. Our results indicate that density and consequently an increased intraspecific competition is the most likely explanation for the observed high frequencies of injuries. We suggest that the intensity of toe amputation between lizard populations may be a useable indirect indication for the intensity of intraspecific competition. 5. This study shows how a combination of morphological, physiological, behavioural and ecological measurements can be used to test assumptions implicit to alternative explanations of an observed phenomenon. Such tests can reveal how likely each of these explanations is, even if the processes leading to the phenomenon are difficult to observe directly.","[Vervust, Bart; Van Damme, Raoul] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Lab Funct Morphol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Dongen, Stefan] Dept Biol, Evolutionary Biol Grp, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Grbac, Irena] Nat Hist Museum Croatia, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia","Vervust, B (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Lab Funct Morphol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",bart.vervust@ua.ac.be,,"Van Damme, Raoul/0000-0002-4585-6940",FWO - FlandersFWO [G.0111.06],"This study is part of larger projects supported by the FWO - Flanders (project no.

Small mammals influence Neotropical forest regeneration following disturbance through their actions as seed dispersers and seed predators. In Panama, the Central American spiny rat (Proechimys semispinosus) and the armored rat (Hoplomys gymnurus) persist sympatrically despite a similar diet and seasonal food resource limitation. To study the relationship between these species, we conducted behavioral arena trials to analyze interspecific and intraspecific interactions. Our goal was to determine whether behavioral dominance between H. gymnurus and P. semispinosus exists, potentially reducing the intensity of aggressive competition and allowing the two species to coexist sympatrically. Aggression data were analyzed using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showing that species pairing was a significant predictor of aggression, supporting the existence of behavioral dominance by P. semispinosus over H. gymnurus. Investigative behavior data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and showed a significantly higher level of investigative behavior for P. semispinosus towards H. gymnurus during the dry season when resources are scarce compared to the wet season when resources are plentiful.","[Dupre, S.

However, it cannot quantify the indirect effects of this approach and the long-term and system-level ecological consequences are hard to assess. Here we focus on the bloom areas of the Ulansuhai Lake in Inner Mongolia. Based on historic data, field monitoring and experimental data, we constructed a quantitative phosphorus cycle network model. Using Ecological Network Analysis (ENA), we evaluated how indirect flow influences dominant algal species and alters network control and utility relationships. Results indicate that: (1) Indirect flows have strong influence on the mutual and control relationships between blooming algae and its related functional groups in the Ulansuhai Lake; (2) Some opposite interspecific relationships between the blooming algae and other functional components have been found by ENA; (3) Key populations controlling the blooming algae are observed from the intuitive Zooplankton and Detritus to network-based Microorganisms, Zoobenthos, Zooplankton and Detritus(water).

Comparisons of leaf chemistry were made among leaves that experienced variable levels of crab damage. Because R. mangle is the crab's preferred food source based on damage patterns in the field, comparisons of R. mangle leaf chemistry were made in relation to that of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans and the white mangrove Laguncularia racemosa. We observed a negative relationship between level of leaf damage and percent dry weight of nitrogen, carbohydrates, condensed tannins, and sclerophvlly. In contrast, a positive relationship was found between leaf damage and the carbon:nitrogen ratio. The chemical constituents that provided the best explanation for differences in damage among the three mangrove species include condensed tannins, nitrogen, carbon: nitrogen ratio, carbohydrates, phenolics, water content, and ash. The results from this study suggest that chemistry only partially explains food preference by A. pisonii.

The paper describes such phenomenon in a Formica rufa L. colony brought into conflict with a R cinerea Mayr colony when the former tried to extend its own territory at the expense of the latter. A territorially stable E rufa colony, neighbouring the same E cinerea colony, served as control. Workers of the expansive F. rufa colony were repeatedly observed to carry numerous ant corpses, empty pupal cocoons and insect leftovers from their nest to the place of confrontation with E cinerea, on a much bigger scale than workers of the stable E rufa colony. Corpse-carrying intensity was not correlated with the general activity level of foragers which suggests that corpse carriers could be a separate task group. Workers of a small colony of F. cinerea were also observed to surround their nest entrance with corpses of their nestmates and prey remains, taken out from inside the nest, in response to intensified traffic of workers of E rufa in the vicinity of their nest. These results are discussed in the context of a possible interrelation between ant aggressive behaviour and transport behaviour. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain the observed phenomenon: (1) explaining it as a by-product of the aggressive arousal of workers, and (2) ascribing to it a possible signalling function in conflict situations.","[Czechowski, Wojciech] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Marko, Balint] Univ Babes Bolyai, Dept Taxon & Ecol, Cluj Napoca 400006, Romania; [Godzinska, Ewa Joanna] Polish Acad Sci, M Nencki Inst Expt Biol, Dept Neurophysiol, Ethol Lab, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland","Czechowski, W (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",wcz@miiz.waw.pl; mbalint@biolog.ubbcluj.ro; e.godzinska@nencki.gov.pl,"Godzinska, Ewa/B-2622-2012; Marko, Balint/C-3081-2011","Godzinska, Ewa Joanna/0000-0001-6993-2082; Marko, Balint/0000-0001-6039-8231; Czechowski, Wojciech/0000-0001-9422-2453",EU FP 6European Commission [PL-TAF-3066]; Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw [407];  [31/1342];  [ID-552 PNII],"The field observations were made during WCz.'s stay at the Tvarminne Zoological Station, University of Helsinki, within the programme of scientific co-operation between the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Finland.

We measured the instantaneous growth of each species in the presence and absence of the other in 1-m(2) enclosures. We tested single-species (three slimy sculpins/m(2) or three brown trout/m(2)) and combined-species (three sculpins/m(2) and three trout/m(2)) combinations in each of six riffles. We placed a clay tile in each enclosure to evaluate the effects of fish combinations on benthic macroinvertebrates. Growth of brown trout was unaffected by the presence of slimy sculpins (P = 0.647, power [to detect 50% increase in growth] = 0.92), whereas slimy sculpin growth was less in the presence of brown trout (P = 0.038). Densities of total benthic macroinvertebrates, Chironomidae, Trichoptera, and Physa did not differ among fish combinations (P > 0.3). However, densities of Gammarus pseudolimnaeus were significantly less in the presence of brown trout irrespective of the presence of slimy sculpins (P = 0.024), which could be a causal factor underlying the interaction between brown trout and slimy sculpins. We found asymmetrical competition between brown trout and slimy sculpins in stream enclosures, with brown trout being the superior competitor. Nevertheless, the size of enclosures may have biased our results, making it more likely to detect an effect of brown trout on slimy sculpins than vice versa.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Fairfield Univ, Dept Biol, Fairfield, CT 06430 USA; Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Ruetz, CR (corresponding author), Lake Michigan Ctr, Annis Water Resources Inst, 740 W Shoreline Dr, Muskegon, MI 49441 USA.",,,,,,,45,22,23,1,14,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

One potential explanation is that these are statistical expectations over the range of potential species characteristics. We systematically examine the indirect interactions between two hosts with a shared parasitoid across all potential parameter values, using a family of simple models. By including a detection limit for nonzero interspecific effects, we demonstrate that (-,0) indirect interactions between hosts are the most common type for many variants of the model. However, the absence of positive indirect effects in empirical studies constitutes a puzzling inconsistency between the empirical and theoretical literatures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In maize, both species tend to infest the ear. The introduction of H. armigera in Brazil has created a new scenario, where these Helicoverpa species might cohabit and interact with one another, affecting the prevalence of each species in the agroecosystem, integrated pest management, and insect resistance management. In this study, larval occurrence and proportion of these species in maize was assessed in three regions of Brazil during three crop seasons. Interaction between the species was evaluated in interspecific and intraspecific scenarios under laboratory and field conditions. Helicoverpa zea was predominant in Rio Grande do Sul and the Planaltina, DF (central Brazil). In western Bahia, H. zea was predominant in the first collection, but approximately equal in number to H armigera in the second crop season. Both species exhibit high cannibalism/predation rates, and larval size was the primary factor for larval survival in the interaction studies. Larva of H. zea had higher survival when interacting with H. armigera, indicating that H. zea has an advantage in intraguild interactions with H. armigera in maize. Overall, the results from this study indicate that maize might play a role as a source of infestation or a sink of insecticide or Bt protein unselected H. armigera populations, depending on the H. zea:H. armigera intraguild competition and adult movement in the landscape.","[Bentivenha, Jose P.

Mobile facultative scavengers are likely to negatively impact tundra biodiversity as dominant competitors or predators, if they spill over into tundra. Here, we provide the first quantitative assessments of the structure of a scavenger guild in low arctic tundra with emphasis on how it changes along spatial gradients from neighbouring ecosystems (i.e. forest and coast) and with altitude (i.e. productivity gradients). We also assess the likelihood of interactions between guild members that may negatively impact vulnerable tundra species. Location North-eastern part of Norway. Methods Extensive records of scavenger prevalence were obtained by deploying automatic digital cameras at experimental carcasses in tundra regions covering several thousand square kilometres and three winters in northern Norway. Main conclusions We found short-range neighbourhood effects of forest and coast within the tundra scavenger guild. Species richness declined steeply with decreasing distance from the neighbouring ecosystems, in particular subarctic forest, and with increasing altitude. Bird species with strongholds in forest (golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos and hooded crow Corvus cornix) or along the coast (white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla) were mostly responsible for short-range neighbourhood effects on guild structure. However, the two most abundant guild members, the common raven Corvus corax and the red fox Vulpes vulpes, exhibited no spatial patterns within the range of neighbourhoods and altitudes examined. There was a clear diurnal segregation in the use of carcasses between birds and mammals reducing the likelihood of direct interactions between these two taxa. Presence of red fox appeared to exclude the arctic fox Vulpes lagopus, the only endemic tundra species within the guild, from carcasses.","[Killengreen, Siw T.; Stromseng, Elise; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Killengreen, ST (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",siw.killengreen@uit.no,"Killengreen, Siw/G-9205-2016; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039",Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management,"We would like to thank Ashild Bye, John Andre Henden, Erik Isakson, Bjorn Hugo Kristoffersen, Arne Petter Sarre, Elin Skog and Alfred Orjebu for skilled help during field work.

However, accessing high trees and their fauna remains difficult; thus, how ants and spiders interact in the canopy remains unclear. To better understand the interspecific interactions between these two dominant arthropod groups, we investigated their spatial distributions at the canopy surface in a tropical rain forest in Borneo. We sampled ants and spiders six times between 2009 and 2011 by sweeping with an insect net at the tree crown surfaces of 190 emergent or tall (20m in height) trees. We collected 438 ant individuals belonging to 94 species and 1850 spider individuals (1630 juveniles and 220 adults) belonging to 142 morphospecies (adults only) from a total of 976 samples. The fact that we collected four times more spider individuals than ant individuals suggests that fewer ants forage at the tree crown surface than previously thought. The number of spider individuals negatively correlated with the number of ant individuals and the number of ant species, indicating significant exclusivity between ant and spider spatial distributions at the tree crown surface. Niche-overlap between the two taxa confirmed this observation. Although our data do not address the causes of these spatial distributions, antagonistic interspecific interactions such as interference behaviors and intra-guild predation are ecological mechanisms that give rise to exclusive spatial distributions.","[Katayama, Motoki; Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko; Tanaka, Hiroshi O.; Itioka, Takao] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan; [Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Endo, Tomoji] Kobe Coll, Sch Human Sci, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan; [Hashimoto, Yoshiaki] Univ Hyogo, Div Phylogenet, Inst Nat & Environm Sci, Museum Nat & Human Act, Sanda, Hyogo, Japan; [Yamane, Seiki] Kagoshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Kagoshima 890, Japan","Itioka, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan.",ichioka.takao.5m@kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [D-04]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and CultureMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [24570109]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24570109] Funding Source: KAKEN","Our study was conducted in accordance with the Memorandums of Understanding signed between the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC, Kuching, Malaysia) and the Japan Research Consortium for Tropical Forests in Sarawak (JRCTS, Sendai, Japan) in November 2005, and between the Sarawak Forest Department (SFD, Kuching, Malaysia) and JRCTS in December 2012.

One of these processes is interspecific killing, the most extreme form of interference competition among carnivores. Subdominant species can avoid falling victim to other carnivores through spatial and/or temporal separation. The smallest carnivore species, including members of the Mustelidae, are typically the most threatened by other predators but are also exceedingly challenging to study in the wild. As a consequence, we have only limited knowledge of how the most at-risk members of carnivore communities deal with being both hunters and hunted. We explored whether activity and space use of a little-known small carnivore, the Altai mountain weasel Mustela altaica, reflect the activity and distribution of its main prey, pika Ochotona sp., and two sympatric predators, the stone marten Martes foina and the red fox Vulpes vulpes. Spatial and temporal patterns of photographic captures in Pakistan's northern mountains suggest that weasels may cope with being both predator and prey by frequenting areas used by pikas while exhibiting diurnal activity that contrasts with that of the mostly nocturnal/crepuscular stone marten and red fox. Camera trap studies are now common and are staged in many different ecosystems. The data yielded offer an opportunity not only to fill knowledge gaps concerning less-studied species but also to non-invasively test ecological hypotheses linked with rarity and elusiveness.","[Bischof, R.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway; [Ali, H.; Kabir, M.; Hameed, S.; Nawaz, M.

The strength and direction of these interactions are likely to be determined by the availability of resources, particularly among species of the same ecological guild. Understanding how species interact in such environments can provide insights into the conditions that facilitate their coexistence. We determined the potential for interspecific interactions among 3 resident medium-sized mammalian herbivores inhabiting the alpine tundra and investigated how they share available space and resources. Overlap in their respective activity areas indicated that these species were aggregated at a landscape scale, but other mechanisms allowed their coexistence at a finer scale. Their distributions were primarily associated with shorter distances to heterospecifics and, secondly, with habitat features related to shelter and escape from predation. Our results suggest that these species can (and do) coexist by partitioning their ecological niches. Competition is likely not a major factor in structuring these communities; in turn, facilitative mechanisms may allow co-occurrence of these sympatric herbivores in seasonal, low productivity environments.","[Barrio, Isabel C.; Hik, David S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Barrio, Isabel C.] Inst Pirenaico Ecol CSIC, Jaca 22700, Spain","Barrio, IC (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",icbarrio@gmail.com,"Barrio, Isabel C/F-8566-2010; Hik, David S/B-3462-2009","Barrio, Isabel C/0000-0002-8120-5248; Hik, David S/0000-0002-8994-9305","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Consejeria de Educacion, Ciencia y Cultura (JCCM, Spain); European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF)","Special thanks are due to F.

Interspecific competition among specialised co-occurring predators capturing termites should be high. Here we investigated various niche dimensions, namely temporal, spatial and trophic, of a couple of jumping spider species of the genusStenaelurillus(Stenaelurillus guttigerandS. modestus) from South Africa, to find whether these two species co-exist and along which niche dimension(s) they differentiate. The two species co-occurred in two out of five study sites. Body size was not significantly different between the species. The phenology was shifted so that one species matured earlier. Circadian activity was not different, as both species were diurnal and active at similar times. Both species preyed almost exclusively on termites. The fundamental trophic niche was very similar and rather narrow. The realised trophic niche at the prey order level of both species was similar, but at the genus level it was different. InS. modestusit was narrower, as it captured mainlyOdontotermes, whileS. guttigerexploited a few termite species. The size of prey captured was also similar between the two species. The frequency of intraguild predation was negligible. We conclude that bothStenaelurillusspecies are specialised termitophagous predators. The two species can coexist across broad spatial scales due to spatial segregation on the landscape. At the sites where they co-occur, the two species specialise on different termite prey, promoting local coexistence.","[Pekar, Stano; Petrakova Dusatkova, Lenka; Michalek, Ondrej] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Haddad, Charles R.] Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, Bloemfontein, South Africa","Pekr, S (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic.",pekar@sci.muni.cz,,,Masaryk University [MUNI/A/1078/2017]; National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [112127],"We would like to thank E.

In nature, however, stream pools often contain not just sunfish and water striders, but also smaller fish such as minnows. Here, we used factorial experiments in seminatural streams to document the direct and indirect effects of sunfish and fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, on water strider survival and behavior. Sunfish, minnows and gerrids all consume surface prey (here, crickets); thus these three species are potential food competitors. Sunfish eat minnows. Accordingly, the presence of sunfish caused minnows to increase their schooling behavior and shift their activity from the surface toward the bottom substrate. The presence of sunfish was also associated with an increase in the number of missing gerrids, whereas minnows caused relatively little gerrid disappearance. Most interestingly, the presence of minnows decreased the effect of sunfish on gerrid disappearance rates; that is, minnows apparently had an indirect positive effect on water strider survival. We suggest that this indirect positive effect reflects the fact that minnows are alternative prey for sunfish. The effects of sunfish and minnows on gerrid mortality explained the influence of these fish on gerrid behavior. Sunfish caused decreases in male gerrid activity, female availability, mating activity, mating frequency and mating duration. Larger males had a mating advantage over smaller males only in pools with sunfish and no minnows. Sunfish also caused a borderline significant decrease in the large female mating advantage. These results were all observed in previous studies and can be viewed as adaptive responses to predation risk. These patterns were not consistent with the expected effects of sunfish as food competitors with water striders. In contrast, minnows had relatively Little influence on water strider behavior and the few significant effects were the opposite of those of sunfish. Minnows caused increases in female activity and in mating duration, a decrease in the large male mating advantage and an increase in the large female mating advantage. These patterns fit the view that minnows caused an increase in gerrid hunger, i.e., that minnows acted as food competitors with gerrids. Finally, planned contrasts against controls showed that, in the presence of both sunfish and minnows, water striders showed no significant behavioral responses to fish (i.e., gerrid behavior in pools with sunfish and minnows did not significantly differ from behavior in fishless pools). The most likely mechanism explaining this pattern is a dilution of sunfish predation risk due to the presence of minnows serving as alternative prey for sunfish.",,"Sih, A (corresponding author), UNIV KENTUCKY,TH MORGAN SCH BIOL SCI,CTR ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV,LEXINGTON,KY 40506, USA.",,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,42,26,26,0,6,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1996,105,2,,,,,179,188,,10.1007/BF00328544,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TV593,WOS:A1996TV59300006,28307080,,,,2021-09-23,

It has been shown that the reproductive success of birds of prey is closely related to food availability. However, relatively little is known about intraspecific differences in reproductive success of birds in relation to varying ecological conditions across environmental gradients. We investigated the reproductive performance of Tengmalm's Owls Aegolius funereus in a temperate (Czech Republic, 50 degrees N) and a boreal (Finland, 63 degrees N) population in relation to long-term variations in the abundance of their main prey (small rodents). Prey densities at the northern site were much higher, but there were also large inter-annual fluctuations and years with steep summer declines of vole densities. Northern owls laid larger clutches but offspring production per nest was similar at both study sites. This resulted from higher nestling mortality in the northern population, especially in nests established later in the season. Despite much greater nesting losses due to predation by Pine Martens Martes martes, productivity at the population level was about four times greater at the temperate site, mainly due to the much higher breeding densities compared with Finland. Tengmalm's Owls at the temperate study site may benefit from relatively stable prey abundance, a more diverse prey community that offers alternative prey during vole scarcity, longer nights in summer that allow more time for foraging, and a lower level of interspecific competition with other vole-specialized predators.","[Zarybnicka, Marketa; Stastny, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, CZ-16521 Prague, Czech Republic; [Sedlacek, Ondrej] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Salo, Palvi; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Sedlacek, O (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Vinicna 7, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic.",zbrd@email.cz,"ZArybnickA, MarkA©ta/AAM-3181-2020; Sedlacek, Ondrej/A-1667-2009","Zarybnicka, Marketa/0000-0001-5883-0988","Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [CIGA 20144203]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [FRVS 41110-1161-1625]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [138638, 123379, 136717, 250709]","We are grateful to V.

Previous studies have suggested that the reason for the fragmented distribution pattern of E. depressa is competitive displacement by the sympatric C. stellatus, following random settlement. This hypothesis is in agreement with the common model of zonation suggested by Connell that lower distribution limits are determined by biotic factors (competition and predation), while upper limits are set by physical factors. It is hard to test the validity of this model for this barnacle pair since the early ontogenetic stages of the species are morphologically indistinguishable, hindering our ability to understand distribution processes. Using 16S mtDNA as a genetic marker in a multiplex PCR system, cyprids and spats were individually identified. Settlement and recruitment rates were assessed using settlement plates, and the effect of post-settlement processes was tested with transplantation of settlers between zones. Results showed different strategies in each species: settlement of E. depressa was habitat-specific, while settlement of C. stellatus was random. Shifting individuals of C stellatus to the high and cryptic zones resulted in high mortality; however, exposing juveniles of E. depressa that settled in artificially cryptic low shore habitat to C stellatus presence had no effect on their survival. These finding do not agree with the formerly suggested hypothesis that zonation is mainly determined by post-settlement factors, and that the interspecies boundary is determined by interspecific competition, implying that competition model cannot be adapted to Mediterranean intertidal zonation and that other models, dominated by physical enforcement and pre-settlement recruitment-limiting factors, may prevail in this ecosystem.

An amazing variety of mammals produce seismic vibrations by drumming a part of their body on a substrate. The drumming can communicate multiple messages to conspecifics about territorial ownership, competitive superiority, submission. readiness to mate, or presence of predators. Drumming also functions in interspecific communication when prey animals drum to communicate to predators that they are too alert for a successful ambush. The diversity of mammals that drum in varied contexts suggest independent evolution in different lineages. Footdrumming, as with other signals, probably originated by ritualization of older forms of behavior not associated with communication such as running and digging. Footdrumming patterns are species specific and range from single thumps to individual footdrum signatures. Although mammals communicate above ground with airborne drumming signals, they can also transmit sound seismically into the burrow where the signals become airborne and are received with ears especially adapted to hear low-frequency sound. Footdrumming has been studied the most extensively in kangaroo rats, Dipodomys. A comparison of species of different body mass shows that smaller sized, non-territorial species have no ritualized footdrumming; medium-sized species drum a simple pattern in limited contexts; while larger-sized species communicate territorial ownership with complex patterns. Future studies should examine the mechanics and energy requirements of drumming to test hypotheses about body size limitations on the evolution of footdrumming. Our understanding of drumming as communication is limited until investigators conduct field tests of responses to drumming signals in the contexts in which the signals are generated.","San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA","Randall, JA (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",jrandall@sfsu.edu,,,,,,107,70,71,1,26,SOC INTEGRATIVE COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY,MCLEAN,"1313 DOLLEY MADISON BLVD, NO 402, MCLEAN, VA 22101 USA",0003-1569,,,AM ZOOL,Am.

There is, however, some debate as to the actual mechanisms producing these unhealthy trees. To investigate further some of the processes that may be contributing to this form of canopy dieback, two field trials were carried out in Olney State Forest, near Wyong, New South Wales. The study site contained Eucalyptus saligna (Sydney blue gum) with canopy dieback and was occupied by a large colony of bell miners. Close examination of the foliage revealed a large and diverse suite of phytophagous insects, including at least 16 species of psyllid (Hemiptera: Psyllidae). In the first trial, the use of bird exclusion cages over selected branches significantly improved leaf survival compared to leaves exposed to a relatively high density of bell miners. It is proposed thar colonization by bell miners may interfere with the efficacy of both other insectivorous birds (through aggressive interspecific territoriality) and the invertebrate predators and parasitoids. Interference with such regulatory factors may enable some phytophagous insect populations To rise to sustained damaging levels. In the second trial, an insecticide application combined. with reduced competition from the dense understorey and neighbouring trees was required to significantly improve trunk diameter and crown condition scores. After 12 months, neither treatment, by itself, significantly improved both growth measures. Possibly both treatments were required because the E. saligna trees were suffering from another source of stress (e.g. drought) in addition to the relatively high level of insect attack.",,"Stone, C (corresponding author), STATE FORESTS NEW S WALES,DIV RES,POB 100,BEECROFT,NSW 2119,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,34,29,33,0,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

Here, we present the results of a baseline study designed to assess the status of this exotic species in northeastern Ohio and to explore its potential impacts on local ant communities and the extent to which it has been incorporated into the diet of a native predator, the red-backed salamander. At the sites where N. flavipes occurred, we found a sixfold increase in total ant abundance, with 87% of all ants collected being N. flavipes. The high numerical dominance of N. flavipes did not lead to observable changes in the species richness and abundance of the native ant community. At baits, N. flavipes did not engage in interspecific combat and did not exhibit aggression towards native ants. Thus, aggression and interference competition are not likely factors explaining the high local abundance of N. flavipes. Red-backed salamanders have incorporated N. flavipes into their diet, but further research is needed to understand the interactions of N. flavipes within the forest-floor food web. Although we did not detect changes in the local ant communities in the presence of N. flavipes, we argue that this species' high local abundance and ability to forage at cooler temperatures may give it a competitive advantage and thereby affect native ants through exploitative competition.","[Ivanov, Kaloyan] Cleveland Museum Nat Hist, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Lockhart, Owen M.; Walton, B.

We examined the relative importance of both biotic (initial height, conspecific seedling density) and abiotic (canopy openness, per cent sand, soil water content) drivers using survival data for 1842 seedlings of 12 dipterocarp species for 1.5 y following mast fruiting in an old-growth Bornean tropical rain forest. More than 30% of all dipterocarp seedlings survived 1.5 y after mast fruiting. When all species were analysed together, we found that initial seedling height, canopy openness and conspecific seedling density affected dipterocarp seedling survival. Negative density dependence indicated that predators were not satiated, but dipterocarp seedlings rather suffered from host-specific natural enemies or intraspecific competition. Species-level analyses of seven dipterocarp species showed large variation in response to biotic and abiotic factors. These results suggest that interspecific differences in the relative importance of biotic and abiotic effects on seedling survival might contribute to species coexistence.","[Oshima, Chiaki] Nagoya Univ, Fac Agr, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Tokumoto, Yuji; Nakagawa, Michiko] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Nakagawa, M (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",miko@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Tokumoto, Yuji/AAG-9495-2019","Tokumoto, Yuji/0000-0001-5934-026X","Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [D-04]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, and CultureMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [20687002, 23255002, 26660124]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [226034]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26660124] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank the Forest Department Sarawak and Sarawak Forestry Corporation for permitting research activities in Lambir Hills National Park, and researchers and local people for helping with field survey.

Little is known about the ecology of these crabs or the factors that influence their distribution in mangrove forests. Pitfall traps were used to sample grapsid crabs in the Murray River estuary in north Queensland. Sampling was conducted at five sites along a salinity gradient from <1 parts-per-thousand at upstream sites to >35 parts-per-thousand at the river mouth. At each site, trapping was done in both low and high intertidal forests. We characterized the sediments at each site by measuring percent sand, silt, clay and organic matter, Eh, pH, and soil pore-water salinity. Four species of grapsids dominated the crab fauna along the Murray River (Sesarma semperi-longicristatum, S. messa, S. brevicristatum, and S. brevipes). Distinct zonation patterns were found along the salinty gradient and between high and low intertidal forests. S. messa was dominant in high intertidal, downstream forests, high and low intertidal forests in the middle to downstream portion of the river, and in low intertidal forests in the central reach of the river. S. brevipes was dominant in both low and high intertidal zone forests at low salinity upstream sites. S. brevicristatum was most abundant in the central reaches of the river and only in the high intertidal zone. S. semperi-longicristatum was found only in the low intertidal zone, downstream forest. Subsequently, tests of salinity tolerances of these crabs were carried out in the laboratory. These indicated very wide tolerances over salinities from completely fresh to hypersaline (60 parts-per-thousand). The osmoregulatory abilities of the crabs were also found to vary. However, neither their salinity tolerance nor osmoregulatory ability adequately explain the zonation patterns we measured in the field. For example, S. brevicristatum had the most restricted distribution, but it had the second broadest salinity tolerance and osmoregulatory ability. Sediment characteristics explained a significant amount of the variation in abundance for two of the crab species. Pore-water salinity provided no explanatory power for any of the species. Individual species abundances are probably influenced by additional factors such as interspecific competition and predation.","AUSTRALIAN INST MARINE SCI,TOWNSVILLE,QLD 4810,AUSTRALIA",,,"Frusher, Stewart/G-5117-2014","Frusher, Stewart/0000-0003-2493-3676",,,,41,59,66,0,28,ESTUARINE RES FEDERATION,LAWRENCE,"PO BOX 368, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0160-8347,,,ESTUARIES,Estuaries,SEP,1994,17,3,,,,,647,654,,10.2307/1352412,,,8,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,QA359,WOS:A1994QA35900012,,,,,2021-09-23,

On coral reefs, structural complexity is typically measured using a single and small-scale metric ('rugosity') that represents multiple spatial attributes differentially exploited by species, thus limiting a complete understanding of how fish associate with reef structure. We used a novel approach to compare relationships between fishes and previously unavailable components of reef complexity, and contrasted the results against the traditional rugosity index. This study focused on damselfish to explore relationships between fishes and reef structure. Three territorial species, with contrasting trophic habits and expected use of the reef structure, were examined to infer the potential species-specific mechanisms associated with how complexity influences habitat selection. Three-dimensional reef reconstructions from photogrammetry quantified the following metrics of habitat quality: 1) visual exposure to predators and competitors, 2) density of predation refuges and 3) substrate-related food availability. These metrics explained the species distribution better than the traditional measure of rugosity, and each species responded to different complexity components. Given that a critical effect of reef degradation is loss of structure, adopting three-dimensional technologies potentially offers a new tool to both understand species-habitat association and help forecast how fishes will be affected by the flattening of reefs.","[Gonzalez-Rivero, M.; Ganase, A.; Hoegh-Guldberg, O.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Gonzalez-Rivero, M.; Harborne, A.

Although both seastars have similar size structures and generally overlapped in their spatial and temporal distribution, the degree of overlap varied in different sites and appeared to be related to prey abundance, substratum type and slope. Three general patterns were observed: (1) both species aggregating in shallow water and decreasing in numbers with depth; (2) the two species showing inverse depth distributions; and (3) both seastars occurring in low numbers across the subtidal zone. Temporal changes in availability of the preferred prey of the two seastars, the mussel Mytilus edulis, appeared to be a major factor affecting their abundance and distribution. The two seastars occurred together in dense aggregations on mussel beds in shallow water. They consume similar-sized mussels until the number of mussels becomes reduced when A. vulgaris, but not L. polaris, begins to select larger mussels. Once a mussel bed is decimated, the seastars appear to move away, possibly in search of other beds. Intensive seastar foraging limits the distribution of mussels to a few metres in depth. Below the mussel zone, the two seastars are spatially segregated at a small spatial scale (l m(2) quadrat) and select different alternative prey, L. polaris feeding mainly on the crevice-dwelling clam Hiatella arctica and A. vulgaris on the ophiuroid Ophiopholis aculeata. The size partitioning of the preferred prey in shallow water, and spatial segregation and selection of different alternative prey at greater depths may reflect mechanisms permitting the two seastars to coexist.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, GIROQ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Gaymer, CF (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,81,56,59,2,42,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4221 USA",0025-3154,,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

This biodiversity loss is generally facilitated by human activities such as land cover change and hydrological alternation. Recent advances in stable isotope analysis (SIA) have been highlighted in many studies addressing fundamental issues in invasion ecology, especially in quantifying competition for resources between native and exotic species. However, how anthropogenic disturbance influences trophic relationships among invasive and native species remains poorly understood. Location Middle-lower Yangtze River Region, China. Methods To investigate the effects of human disturbance on interspecific trophic interactions, this study compared isotopic niche space and overlap of the introduced red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and the native oriental river shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) and freshwater snail (Bellamya aeruginosa) in natural and modified wetlands. Results Based on carbon and nitrogen SIA, we found ubiquitous niche shifts in macroinvertebrates with increased competition, which might lead to significant niche contraction in modified habitats at both community and population scales. Moreover, the isotopic niche width of the exotic crayfish was twice as larger as that of natives at both habitats, suggesting that the exotic P. clarkii had great competitive superiority over the native species. However, the effects of habitat modification on niche overlap were inconsistent. While the niche overlap between crayfish and shrimp was significantly higher in modified habitats than in natural open waters, niche overlap between crayfish and the snail was significantly reduced. Main conclusions Collectively, our findings highlight that the competitive outcomes of interspecific trophic interactions can be dependent on the prey availability and diversity, which embraces both the classic optimal foraging theory and competition theory to understand how environmental change, such as habitat alternation, affects the biological invasion processes.","[Wang, Yuyu; Tan, Wenzhuo; Li, Bin; Wen, Li; Lei, Guangchun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuyu; Tan, Wenzhuo; Li, Bin; Lei, Guangchun] Natl Field Sci Observat & Res Stn Dongting Lake W, Hanshou, Peoples R China; [Wen, Li] NSW Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Sci Div, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Lei, GC (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",guangchun.lei@foxmail.com,,"WEN, LI/0000-0003-3783-3826; Wang, Yuyu/0000-0003-2081-5277",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017ZY15]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0405303],"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2017ZY15; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFC0405303",,80,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

We conducted an experiment to evaluate how pond hydroperiod affected the ability of two larval anuran species (Hyla squirella and Bufo terrestris) to interact with intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Pond hydroperiod altered how an increase in the abundance of intraspecific competitors affected fitness components of B. terrestris but not for H. squirella. Specifically, an increase in intraspecific abundance caused a reduction in B. terrestris survivorship in short hydroperiod ponds but had no effect on fitness components of B. terrestris in long hydroperiod ponds. Interspecific competition did not occur between these species in either short or long hydroperiod ponds. Our study highlights the point that the strength of density-dependent processes operating in the aquatic environment can depend on pond hydroperiod. Consequently, the extent to which processes operating in the aquatic environment contribute to the regulation of population and metapopulation size for amphibians will also likely depend on pond hydroperiod.","[Rogers, Tracy Noel; Chalcraft, David R.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Chalcraft, DR (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",chalcraftd@ecu.edu,,"Chalcraft, David/0000-0002-2165-0948",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716558],"This work was completed in partial fulfillment of the degree requirements for a Master of Science degree at East Carolina University.

In situ populations of Australia's iconic marsupial, the greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis), are nearing extinction due to the impacts of competition and predation by feral animals and unpredictable climatic events (summer heat waves). In this study, we focussed our aim to identify a non-invasive method to measure adrenal activity in the species and also to identify potential factors that should be considered when comparing physiological stress in semi-free ranging populations of the species. We validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detecting fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) from fresh fecal pellets taken from bilbies within four captive sites and two semi-free ranging populations around Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Our FCM EIA successfully detected the 'raise and fall' pattern of FCM levels within 3 days of exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge. Mean FCM levels differed significantly between the captive sites and between sexes. All male bilbies grouped outdoor in captivity expressed the highest mean FCM level in comparison to all captive males that were housed individually or as groups indoors. Also, semi-free ranging bilbies expressed higher mean FCM levels than the captive bilbies. Overall, our study successfully validated a non-invasive tool for monitoring physiological stress in the greater bilby. In the future, it will be worthwhile to consider factors such as housing conditions, sex and location when comparing the adrenal sensitivity to environmental changes, to help evaluate the success of management interventions (such as predator free enclosures) and support the survival of the species.","[Narayan, Edward J.; Evans, Nicole; Hero, Jean-Marc] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia","Narayan, EJ (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",e.narayan@ga.griffith.edu.au,"Narayan, Edward/E-8238-2016","Narayan, Edward/0000-0003-2719-0900",Save the Bilby Fund; Griffith UniversityGriffith University; Griffith University's Animal Ethics Committee [ENV/17/11/AEC],"This project was completed in accordance with approval from Griffith University's Animal Ethics Committee (ENV/17/11/AEC).

Furthermore, data on small mammal assemblage composition in two different environmental types (i.e. woodland and grassland) were drawn from previous studies performed in the study areas. The three owls preyed chiefly upon small mammals, while birds were occasionally eaten. The trophic niches of A. otus in the three study areas were significantly narrower than that of T. alba and S. aluco. These latter species varied the size of their prey between the three localities, while A. otus preyed upon similarly sized prey in the three study areas. By using data on small mammal occurrence we tried to estimate the environmental type where the owls conducted their predatory activity: principal component analysis revealed that A. otus was linked to the cultivated fields as foraging habitat, while S. aluco and ir: alba were less selective in the choice of hunting habitat. Furthermore, discriminant analysis indicated that species dietary habits maintained their distinguishing features also in distant localities. However, it appeared that owls did not use foraging resource with an exclusive strategy: evidences from this study are consistent with the hypothesis of a selective use of the trophic resource by A. otus, while diets of T. alba and S. aluco showed differences between the three localitites.","Ist Nazl Fauna Selvat, I-40064 Ozzano Emilia, Italy; Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sci Biol, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; Inst Ecol, CNF, Calabar, Cross River Sta, Nigeria","Capizzi, D (corresponding author), Ist Nazl Fauna Selvat, Via Ca Fornacetta 9, I-40064 Ozzano Emilia, Italy.",me3176@mclink.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020; CAPIZZI, DARIO/O-6431-2019","Capizzi, Dario/0000-0003-0871-9602",,,,67,9,10,1,15,SOC NATL PROTECTION NATURE ACCLIMATATION FRANCE,PARIS 5,"57 RUE CUVIER, 75005 PARIS 5, FRANCE",0249-7395,,,REV ECOL-TERRE VIE,Rev.

To understand how the semiaquatic bug communities are shaped, it was first verified whether there was a pattern of co-occurrence between species. It was subsequently tested whether the pattern found was related to environmental variables. Lastly, it was verified whether morphological divergence between species was present in the morphological and functional traits selected. 2. A pattern of species co-occurrence was found in the studied assemblage, related to both environmental variables and interspecific biological interactions. Pairs of species with negative, positive, and random co-occurrence were found. Traits related to predation competition, sexual competition, and interaction with the environment showed significant morphological divergence. 3. Therefore, more than one process defines species co-occurrence patterns in semiaquatic bug communities. It is suggested that environmental influence is related to species microhabitat preference. On the other hand, the morphological divergence found is related to competition and sharing of food resources.","[Guterres, Alana P.

The main factors that are thought to influence population size are either resources (bottom-up), or predation (top-down), or interspecific competition (parallel). However, there are highly variable and often contradictory results regarding their relative strengths and influence. These varied results are often interpreted as indicating shifting control among the three main factors, or a complex, nonlinear relationship among environmental variables, resource availability, predation, and competition. We argue here that there is a missing link in our understanding of predator-prey dynamics. We explore whether the landscape-of-fear model can help us clarify the inconsistencies and increase our understanding of the roles, extent, and possible interactions of top-down, bottom-up, and parallel factors on prey population abundance. We propose two main predictions derived from the landscape-of-fear model: (1) for a single species, we suggest that as the makeup of the landscape of fear changes from relatively safe to relatively risky, bottom-up impacts switch from strong to weak as top-down impacts go from weak to strong; (2) for two or more species, interspecific competitive interactions produce various combinations of bottom-up, top-down, and parallel impacts depending on the dominant competing species and whether the landscapes of fear are shared or distinctive among competing species. We contend that these predictions could successfully explain many of the complex and contradictory results of current research. We test some of these predictions based on long-term data for small mammals from the Chihuahuan Desert in the United States. and Mexico. We conclude that the landscape-of-fear model does provide reasonable explanations for many of the reported studies and should be tested further to better understand the effects of bottom-up, top-down, and parallel factors on population dynamics.","[Laundre, John W.; Hernandez, Lucina; Lopez-Portillo, Jorge; Gonzalez-Romero, Alberto; Grajales-Tam, Karina M.] Inst Ecol, AC, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Laundre, John W.; Hernandez, Lucina; Gronemeyer, Peg] New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Laundre, John W.; Hernandez, Lucina] SUNY Coll Oswego, Oswego, NY 13126 USA; [Lopez Medina, Perla] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Queretaro 76010, Qro, Mexico; [Campanella, Andrea] New Mexico State Univ, Jornada Basin LTER USDA ARS, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Browning, Dawn M.] USDA ARS Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Laundre, JW (corresponding author), Inst Ecol, AC, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",launjohn@hotmail.com,"Portillo, Jorge Lopez/L-2492-2014; Gonzalez-Romero, Alberto/Q-6701-2018; Grajales-Tam, Karina Magdalena/Q-6828-2018","Portillo, Jorge Lopez/0000-0002-6827-3297; Gonzalez-Romero, Alberto/0000-0001-5800-1223; Grajales-Tam, Karina Magdalena/0000-0002-8880-3275; Browning, Dawn M./0000-0002-1252-6013",CONACyT of MexicoConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [1843P-N9507]; Earthwatch Institute; INECOL [902-16]; SEMAR-NAT of Mexico; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0004526]; New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Center; TE Inc.; American Society of Mammalogists; Ecological Society of America; ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service [ARS-0423561] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER,"This work was conducted in conjunction with the Mapimi Long-Term Exclusion Experiment (MLTER) coordinated by L.

In this study, we simplified the community assemblage to reduce interspecific competition and gain a better understanding of the role biotic conditions play in creating Yellow Perch fisheries. Yellow Perch were introduced into three recently renovated lakes in an attempt to increase growth rates through reduced interspecific competition and hypothetically allow fish to reach an acceptable size for angler harvest in a shorter period of time compared with four mixed-species lakes. Yellow Perch-only populations exhibited faster growth, potentially resulting from reduced interspecific competition, increased piscivory, and lower levels of activity. Yellow Perch-only populations also had more consistent recruitment, onset of maturation at age 1, and an earlier onset of sexual size dimorphism compared with mixed-species lakes and published literature. While limitations of density dependence were noted, natural resource managers are encouraged to investigate methods that would capitalize on the improved population dynamics of Yellow Perch-only lakes and the release from biotic controls.","[Munter, R.

In this study, we analyzed some aspects of the early Life history of the stone crab, focusing especially on (1) recruitment patterns among habitats and between years in intertidal zones, (2) habitat preferences, including some intra- and interspecific interactions that may affect habitat use, and (3) intraspecific interactions that may affect survival. We also evaluated the percent cover of suitable habitats for juvenile stone crabs in a MPA and a MEA. Sheltered habitats showed higher densities of juvenile H, plana than exposed areas, and sand with boulders showed the highest crab densities, followed by shell hash with boulders. Differences in mean densities were detected for all benthic stages among sheltered substrates, except for megalopae. Bare substrates (without boulders) showed the lowest density. Throughout the settlement period, abundance of smaller instars (<J2) was 3 times higher in 1995 than in 1996, while densities of >J4 were twice as high in 1996 than in 1995. Neither intra- nor interspecific space competition seems to explain the distribution of juvenile stone crabs in the field. However, cannibalism among juveniles may have an important effect on survival. Cannibalism among juveniles is density-dependent, and may have greater effects as the abundance of larger conspecifics increases since mutual interference does not affect proportional prey mortality per predator. We suggest that losses are high in low quality habitats (probably through emigration, predation or habitat disturbance due to wave impact), and cannibalism is an important source of mortality in high quality habitats (where crab density is high). Although substrate type and post-settlement processes can help explain the distribution of juvenile stone crabs, wave action seems to be the major determinant of juvenile distribution. Neither sheltered habitats nor the most suitable substrate are common in the MPA and MEA studied. These factors are not currently being considered in the assignation of MEAs or planning of MPAs, although they could explain the lack of effect of both protection strategies in increasing the abundance of the stone crabs in Chile in comparison to other exploited benthic species.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile","Fernandez, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",mfernand@genes.bio.puc.cl,,,,,,41,20,20,1,20,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The species was first observed in North America near Delaware Bay (39 degrees N, 75 degrees W) in 1988, and a variety of evidence suggests initial introduction via ballast water early in that decade. The crab spread rapidly after its discovery, and breeding populations currently extend from North Carolina to Maine (35 degrees-45 degrees N). H. sanguineus is now the dominant crab in rocky intertidal habitat along much of the northeast coast of the USA and has displaced resident crab species throughout this region. The Asian shore crab also occurs on the Atlantic coast of Europe and was first reported from Le Havre, France (49 degrees N, 0 degrees E) in 1999. Invasive populations now extend along 1000 km of coastline from the Cotentin Peninsula in France to Lower Saxony in Germany (48-53 degrees N). Success of the Asian shore crab in alien habitats has been ascribed to factors such as high fecundity, superior competition for space and food, release from parasitism, and direct predation on co-occurring crab species. Laboratory and field observations indicate that H. sanguineus is a generalist predator with potential for substantial effects on sympatric populations of mollusks and crustaceans. However, broad ecosystem effects and actual economic impact are unclear. The literature on H. sanguineus is limited in comparison to better known invasive species like the European green crab (Carcinus maenas) and the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). Nevertheless, there are substantial bodies of work on larval biology, trophic ecology, and interspecies competition. This paper presents a review of the biology and ecology of invasive populations of the Asian shore crab H. sanguineus in North American and European habitats. (c), 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The barrier includes several hundred kilometers without suitable habitat and is the convergence zone of major ocean currents. Within the barrier region, along-shore larval transport is expected to be erratic, with water moving offshore to form long-lived eddies. Through comparison of central and range edge populations, we test for evidence of recruitment limitation and interspecific competition with the whelk, Haustrum vinosum, which occurs sympatrically at the range edge. We found similar levels of recruitment and allozyme genetic variation within centre and edge populations where H. vinosum was absent, implying that populations are strongly interconnected. Nevertheless, recruitment and abundance of M. marginalba were lower at its extreme range limit, where it occurs with H. vinosum. Indeed, we detected significant inverse correlations between the abundance of these species, although their habitat use was similar and they consumed similar prey. These lines of evidence suggest a restricted recruitment across the barrier limits the range of M. marginalba but emphasize that multiple factors may act to set species range limits.

However, little data exists on local- and broad-scale tree seed immigration and recruitment in these communities. Interspecific competition and seed predation are two major causes of recruitment failure for plants. In North American urban forests, these pressures may be exacerbated by an altered disturbance regime and prevalent invasive species combined with dense populations of rodents and browsers. Preliminary investigation in an urban forest on the eastern shore of Lake Erie indicated very low long-term tree seedling recruitment in the mature canopy stands. Our competing hypotheses were that seed establishment (habitat suitability) and seed limitations (seed availability) explained the tree recruitment failure. We tested seed establishment using field experiments (burning and vertebrate herbivore exclosures) and seed limitation by introducing native tree seeds. Moreover, we tested also seed limitation by examining local and regional seed input using seed traps. We found that seedling recruitment increased significantly with experimental reductions in predators and competitors, suggesting strong biotic establishment limitations in the urban forest. In addition, seed rain correlated significantly with immediately proximate parent plants, but no species arrived beyond what occurs within 50 m of the experimental plots. Essentially, then, the existing canopy species are not replacing themselves and extant seeds are not immigrating to replace them. At the patch scale, habitat quality, particularly seed predation and browsing, as well as competition from nonnative understory shrubs, constrained native tree recruitment in the urban forest. At the landscape scale, the evidence of poor long-term seed recruitment and the lack of long-distance seed input also suggest low native tree seed availability. The tree recruitment failure suggests that, in the absence of active management, this urban forest may eventually convert to an invasive-species dominated urban shrubland.","[Labatore, Adam C.; Potts, Daniel L.; Warren, Robert J., II] SUNY Buffalo State, Dept Biol, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA; [Spiering, David J.] Buffalo Museum Sci, Tifft Nat Preserve, 1200 Fuhrmann Blvd, Buffalo, NY 14203 USA","Warren, RJ (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo State, Dept Biol, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.",hexastylis@gmail.com,,,,,,65,11,12,1,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,1573-1642,,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,APR,2017,20,2,,,,,393,401,,10.1007/s11252-016-0601-x,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Urban Studies,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,ER7RP,WOS:000399011500012,,,,,2021-09-23,

The consequences of intraguild interactions on the foraging efficiency of the two coccinellid species were investigated by evaluating the functional responses of single beetles and intra- and interspecific combinations to densities of the spirea aphid, Aphis citricola van der Goot (Hemiptera: Aphididae), on apple seedlings, during 2 and 12 h under laboratory conditions. A type II functional response was observed in all the bioassays. Solitary H. axyridis consumed significantly more aphids than single P. japonica in both exposure periods. However, at intermediate prey densities the prey consumption of P. japonica was slightly greater than that of H. axyridis. The 95% confidence intervals of the functional response curves of conspecific and heterospecific pairs overlapped at 2 h. In contrast, conspecific pairs of H. axyridis showed a higher functional response curve at 12 h compared to a combination of H. axyridis and P. japonica. Prey's predation risk reduction was only detected for paired H. axyridis and mixed predators compared to their estimated functional responses at the 2-h foraging period. By comparing functional responses between intraguild predatory lady beetle combinations, we could further predict the potential ecosystem service provided by these natural enemies.","[Feng, Yi; Zhou, Zhao-Xu; An, Meng-Ru; Li, Yu-Dan; Liu, Zhi-Guo; Wang, Lin-Lin; Ren, Jin-Ze; Liu, Tong-Xian] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yi; Zhou, Zhao-Xu; An, Meng-Ru; Li, Yu-Dan; Liu, Zhi-Guo; Wang, Lin-Lin; Ren, Jin-Ze; Liu, Tong-Xian] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Minist Agr, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops Northwes, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zhao-Xu] Gansu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Liu, TX (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Liu, TX (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Minist Agr, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops Northwes, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",txliu@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"Liu, Tong-Xian/0000-0002-7686-0686",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31272089]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Z109021611]; national college students' science and technology innovation project [201610712004],"We thank Xing-Lin Yu for assistance in field collection of insects.

Little information is available on the importance of biotic interactions in shaping the communities in these habitats. A common observation in the freshwater rock pool community assembly process is the clearly separated density peaks of fairy shrimp (Anostraca) and cladocerans (Anomopoda) over time. Fairy shrimp (Anostraca), the flagship group and dominant filter feeders of temporary waters hatch early after inundation. This contrasts with the occurrence pattern of coexisting cladocerans, which despite higher chances of abortive hatching occur later during the hydroperiod. To study this apparent succession pattern and test the possible presence of a biotic interaction, we set up enclosure experiments in freshwater rock pools in Western Australia and monitored cladoceran (Macrothrix hardingii) densities in the presence of variable densities or absence of fairy shrimp (Branchinella longirostris). The anomopod cladoceran populations decreased with increasing anostracan densities revealing a negative biotic interaction. The competitive dominance of anostracans most probably was mainly due to exploitation competition, with possibly elements of interference competition or predation included. Early hatching and competitive superiority may help anostracans in temporary pools to monopolize the habitat with respect to small and/or other filter feeding invertebrates. As such they influence succession dynamics and invertebrate community structure, making anostracans keystone species of temporary pools.","[Jocque, M.; Vanschoenwinkel, B.; Brendonck, L.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Jocque, M (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Cent Lab Gen Ecol, 2 Yurii Gagarin St, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria.",MerlijnJocque@gmail.com,"Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/I-9021-2019","Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/0000-0002-8973-6297; Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420",IWT (Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); Fund for scientific research Flanders (FWO)FWO [G.0118.03],"We thank David Angeler, Anne Robertson and an anonymous reviewer for suggestions to improve the manuscript.

We recently showed that P. mulleri infection was associated with G. d. celticus hosts being more vulnerable to predation by the invasive amphipod Gammarus pulex. Parasitized G. d. celticus also had a reduced ability to prey upon other co-occurring amphipods. We suggested the parasite may have pervasive influences on host ecology and behaviour. Here, we examine the association between P. mulleri parasitism and parameters influencing individual host fitness, behaviour and interspecific interactions. We also investigate the relationship between parasite prevalence and host population structure in the field. In our G. d. celticus study population, P. mulleri prevalence was strongly seasonal, ranging from 8.5% in summer to 44.9% in winter. The relative abundance of hosts with the heaviest parasite burden increased during summer, which coincided with high host mortality, suggesting that parasitism may regulate host abundance to some degree. Females were more likely to be parasitized than males and parasitized males were paired with smaller females than unparasitized males. Parasitism was associated with reduction in the host's activity level and reduced both its predation on the isopod Asellus aquaticus and aggression towards precopula pairs of the invasive G. pulex. We discuss the pervasive influence of this parasite on the ecology of its host.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Ctr Med Biol, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; Univ Leeds, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England","MacNeil, C (corresponding author), Govt Lab, Ballakermeen Rd, Douglas 1M1 4BR, Man, England.",,,"Dunn, Alison/0000-0002-4855-1077",,,,24,26,26,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0031-1820,,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,SEP,2005,131,,3,,,,331,336,,10.1017/S0031182005007754,,,6,Parasitology,Parasitology,970MZ,WOS:000232315600006,16178354,,,,2021-09-23,

Several hypotheses address the behavioral mechanisms driving the impacts of this mutualism, but relatively few studies have considered multiple ant species simultaneously as well as interspecific and intraspecific variation in ant behavior. In a series of field experiments that manipulated ant diet, this work examines the role of induced behaviors of forest ant species actively engaged in mutualism with Hemiptera. Based on other work in ant mutualisms, we predicted a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors towards prey and competitors by ants in the presence of honeydew-producing Hemiptera. We specifically compared Camponotus chromaoides and Formica neogagates (Formicidae), two abundant species in temperate forests of the northeastern U.S.A. After manipulating ant diet and interactions with sap-feeders experimentally, we observed 494 one-on-one interactions between ants and competitors, ladybird beetles and caterpillar prey. We found that C. chromaoides, exhibited behavioral dominance over F. neogagates, and C. chromaoides was more likely to attack ladybird beetles, competing ants, and caterpillar prey. However, contrary to other work in ant-Hemipteran mutualisms, we observed no evidence that food rewards provided by sap-feeders induced changes in ant behavior for either ant species examined. These results reveal the importance of considering interspecific differences in behavior as a mechanism underlying the ecological impacts of ant-Hemipteran protection mutualisms.","[Clark, Robert E.; Singer, Michael S.] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA","Clark, RE (corresponding author), Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",rclark@wesleyan.edu,,,NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1404177],"This work was supported by NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant DEB-1404177.

Behavioural-scale measurements on a guild of five species of freshwater pond snails (Mollusca: Pulmonata) indicate a trade-off between the ability to utilize a patch's resource and the ability to quickly find new resource patches. Community-level experiments demonstrate that both species richness and composition are affected by the patchiness of the environment. In particular, treatments with low patchiness are dominated by species best at exploiting local resources (diggers) whereas treatments with high patchiness are dominated by species best at finding new patches (grazers). Results from a controlled mesocosm experiment with two of the most common of these species, Helisoma trivolvis (a relative digger) and Physella gyrina (Physidae) (a relative grazer) show that the patchiness of the environment strongly influences the outcomes of interspecific competition among these two species: the digger performed much better in less patchy habitats, whereas the grazer performed better in more patchy habitats. A two-species model of diggers and grazers modified to incorporate behavioural aspects of patchiness produces this same pattern of competitive outcomes.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Amsterdam, Populat Biol Sect, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands","Chase, JM (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jchase@pitt.edu,,"Richards, Shane/0000-0002-9638-5827",,,,40,46,47,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

The gall's position on H. spinosa is verv specific, reflected in the fact that the gall maker attaches principally to the basal floral buds of the inflorescence, and in the lower sector of the plant. We labelled inflorescences with and without galls in order to (quantify goat herbivory and gall predation. The goat feeds both on plants and infructescences with or without galls, resulting in gall destruction and larval death (phenotypic selection). The browsing behaviour of goat was influenced by the general stunted growth of the plant, as well as by the abundance of spiny stems. This fact allows chalcids to escape goat herbivory on a very fine spatial scale. Gall survival strongly depends on gall position in the inflorescence, being greater in the lower position. Furthermore, galls situated in the lower sector of the plant have a greater survival chance than galls situated in the upper sector. The goat acted as a true predator of the gall maker wasp, becoming a potential selective agent conditioning the reproductive success of Systasis. The relationship between goat and gall-maker is an asymmetrical hierarchy mediated by size differences, the bigger one conditions the smaller one, but the reverse does not occur. We propose that under low herbivore pressure, the gall makers (and similar invertebrate sessile forms) will show a spatial oviposition preference which is less selective that under strong herbivore pressure.",,"ZAMORA, R (corresponding author), UNIV GRANADA,FAC CIENCIAS,DEPT BIOL ANIM & ECOL,E-18001 GRANADA,SPAIN.",,"Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017; Zamora, Renato/ABE-6898-2020; Zamora, Regino/B-3179-2010","Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664; Zamora, Renato/0000-0002-2223-3361; Zamora, Regino/0000-0002-5049-9968",,,,33,25,26,0,11,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1993,66,2,,,,,223,228,,10.2307/3544808,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KJ535,WOS:A1993KJ53500006,,,,,2021-09-23,

Experiments of multiple predator effects on prey populations are extremely demanding, as the number of treatments and the amount of labour associated with these experiments increases exponentially with the number of species in question. Therefore, researchers tend to vary only presence/absence of the species and use only one (supposedly realistic) combination of their numbers in experiments. However, nonlinearities in density dependence, functional responses, interactions between natural enemies etc. are typical for such systems, and nonlinear models of population dynamics generally predict qualitatively different results, if initial absolute densities of the species studied differ, even if their relative densities are maintained. Therefore, testing combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities may not be sufficient. Here we test this prediction experimentally. We show that the population dynamics of a system consisting of 2 natural enemies (aphid predator Adalia bipunctata (L.), and aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani Viereck) and their shared prey (peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer) are strongly affected by the absolute initial densities of the species in question. Even if their relative densities are kept constant, the natural enemy species or combination thereof that most effectively suppresses the prey may depend on the absolute initial densities used in the experiment. Future empirical studies of multiple predator - one prey interactions should therefore use a two-dimensional array of initial densities of the studied species. Varying only combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities is not sufficient and can lead to misleading results.","[Ameixa, Olga M. C.

We investigated the effect of social status on neophobic responses using 10 captive coyote breeding pairs. Social status was determined from observations of feeding behavior and agonistic interactions during a series of reference trials. Once dominance was established, we surrounded an experimental area with novel stimuli (ropes adorned with interspersed flags) to create a novel context around a familiar food source. Contrary to hypotheses, dominant coyotes were first to feed, showed more interest toward novel stimuli, and eventually crossed the barrier, which subordinates never did. Our results indicate that dominant coyotes are less neophobic of novel settings that contain familiar food than subordinates are. Since a reduction in neophobia can be interpreted as an increase in risk taking, our results support previous observations that dominant (alpha) coyotes take more risks than subordinates. Our results also suggest reasons for differential observations of coyote behavior in the field: artificial selection against bold behavior in populations undergoing predator control.

The system permits a detailed study of localised competition with major implications for coral reefs with respect to human impacts including climate change. Using underwater video cameras, this study examined competition among 30 species of large reef fishes (from nine families) for access to shelter provided by 26 tabular structures, which may be the highest reported diversity of vertebrates competing for a single resource. Mean concentrations of fishes under tabular structures were also among the highest biomass recorded on reefs (4.71 kg m(-2)). A generated dominance hierarchy for the occupation of shelter appeared to be primarily driven by the size of fishes. In contrast to previous studies, fishes higher in the hierarchy tended to exhibit the lowest levels of aggression. However, size difference between fishes was found to be strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of aggressive interactions (R (2) = 0.971, P < 0.0001). The strong competition for the shade provided by these corals highlights concerns about future shifts in the structure of large reef fish communities as corals are lost. This is particularly concerning given the critical functional roles played by certain species of large reef fishes that utilise tabular structure for shelter and which occupy the lower ranks of the dominance hierarchy.","[Kerry, J.

This kind of indirect effects has received little attention to date, although recent research suggest they may not be infrequent. Chytridiomycosis is an EID that is affecting amphibian assemblages worldwide. Here we present the first (to our knowledge) field evidence of its indirect effect on assemblage structure through the disruption of a biotic interaction. We have documented an expansion of the common toad (Bufo bufo) after chytridiomycosis nearly extirpated the midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) in Penalara Natural Park (Central Spain). Bufo bufo has significantly increased its number of breeding sites. All newly occupied breeding ponds were colonized once the large numbers of large, overwintering A. obstetricans tadpoles they had previously held disappeared. An experiment demonstrated that breeding B. bufo adults strongly avoided laying eggs in water containing A. obstetricans tadpoles, accounting for observed patterns of pond use. A second experiment failed to show any predation by large A. obstetricans tadpoles on B. bufo eggs, but other researchers have documented reductions in condition, growth and survival of B. bufo larvae caused by the presence of A. obstetricans tadpoles. In Penalara, chytridiomycosis attacks B. bufo too, but its effect on it has been quite less severe than on A. obstetricans. Our findings show how, besides any chytridiomycosis direct effects, interspecific differences in its impact may alter assemblage-influencing biotic interactions and, hence, assemblage structure in indirect ways.","[Bosch, Jaime; Rincon, Pedro A.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Bosch, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",bosch@mncn.csic.es,"Bosch, Jaime/H-3042-2011","Bosch, Jaime/0000-0002-0099-7934",,,,55,24,25,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

We described differences in the activity of individuals occurring alone or in sympatry with larger cats. Oncilla presented low densities (7-13 ind./100 km(2)) and high flexibility in its activity. The oncillas were primarily nocturnal in the absence of other larger cat species - margay, ocelot and puma - but became more diurnal, with a cathemeral activity pattern, when the other cats were present. Oncilla is likely to be in a subordinate position in interactions with larger cats and changes its activity to decrease the chances for interspecific encounters. In this study, however, the presence of other cat species covaries with habitat changes (from coastal forest patches to dense evergreen forests). We also verified the highest oncilla relative abundance in an area with no sympatric larger cats, with abundance decreasing when it was in sympatry with margay, ocelot and puma. Our results, together with recent records of oncilla in other degraded landscapes of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, provide evidence that oncillas may thrive even in harsh environments where other cats have already been extinct. This raise interesting conservation insights, as in the absence of other cats, L. tigrinus may assume a top predator role of these impoverished vertebrate communities.","[Oliveira-Santos, Luiz Gustavo R.; Zucco, Carlos A.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecol & Conservacao Populacoes, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Graipel, Mauricio E.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ecol & Zool, BR-88040970 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Tortato, Marcos A.] Univ Fed Parana, Setor Ciencias Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Caceres, Nilton C.] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Biol, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Goulart, Fernando V.

Given the importance of shell refuge to their post-settlement ontogeny, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began constructing intertidal plots of oyster shell in the Grays Harbor estuary, Washington, to enhance recruitment and mitigate losses of subtidal C. magister entrained and killed during extensive dredging efforts. When shell habitat was newly constructed, settlement and survival of C. magister were high, and expectations for the mitigation project were met. During the first several years (1992-1997), plots greater than 1 yr postconstruction were colonized by yellow shore crabs, Hemigrapsus oregonensis (often greater than or equal to 75 crabs m(-2)), and abundance of EBP C. magister was reduced to nearly zero. While some predation of settling megalopae by H. oregonensis does occur, the relationship between these species is characterized by density-dependent competitive interactions. Laboratory observations of competition for shell habitat indicate that H. oregonensis are dominant over EBP C. magister and can evict C. magister from refuge spaces. Field experiments show that high densities of the former cause the latter to emigrate from shell, and suggest detection and avoidance of areas with high densities of H. oregonensis by settling C. magister megalopae. More recently (1998-2001), abundance of H. oregonensis has declined dramatically within plots of oyster shell, apparently due to recruitment failure, and patterns of C. magister abundance and production have returned to levels consistent with original expectations of the mitigation project. Both intraspecific and interspecific competition for space are significant factors effecting population regulation of C. magister when they are strongly dependent on refuge from predation. Efficacy of constructed oyster shell plots as a mitigation tool may hinge on the population dynamics of a species previously considered of little consequence to the target species.","Clarkson Univ, Ctr Environm, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Visser, EP (corresponding author), Clarkson Univ, Ctr Environm, Box 5717, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.",emmajoan@northnet.org,,,,,,98,8,8,1,31,ESTUARINE RESEARCH FEDERATION,PORT REPUBLIC,"2018 DAFFODIL, PO BOX 510, PORT REPUBLIC, MD 20676 USA",0160-8347,,,ESTUARIES,Estuaries,AUG,2004,27,4,,,,,699,715,,10.1007/BF02907654,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,849HC,WOS:000223528300011,,,,,2021-09-23,

Color variation among populations of variably toxic organisms has been shown to associate with alternative anti-predator behaviors. However, the effects of these alternative behavioral tendencies on the outcomes of interspecific interactions other than predator-prey remain largely unexplored. We investigated how coloration and body size variation in Oophaga pumilio, one of the most phenotypically diverse amphibians known, associated with territorial aggressiveness and how this association influenced the outcome of agonistic male-male interactions with conspecifics and heterospecifics of two sympatric species (Andinobates claudiae and Phyllobates lugubris). Irrespective of body size, resident frogs from more conspicuous, red-colored O. pumilio populations responded to same-morph conspecifics and P. lugubris more quickly and exhibited more aggressive behaviors and more energetically expensive behaviors than resident frogs from green populations under these same treatments. Furthermore, red-colored resident frogs dominated most of the interactions in which they were involved, whereas green residents dominated only a few of the interactions, despite their status as residents. Because conspecific and heterospecific intruders did not behave more aggressively toward red resident frogs, aggressiveness of red residents does not appear to be a response to higher aggression being directed toward them. These results suggest that coloration in O. pumilio is a good indicator of aggressiveness that associates with the outcome of intraspecific and some interspecific behavioral male-male interactions, providing support for a positive association among anti-predator traits, agonistic behavior, and dominance in both intraspecific and interspecific, intraguild interactions.","[Galeano, Sandra P.; Harms, Kyle E.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Galeano, SP (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",sgalea1@tigers.lsu.edu,,,Sigma Xi Chapter of Louisiana State University; Louisiana Environmental from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries; Education Commission from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries,"We are grateful to M.

The smallest species (A. laterale and A. maculatum) spent the most time in the vegetated chamber, used the vegetated chamber more often, and decreased activity in the presence of potential predators. When species were paired, both species usually changed their activity and use of microhabitat in opposite directions.

Gaps exist in the knowledge about second generation breeding performance in bivoltine populations. In this study, the breeding performance of the second generation was evaluated in three bivoltine populations of I. typographus in the SE Alps. Length of the maternal galleries (from 40.5 to 44.8 mm), population growth rate (PGR; from 0.7 to 3.6), and emerged adults per m(2) (from 669 to 1,570 insects/m(2)) varied among populations and were negatively correlated with bark colonisation density. Pheromone traps set up in the three investigated forests differed in the number of trapped beetles, with mean captures ranging between 5,310 and 19,850 insects per trap. The populations giving the highest captures in the traps showed the lowest bark colonisation density (248 vs. 489 maternal galleries per m(2)) and the best breeding performance. The populations of parasitoids and predators corresponded to just 1-9 and 2-10% of the emerging I. typographus adults, respectively, and phloem temperature never reached thresholds lethal to I. typographus. Interspecific competition was negligible, whereas intraspecific competition was found to be the main factor affecting the breeding performance of the second generation, although with different intensity according to the colonisation density. It is hypothesised that competition with the first generation and spring precipitation influence the number of suitable hosts available to the second generation.","[Faccoli, Massimo] Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy; [Bernardinelli, Iris] Univ Udine, Dept Biol, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Faccoli, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy.",massimo.faccoli@unipd.it,"Faccoli, Massimo/AAC-8141-2020",,"Direzione Centrale delle Risorse Agricole, Naturali, Forestali e della Montagna-Regione Autonoma Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy); PRIN projectMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN) [200774ENMR]","The authors would like to thank Fabio Stergulc, Olle Anderbrant, Andrea Battisti, Marc Kenis and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments on earlier versions of the manuscript, and to Alison Garside for linguistic proofreading.

Typically, emphasis is on pattern emulation, and less on processes, such as competition, predation or habitat selection. Knowing how communities in the boreal forest assemble can provide further insight to the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the processes responsible, permitting assessments about whether forestry practices emulate processes as well as patterns. We contrasted variation in species richness among forest types, with stand area, and between local (forest stand) and regional (landscape) scales on managed and natural boreal landscapes in NW Ontario. Species richness varied more among forest stand types than between landscapes, or with stand area, on either landscape. On both landscapes, mean local species richness was 1/3 of regional richness, consistent with the hypothesis that competition structured stand-level assemblages regardless of stand origin. We further compared the structure of stand-level assemblages from randomized null models using presence/absence and abundance data with observed assemblages on each landscape, while controlling for variation in habitat structure among stands. Local bird assemblages were over-dispersed in niche space relative to random assemblages, also consistent with the competition hypothesis, regardless of stand origin. We found no evidence that patterns of variation in diversity of songbirds and woodpeckers, nor the processes that govern them, differed between managed and natural boreal forest landscapes. Our results suggest that past forest practices in this region, if by default, nevertheless emulated natural patterns of variation in diversity and species assembly of bird communities.","[Wyshynski, Sarah A.; Nudds, Thomas D.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Nudds, TD (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",tnudds@uoguelph.ca,,,Network of Centres of Excellence; The Canadian Forest Service and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources,"We thank Ian Thompson, James Baker, and John Fryxell for inviting our collaboration with the Marten Project in Ear Falls.

However, many pathogens exhibit cyclic abundance patterns (e. g., seasonality), and temporal asynchrony between interacting pathogens could reduce the impact of those interactions. Here we use an extension of our previously published model to investigate the effects of cycles on pathogen interaction. We demonstrate that host immune memory can maintain the impact of an interaction, even when the effector pathogen abundance is low or the pathogen is absent. Paradoxically, immune memory can result in pathogens interacting more strongly when temporally out of phase. We find that interactions between species can result in changes to the temporal pattern of the affected species. We further demonstrate that this may be observed in a natural host-pathogen system. Given the continuing debate regarding the relevance of pathogen interactions in natural systems and increasing concern about treatment strategies for coinfections, both the discovery of a shift in cycle in empirical data and the mechanism by which we identified it are important. Finally, because the model structure used here is analogous to models of a simple predator-prey system, we also consider the consequences of these findings in the context of that system.","[Lello, Joanne] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, Wales; [Norman, Rachel A.] Univ Stirling, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Boag, Brian] Birch Brae, Perth, WA PH14 9SW, Australia; [Hudson, Peter J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fenton, Andrew] Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England; [Boag, Brian] Birch Brae, Kinross PH14 9SW, Scotland","Lello, J (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, Wales.",lelloj@cardiff.ac.uk; ran@cs.stir.ac.uk; bboag@scri.ac.uk; pjh18@psu.edu; a.fenton@liv.ac.uk,"Hudson, Peter/AAB-8080-2020; Fenton, Andy/B-5972-2009; Norman, Rachel A/A-2930-2009; Lello, Joanne/AAG-7838-2021; Norman, R/AAI-8164-2021; Lello, Joanne/A-5261-2010","Hudson, Peter/0000-0003-0468-3403; Fenton, Andy/0000-0002-7676-917X; Norman, Rachel A/0000-0002-7398-6064; Norman, R/0000-0002-7398-6064; Lello, Joanne/0000-0002-2640-1027",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/B500482/2] Funding Source: researchfish,,,22,20,21,0,36,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Our analysis of field-derived data showed clear spatiotemporal partitioning of shell microhabitats by epizoic algae with different degrees of resource specialization. As a substrate-specializing, obligate epizoic alga,Pseudocladophora conchopheriaoccupied wider micro-niches on the host of different sizes than facultative epizoic algae (encrusting rhodophytes, crustoseCorallinaandGelidium). WhilePseudocladophorademonstrated uniform use of all shell microhabitats on hosts of all sizes, crustoseCorallinaandGelidiumshowed more varied microhabitat use with shifting positions on hosts of different sizes. Furthermore, in addition to slight differences in microhabitat use, crustoseCorallinaandGelidiumdemonstrated differences in their interspecific relationship withPseudocladophora. Our generalized linear models (GLM) analyses indicated that the occurrence/abundance of crustoseCorallinawas negatively affected byPseudocladophorabut that ofGelidiumwas positively affected, whilePseudocladophoraappeared to be competitively inferior to both rhodophytes when they co-occurred on hosts of relatively large sizes. The present study, therefore, points to variable niche partitioning among algae even on a small spatial scale, which may result from complex interactions between spatio-temporal substrate heterogeneity on a live host and interspecific interactions.","[Osawa, Yumiko; Tokeshi, Mutsunori] Kyushu Univ, Amakusa Marine Biol Lab, Kumamoto, Japan","Osawa, Y (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Amakusa Marine Biol Lab, Reiho Ku, Kumamoto 8632507, Japan.",yumosa@ambl-ku.jp,,,Tokyo Institute of Technology [28-148]; Japan Science Society [28-750],"Tokyo Institute of Technology, Grant/Award Number: Research grant (No. 28-148); Japan Science Society, Grant/Award Number: Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant (No. 28-750)",,57,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term 'interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5. Finally, the prime focus on predator-prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non-trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.","Univ Calif, White Mt Res Stn, Bishop, CA 93514 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Utrecht, Dept Environm Sci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10021 USA; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10021 USA; Linkoping Univ, Dept Biol, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool Ecol & Plant Sci, Cork, Ireland; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London, Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; Univ London, Queen Mary, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England; Univ Aegean, Dept Marine Sci, Mitilini 81100, Lesvos Isl, Greece; IFARAN, Lab Math Ecol, Moscow 119017, Russia; Univ Manchester, Dept Theoret Phys, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; IMIM UPF GRIB, Complex Syst Lab, Barcelona, Spain; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Berlow, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif, White Mt Res Stn, Bishop, CA 93514 USA.",eric@wmrs.edu; cohen@rockefeller.edu; gkok@aegean.gr,"Montoya, Jose/AAH-2369-2019; Kokkoris, Giorgos D/A-1222-2010; Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011; Montoya, Jose M/E-3605-2010; Jansen, Vincent A A/C-8353-2009","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633; Jansen, Vincent A.A./0000-0002-6518-2090; Kokkoris, Georgios/0000-0002-9342-6566; Montoya, Jose M./0000-0002-6676-7592; Jones, John Iwan/0000-0002-7238-2509; Logofet, Dmitrii/0000-0001-5229-6534",,,,189,372,382,4,225,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Such changes are observed as organisms invade new environments, and they are often triggered by changed interspecific interactions, such as differences in predation regimes. However, in spite of increased recognition of antagonistic male-female mating interactions, there is very limited evidence that such intraspecific interactions could cause rapid evolutionary dynamics in nature. This is because ecological and longitudinal data from natural populations have been lacking. Here we show that in a color-polymorphic damselfly species, male-female mating interactions lead to rapid evolutionary change in morph frequencies between generations. Field data and computer simulations indicate that these changes are driven by sexual conflict, in which morph fecundities are negatively affected by frequency- and density-dependent male mating harassment. These frequency- dependent processes prevent population divergence by maintaining a female polymorphism in most populations. Although these results contrast with the traditional view of how sexual conflict enhances the rate of population divergence, they are consistent with a recent theoretical model of how females may form discrete genetic clusters in response to male mating harassment.","Lund Univ, Sect Anim Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Svensson, EI (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Sect Anim Ecol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",erik.svensson@zooekol.lu.se; jessica.abbott@zooekol.lu.se; roger.hardling@zooekol.lu.se,"Abbott, Jessica K/F-5848-2010; Svensson, Erik/E-8324-2010","Abbott, Jessica K/0000-0002-8743-2089; Svensson, Erik/0000-0001-9006-016X",,,,53,186,193,0,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

They can arise in two general ways: through linked chains of direct interactions, and when a species changes the interactions among species. Indirect effects have been uncovered largely by experimental studies that have monitored the response of many species and discovered ''unexpected results,'' although some studies have looked for specific indirect effects predicted from simple models. The characteristics of such approaches make it likely that the many indirect effects remain uncovered, but the application of techniques such as path analysis may reduce this problem. Deterministic theory indicates that indirect effects should often be important, although stochastic models need exploration. Simulation models indicate that some indirect effects may stabilize multi-species assemblages. Five simple types of indirect effects have been regularly demonstrated in nature: exploitative competition, trophic cascades, apparent competition, indirect mutualism, and interaction modifications. Detailed experimental investigations of natural communities have yielded complicated effects. Indirect effects have the potential to affect evolutionary patterns, but empirical examples are limited. Future directions in the study of indirect effects include developing techniques to estimate interaction strength in dynamic models, deriving more efficient approaches to detecting indirect effects, evaluating the effectiveness of approaches such as path analysis, and investigating mechanisms in which a species changes how other species interact.",,"WOOTTON, JT (corresponding author), UNIV CHICAGO,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT,1101 E 57TH ST,CHICAGO,IL 60637, USA.",,"Wootton, J.

One strategy employed by carnivores to minimize potentially costly interspecific competition is avoidance of dominant species. Recent research has highlighted the importance of consistent individual differences in behavior (i.e. temperament traits) in understanding behavioral variation during predator-prey interactions and intraspecific interactions. However, the importance of such individual differences to interspecific competition has received little attention. Here, we examined the responses of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) to their primary competitors, African lions (Panthera leo), to (1) determine whether hyenas avoid lions and (2) evaluate the potential importance of individual differences in behavior during interspecific competition. Spotted hyenas and lions co-occur throughout much of Africa and are vigorous competitors. Whereas lions sometimes kill hyenas and steal their food, lions also represent a source of food for hyenas via scavenging. Using audio playback experiments, we found that hyenas do not uniformly avoid potential encounters with lions. Indeed, we noted considerable variation among individuals in their responses to lion roars, and this variation reflected consistent individual differences in risk-taking and vigilance tendencies. Individual differences in vigilance behavior were specific to interactions with lions. We conclude that individual differences in behavior have the potential to play an important role in determining the nature and outcome of interspecific competition.","[Watts, Heather E.; Blankenship, Lisa M.; Dawes, Stephanie E.; Holekamp, Kay E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Watts, HE (corresponding author), Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",hwatts1@lmu.edu,"Holekamp, Kay E/G-6054-2010",,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN0113170, IBN0343381, IOB0618022, IOS0819437]; Michigan State University","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (IBN0113170, IBN0343381, IOB0618022, and IOS0819437) and Michigan State University.

Interannual variation in seasonal weather patterns causes shifts in the relative timing of phenological events of species within communities, but we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of how these phenological shifts affect species interactions. Identifying these mechanisms is critical to predicting how interannual variation affects populations and communities. 2. Species' phenologies, particularly the timing of offspring arrival, play an important role in the annual cycles of community assembly. We hypothesize that shifts in relative arrival of off-spring can alter interspecific interactions through a mechanism called size-mediated priority effects (SMPE), in which individuals that arrive earlier can grow to achieve a body size advantage over those that arrive later. 3. In this study, we used an experimental approach to isolate and quantify the importance of SMPE for species interactions. Specifically, we simulated shifts in relative arrival of the nymphs of two dragonfly species to determine the consequences for their interactions as intraguild predators. 4. We found that shifts in relative arrival altered not only predation strength but also the nature of predator-prey interactions. When arrival differences were great, SMPE allowed the early arriver to prey intensely upon the late arriver, causing exclusion of the late arriver from nearly all habitats. As arrival differences decreased, the early arriver's size advantage also decreased. When arrival differences were smallest, there was mutual predation, and the two species coexisted in similar abundances across habitats. Importantly, we also found a nonlinear scaling relationship between shifts in relative arrival and predation strength. Specifically, small shifts in relative arrival caused large changes in predation strength while subsequent changes had relatively minor effects. 5. These results demonstrate that SMPE can alter not only the outcome of interactions but also the demographic rates of species and the structure of communities. Elucidating the mechanisms that link phenological shifts to species interactions is crucial for understanding the dynamics of seasonal communities as well as for predicting the effects of climate change on these communities.","[Rasmussen, Nick L.; Van Allen, Benjamin G.; Rudolf, Volker H.

Although frequently studied in the context of predator-prey interactions, refuges may also mediate interspecific competition between native and invasive taxa given the role of refuges as a valuable resource. Because interspecific interactions (e.g., competition and predation) can be modulated by temporal and biotic (e.g., trophic level) factors, we used a manipulative approach to investigate community-wide refuge-use patterns in the context of two important ecological factors: invasive species and seasonality. We surveyed refuge (artificial cover object) use of ants and vertebrates in a forest community for 2years, and we systematically suppressed an established invasive species (red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta) to examine its impact on community refuge use. Native Camponotus ants appeared to co-exist and share refuges with S. invicta, but we found evidence for a negative effect of S. invicta on vertebrate refuge use that was also influenced by season. Vertebrates were more abundant under refuges undergoing suppression of S. invicta, and they were less abundant under refuges during the fall (the season characterized by the highest occupancy of refuges by S. invicta). Thus, researchers must continue to examine the entire community and to incorporate the effects of season when assessing the impact of invasive species (e.g., at our site, a survey conducted only in the summer or only on native ants would have indicated a negligible effect of S. invicta on community refuge use).","[Stahlschmidt, Z.

It is likely that the strongest interactions involving the gadoids are of predator-prey type and exist between the most abundant gadoids and their main prey: small saithe and blue whiting as predators and the euphausids as prey, and between saithe and Norway pout. Because it seems unlikely that any of the species, even those showing rather extensive overlaps in their diets and spatial distributions, experience resource shortages, the overall impression is that competition plays a minor role among the gadoids. However, intraspecific resource overlap seemed rather strong among the lifestages found in this area. Therefore, significant influence of competitive interactions are more likely to be found between size groups of the same species than between different species.",,"BERGSTAD, OA (corresponding author), UNIV BERGEN,DEPT FISHERIES & MARINE BIOL,THORMOHLENSGT 55,N-5008 BERGEN,NORWAY.",,,,,,,47,17,18,0,5,UNIV BERGEN,BERGEN,"DEPT FISHERIES/MAR.

While small-scale individual-level studies on normative-native fish interactions have helped elucidate mechanisms of impact, very few investigations have occurred at a scale consistent with that of species replacement. Thus, large-scale population-level studies are needed to understand the effects of normative fish as well as to more effectively conserve native fishes in the presence of normative fish. For this reason, we conducted an evaluation of the effects of normative brown trout Salmo trutta on the individual- and population-level performance of native cutthroat trout using a field-experimental approach. We studied local populations of cutthroat trout in the presence and absence of brown trout in long stream reaches and subsequently compared growth, condition, stable-isotope-based measures of dietary habits, movement, and survival between treatment groups. We found clear evidence for reduced cutthroat trout growth owing to the presence of brown trout. Additionally, we observed differences in cutthroat trout dietary habits based on delta C-13 signatures resulting from our experimental manipulation of brown trout abundance. Finally, brown trout suppressed cutthroat trout movement but had no apparent effect on their survival. Considering previous studies, we concluded that the individual-level effects of brown trout on cutthroat trout are scale invariant. Higher-level impacts (i.e., on movement and survival), in contrast, appear to be more sensitive to the scale at which the investigation is conducted. Overall, our results indicate that brown trout can have strong negative effects on cutthroat trout performance and should therefore be more explicitly considered in native fish conservation plans.","Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources,Coll Nat, Logan, UT 84322 USA","McHugh, P (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources,Coll Nat, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",pam@cc.usu.edu,"Budy, Phaedra/B-2415-2012","Budy, Phaedra/0000-0002-9918-1678",,,,88,35,37,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Species richness was not significantly different over 2.5 yr on stabilized oil and coal ash reefs compared to concrete control reefs. Of 19 species tested for significant differences in mean abundance, lane snapper was observed at significantly higher mean abundances on fossil-fuel ash reefs (stabilized oil ash/coal fly ash), while three reef species (hairy blenny, porkfish and gray snapper) were significantly more common on concrete control reefs. Further study is needed to determine whether contaminants (Cu, V, Ni and Zn) from stabilized ash blocks can cause abundance differences for some fishes. Plausible alternate explanations for the differences in mean abundance include both interspecific interactions (competition and predation) and differences in the attraction or retention of fish among reef replicates due to slight variations in reef dimensions.

Apart from interspecific interactions, parasites can affect how their hosts behave with conspecifics, such as during competition for resources. Fish are important hosts to a variety of parasite taxa that can, through physical impairment or invasion of sense organs, affect how they interact with conspecifics for food, territory, or mates. In New Zealand, the common bully Gobiomorphus cotidianus plays host to a variety of parasites, encysting throughout the body (Apatemon sp.) or residing within the eyes (Tylodelphys darbyi). We hypothesized that fish with lower levels of infection would secure territories closer to a food patch and be more likely to tolerate sharing that territory. Our experiments show that parasites infecting different areas may have variable impacts on how far the host positions itself from a food patch and the likelihood that it shares its territory. Fish with higher intensities of T. darbyi tended to be closer to the food patch, but Apatemon sp. did not show a similar pattern. Higher infection levels of both parasites were statistically associated with bullies being less likely to share territory. Further, bigger fish were less likely to share their territory at higher intensities infection, and we observed individual variation in a fish's response between trials. Our findings support that parasites matter in ecological interactions but also emphasize the context dependence of their effects.","[Ruehle, Brandon; Poulin, Robert] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand","Ruehle, B (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand.",brandon.ruehle90@gmail.com,,"Ruehle, Brandon/0000-0002-9898-3169",University of Otago,We would like to thank the members of the Evolutionary and Ecological Parasitology Lab as well as Jolyn Chia for their assistance with field and lab work.

Procellariiform seabirds provide particularly appropriate models for investigating these topics as they possess a well-developed olfactory system and unequalled associated capabilities. We present here results from a detailed chemical examination of the uropygial secretions (the main source of avian exogenous chemicals) from 2 petrel species, Antarctic prions and blue petrels. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques and recently developed multivariate tools, we demonstrate that the secretions contain critical socioecological information such as species, gender, and individual identity. Importantly, these chemosignals correlate with some of the birds' olfactory behaviors demonstrated in the field. The molecules found to be associated with social information were essentially large unsaturated compounds, suggesting that these may be precursors of, or correlates to the actual airborne signals. Although the species-specific chemosignal may be involved in interspecific competition at the breeding grounds, the role of the sexually specific chemosignal remains unclear. The existence of individually specific signals (i.e., chemical signatures) in these birds has important implications for processes such as individual recognition and genetically based mate choice already suspected for this group.

Crabs reaching a site of a recent predatory event may not only find the shell empty but also encounter a predator. The attendance at sites where gastropods are decomposing may be less risky, but the use of these shells will depend on the crab's ability to extract the flesh. We tested the responses of two coexisting species of hermit crabs to chemical cues of potential empty shells at different levels of predatory risk and constraints to occupy it. The crabs were exposed in a Y-maze to chemical odors simulating gastropods in decomposition vs. a control, freshly predated gastropods vs. control, and gastropods in decomposition vs. predated gastropods. We also tested the ability of each species to extract the flesh of a dead snail. Contrary to expectation, individuals of both species avoided the two odors of shells. When the crabs were presented with the two chemical cues, Calcinus californiensis approached more to odors from gastropods in decomposition, whereas Clibanarius albidigitus approached more to odors from predated snails. The behavioral response of C. californiensis agrees with its greater ability to extract the flesh, which may allow it to obtain a new shell at relatively low risk. The lower ability of C. albidigitus to remove the flesh matches its preference for cues of predated gastropods rather than decomposed gastropods. Our results show that the flesh of gastropods needs not to he an obstacle to the use of their shells. The exploitation strategy sets the resource partitioning in these hermit crabs. The ability to remove the flesh, feed on dead gastropods, and occupy the shell makes hermit crabs exceptional as they exploit a limited resource as refuge and food.","[Alcaraz, Guillermina; Kruesi, Karla] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico; [Burciaga, Luis M.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico","Alcaraz, G (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico.",alcaraz@ciencias.unam.mx,,,"Posgrado en Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia, UNAMUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)","We thank Sebastian Zuniga for his technical assistance.

In a laboratory experiment, we measured Daphnia life history plasticity under different predation risk and temperature treatments that simulate changing environmental conditions. Daphnia pulicaria abundance and size at first reproduction (SFR) declined, while ephippia (resting egg) formation increased at high temperatures. Daphnia mendotae abundance and clutch size increased with predation risk at high temperatures, but produced few ephippia. Thus, each species exhibited phenotypic plasticity, but responded in sharply different ways to the same environmental cues. In Glen Elder reservoir, Kansas USA, D. pulicaria dominance shifted to D. mendotae dominance as temperature and predation risk increased from March to June in both 1999 and 2000.

However, competition is not the sole constraint on resource partitioning, and its effects are mediated by factors including the environmental context in which species coexist. Colonial seabirds provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the importance of competition in shaping realized niche widths because their life histories lead to variation in intra- and interspecific competition across the annual cycle. Dense breeding aggregations result in intense competition for prey in surrounding waters, whereas non-breeding dispersal to larger geographical areas produces lower densities of competitors. Bayesian hierarchical models of the isotopic niche, closely aligned to the trophic niche, reveal the degree of segregation between species and functional groups during both time periods. Surprisingly, species explained far more of the variance in the isotopic niche during the non-breeding than the breeding period. Our results underline the key role of non-breeding dynamics in alleviating competition and promoting distinctions between species through the facilitation of resource partitioning. Such situations may be common in a diverse range of communities sustained by ephemeral but abundant food items. This highlights how consideration of the hierarchical grouping of competitive interactions alongside consideration of abiotic constraints across the complete annual cycle allows a full understanding of the role of competition in driving patterns of character displacement.","[Bodey, Thomas W.; Bearhop, Stuart] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, England; [Ward, Eric J.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Phillips, Richard A.] British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [McGill, Rona A.

Despite its relevance in the research field, little is known about the ontogeny and inter-population effects on the otolith of freshwater fish. In this study we used otoliths from 1800 European perch (Perca fluviatilis) individuals from 9 different populations to analyze the ontogenetic and inter-population differences on the otolith shape using six morphometric indices. The relationship between fish and otolith length was fitted using three different regression models (linear, power and logistic) to identify the best allometric relationship. Our results show that there are strong ontogenetic and interpopulation differences in P. fluviatilis otolith shapes. We also show that the relationship between the fish and otolith length follows a logistic curve. The ontogenetic differences on otolith shape might be related to extrinsic factors (diet shift and intra and interspecific competition) in each ecosystem, given that the reservoirs are different and no clear pattern on the otolith shapes can be distinguished among populations. Our results imply that the available back-calculation models may not always provide accurate estimates of P. fluviatilis length and that a model that takes into account the real allometric relationship for the species can improve the fish length estimations of back-calculated fish lengths for the European perch.","[Souza, A.

Yet, the roles of controphic species of mosquito larvae in affecting mosquito populations have received little attention. Published empirical evidence, although scarce, suggests that controphic species such as zooplankton and anuran larvae compete with mosquito larvae, can positively affect mosquito larvae by consuming bacteria that are pathogenic to mosquito larvae, reduce predation on mosquito larvae by serving as alternative prey, and ultimately cause increased predation on mosquito larvae by causing a numerical response in the predator. We conclude that more extensive theoretical and empirical studies in elucidating the roles of controphic species will better allow us to predict mosquito population dynamics and allow for better management of mosquitoes.","Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Community Ecol Lab, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Entomol, Mosquito Res Lab, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Community Ecol Lab, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",leon@research.haifa.ac.il; jchase@biology2.wustl.edu,,,,,,105,94,104,0,47,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

Arthropods, spiders in particular, were most abundant in upper tree parts and in the outer sections of branches. There was a high correlation between food abundance and bird density, based on proportional use of foraging sites over eight sections of spruce suggesting that food distribution is a major factor influencing the segregative distribution of the four bird species. However, the distribution of the bird species cannot be explained solely by food abundance. In outer tree parts there were fewer birds than expected from arthropod biomass. A possible explanation is that the risk of predation by Pygmy Owls Glaucidium passerinum is higher there, reducing the net benefit of foraging in the tree parts with highest food abundance. A further support for the impact of predation comes from the fact that it is the socially least dominant species, the Goldcrest and the Coal Tit P. ater, that use the outer tree parts. Crested Tits P. cristatus are highest in dominance rank, but they mainly forage in the inner tree parts. Willow Tits P. montanus are second in the dominance, but have the lowest food abundance in their foraging sites. Both interspecific competition over food, and the site-dependent risk of predation, seem to govern the ways in which the four bird species select their foraging sites in spruce in winter.","SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DEPT WILDLIFE ECOL,S-75007 UPPSALA,SWEDEN; UNIV UPPSALA,DEPT ZOOL,S-75122 UPPSALA,SWEDEN","SUHONEN, J (corresponding author), UNIV JYVASKYLA,DEPT BIOL,KONNEVESI RES STN,YLIOPISTONKATU 9,SF-40100 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND.",,,"Hoglund, Jacob/0000-0002-5840-779X",,,,44,38,39,0,23,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-5693,,,ORNIS SCAND,,OCT-DEC,1992,23,4,,,,,467,474,,10.2307/3676678,,,8,Ornithology,Zoology,KA562,WOS:A1992KA56200006,,,,,2021-09-23,

However, due in part to the secretive behavior and low detectability of many snake species, this generalization is based on a limited number of studies, most of which focus on a single study site. We examined differences in diet composition, trophic niche overlap, site occupancy and detectability of five sympatric aquatic snake species between two different habitat types in the Southeastern US, replicated at the landscape scale: permanent wetlands with fishes (n=13) and isolated, often ephemeral wetlands without fishes (n=10). We collected >3700 prey items from snakes and compared diet composition among snake species to examine niche breadth and overlap, correcting for relative availability of prey captured independently in the same wetlands. We evaluated evidence for competitive exclusion by estimating the probability of co-occupancy for pairs of snake species in each habitat type using occupancy modeling. In wetlands with fishes, niche overlap was low, suggesting resource partitioning. Conversely, in wetlands without fishes, niche overlap was high, with most species feeding on larval or paedomorphic ambystomatid salamanders, but competitive exclusion did not occur. We suggest that high co-occupancy of aquatic snakes in wetlands without fishes despite the apparent lack of resource partitioning is due to a combination of seasonally high abundance of high quality amphibian prey, unique aspects of predator physiology and stochastic abiotic processes that prevent these systems from reaching equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that snake diets can be highly context (e.g. habitat)-specific. Studies should consider other factors in addition to competition for prey when attempting to understand snake population and community dynamics.","[Durso, A.

The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of post-metamorphic green frogs (Rana clamitans) on post-metamorphic American toads (Bufo americanus) in the terrestrial environment as a model for understanding how interspecific differences in size at metamorphosis may influence terrestrial interactions. We examined if caged, uncaged or no green frogs affected survival, growth and hiding behavior of recently metamorphosed American toads in a replicated laboratory experiment. Green frogs did not appear to prey upon small American toads. However, by the end of the experiment American toad survival was lowest in treatments with uncaged green frogs; this result suggests that green frogs may outcompete American toads for food, but such impacts in nature may be limited or may have selected for spatial segregation in the terrestrial environment. Green frogs also increased hiding activity of toads at sonic times, which may in part explain the trend of reduced mass gained when toads were reared with green frogs. Thus study represents one of the first to examine interspecific interactions among anurans with complex life cycles in the terrestrial environment.","[Sams, Erin; Boone, Michelle D.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Boone, MD (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 212 Pearson Hall, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",boonemd@muohio.edu,,,Miami University,"We thank M.

Specifically, mast production and acorn weevil (Curculio L., 1758) occupancy were estimated annually from 2006 to 2008 for individual host trees in a sample of 74 northern red oaks (Quercus rubra L.), 100 white oaks (Quercus alba L.), and 81 shagbark hickories (Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Koch) in west-central Indiana, USA. Occupancy and vital rates of nine Curculio species on their primary host-tree species were derived using multispecies, multiseason (MSMS) models within a Bayesian framework, accounting for imperfect detection. Mast production of host trees had a strong positive effect on community-level occupancy and survival of Curculio. Mast production varied considerably between years and generally was spatially autocorrelated only at distances <2 km, which likely reduced interspecific resource competition. Derived estimates of mean weevil species richness per tree and community similarity were highest in 2007 when mast production on all host-tree species was in phase. Generalist species compensated for lower survival rate on secondary hosts with higher colonization rates on these hosts during a year of mast failure in the primary host. We hypothesize that differential suitability of hosts as resources for Curculio created a spatial storage effect that, when coupled with a temporal storage effect induced by prolonged diapause common among Curculio, facilitated species coexistence. Methodologically, increased precision of parameter estimates from MSMS models makes it generally more useful than single-species models in studies of community dynamics.","[Govindan, Byju N.; Swihart, Robert K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Govindan, BN (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, LJ Smith 211,POB 646120, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",byju.ng@wsu.edu,"Swihart, Robert K/D-2787-2016; Govindan, Byju N./J-7665-2015","Govindan, Byju N./0000-0001-8126-1445","James S.

As a strong test of the prevailing generalization that competition plays a relatively trivial role among suspension-feeding invertebrates in the soft sediments on the estuarine seafloor, we manipulated local densities of bivalves, two species of Katelysia, in a Western Australia lagoon, characterized by exceptionally high bivalve abundances (averaging 157 m-2). 2. Competition appeared weakly and sporadically, evident in only one of five intervals, when survivorship was 20-30% lower, production of undamaged empty shells 3-5 times higher, and average growth of survivors 50% lower for both Katelysia scalarina Lamarck and Katelysia rhytiphora Lamarck in the highest density treatment (320 m-2) than in the others (20-160 m-2). 3. Surprisingly, during both winter-spring intervals survivorship was also 25% lower at the lowest density for both species. The type of mortality was one that resulted in disappearance of the empty shell. Addition of sufficient numbers of sham clams, dead shells filled with sand and implanted in living position in the sediments, acted to prevent the enhancement of mortality at low density. This demonstration of the importance of a structural barrier implies that the agent of mortality at low density is a predator. Sampling error, emigration and post-mortem transport by scavengers can be ruled out by results of direct tests. 4. In a caging experiment, the predatory seastar Coscinasterias calamaria (Gray) replicated the pattern of enhanced predation rate on Katelysia of both species at low density. This represents a candidate for the unknown predator that was deterred by the structural barrier created by crowding of shells. A demersal fish is an alternative candidate. 5. Contrary to previous data for suspension feeders in estuarine soft sediments, which commonly show negative effects of adults on local recruitment of young, recruitment of K. scalarina was greater around higher densities of adult bivalves in one of two tests. Survivorship of recruits did not vary with adult density, suggesting that the recruitment pattern may have resulted from gregarious larval settlement around adults rather than from differences in early post-settlement survivorship. 6. Evolution and expression of gregarious settlement may be a reasonable expectation, given the sporadic and small penalties of competition, and the large and repeated benefits of mutual defences at high density. More broadly, positive interactions such as commensalism, mutualism and facilitation might be expected to be more prevalent in systems like the soft-sediment benthos where competition is so ineffective and relatively unimportant.","UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA, DEPT ZOOL, NEDLANDS, WA 6009, AUSTRALIA","PETERSON, CH (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012; Black, Robert/F-5312-2013","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Black, William/0000-0001-6839-8674",,,,64,57,59,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

In this study, we used stable isotope analyses (SIA) to explore trophic status of an introduced population of northern crayfish (Faxonius virilis) in Buffalo Lake, Washington. Northern crayfish are an important prey item for introduced warmwater and coldwater fish species in this lentic system and may buffer competitive interactions between largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka). In 2017, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of liver samples from 208 crayfish informed proportional diet estimates. Crayfish diets were comprised of 8 littoral sources and were examined for cannibalism, temporal, spatial, and ontogenetic trophic shifts. There was no significant spatial or temporal trophic shift detected in this crayfish population. Seasonal delta N-15 values among all crayfish size classes mirrored seasonal abundance shifts of littoral macroinvertebrates. A multiple-source stable isotope mixing model and relative trophic positions provided evidence for an ontogenetic trophic shift between juvenile and adult crayfish, from a generalist detritivore to a predatory diet dominated by Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera. The trophic status of Buffalo Lake crayfish may affect salmonid management goals if interspecific competition for food between crayfish and sport fish is biologically significant. Our research is an important first step to understanding crayfish trophic status in a lentic food web, and should inform fish stocking regimes and fishery regulations in management efforts to achieve long-term sustainability of this diverse fishery.","[Loffredo, John R.; Moore, Barry C.; Lanouette, Brian; Katz, Stephen L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Lee, Raymond W.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Cross, Benjamin K.] Colville Confederated Tribes, Nespelem, WA USA","Loffredo, JR (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",john.loffredo@wsu.edu,"Moore, Barry/AAB-6459-2020; Loffredo, John/AAC-3411-2020","Loffredo, John/0000-0003-2038-1229",Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation,"The primary author would like to thank the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation for providing funding and generously donating the biological specimens for this research.

The aim of this work was to infer the role that such interactions play in the population dynamics of psyllids and aphids in pear orchards. Interactions were inferred from field data and periodical sampling along a 4-year study, and from interaction assays performed under controlled conditions. RESULTS A decline in the abundance of the pear psyllid (Cacopsylla pyri L.), parallel to an increase in the abundance of aphids, was registered over 4 years. Ants were the dominant species, representing about 90% of the predators, followed by spiders and predatory hemipterans (namely Pilophorus gallicus Remane). Ant abundance increased over the 4 years, matching the population dynamics of aphids. Evidence of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions were found for ant-aphid and ant-psyllid, respectively: (i) ant-aphid abundances on pear trees were positively correlated, and ants reduced predation on aphids by generalist predators, and (ii) ant-psyllid abundances were negatively correlated, ants have a negative effect on the psyllid population growth rates, and ants were found to prey on the psyllid. CONCLUSIONS Because of their high abundance in comparison with other predators and the mutualistic-antagonistic relationships with aphids-psyllids, ants are considered to be the principal force behind the decline of pear psyllid populations and the increase in aphid numbers. In summary, ants contribute positively to biological control by the suppresion of pests (i.e. the psyllid) which are more damaging than those they protect (i.e. aphids).

In Ireland, the bank vole was introduced 80 years ago and now occupies a third of the island. The greater white-toothed shrew arrived more recently within the invasive range of the bank vole. We surveyed the abundance of both invasive species and two indigenous species, the wood mouse and pygmy shrew, throughout their respective ranges. The negative effects of invasive on indigenous species were strong and cumulative bringing about species replacement. The greater white-toothed shrew, the second invader, had a positive and synergistic effect on the abundance of the bank vole, the first invader, but a negative and compounding effect on the abundance of the wood mouse and occurrence of the pygmy shrew. The gradual replacement of the wood mouse by the bank vole decreased with distance from the point of the bank vole's introduction whilst no pygmy shrews were captured where both invasive species were present. Such interactions may not be unique to invasions but characteristic of all multispecies communities. Small mammals are central in terrestrial food webs and compositional changes to this community in Ireland are likely to reverberate throughout the ecosystem. Vegetation composition and structure, invertebrate communities and the productivity of avian and mammalian predators are likely to be affected. Control of these invasive species may only be effected through landscape and habitat management.","[Montgomery, W.

Most ecological research has focused on negative species interactions, especially competition, predation and parasitism. Yet the relevance of positive interactions - mutualisms and commensalisms - have been brought to the fore in recent years by an increasing number of empirical studies exploring their impact on range limits. Based on a review of 73 studies from a Web of Science search, we found strong evidence that positive interactions can influence the extent of species' geographic or ecological ranges through a diversity of mechanisms. More specifically, we found that while obligate interactions, and especially obligate mutualisms, tend to constrain the ranges of one or both partners, facultative positive interactions tend to widen ranges. Nonetheless, there was more variation in effects of facultative interactions on range limits, pointing to important context-dependencies. Therefore, we propose that conceptual development in this field will come from studying ecological interactions in the context of networks of many species across environmental gradients, since pairwise interactions alone might overlook the indirect and environmentally-contingent effects that species have on each other in communities of many interacting species. Finally, our study also revealed key data gaps that limit our current understanding of the pervasiveness of effects that positive interactions have on species' ranges, highlighting potential avenues for future theoretical and experimental work.","[Stephan, Pauline; Mora, Bernat Bramon; Alexander, Jake M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland","Stephan, P (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",stephanp@student.ethz.ch,"; Alexander, Jake/P-2580-2014","Stephan, Pauline/0000-0002-5218-3852; Alexander, Jake/0000-0003-2226-7913",European UnionEuropean Commission [678841],We thank Thomas Stadler and students on the course `Ecology and Evolution: Term Paper' at ETH Zurich for suggestions that helped improve an early version of this manuscript.

Among-species differences in the expression of constitutive and plastic traits may shape species distributions within a community. For many systems, the relationships among individual species' phenotypes, particularly morphological plasticity, and performance and distribution are poorly understood. 2. I tested whether three co-occurring species of marine snails in the genus Nucella differed in their constitutive and inducible defences against crabs, in terms of growth and shell architectural defence. I also tested whether among-species trait differences were associated with interspecific differences in antipredator performance (resistance to crushing) and distributions along a vertical tidal emersion gradient on rocky shores where the snails co-occur. 3. Species distributed lower on the shore and thus exposed to crabs for longer periods of time exhibited higher constitutive growth rates than the upper-shore species. Lower-shore species also exhibited greater inducible reductions in somatic growth and increases in shell thickening than the upper-shore species. Plastic alterations of the scaling relationship between shell-thickness and somatic growth (i.e. greater shell mass per body mass) enabled the two lower-shore species to produce stronger, more crab-resistant shells in the presence of crabs than their upper-shore congener. 4. Results suggest that species-specific differences in both constitutive and inducible shell defence and growth reflect growth/mortality tradeoffs that are associated with species' vertical distributions along a predation risk gradient. Thus, adaptive differences in inducible morphological defenses should be considered along with more traditionally studied traits such as behaviour and constitutive morphological defenses, when examining traits that influence patterns of species distribution along environmental gradients.","[Bourdeau, Paul E.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Bourdeau, PE (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",bourdea7@msu.edu,"Bourdeau, Paul/AAA-3551-2019","Bourdeau, Paul/0000-0002-8927-1899",A Ruth and Stephen Wainwright Fellowship,"I would like to thank the Director and Staff at Friday Harbor Labs for logistical support.

Adult body mass varies by more than 10-fold, and body length (snout-vent length, SVL) varies by approximate to 2.2-fold. Predation and interspecific food competition are largely absent and can be excluded as potential forces explaining differences in body size among populations. This provides an ideal system in which to determine how proximate environmental factors affect adult body size, We compared the small iguanas from Genovesa Island (mean adult male SVL 250 mm) to the larger Santa Fe iguanas (mean adult male SVL 400 mm). Marine iguanas forage on intertidal algae pastures in scramble competition. Energy availability was lower on Genovesa than on Santa Fe, because of lower marine productivity on Genovesa. The length of grazable algal turf decreased with increasing sea surface temperature (SST). SST was approximate to 2 degrees C lower on Santa Fe than on Genovesa, implying approximate to 1.5 mm lower algae pastures on the latter. Genovesa showed a fivefold lower standing algal biomass and a twofold lower productivity of algae pastures than did Santa Fe. The smallest iguanas of each island had approximate to 1.5-fold higher bite rates during foraging, and their absolute food intake per day was 35% that of the largest iguanas. However, food intake per bite per gram of body mass was about twice as high for small iguanas as for large iguanas. Large iguanas of both islands showed a marked decline in body mass during the two study years, whereas small iguanas (SVL < 170 mm on Genovesa and < 320 mm on Santa Fe) increased in mass, Growth rates of SVL reflected these findings. A comparison of measured metabolizable energy with published field metabolic rates (FMR) suggested that iguanas above a threshold size were in negative energy balance, because energy intake scaled to body mass with a lower exponent (0.3) than FMR (0.97). Threshold body size was lower on Genovesa than on Santa Fe and differed between years: In the lean El Nino year (1991/1992), iguanas > 200 mm SVL on Genovesa and > 310 mm SVL on Santa Fe significantly lost mass; in the more productive year (1992/1993), thresholds were 230 mm and 350 mm SVL, respectively. Thus, food abundance (length and turnover of algal swards) explained differences in adult body length and mass between islands as a result of energetic limitation. On a given island, foraging efficiency (intake/bite) explained the negative energy balance of large compared to small iguanas. This also explained why, on both islands, the largest animals suffered higher mortality rates than did medium-sized ones when food was scarce. The finding that small animals outcompeted larger ones because of their higher foraging efficiency resembles the grazing succession in ungulate herbivores.","UNIV BIELEFELD, DEPT ANIM BEHAV, D-33501 BIELEFELD, GERMANY; MAX PLANCK INST BEHAV PHYSIOL, D-82319 SEEWIESEN, GERMANY",,,,,,,,64,70,71,0,48,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1997,78,7,,,,,2204,2217,,10.2307/2265956,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XZ789,WOS:A1997XZ78900023,,,,,2021-09-23,

The model predicts that, when a generalist herbivore feeds in the absence of plant toxins, adaptive foraging generally increases the probability of coexistence of plant species populations, because the herbivore switches more of its effort to whichever plant species is more common and accessible. In contrast, toxin-determined selective herbivory can drive plant succession toward dominance by the more toxic species, as previously documented in boreal forests and prairies. When the toxin concentrations in different plant species are similar, but species have different toxins with nonadditive effects, herbivores tend to diversify foraging efforts to avoid high intakes of any one toxin. This diversification leads the herbivore to focus more feeding on the less common plant species. Thus, uncommon plants may experience depensatory mortality from herbivory, reducing local species diversity. The depensatory effect of herbivory may inhibit the invasion of other plant species that are more palatable or have different toxins. These predictions were tested and confirmed in the Alaskan boreal forest.","[DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, US Geol Survey, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Feng, Zhilan; Liu, Rongsong] Purdue Univ, Dept Math, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Bryant, John P.; Kielland, Knut; Stuart Chapin, F., III] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Swihart, Robert K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","DeAngelis, DL (corresponding author), Univ Miami, US Geol Survey, POB 249118, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",zfeng@math.purdue.edu; ddeangelis@bio.miami.edu,"Swihart, Robert K/D-2787-2016; Feng, Zhilan/L-4027-2018",,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-0719697]; James S.

Communicating by surface-borne vibrations is likely the most ancient mode of getting and exchanging information in both invertebrates and vertebrates. In this review, we concentrate on the use of vibrational communication in arthropods as a form of intraspecific and interspecific signaling, with a focus on the newest discoveries from our research group in terrestrial isopods (Crustacea: Isopoda: Oniscidea), a taxon never investigated before in this context. After getting little attention in the past, biotremology is now an emerging field of study in animal communication, and it is receiving increased interest from the scientific community dealing with these behavioral processes. In what follows, we illustrate the general principles and mechanisms on which biotremology is based, using definitions, examples, and insights from the literature in arthropods. Vibrational communication in arthropods has mainly been studied in insects and arachnids. For these taxa, much evidence of its use as a source of information from the surrounding environment exists, as well as its involvement in many behavioral roles, such as courtship and mating, conspecific recognition, competition, foraging, parental care, and danger perception. Recently, and for the first time, communication through surface-borne waves has been studied in terrestrial isopods, using a common Mediterranean species of the Armadillidae family as a pilot species, Armadillo officinalis Dumeril,1816, InDictionnaire des Sciences naturelles(pp. 115-117). Mainly, for this species, we describe typical behavioral processes, such as turn alternation, aggregation, and stridulation, where vibrational communication appears to be involved.","[Cividini, Sofia] Univ Liverpool, Inst Translat Med, Dept Biostat, Crown St, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Montesanto, Giuseppe] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Biol, Pisa, Italy","Cividini, S (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Inst Translat Med, Dept Biostat, Crown St, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",Sofia.Cividini@liverpool.ac.uk,"Cividini, Sofia/H-9942-2017; Cividini, Sofia/E-4048-2019; Montesanto, Giuseppe/D-3011-2009","Cividini, Sofia/0000-0003-2705-9224; Montesanto, Giuseppe/0000-0001-8946-1185",,,,160,2,2,3,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1543-4494,1543-4508,,LEARN BEHAV,Learn Behav.,SEP,2020,48,3,,,,,281,300,,10.3758/s13420-020-00428-3,,JUL 2020,20,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Psychology, Experimental; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,NK0HU,WOS:000545916500002,32632754,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2021-09-23,

For sympatric species, convergence of head morphology can indicate similar prey or foraging strategies while divergence can suggest competition, resource partitioning or expansion into new habitats. Sexual dimorphism can further complicate the head morphology-diet relationship by potentially reducing intraspecific competition. To understand the relationship between head morphology and diet, we studied three sympatric species, the plain-bellied (Nerodia erythrogaster), diamondback (N. rhombifer), and northern (N. sipedon) watersnakes in western Kentucky. All three species inhabit similar wetlands and feed on amphibians and fishes. The anurophagous plain-bellied watersnakes had longer, narrower heads that likely allow snakes to capture anuran metamorphs and froglets while facilitating movement through dense vegetation. The piscivorous diamondback watersnake had a wider head, which would enhance contact with prey in this open-mouth forager, and smaller interocular distance, resulting in dorsally placed eyes that facilitate seeing fish prey from below. The mostly piscivorous northern watersnake had an intermediate, generalized head shape, which may reflect the typically wide diet range of this species. Head shape did not differ between snake sexes but diamondback and northern females had larger heads than males and fed more frequently on fishes. The relationship between head morphology and diet highlights potential interspecific and intersexual competition and aids in the understanding of species coexistence patterns.","[Perkins, Micah W.] Owensboro Community & Tech Coll, Owensboro, KY 42303 USA; [Eason, Perri K.] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA","Perkins, MW (corresponding author), Owensboro Community & Tech Coll, Owensboro, KY 42303 USA.",micah.perkins@kctcs.edu,,,University of Louisville; Watershed Studies Institute (Murray State University); Greater Cincinnati Herpetological Society; Chicago Herpetological Society; Kentucky Society of Natural History; Kentucky Chapter of The Wildlife Society,"This research was funded by University of Louisville, Watershed Studies Institute (Murray State University), Greater Cincinnati Herpetological Society, Chicago Herpetological Society, Kentucky Society of Natural History, and The Kentucky Chapter of The Wildlife Society.

Such complexity makes it difficult to discern the mechanisms generating community structure. In this paper we review concepts and issues related to linking functional and community studies while also including greater complexity into the experimental realm. These principles are primarily illustrated with case studies involving predation ecology in a freshwater snail-fish-crayfish model system. The system illustrates how predator impacts on prey are mediated by multiple prey traits, correlations between traits, functional trade-offs in predator defence, interactions between predators, and interactions with other community members. We argue for a pluralistic approach to investigating mechanisms of community structure; that is, an approach that integrates many subdisciplines of ecology and evolution. We discuss four main areas that when used together yield important insights on community structure. First, selection gradient analyses formally link functional and community ecology. This formalisation is shown to help identify targets of selection, estimate environment-specific mortality rates, and identify agents of selection in complex communities. Second, we encourage increased focus on emergent community properties (results not predicted based on pairwise species interactions). Third, we emphasise that a community, rather than a web of species interactions, may more profitably be viewed as a network of trait interactions. This trait-centred view makes clear how indirect community effects arise between species that do not interact physically. This perspective also leads to our fourth topic, the integration of phenotypes. Just as populations evolve co-adapted suites of traits, so too should individuals embody integrated trait correlations, termed 'trait integration', rather than randomly assembled collections of phenotypes. All the perspectives mentioned above suggest that investigations should focus on multiple traits and multiple environments simultaneously, rather than singular, atomised components of complex systems.

The bullhead, Cottus gobio, is a species of great conservation interest threatened by the massive introduction of hatchery-reared brown trout, Salmo trutta, for angling purposes. The aims of this research were: i) to present a case-study of interspecific and intraspecific competition in dwelling fish from two Mediterranean streams ( central Italy); ii) to evaluate the bullhead population status before and after the alien brown trout removal, and iii) to investigate the influence of the environmental parameters on the abundance of both species. For the bullhead populations the abundances and the young-of- the-year percentage significantly increased after the removal activities. The growth analysis showed that, after the trout removal, bullhead were distinguished by greater performance and larger sizes in all age classes in comparison to the pre-removal period, while the condition factor (Kn) showed no differences, suggesting that the effects of trout population control acted mainly through predator-prey dynamics. An inverse correlation between the abundance of bullhead and its body condition suggested that the beneficial effects due to the reduction of predation could be compensated by the intraspecific competition due to the increase of the bullhead population density.","[Lorenzoni, Massimo; Carosi, Antonella; La Porta, Gianandrea] Univ Perugia, Dept Chem Biol & Biotechnol, Via Elce Sotto, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Giovannotti, Massimo; Splendiani, Andrea; Barucchi, Vincenzo Caputo] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy","Carosi, A (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Chem Biol & Biotechnol, Via Elce Sotto, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.",acarosi@libero.it,"Carosi, Antonella/M-4474-2016; lorenzoni, massimo/G-7610-2014; La Porta, Gianandrea/F-3545-2014; Carosi, Antonella/AAE-4635-2020; Giovannotti, Massimo/AAZ-3563-2020","Carosi, Antonella/0000-0003-0513-7287; La Porta, Gianandrea/0000-0002-6465-5423; Giovannotti, Massimo/0000-0001-7622-3583",Lifethorn TROTA Project [LIFE12 NAT/IT/0000940],"This work was funded by Lifethorn TROTA Project (LIFE12 NAT/IT/0000940) for the recovery and conservation of Mediterranean trout (Salmo trutta complex) in the central Apennines (Italy), within the framework of the European Commission Life Projects.

We investigated the relative abundance and microhabitat selection of Northern Pygmy Salamander and Southern Pygmy Salamander in 3 forest types of different elevations across the mountains of North Carolina during the summer of 2015. We conducted 2-h time-constrained searches at 4 sites in Picea rubens (Red Spruce)-Abies fraseri (Fraser Fir) forests, northern hardwood forests, and mountain cove forests for each species. We quantified microhabitat characteristics at each pygmy salamander location and at a corresponding random location 2-30 m away. We captured a total of 98 pygmy salamanders (D. organi = 41, D. wrighti = 57): 52 in spruce-fir forests, 26 in northern hardwood forests, and 20 in cove forests, and recorded 655 other salamanders representing 15 species. Relative abundance of pygmy salamanders was greater in spruce-fir forests than in cove forests, but was not significantly different between spruce-fir and northern hardwood forests. Microhabitat did not differ between Northern Pygmy Salamander and Southern Pygmy Salamander for any of the variables examined, except for soil moisture, which was greater at Northern Pygmy Salamander locations and may have been a spurious result. We observed pygmy salamanders almost exclusively beneath wood cover-objects, and size of cover objects did not differ from the size available in the surrounding environments. Total area of small-sized down woody debris (DWD) and total area of large-sized DWD were the only variables associated with the presence of pygmy salamanders, suggesting that pygmy salamanders avoid predation and interspecific competition by selecting sites that minimize encounters with larger salamanders.","[Rossell, C.

Competitive interactions are an important determinant of foraging rates; however, the relationship between the exploitation and interference components of competition has received little empirical or theoretical consideration. Moreover, little is known about the relationship between aggressive behavioural interactions and interference competition. Using a natural gradient of consumer and resource densities, we empirically examine how aggressiveness relates to consumer-consumer encounter rates and foraging for four species of Chaetodon reef fish spanning a range of dietary niche breadths. The probability of aggression was most strongly associated with both total consumer and resource densities. In contrast, total encounter rates were best predicted by conspecific consumer density, and were highest for the most specialised consumer (Chaetodon trifascialis), not the most aggressive (Chaetodon baronessa). The most specialised consumer, not the most aggressive, also exhibited the largest reduction in foraging rates with increasing consumer density. Our results support the idea of a positive link between the exploitation and interference components of competition for the most specialised consumer. Moreover, our results caution against inferring the presence of ecological interactions (competition) from observations of behaviour (aggression and agonism) alone.","[Blowes, Shane A.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Blowes, Shane A.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Blowes, Shane A.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Blowes, SA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Blowes, SA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Blowes, SA (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",sablowes@gmail.com,"Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020","Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Blowes, Shane/0000-0001-6310-3670",James Cook University; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Queensland Smart State Ph.D. fellowship; JCU Ecological Modelling Research Group,"We thank James Cook University and the Australian Research Council for financial support; SAB was also supported by a Queensland Smart State Ph.D. fellowship.

Introduced plants generally have lower generalist herbivore loads than native plants. Herbivores may be avoiding a potentially edible food source (Behavioural Constraint Hypothesis) or defences of introduced plants may be unusually toxic (Novel Defence Hypothesis). 2. To examine these hypotheses, acridid grasshoppers (Melanoplus angustipennis and Orphullela pelidna) were enclosed in a Texas grassland. Each enclosure contained native prairie vegetation and a seedling of either introduced Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) or native Celtis laevigata (hackberry). Sapium invades many ecosystems in the south-east U.S.A. Celtis seedlings also establish in these ecosystems. 3. Although grasshoppers usually feed sparingly on Sapium, in field enclosures they fed heavily on this introduced tree species, supporting a role for behavioural avoidance. In laboratory feeding trials, M. angustipennis grasshoppers preferred Sapium foliage over the foliage of three native tree species. In a greenhouse experiment, M. angustipennis individuals fed more on Sapium in prairie mesocosms if they were conditioned on Sapium. 4. In another field experiment with single seedlings in enclosures, grasshoppers consumed similar amounts of Sapium from its introduced (Texas, U.S.A.) and native (China) ranges, suggesting that Sapium may have been a suitable host plant since it was introduced. Behavioural avoidance by generalist herbivores may contribute to Sapium's low herbivore load in its introduced range.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Siemann, E (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol MS 170, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",siemann@rice.edu,"Lankau, Richard A/B-9760-2008","Lankau, Richard A/0000-0001-9995-328X",,,,45,59,69,2,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Resource partitioning may be facilitated by behavioural differentiation along three main niche dimensions: habitat, food and time. In this study, we investigate the extent to which these mechanisms can explain the coexistence of an assemblage of five sympatric felids in Borneo. Using multi-scale logistic regression, we show that Bornean felids exhibit differences in both their broad and fine-scale habitat use. We calculate temporal activity patterns and overlap between these species, and present evidence for temporal separation within this felid guild. Lastly, we conducted an all-subsets logistic regression to predict the occurrence of each felid species as a function of the co-occurrence of a large number of other species and showed that Bornean felids co-occurred with a range of other species, some of which could be candidate prey. Our study reveals apparent resource partitioning within the Bornean felid assemblage, operating along all three niche dimension axes. These results provide new insights into the ecology of these species and the broader community in which they live and also provide important information for conservation planning for this guild of predators.","[Hearn, Andrew J.; Ross, Joanna; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit WildCRU, Oxford, England; [Cushman, Samuel A.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Goossens, Benoit] Danau Girang Field Ctr, Sabah Wildlife Dept, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Goossens, Benoit] Sabah Wildlife Dept, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Goossens, Benoit] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Biosci, Organisms & Environm Div, Sir Martin Evans Bldg,Museum Ave, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Goossens, Benoit] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Pl Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Hunter, Luke T.

This is an ideal place for studying resource limitations because it avoids various complicating factors that are difficult to quantify but might affect animal densities, such as predation, interspecific competition, and past catastrophes. The relative group density was high in the coastal forest (0-400 m), while it did not differ among the higher zones (400-800, 800-1200 and 1200-1886 m). To examine this variation, three habitat variables were analyzed: total basal area of food trees per unit area, seasonal variations in fruit abundance, and total annual fleshy fruit production. All of these variables indicate that fruit and seeds are most available in the coastal forest. Thus, altitudinal variations in the density of Japanese macaques on Yakushima are determined by the total annual food abundance.","Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; Ryukoku Univ, Kyoto 6120021, Japan; Tonoji Terada, Inuyama, Aichi 4840094, Japan; Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Hikone 5228533, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Takaoka, Tomakomai 0530035, Japan; Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Gakuen, Sanda 6691337, Japan","Hanya, G (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Aichi 4848506, Japan.",hanya@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Agetsuma, Naoki/A-4329-2012","Agetsuma, Naoki/0000-0003-4093-5276",,,,45,39,40,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Summer declines in deposit feeding populations have been ascribed to food limitation and to the seasonal influx of predators. We used a bioassay approach to test the following hypotheses: (1) Sediment supports more population growth in the spring and early summer, relative to the late summer and fall. (2) The nutritive value of sediment declines from spring to early fall, and absorption therefore should decrease. Laboratory tests using the common deposit feeding oligochaete Paranais litoralis partially support both hypotheses. Population growth studies of spring and summer sediment show a relatively nutritionally enriched surface sediment layer, suggesting that the sediment is recharged in the late fall and winter, either by particulate organic matter deposition or microbial transformation of previously unabsorbable material. High summer temperature contributes to the negative effect of poor sediment quality. In Flax Pond, Long Island, New York, field studies show summer declines of several species of deposit feeding invertebrates, but caging studies demonstrate that predation is not a likely cause of the crashes, which proceed at similar rates inside and outside of cages.","SUNY, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA",,,,,,,,63,52,53,0,5,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Habitat characteristics were measured on 13 islands in winter and summer, 2008-11. Burrows of the four species were associated with one or more habitat parameters, potentially explained by predator avoidance, physical requirements and possibly by interspecific competition. Whereas the habitat characteristics used by each species showed broad interspecific overlap, there was strong divergence, and the four species typically occupied different nesting sites within breeding areas.

Knowledge about the ecology of A. rubens in these highly seasonal systems is largely limited to studies of interspecific competition for prey. Two experiments in an oscillatory wave tank were used to test the hypothesis that wave action and starvation modulate displacement, microhabitat selection, and ability to contact mussel (Mytilus edulis) prey in A. rubens from southeastern Newfoundland. Both experiments were carried out in two seasons (winter and summer) to quantify intra-annual variation in the effects of wave action (three wave velocities: null [0.0 m s(-1)], low [0.1 m s(-1)], and high [0.2 m s(-1)]) and starvation (two levels: fed and starved three weeks). Experiment 1, in which two sea stars were allowed to displace and make contact with six microhabitats typifying natural seabed heterogeneity, showed that A. rubens displaced up to 50% less with increasing wave velocity. Displacement was 120% higher in summer than winter and lower in starved than fed individuals in summer only. The sea star predominantly stayed on flat horizontal surfaces, did so more frequently in the presence than absence of waves, and spent more time in the two most uneven microhabitats in winter than summer regardless of wave velocity. Experiment 2, in which one sea star in the centre of a depression was allowed to move to the top of surrounding mounds, showed that more sea stars that left the centre of the depression reached the top of the mounds in summer than winter, in the absence than presence of waves, and when starved than fed. Sea stars that reached the top of mounds spent more time there in the presence than absence of mussels in summer only, when starved than fed in summer only, and in the presence than absence of mussels at null and low wave velocities. Measurements of wave height, sea temperature, and A. rubens abundance over six months at one subtidal site indicated that the sea star was >4 times more abundant at 8 m than at 2 m and 4 m. This difference was unrelated to temperature and likely mainly caused by the wave environment. Collectively, results demonstrate that wave action, and to a lesser extent starvation, are key modulators of the inclination and ability of A. rubens to explore its environment and localize prey. In southeastern Newfoundland, the response of A. rubens to wave action and starvation is adaptable, being generally stronger in summer than winter, when sea temperature is markedly lower.

Numbers of nesting Caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia) and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) were stable at about 700-1,000 breeding pairs at five colonies and about 1,200-1,500 breeding pairs at four colonies, respectively. Numbers of American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) increased at Badger Island, the sole breeding colony for the species on the Columbia Plateau, from about 900 individuals in 2007 to over 2,000 individuals in 2010. Overall numbers of breeding California gulls (Larus californicus) and ring-billed gulls (L. delawarensis) declined during the study, mostly because of the abandonment of a large colony in the mid-Columbia River. Three gull colonies below the confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers increased substantially, however. Factors that may limit colony size and productivity for piscivorous waterbirds nesting on the Columbia Plateau included availability of suitable nesting habitat, interspecific competition for nest sites, predation, gull kleptoparasitism, food availability, and human disturbance. Based on observed population trends alone, there is little reason to project increased impacts to juvenile salmonid survival from tern and cormorant populations. Additional monitoring and evaluation may be warranted to assess future impacts of the growing Badger Island American white pelican colony and those gull colonies located near mainstem dams or associated with Caspian tern colonies where kleptoparasitism is common.","[Adkins, Jessica Y.; Lyons, Donald E.; Loschl, Peter J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Roby, Daniel D.] Oregon State Univ, US Geol Survey, Oregon Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Collis, Ken; Evans, Allen F.; Hostetter, Nathan J.] Real Time Res Inc, Bend, OR 97702 USA","Collis, K (corresponding author), Real Time Res Inc, 52 SW Roosevelt Ave, Bend, OR 97702 USA.",ken@realtimeresearch.com,,,U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)-Walla Walla District; U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR),"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)-Walla Walla District and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) provided funding for this research; we thank C.

Between the guild of ants that are attracted to these seeds, only a few of them will act as effective dispersers, that is, transporting the seeds to suitable sites (the nests) for germination and plant establishment. Ant communities are known to be highly hierarchical, and subordinate ants quickly deliver resources to their nest rather than consuming it on-site, thereby avoiding encounters with more dominant species. As a result of a series of studies that were carried out during summer in semi-arid Northwest Argentina, we have found that the most important seed disperser of the myrmecochorous plant Jatropha excisa Griseb. (Euphorbiaceae), the ant Pogonomyrmex cunicularius pencosensis Forel, was the most subordinate species during interspecific interactions. The daily timing of release of the J. excisa seeds through ballistic dispersal increased their probability of being removed by the highly thermophilic P. cunicularius pencosensis. Foraging during the warmest hours of the day allowed P. cunicularius pencosensis ants to avoid the risk of interference competition with dominant species, which also behaved as elaiosome predators. As a conclusion, subordinance behaviour appears to be integral to successful myrmecochory, and also the timing of seed release plays a key role in shaping the dynamics of myrmecochorous interactions. Therefore, ant-dispersed plants should not only favour their discovery by subordinate ants, but also should present their seeds at those times of the day when the behaviourally dominant ants are less active.","[Aranda-Rickert, Adriana; Fracchia, Sebastian] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina","Aranda-Rickert, A (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina.",ardrickert@yahoo.com.ar,,,Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas,"This study is part of the Ph.D. dissertation of A.A.R. at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, which was financially supported by a Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas Grant.

Here we examine if logging -a prevalent activity in the tropics- drives a pattern of differential defaunation in a Neotropical forest managed by a community of indigenous people. Using a match-paired design, we conducted mammalian surveys during four consecutive years in three independent sites, each one including (1) areas for logging practiced by Maya communities of the Yucatan Peninsula (selective and interspaced harvesting), and (2) adjacent areas set aside as reserves. We found that in logged areas the abundance of medium and large mammals decreased (4.3-fold, overall), while the abundance of small mammals increased (2.5-fold, overall). We posit that these changes result from a combination of factors, including: (1) facilitated access for hunters of medium- and large-sized game, comprising both predators (potentially leading to small-prey release) and competitors of small-bodied species; (2) changes in vegetation (e.g., more shelter and food for rodents); and (3) contrasting animal life history traits (population growth rate, home range size). We conclude that although non-intensive logging interventions have negative consequences for the mammalian community (for at least ten years after harvesting), the indigenous practices of rotational harvesting and maintaining reserves help to prevent the landscape-wide mammalian declines known to occur under large-scale industrial logging.","[Gutierrez-Granados, Gabriel; Dirzo, Rodolfo] UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Zaragoza, UMIEZ, Batalla 5 Mayo S-N Esquina Fuerte Loreto, Ciudad De Mexico 09320, Mexico; [Dirzo, Rodolfo] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, 327 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dirzo, Rodolfo] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, 327 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gutierrez-Granados, G (corresponding author), UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Zaragoza, UMIEZ, Batalla 5 Mayo S-N Esquina Fuerte Loreto, Ciudad De Mexico 09320, Mexico.",gabrielgg@comunidad.unam.mx,,"Gutierrez, Gabriel/0000-0002-5967-7425",CONABIO [BJ045]; UNAMUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); CONABIO; Instituto de Ecologia (UNAM)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Stanford UniversityStanford University,"This project was funded by CONABIO (project BJ045).

Body reserves of Willow Tits as subordinate flock members were found to be dependent on the presence of dominant Crested Tits. At dusk, Willow Tits were heavier than Crested Tits. Body reserves of members of mixed-species flocks negatively correlated with dominance rank within both intraspecific and interspecific hierarchies. Removal experiments confirmed results of field observations, revealing a causal relationship between rank and ability to choose the safest fattening strategy. Body mass and fat reserves of Willow Tit alpha males decreased in the absence of Crested Tits. In contrast, body mass and fatness of dominant individuals of Crested Tits remained at the same level. To control for changes in body mass resulting from a higher rank and smaller flocks, the foraging height of remaining individuals of both species was recorded. Willow Tits responded to removal of Costed Tits by foraging closer to the top of the tree. No shifts were observed in groups with only Crested Tits. Fattening strategies dependent on social status represent a flocking cost to individuals belonging to a subordinate species. Further investigations should be done into the benefits of mixed-species flocking, which is a social behaviour common in parids.","Daugavpils Pedagog Univ, Dept Sci, LV-5407 Daugavpils, Latvia","Krams, I (corresponding author), Daugavpils Pedagog Univ, Dept Sci, LV-5407 Daugavpils, Latvia.",root@maknia.latg.lv,"Krams, Indrikis/B-5788-2017","Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108",,,,45,26,26,1,9,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,1998,75,1,,,,,19,26,,,,,8,Ornithology,Zoology,ZH886,WOS:000073157300002,,,,,2021-09-23,

Yet, in apparent defiance of the competitive exclusion principle, large numbers of species form natural communities while sharing a small number of limiting resources. Consumers not only coexist, but also show positive facilitative interactions among themselves. Since body size and functional responses may play important roles in these interactions, we investigate their joint effects on two consumers over a single resource. We find that two consumers with unimodal Type IV functional response can facilitate each other by increasing each other's intake rates. But, this facilitation does not necessarily impact their co-existence. When the consumers differ in their body sizes, the larger consumer receives greater absolute benefits, and the smaller consumer gains more relative benefits. These results are consistent with empirical observations, and do not require any additional assumptions over the parameters governing dynamics of resources to explain net positive interactions between consumers.

The role of the foraging behaviour in promoting species coexistence was also examined. We used giving-up densities (GUDs) in artificial food patches to measure the patch use of rodents and video trapping to directly record the foraging behaviour, vigilance, and interspecific interactions. Three potential mechanisms of coexistence were evaluated (1) microhabitat partitioning; (2) spatial heterogeneity of resource abundance with a tradeoff in foraging efficiency vs. locomotion; and (3) temporal partitioning on a daily scale. Compared to M. meridianus, D. sagitta generally possessed lower GUDs, spent more time on patches, and conducted more visits per tray per capita, regardless of microhabitat. However, M. meridianus possessed advantages in average harvesting rates and direct interference against D. sagitta. Our results only partly support the third mechanism listed above. We propose another potential mechanism of coexistence: a tradeoff between interference competition and safety, with M. meridianus better at interference competition and D. sagitta better at avoiding predation risk. This mechanism is uncommon in previously studied desert rodent systems.","[Shuai, Ling-Ying; Song, Yan-Ling; Zeng, Zhi-Gao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kotler, Burt P.; Embar, Keren] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Sede Boker Campus, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Zeng, ZG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zengzhg@ioz.ac.cn,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Shuai, Ling-Ying/AAB-8639-2020","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; ",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31201722],This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31201722].,,37,4,5,1,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1565-9801,2224-4662,,ISR J ECOL EVOL,Isr.

The distribution of the introduced calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE) shifted from brackish to fresh water in 1993 following the introductions of 2 brackish-water copepods, the small but numerically dominant Limnoithona tetraspina (Cyclo poida) and the predatory Acartiella sinensis (Calanoida). The nearly simultaneous timing of these introductions complicated interpretation of the temporal change in distribution of P. forbesi. Although P. forbesi is now uncommon at salinity >similar to 2, which might be interpreted as the result of salinity stress, short-term experiments showed high survival of adults up to salinity similar to 8 and of nauplii to salinity of at least 14, and reproduction was highest at salinity 5. Feeding experiments showed some overlap in diets of P. forbesi and L. tetraspina, but P. forbesi consumed a broader range of prey than L. tetraspina. Furthermore, feeding rates of the L. tetraspina population appeared insufficient to reduce prey availability to P. forbesi. Previous reports of high consumption of nauplii by A. sinensis and the clam Potamocorbula amurensis suggest that these interspecific interactions are important in constraining the distribution of P. forbesi in the upper SFE. Thus, we interpret the temporal shift in distribution of P. forbesi as due mainly to the introduction of the predatory copepod, whose high abundance may have been facilitated by the availability of a common alternative prey, L. tetraspina.","[Kayfetz, Karen] Delta Stewardship Council, Delta Sci Program, 980 9th St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Kimmerer, Wim] San Francisco State Univ, Romberg Tiburon Ctr Environm Studies, 3152 Paradise Dr, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA","Kayfetz, K (corresponding author), Delta Stewardship Council, Delta Sci Program, 980 9th St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA.",karen.kayfetz@deltacouncil.ca.gov,,"Kayfetz, Karen/0000-0003-3236-4469",U.S. Dept. of Interior agreement [R10AC20074],"We thank A.

In birds, subordinates with restricted access to resources may respond to intragroup contests by acquiring extra body reserves to avoid periods of food shortage. In turn, higher body mass reduces agility and increases predation and mortality risk to subordinates. Birds often live in hierarchically organized mixed-species groups, in which heterospecific individuals are considered to substitute for conspecifics as protection against predators at a significantly reduced competition cost. Crested tits (Lophophanes cristatus) and willow tits (Poecile montanus) form mixed-species groups during the non-reproductive season that typically exhibit a nearly linear dominance hierarchy ('despotic' social structure) in which the highest ranking male willow tit is fourth in the overall hierarchy after the dominant male, female and subordinate juvenile crested tit, respectively. Much less frequently, 'egalitarian' dominance structures occur in which the adult willow tits rank second and the hierarchy is less steep, or linear. We present a rare long-term data set in which egalitarian flocks are common enough to assess the consequences of this simple change in hierarchy structure as well as a potential driver of the pattern. A comparison of individuals in the despotic mixed-species groups revealed a strong negative correlation between subcutaneous fat stores and dominance rank in the interspecific dominance hierarchy, whereas in egalitarian groups, subordinate willow tits had significantly lower fat reserves and they foraged in safer parts of the canopy than willow tits in despotic groups. Moreover, egalitarian groups exhibited markedly less within-group aggression, higher group cohesion and improved winter survival in both tit species. However, winter survival of birds in egalitarian groups was impaired relative to despotic groups in forests recently affected by industrial forestry. This suggests that the more egalitarian bird societies may best be adapted to less-disturbed environments.","[Krams, Indrikis A.; Krama, Tatjana] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Krams, Indrikis A.] Latvian Biomed Res & Study Ctr, LV-1067 Riga, Latvia; [Krams, Indrikis A.] Univ Latvia, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Fac Biol, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia; [Luoto, Severi] Univ Auckland, English Drama & Writing Studies, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Luoto, Severi] Univ Auckland, Sch Psychol, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Krams, Ronalds] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Dept Plant Hlth, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Sieving, Kathryn] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Trakimas, Giedrius] Vilnius Univ, Inst Biosci, LT-10257 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Elferts, Didzis] Univ Latvia, Dept Bot & Ecol, Fac Biol, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia; [Rantala, Markus J.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Rantala, Markus J.] Univ Turku, Turku Brain & Mind Ctr, Turku 20014, Finland; [Goodale, Eben] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Guangxi Key Lab Forest Ecol & Conservat, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Krams, IA (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.; Krams, IA (corresponding author), Latvian Biomed Res & Study Ctr, LV-1067 Riga, Latvia.; Krams, IA (corresponding author), Univ Latvia, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Fac Biol, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia.",indrikis.krams@ut.ee,"Goodale, Eben/AAM-7436-2020; Elferts, Didzis/M-8533-2015; Luoto, Severi/I-8548-2019; Trakimas, Giedrius/B-8462-2008; Sieving, Kathryn/I-6058-2013","Goodale, Eben/0000-0003-3403-2847; Elferts, Didzis/0000-0002-9401-1231; Luoto, Severi/0000-0002-3904-3994; Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108; Krams, Ronalds/0000-0003-4445-746X; Trakimas, Giedrius/0000-0001-6294-0194; Sieving, Kathryn/0000-0002-0849-8101","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Latvian Council of ScienceLatvian Ministry of Education and Science [290/2012, lzp-2018/1-0393]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [PUT1223]; Emil Aaltonen Foundation Young Researcher Grant","We thank Dr. Jolanta Vrublevska, Dr. Inese Kivleniece and Aleksejs Osipovs for their help in the field.

We compared the behaviour of birds that foraged in pairs (mono- or hetero-specific) and solitarily. The percentage of time spent foraging was higher when a Great Tit was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species rather than with another Great Tit or a member of the dominant species. When a bird was solitary, time spent foraging was less than when it was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species, and greater than when it was with one belonging to the dominant species. The proportion of time spent vigilant did not differ between Great Tits that foraged with an individual from a dominant species or a subordinate species or with a conspecific, but was higher for solitary birds. Vigilance time of solitary Great Tits, Nuthatches, and three other Parus species was not negatively correlated with interspecific dominance status. In these small passerines, vigilance does not seem to be directed towards the detection of a competitor species. Surveillance for predators and detection of competitor species may be synchronous, nonexclusive tasks. Scanning rate (number of scans per minute of feeding) was the same for Great Tits that fed either solitarily or in pairs, but mean scan duration was significantly shorter for individuals in groups than when solitary.

In CNP, H. bimaculata occurs in the absence of other fish species and major invertebrate predators along an approximately 1000 m elevation gradient. This allowed for the examination of trait variation along the gradient without the confounding effects of interspecific interactions or habitat patchiness. Heterandria bimaculata exhibited traits characteristic of a low-predation environment: balanced sex ratio, slow growth, late maturity and large female size. Females produced more, smaller eggs from upstream to downstream, but overall reproductive allocation remained constant along the gradient. Maximum male length and annual growth rates increased from upstream to downstream, but female growth showed no trend. The patterns of growth and reproductive allocation tradeoff are consistent with predicted response to a longitudinally-increasing productivity gradient in which food resources become more abundant downstream. Macrobrachium and Bellastoma could have caused some predation, but were sparse and patchily distributed. Fish density remained fairly constant among elevations; if food resources were limiting in upstream habitats, per-capita resource availability would be lower and density-dependent competition would drive selection for larger but fewer, more competitive offspring. Future work should quantify longitudinal changes in productivity and conduct experiments to decouple the effects of stream order and fish density dependence.","[Olinger, Charles T.; Peoples, Brandon K.; Frimpong, Emmanuel A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 100 Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Peoples, Brandon K.] Operat Wallacea, Wallace House, Spilsby PE23 4EX, Lincs, England","Frimpong, EA (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 100 Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",colinger@vt.edu; bpeoples@vt.edu; frimp@vt.edu,,,Operation Wallacea,"This project was funded by Operation Wallacea.

We tested this prediction with a granivorous avian guild consisting of only two Carpodacus members that bred in a Tibetan alpine zone at 4,200-4,600 m a.s.l. These two species, Streaked rosefinch C. rubicilloides weighing 40 g and Pink-rumped rosefinch C. eos 20 g, represent the extreme of body size of their genus. Both rosefinch species as the dominant members of local passerine breeders had similar breeding densities. They did not segregate in clutch initiation date, nesting altitude, habitat patches or nesting plant species, but in nesting plant height, with C. rubicilloides using those taller than the average of local bushes and C. eos using those lower than the average. No overlap in diet fed to nestlings between the two rosefinch species. C. rubicilloides with large and strong beaks primarily exploited the leguminous seeds, whereas C. eos mainly collected small seeds at ground level from a variety of plant species in accord with their smaller beaks. Interspecific aggression and territoriality were lack. The mechanisms underlying stable coexistence of the two rosefinch congeners should contribute to their success in the harsh abiotic environments.","[Lu, Xin; Gong, Guohong; Ma, Xiaoyan] Wuhan Univ, Dept Zool, Coll Life Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China","Lu, X (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Dept Zool, Coll Life Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",luxinwh@gmail.com,,,National Sciences Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30425036],"We thank the Buddhists in Xiongse nunnery for logistical assistance, and L.Y.

However, its populations have significantly declined in recent decades, principally as the result of agricultural intensification on arable land. Its abundance has also undergone a significant decline in forested areas over the last few decades, where wild ungulate management and abundance have increased. In this scenario, we aimed to test the factors that affect red-legged partridge abundance in relation to high wild ungulate (wild boar and red deer) abundance in south-central Spain. The factors included as predictors were carnivore, wild boar and red deer abundances, vegetation features, nest predation rate and invertebrate availability. Red deer abundance showed a negative relationship with partridge abundance in spring (non-significant negative trends were also evident for carnivore and wild boar), whereas variables related to food availability (grass biomass, Hemipteran abundance and total invertebrate mass) had a positive effect in the same season. Moreover, deer and carnivore abundances and spring nest predation rate were negatively associated with partridge abundance in autumn. Plant biomass and Hemipteran abundance were negatively correlated with wild boar abundance, whereas maximum pasture height was negatively related to red deer and wild boar abundance. Overall, our results show that high ungulate densities may negatively affect partridge abundance, which may be mediated by (i) a reduction in food availability (invertebrate and herbaceous plant biomass) and (ii) nest predation by wild boar. This research has shown that current intensive big-game hunting management schemes in south-central Spain are often incompatible with red-legged partridge conservation, and that these effects should be taken into account when defining big-game management and conservation policies.","[Carpio, A.

Age-intensity data for birds of known age suggest that the rate of parasite uptake increases during the first 6 mo of a bird's life and this increase reflects an increase in feeding rate with age and exhibits no signs of self-cure. Analysis of these age-intensity curves permits us to estimate the transmission rate of the free-living infective stages. Reinfection rates of adults treated to reduce parasite intensities were not significantly different from infection rates of naive immature grouse. Secondary infections continued to rise over a period of 18 mo and this suggests that there is no strong host-mediated response against the parasite. Any density-dependent reduction in parasite fecundity is probably very weak and would act through interspecific competition between parasites. Initial analysis of worm egg production in relation to the intensity of worm infection found weak evidence of density-dependent suppression of egg production at high worm intensities. However, a more rigorous analysis found that such a relationship suffered from Type I errors and was a consequence of the aggregated distribution of the parasites. Any density-dependent suppression of parasite egg production is too weak to be detected and would only occur at high worm intensities. The potential density-dependent reductions in fecundity on the population dynamics of T. tenuis and red grouse are examined using a mathematical model. The model suggests that the presence of density-dependent reductions in worm fecundity could produce significant reductions in the propensity of the grouse-nematode system to exhibit population cycles. The sustained cycles observed in the long-term dynamics of the grouse populations in the study area suggest that density-dependent reductions in worm fecundity and establishment are either absent or only operating at levels that are not detectable in field studies.","GAME CONSERVANCY, UPLAND RES GRP, NEWTONMORE PH20 1BE, INVERNESS, SCOTLAND",,,"Hudson, Peter/AAB-8080-2020","Hudson, Peter/0000-0003-0468-3403",,,,46,39,39,1,32,ALLEN PRESS INC,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0022-3395,1937-2345,,J PARASITOL,J.

However, community ecology studies have mainly focused on simple competition and predation systems, and the relative impact of positive interspecific interactions in shaping communities in a spatial context is not well understood. Here we employ a spatially explicit metacommunity model to investigate the effect of local dispersal on the structure and function of communities in which species are linked through an interaction web comprising mutualism, competition and exploitation. Our results show that function, diversity and interspecific interactions of locally linked communities undergo a phase transition with changes in the rate of species dispersal. We find that low spatial interconnectedness favors the spontaneous emergence of strongly mutualistic communities which are more stable but less productive and diverse. On the other hand, high spatial interconnectedness promotes local biodiversity at the expense of local stability and supports communities with a wide range of interspecific interactions. We argue that investigations of the relationship between spatial processes and the self-organization of complex interaction webs are critical to understanding the geographic structure of interactions in real landscapes.

However, there is growing evidence that negative interactions among distantly related taxa also occur and may be far more important than previously thought. In this study, we took advantage of an 11-year-old replicated vertebrate-exclosure experiment in a coastal dune community in northern California, USA, to examine the effects of the two most common vertebrate herbivores (jackrabbits and black-tailed deer) on the abundance of the three most visible invertebrate herbivores (two snail, a moth, and a grasshopper species). Our results indicate that four of the six possible pairwise interactions were significantly negative for the invertebrates. Jackrabbits reduced the abundances of snails by 44-75%, tiger moth caterpillars by 36%, and grasshoppers by 62%. Deer reduced the abundances of snails by 32%, increased the abundances of caterpillars by 31%, and had no measurable effect on grasshopper abundance. Our data also revealed that jackrabbits significantly decreased the volume of forbs and common shrubs and the flowering by grasses in our study plots. We were unable to detect an effect of deer on these measures of vegetation. These results suggest that by changing vegetation, jackrabbits may reduce invertebrate populations that are limited by food, protective structures, or microclimate provided by plants. Of these three mechanisms, only shade was strongly supported as limiting snail numbers in smaller-scale manipulations. In most systems, as in this one, the number of pairs of distantly related herbivores far exceeds the number of pairs of congeners. Since interactions among distantly related herbivores may be common in many cases, these interactions are likely to be important and should receive far more attention from ecologists.","[Huntzinger, Mikaela] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Cushman, Hall] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA","Huntzinger, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,40,35,37,0,51,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2008,89,7,,,,,1972,1980,,10.1890/07-0834.1,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,331JC,WOS:000258007500019,18705383,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-23,

However, these models often ignore species interactions, which are vital for determining community composition and structure. To evaluate both direct and indirect effects of climate change on species distributions, we applied the Menge-Sutherland model, which describes the relative role of predation and environmental stress in regulating community structure. Using a space-for-time approach, we tested the predictions that (1) predators are more strongly impacted by increasing environmental stress than prey (as described in the Menge-Sutherland model) and (2) incorporating indirect (predator) effects increases our ability to predict impacts of increased temperature on prey distributions. We surveyed vertical distributions of predators (sea stars) and a foundational prey species (mussels) at 20 intertidal sites spanning a thermal gradient along the West Coast of the United States. Using generalized linear models and structural equation models, we found that as temperature increased, the upper limits of foundational prey species decreased (a direct effect), while prey lower limits also shifted downward, due to an indirect effect of temperature on predator distributions. Under future climate change, mussel ranges may undergo vertical shifts toward subtidal habitats, allowing for localized persistence of mussels and associated species. Our model comparisons indicate that this framework-incorporating both direct and indirect environmental stress effects within a classic community regulation model-can improve prediction of responses to warming.

We have developed a new and highly tractable optimal foraging model for drift-feeding fishes that is based on the profitability of occupying varying focal-point velocities in a stream. The basic model can be written as: I-x = (E-x * P-x) = {(D * A * V) * [1/(1 + e((b + cV)))]} - S-x where: (1) I-x is the net energy intake at velocity x; (2) E is prey encounter rate; (3) P is prey capture success rate which can be modelled as 1/(1 + e((b + cV))) where b and c are fitting constants from the prey capture success curve; (4) D is the energy content of prey (J/m(3)) in the drift; (5) A is the visual reactive area of the fish; (6) V is velocity (cm/s); and (7) S is the cost of maintaining position (J/s). Given that D, A and S can be considered constant over the range of velocities occupied by these fishes, the model reduces to e((b + cV)) = 1/(cV - 1) which we solved iteratively to yield an optimal focal-point velocity for species in each sample. We tested the model by comparing its predictions to the mean focal-point velocities (i.e. microhabitats) occupied by four species of drift-feeding minnows in two sites in a stream in North Carolina, USA. The model successfully predicted focal-point velocities occupied by these species (11 out of 14 cases) in three seasonal samples collected over 2 years at two sites. The unsuccessful predictions still were within 2 cm/s of the 95% confidence intervals of mean velocities occupied by fishes, whereas the overall mean deviation between optimal velocities and mean fish velocities was small (range = 0.9 and 3.3 cm/s for the warpaint shiner and the Tennessee shiner, respectively). Available focal-point velocities ranged from 0-76 to 0-128 cm/s depending on site and season. Our findings represent one of the more rigorous field tests of an optimal foraging/habitat selection model for aquatic organisms because they encompass multiple species and years, and for one species, multiple sites. Because of the ease of parameterization of our model, it should be readily testable in a range of lotic habitats. If validated in other systems, the model should provide critical habitat information that will aid in the management of riverine systems and improve the performance of a variety of currently used management models (e.g. instream flow incremental methodology (IFIM) and total maximum daily load calculations (TMDL)).","Univ Georgia, DB Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Grossman, GD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, DB Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,,,,,36,60,60,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

One way to avoid competition while maintaining the benefits of living in a group is to form interspecific associations with species with relatively little dietary overlap. Here we report a stable association between a male golden-headed lion tamarin (GHLT), Leontopithecus chrysomelas, and a group of Wied's black-tufted-ear marmosets (WBTMs), Callithrix kuhlii. We collected ecological and behavioral data on a duo of GHLTs from May to August 2008, totaling 62 h of observations. On 19 August 2008, the radio-collared GHLT dispersed alone and was located on 28 August in association with WBTMs. To examine possible changes in GHLT ecology and behavior, we monitored the mixed-species group between September and December 2008, totaling 122 h of observations. We found that the GHLT's home range and daily path length decreased by about ten and three times, respectively, after joining the WBTM group, suggesting adaptations to the WBTMs' use of space. All non-agonistic behaviors recorded in the mixed group were directed from GHLT to the WBMTs, whereas all agonistic interactions were directed from the WBMTs to the GHLT, indicating a subordinate position of GHLT in the mixed group. In golden lion tamarins, reproductive success of subordinate adult males that remain in the group is higher than that of those that disperse and prospect for a breeding opportunity. If dispersing individuals are unable to find a mate and defend a territory, they will likely die within a year. The dispersing GHLT in this study assumed a subordinate role in a mixed-species group outside a GHLT territory. Apparently, the benefits of waiting for a dispersing female in a relatively safe situation may exceed the costs of prospecting elsewhere or being a subordinate.","[Oliveira, Leonardo de Carvalho] UERJ, Dept Ciencias, Fac Formacao Prof, Rua Dr Francisco Portela,1470 Patronato, BR-24435005 Sao Goncalo, RJ, Brazil; [Dietz, James] Univ Maryland, Program Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Oliveira, Leonardo de Carvalho; de Almeida Rocha, Juliana Monteiro; dos Reis, Paula Pedreira] Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidad, BR-45662900 Ilheus, BA, Brazil; [dos Reis, Paula Pedreira] Inst Estudos Socioambientais Sul Bahia IESB, Rua Araujo Pinho,72-3 Andar, BR-45653145 Ilheus, BA, Brazil; [Oliveira, Leonardo de Carvalho] Bicho Mato Inst Pesquisa, Ave Consul Antonio Cadar 600, BR-30360082 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Dietz, James] Save Golden Lion Tamarin, Silver Spring, MD USA","Oliveira, LD (corresponding author), UERJ, Dept Ciencias, Fac Formacao Prof, Rua Dr Francisco Portela,1470 Patronato, BR-24435005 Sao Goncalo, RJ, Brazil.; Oliveira, LD (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidad, BR-45662900 Ilheus, BA, Brazil.; Oliveira, LD (corresponding author), Bicho Mato Inst Pesquisa, Ave Consul Antonio Cadar 600, BR-30360082 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",leonardoco@gmail.com,"Oliveira, Leonardo C/G-1290-2012","Oliveira, Leonardo C/0000-0002-1774-0713",University of Maryland Biology Department; Seeds of Change; Lion Tamarins of Brazil Fund; Wildlife Conservation Society; International Foundation for ScienceInternational Foundation for Science; Rufford Small Grants Foundation; Idea Wild; University of Maryland (College of Chemical and Life Sciences Board of Visitors); University of Maryland (Ann G.

Such multispecies interactions can give rise to trait-mediated indirect effects that are likely to be common in nature but which are also inherently difficult to predict. Understanding multispecies interactions is also important in the use of biological control agents to control invasive plants because modern approaches to biocontrol rely on releasing multiple agents for each target weed. Centaurea solstitialis is one of the most problematic invasive weeds in California, USA, and the weevil Eustenopus villosus is its dominant biological control agent. We conducted a field experiment to quantitatively assess the direct effect of the recently approved biocontrol pathogen Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis on plant performance and any indirect effects that might arise by altering the plant's interactions with Eustenopus or its pollinators (principally the nonnative Apis mellifera). We documented both synergy and interference between the two biocontrol agents depending on the life stage of the weevil. Puccinia infection increased the impact of bud-feeding by the adult weevils but reduced the impact of seed-feeding by larval weevils. Neither infection nor Eustenopus attack had an effect on pollinator visitation. The net effect was that attack by both the pathogen and the weevil did not reduce plant fitness relative to plants attacked only by the weevil. Because the consequence to the plant of interacting with one species may depend on the presence or absence of other interacting species, a careful consideration of multispecies interactions may be necessary for the selection of biocontrol agents that act in a complementary manner to reduce plant fitness. Likewise, relatively tractable weed-biocontrol systems allow us to examine multispecies interactions that can be difficult to study experimentally in native systems that are composed of numerous species with well-established populations.","[Swope, Sarah M.; Parker, Ingrid M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Swope, Sarah M.] ARS, USDA, Exot & Invas Weeds Res Unit, Albany, CA 94710 USA","Swope, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",swope@biology.ucsc.edu,"Parker, Ingrid M./ABH-2014-2020","Parker, Ingrid M./0000-0002-4847-1827",USDA's Exotic and Invasive Weeds Research Unit; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0808337],"We thank Marci Beitch and Laurel Warddrip for their diligent work in the field.

Red fox dominates in physical interactions with the smaller arctic fox, but little is known about competition between them on the tundra. On Hershel Island, north Yukon, where these foxes are sympatric, we focused on natal den choice, a critical aspect of habitat selection. We tested the hypothesis that red fox displaces arctic fox from dens in prey-rich habitats. We applied an approach based on model comparisons to analyse a 10-year data set and identify factors important to den selection. Red fox selected dens in habitats that were more prey-rich in spring. When red foxes reproduced, arctic fox selected dens with good springtime access, notably many burrows unblocked by ice and snow. These provided the best refuge early in the reproductive season. In the absence of red foxes, arctic foxes selected dens offering good shelter (i.e. large isolated dens). Proximity to prey-rich habitats was consistently less important than the physical aspects of dens for arctic fox. Our study shows for the first time that red foxes in the tundra select dens associated primarily with prey-rich areas, while sympatric arctic foxes do not. These results fit a model of red fox competitively interfering with arctic fox, the first detailed study of such competition in a true arctic setting.","[Gallant, Daniel; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Biodiversite Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gallant, Daniel; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Reid, Donald G.] Wildlife Conservat Soc Canada, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 5T2, Canada","Gallant, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Biodiversite Nord, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",beru9664@hotmail.com; dominique_berteaux@uqar.ca,"Gallant, Daniel/B-9118-2015; Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016","Gallant, Daniel/0000-0002-3170-0523; Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; International Polar Year program of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada; Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada; ArcticNet; Wildlife Conservation Society Canada; Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP)Natural Resources Canada; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Aurora Research Institute; Canadian Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation; Centre d'Etudes Nordiques (CEN); Northern Scientific Training Program (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada); Universite du Quebec a Rimouski,"We thank G.

Sustainable strategies to manage grasshopper populations through habitat management require knowledge of the forces that regulate grasshopper populations. This experiment was undertaken to determine whether populations of Melanoplus borealis (Fieber), a common pest species in Alaska, are food-limited in Alaska. Cages were set up in a fallow field near Delta Junction, AK, in 3 yr (2007-2009). In 2007 and 2008, fertilizer was added to half the plots to increase primary production, and, in all years, cages within each plot were stocked with 0, 5, 9, or 13 fourth-instar M. borealis ( equivalent to 0, 20, 36, or 52 grasshoppers/m(2)). Grasshoppers in each cage were counted weekly. Near the end of the growing season, surviving female grasshoppers (approximate to 40% of the original number) were collected. Femur length was taken as a measure of adult size, and functional ovarioles were counted as a measure of current fecundity. If the grasshoppers were food limited, we expected to see significant effects of either density or fertilizer on grasshopper survival, size, or fecundity. The fertilizer treatment greatly increased primary production in both years. Neither fertilizer treatment nor grasshopper density had consistent effects on survival, size, or potential fecundity, leading us to conclude that food is seldom limiting to populations in the interior of Alaska at densities <50 m(-2).","[Fielding, Dennis J.] USDA ARS, Subarctic Agr Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Zhang, Mingchu] Univ Alaska, Sch Nat Resources & Agr Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA","Fielding, DJ (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Subarctic Agr Res Unit, POB 757200, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",dennis.felding@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,42,11,11,0,7,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"10001 DEREKWOOD LANE, STE 100, LANHAM, MD 20706-4876 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Habituation has invaluable strengths, particularly in quantity and diversity of data collected, but along with these come substantial weaknesses, i.e., costs both in time and effort, health risks, and potential exposure of subjects to poaching. With new technologies, we are able to extend our studies beyond the limitations of habituation; camera traps are one technology that can be used to study unhabituated primate groups. In this study we used eight camera traps over the course of 2 yr (1542 camera trap days) to capture thousands of still images of West African savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Fal,m, region of southeastern Senegal. Images corroborated behavioral observations from habituated chimpanzees at the Fongoli site, where researchers have observed nocturnal activity and cave use. The cameras also captured interspecies interactions at water sources during the dry season and allowed us to determine demographic composition and minimum community size. The photographs provide data on local fauna, including predators (Panthera pardus pardus, Panthera leo senegalesis, and Crocuta crocuta), potential prey, and competitor species (Papio papio, Cercopithecus aethiops, and Erythrocebus patas). As primate habitat across Africa is further threatened and human-wildlife conflict increases, camera trapping could be used as an essential conservation tool, expanding studies of primates without exacerbating potential threats to the species.","[Boyer-Ontl, Kelly M.; Pruetz, Jill D.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Boyer-Ontl, KM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",kmboyer@iastate.edu,"Ontl, Kelly Boyer/P-5052-2019","Ontl, Kelly Boyer/0000-0001-7441-0289; Pruetz, Jill/0000-0002-9151-8571",Houston Zoo Inc.'s Naturally Wild Conservation Department; United States Fish and Wildlife Service Great Ape Conservation Fund; Margot Marsh Biodiversity Fund; Blank Park Zoo; Department of Anthropology at Iowa State University,"We thank the Republic of Senegal and Department of Eaux et Forets for permission to work in Senegal.

The nest, which originally contained a single Crowned Lapwing egg, eventually contained an additional three Wattled Lapwing eggs, before it was predated. Although parents of both species were observed in the vicinity of the nest, video monitoring showed that the Wattled Lapwings incubated all four eggs. Detection of embryonic heart rate suggested that all the eggs were probably viable up until the nest was destroyed. Nest usurpation in shorebirds is rare, and given the easily accommodated nest requirements and minimal costs of nest construction in these species, is difficult to explain. I speculate that the occurrence described here may represent a case of mistaken identity by the female Wattled Lapwing when choosing a nest scrape, since there seems to have been little benefit to the usurping species of taking over an already occupied nest.","[Horrocks, Nicholas P.

This may drive morphological divergences from their mainland counterparts, presenting gigantism and frequently sexual dimorphism. The aim of this study was to determine morphological divergence (i.e. head and limbs) and sexual dimorphism in the arboreal lizard Urosaurus bicarinatus on San Agustin Island off the Mexican Pacific Coast. We measured several morphological structures of U. bicarinatus on San Agustin Island, as well as on the adjacent mainland in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Additionally, we measured individuals from the state of Michoacan and from a preserved collection with individuals from Michoacan and Guerrero. Our results indicated a divergence and an expansion of the morphological space of the island population compared with the mainland. The divergence was accompanied by dwarfism (reduction of the head and limbs with respect to body size) and a lack of sexual dimorphism in morphology and size. Our study contributes to understanding the effect of insularity on lizards' populations and enriches the knowledge concerning phrynosomatids such as U. bicarinatus.","[Siliceo-Cantero, H.

We tested the effects of food, in the form of leaf litter, and density on population growth and fitness correlates of the tree hole mosquito Aedes triseriatus. Our field experiment used a 2 x 2 randomized block design, with three holes as blocks. In cages within three holes, we manipulated densities of Aedes triseriatus larvae, and presence of leaf litter. Our laboratory experiment used a 2 x 3 factorial design in which we also manipulated densities of larvae and availability of leaf litter within similar cages (inside, outside, or absent). For both experiments we determined effects on survival, days to and mass at eclosion of both sexes, and a composite index of population performance lambda', that estimates finite rate of increase. 2. In the field experiment, we found significant and large effects of leaf litter and of density on the performance of A. triseriatus. The effect of density did not depend on leaf litter availability. We documented significant variation among tree holes for most correlates of fitness. Often, the effects of treatments varied significantly depending on the tree hole tested. 3. In the laboratory experiment we found significant effects of density and litter, and that direct browsing on leaf litter is necessary for the effect of litter on performance of A. triseriatus. In the laboratory, the negative effect of increased density was dependent on leaf litter availability. 4. Our results demonstrate that leaf litter has important effects on population performance of tree hole mosquitoes in natural tree holes, Direct browsing on the surface of leaf litter is the most likely mechanism by which litter enhances population growth. The impact of litter on populations varies among tree holes.","ILLINOIS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,ECOL GRP,NORMAL,IL 61790",,,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",,,,36,92,95,1,27,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The study was carried out in an agricultural area in SW Hungary and was based on scat analysis (jackal n = 373, fox n = 268 samples). The jackal primarily consumed small mammals in all seasons (mean biomass consumed: 72 %). The secondary food sources were wild ungulates (in winter and spring; mainly wild boar Sus scrofa, including piglets) and plants (in summer and autumn; mainly wild fruits). The consumption of cervids in winter and in spring was only detected in low proportions. The fox also primarily consumed small mammals (50.3 % of trophic niche breadth, B), but their consumption dropped in summer and autumn. Two-thirds of the summer and autumn diet consisted of plants, while the bird consumption was higher in spring and summer. The diet compositions of both predators were similar. However, compared with jackal, the fox consumed significantly higher proportions of birds. The standardized trophic niche breadth (BA) of these canids was very narrow (0.09), and the food overlapped in high proportions (69.8 %). The study confirmed the partial partitioning of food resources and opportunistic feeding of both canids.","[Lanszki, Jozsef; Kurys, Anita; Nagyapati, Nikolett] Kaposvar Univ, Carnivore Ecol Res Grp, POB 16, H-7401 Kaposvar, Hungary; [Szabo, Laszlo; Heltai, Miklos] Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Wildlife Conservat, Pater Karoly Str 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Porter, Laura B.] Bangor Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2DG, Gwynedd, Wales","Lanszki, J (corresponding author), Kaposvar Univ, Carnivore Ecol Res Grp, POB 16, H-7401 Kaposvar, Hungary.",lanszkij@gmail.corn,"Lanszki, Jozsef/AAN-1013-2020",,Bolyai ScholarshipHungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian-Serbian bilateral programme [RS-14/09]; Hungarian Ministry of Human Resources [7629-24/2013/TUDPOL],"Thanks to Laszlo Torbo for his assistance during field works and anonymous reviewers for helpful advice and Comments.

For example, migratory water birds are believed to suffer from competition with resident fish populations for shared food resources. While observational evidence in support of this hypothesis is accumulating, replicated experiments addressing this issue at the proper spatial scale are lacking. Here, we report from a replicated whole-system experiment in which we stocked large (0.07 km(2)), shallow (<= 2.5 m deep), highly eutrophic ponds in the bird protection area Ismaninger Speichersee mit Fischteichen'' with different densities of carp and assessed the responses of water birds and their food resources during summer over several years. In all years, the biomasses of benthic macroinvertebrates, macroalgae, and macrophytes as well as the densities of herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous water birds were reduced in carp ponds compared to fishshless ponds. The negative effects of carp on food resources and on the numbers of water birds feeding in carp ponds increased over the season (May-September) and were stronger at high than at low stocking densities of carp. Consequently, differences in resource densities between ponds with and without carp increased, and the ranking of ponds with respect to resource densities became more predictable over the season. These factors may have contributed to a seasonal improvement of the birds' abilities to track resource densities across ponds, as suggested by tight correlations of bird numbers on ponds with resource densities late, but not early, in the season.","Univ Munich, Dept Biol II, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Haas, K (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Dept Biol II, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",karin_haas@web.de,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,58,62,68,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2007,88,11,,,,,2915,2925,,10.1890/06-1981.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,233CL,WOS:000251067900028,18051660,,,,2021-09-23,

AimsTo investigate whether food limitation of House Sparrow population size during the winter varied spatially in relation to agricultural landscape intensification and farm management. MethodsWe experimentally increased the winter food supply for populations on farmsteads in replicated landscapes that differed in agricultural intensification (open plains versus mixed farming) and/or farm management (crop farming versus animal husbandry), and estimated possible differences in effects on winter population change. ResultsWe found no effect of supplementary winter feeding on changes in House Sparrow population sizes over the winter, irrespective of agricultural landscape type or presence of animal husbandry at the farm. However, we found a significantly larger winter population decline in mixed farmland and when farms contained animal husbandry. ConclusionsThe results suggest that House Sparrow populations in south Swedish farmland are not primarily limited by winter food availability. Alternatively, supplemental winter feeding may augment interspecific competition or attracts predators, offsetting any positive effect on population change. However, the stronger population decline in landscapes in which more breeding resources may be available (animal husbandry farms, mixed farmland), suggests stronger intraspecific competition during the winter in line with the resource separation hypothesis.","[Von Post, Maria; Stjernman, Martin; Smith, Henrik G.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Sect, Lund, Sweden; [Smith, Henrik G.] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Lund, Sweden","Von Post, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Sect, Lund, Sweden.",maria_von.post@biol.lu.se,,,"Stiftelsen Oscar och Lilli Lamms minne; FORMAS (the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning)Swedish Research Council Formas; Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet; SYSAV Natur- och Viltvard","We would like to thank all the farmers that were involved in this study and that helped out filling up the stations.

Effects of neighbors on consumer-resource interactions (associational effects) occur in many systems, including plant-herbivore interactions, predator-prey interactions (mimicry), and plant-pollinator interactions. Unfortunately, we know little about how ecologically or evolutionarily important these effects are because we lack appropriate models and data to determine how neighbor effects on individuals contribute to net interactions at population and community levels. Here we supply a general definition of associational effects, review relevant theory, and suggest strategies for future theoretical and empirical work. We find that mathematical models from a variety of fields suggest that individual-level associational effects will influence population and community dynamics when associational effects create local frequency dependence. However, there is little data on how local frequency dependence in associational effects is generated, or on the form or spatial scale of that frequency dependence. Similarly, existing theory lacks consideration of nonlinear and spatially explicit frequency dependence. We outline an experimental approach for producing data that can be related to models to advance our understanding of how associational effects contribute to population and community processes.","[Underwood, Nora; Inouye, Brian D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Hamback, Peter A.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Underwood, N (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",nunderwood@bio.fsu.edu; binouye@bio.fsu.edu; peter.hamback@su.se,"Hamback, Peter A/A-8194-2008","Hamback, Peter A/0000-0001-6362-6199",Fulbright Foundation; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [621-2009-4943]; NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0717221],"We thank Stockholm University and Florida State University for facilitating the discussions that led to this paper.

While efforts to develop therapeutics, vaccines, and novel genetic mosquito-control technologies are underway, many important underlying ecological questions remain that could significantly enhance our understanding and ability to predict and prevent transmission. Here, we review the current knowledge about the transmission ecology of two recent arbovirus invaders, the chikungunya and Zika viruses. We introduce the viruses and mosquito vectors, highlighting viral biology, historical routes of transmission, and viral mechanisms facilitating rapid global invasion. In addition, we review factors contributing to vector global invasiveness and transmission efficiency. We conclude with a discussion of how human-induced biotic and abiotic environmental changes facilitate mosquito-borne virus transmission, emphasizing critical gaps in understanding. These knowledge gaps are tremendous; much of our data on basic mosquito ecology in the field predate 1960, and the mosquitoes themselves, as well as the world they live in, have substantially changed. A concerted investment in understanding the basic ecology of these vectors, which serve as the main drivers of pathogen transmission in both wildlife and human populations, is now more important than ever.","[Shragai, Talya; Harrington, Laura C.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 3138 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Tesla, Blanka; Murdock, Courtney] Univ Georgia, Dept Infect Dis, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Tesla, Blanka; Murdock, Courtney] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Harrington, LC (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 3138 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",lch27@cornell.edu,,,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture multistate Project [NYC-139835/NE-1443]; National Science Foundation (NSF)-EEID RAPIDNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1640780],"This research was funded in part by USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture multistate Project NYC-139835/NE-1443.

The partial syntopy of three viper species (V. ammodytes, V. aspis, and V. berus) is exceptional and has become known only from two neighbouring valleys in the southern Julian Pre-Alps along the Italian-Slovenian border (Valle Mea and Nadiza Valley). This unique situation puts forward questions concerning their co-existence, particularly when considering that natural hybrids are known among all three species. Our principal goals for this article were therefore to evaluate variation and integrity of key dorsal colour pattern and body size among V. berus, V. ammodytes, and V. aspis from Mount Stol, Nadiza Valley in Slovenia. We discuss these variations in the context of potential hybridization, interspecific competition, and local to regional synecological properties including diet, habitat, and climate. Despite the fact that a pre-study specimen showed intermediate colour pattern, suggesting a hybrid between V. ammodytes and V. aspis, no further intermediate specimens (n > 100) were detected based on external features. Comparison of body length and mass shows equal sizes between V. ammodytes and V. aspis, whereas V. berus is approximately 30% smaller. Furthermore, V. berus on Mount Stol is also much smaller and lacks melanism, unlike V. berus from a close population in Italy (< 15 km), where they are larger and melanism is relatively frequent. These local character expressions presumably are the result of environmental constraints at high elevations (> 1200 m asl.), such as a harsh climate of open, non-forested habitat and possibly a regionally different predation pressure and diet composition. At mid-elevation < 1200 m asl., syntopic V. ammodytes and V. aspis may compete for food, yet, the previously evaluated microhabitat differences appear sufficient to maintain species integrity for these two viper populations.","[Mebert, Konrad; Ursenbacher, Sylvain] Univ Basel, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Mebert, Konrad; Luiselli, Luca] IDECC, Via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Luiselli, Luca] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, PMB 5080, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; [Cafuta, Vesna] Herpetolosko Drustvo Soc Herpetol Slovenica, Vecna Pot 111, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Golay, Philippe] Elapsoidea, 21 Chemin Moulin, Bernex Geneva, Switzerland; [Dubey, Sylvain] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bld, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Dubey, Sylvain] Hintermann & Weber SA, Rue Eglise Catholique 9b, CH-1820 Montreux, Switzerland","Mebert, K (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.; Mebert, K (corresponding author), IDECC, Via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy.",konradmebert@gmail.com,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,Joachim de Giacomi Foundation; DGHT-ZH,"Funding was supported through Joachim de Giacomi Foundation, DGHT-ZH, and J-C Eichmann.

We evaluated whether fire injury increased susceptibility of lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta) to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), how it influenced beetle reproductive success, and whether beetle population phase altered this interaction. Eight sites that experienced wildfire and eight unburned sites were examined in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (USA). Half were in areas where D. ponderosae was undergoing outbreaks, and half were in areas with low populations. We examined 2056 trees one year after fire for burn injury and beetle attack. We quantified beetle reproductive success in a random sample of 106 trees, and measured gallery areas of D. ponderosae and competing subcortical herbivores in 79 additional trees. Baited flight traps sampled stand-level populations of Subcortical herbivores and predators. Wildfire predisposed trees to D. ponderosae attack, but nonlinearly, with moderately injured trees being most preferred. This tree-level interaction was influenced by stand-level beetle population size, in that both healthy and fire-injured trees of all classes were attacked where populations were high, but no healthy trees, and only low and moderately injured trees were killed where populations were low. The number of adult brood produced per female was likewise curvilinear, being highest in moderately injured trees. This reflected an apparent trade-off, with high intraspecific competition arising from the large number of beetles needed to overcome defenses in healthy trees, vs. high interspecific competition and low substrate quality in more injured trees. These results suggest that fire-injured trees can provide a reservoir for D. ponderosae during periods when populations are too low to overcome defenses of healthy trees, and might otherwise face localized extinction. However, the likelihood of populations increasing from endemic to outbreak levels in response to increased susceptibility is offset by the opposing constraints of lower substrate quality and higher competitor load in severely injured hosts, and the relative scarcity of moderately injured trees. Wildfire may confer some reproductive increases to populations already outbreaking. We present a conceptual model of how these disturbances and inherent feedbacks interact to affect beetle population dynamics.","[Powell, Erinn N.; Raffa, Kenneth F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Powell, Erinn N.; Townsend, Philip A.; Raffa, Kenneth F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Raffa, KF (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",raffa@entomology.wisc.edu,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0816541]; McIntire Stennis [WIS0469]; Joint Fire Sciences Program [06-2-1-20]; University of Wisconsin College of Agricultural and Life Sciences,"We thank the National Science Foundation DEB-0816541, McIntire Stennis WIS0469, Joint Fire Sciences Program 06-2-1-20, and University of Wisconsin College of Agricultural and Life Sciences for support.

To determine the effects of potential competitive and behavioral interactions between native predators and invasive lionfish, we experimentally altered the presence of lionfish and red grouper Epinephelus morio in karst solution holes in Florida Bay, USA, and then tracked subsequent changes in the juvenile reef fish and motile macroinvertebrate communities for 6 wk. Relative to solution holes where we excluded both predators, mean juvenile reef fish abundance declined 83.7% in solution holes with a lionfish but increased by 154% in solution holes with a red grouper. There was no difference in juvenile reef fish abundance in solution holes with both lionfish and red grouper compared to holes where we excluded both predators. The composition of lionfish stomach contents shifted from mostly teleost fishes when lionfish were present in solution holes alone, to mostly crustaceans when in the presence of a red grouper. Concurrently, the abundance of 2 species of cleaner shrimp (Ancylomenes pedersoni and Periclimenes yucatanicus) decreased by 14.7% when lionfish were present but increased by 56.2% at holes where lionfish were excluded. We suggest that these results are due to altered lionfish predatory behavior in the presence of red grouper and highlight the importance of maintaining intact native predator communities for ameliorating the negative effects of the lionfish invasion.","[Ellis, Robert D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Faletti, Meaghan E.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Div Marine Fisheries Management, 2950 Execut Ctr Circle East, Tallahassee, FL 32301 USA; [Ellis, Robert D.] Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",robert.ellis@myfwc.com,,"Ellis, Robert/0000-0001-7178-8980",PADI Foundation; Florida Sea Grant; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute (GCFI),"This project was conducted with permissions from the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (permit #FKNMS-2012-078), the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (SAL #11-1330-SR), and the FSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC Protocol #1106).

Five types of sleeping sites were distinguished: 1) Jessenia bataua palms; 2) tree hollows; 3) dense tangles of vegetation; 4) crotches; 5) open horizontal branches. Both tamarin species used Jessenia-palms most frequently. Tree hollows ranked second in the saddle-back tamarins, but were never used by moustached tamarins. Sleeping sites of moustached tamarins were located significantly higher than those of saddle-back tamarins. Jessenia-palms used by moustached tamarins were significantly higher than palms from a random transect sample, but this was not the case for Jessenia-palms used by saddle-back tamarins. For both species, concealment seems to be more important than height above ground. The maximum number of subsequent nights spent in the same sleeping site was two in moustached tamarins and six in saddle-back tamarins. The two tamarin species did not compete for sleeping sites. While the general pattern of sleeping site selection conforms to hypotheses predicting safety from predators as a major factor, differences between the two tamarin species reflect general niche differences between them. Most sleeping sites are located in exclusively used parts of the home range. Moustached tamarins generally use sleeping sites that are close to the last feeding site of the afternoon. The distance between simultaneously used sleeping sites of moustached and saddle-back tamarins are generally close together, which helps to minimize time spent out of interspecific association.",,"HEYMANN, EW (corresponding author), DEUTSCH PRIMATENZENTRUM GMBH,ARBEITSGRP VERHALTENSFORSCH OKOL,KELLNERWEG 4,D-37077 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY.",,"Heymann, Eckhard W./I-2422-2014","Heymann, Eckhard W./0000-0002-4259-8018",,,,50,116,125,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0952-8369,,,J ZOOL,J.

Species occurrence is influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of other species. Current approaches for multispecies occupancy modelling are practically limited to two interacting species and often require the assumption of asymmetric interactions. We propose amultispecies occupancymodel that can accommodate two ormore interacting species. 2. We generalize the single-species occupancy model to two or more interacting species by assuming the latent occupancy state is a multivariate Bernoulli random variable. We propose modelling the probability of each potential latent occupancy state with both a multinomial logit and a multinomial probit model and present details of aGibbs sampler for the latter. 3. As an example, we model co-occurrence probabilities of bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a function of human disturbance variables throughout 6 Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. We found evidence for pairwise interactions among most species, and the probability of some pairs of species occupying the same site varied along environmental gradients; for example, occupancy probabilities of coyote and grey fox were independent at sites with little human disturbance, but these two species were more likely to occur together at sites with high human disturbance. 4. Ecological communities are composed of multiple interacting species. Our proposed method improves our ability to draw inference from such communities by permitting modelling of detection/non-detection data from an arbitrary number of species, without assuming asymmetric interactions. Additionally, our proposed method permits modelling the probability two or more species occur together as a function of environmental variables. These advancements represent an important improvement in our ability to draw community-level inference from multiple interacting species that are subject to imperfect detection.","[Rota, Christopher T.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Rota, Christopher T.; Millspaugh, Joshua J.] Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlidfe Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Ferreira, Marco A.

Some species of scorpions avoid temporal or spatial overlap of their surface activities, which may differ depending on species, age group or gender, and thus reduce intra-and interspecific competition and predation. We examined the surface activity of males, females and juveniles (sex-age class) of the scorpion Brachistosternus ferrugineus (Thorell, 1876) in an area of Arid Chaco, and also its microhabitat preference and behavior by each sex-age class. The month-by-month activity of each sex-age class was different, but all the classes were observed each month. The most frequently used microhabitat was soil (64.8%), while leaf litter and vegetation were used in similar proportions. The behavior most frequently observed was ambush (68.3%), followed by walking and less frequently feeding, doorkeeping and courting. Each sex-age class performed one particular behavior with more frequency than the others. Analyzing combinations of microhabitat, behavior and sex-age class, we found the juveniles were associated with feeding on vegetation, males with walking on leaf litter, while females were related to ambush on soil. No marked temporal distribution between sex-age classes was observed. However, the spatial distribution and frequency of behaviors were highly dependent on developmental stage and sex. These differences may facilitate understanding of the coexistence of different age-sex classes of B. ferrugineus.","[Nime, M. F.; Mattoni, C.

Prey depletion might cause trophic niche widening in generalist species, but not in specialists, which are expected to increase their foraging effort without diet shifts. In sympatric species feeding on similar resources, reduced food availability can increase interspecific competition and cause trophic niche segregation. To understand these processes, we studied the spatio-temporal variability in diet and niche width in 2 sympatric gull species, the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis and Audouin's gull Ichthyaetus audouinii, which have experienced exponential growth in recent decades due to an increase in anthropogenic food subsidies. We sampled feathers from chicks of both species in several colonies along the western Mediterranean from 2009 to 2011 and performed stable isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur on these feathers. Bayesian modelling shows that both species displayed opportunistic behaviour if different types of resources were available, but could also narrow their trophic niche if 1 resource was abundant. We also provide evidence of trophic segregation between the 2 gull species, suggesting the occurrence of interspecific competition for food. Our meta-population approach provides a comprehensive view of the trophic ecology and the competitive interactions of these gull species. We emphasize the usefulness of 3-dimensional isotope analyses to correctly assess spatio-temporal variability in trophic behaviour of predator species, revealing differences that would remain hidden in single population studies or when using only the isotopic ratios of 2 elements.","[Morera-Pujol, Virginia; Ramos, Raul; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob] Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Morera-Pujol, Virginia; Ramos, Raul; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Mendez, Nestor] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Sede Andina, Inst Invest Recursos Nat Agroecol & Desarrollo Ru, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Cerda-Cuellar, Marta] IRTA, CReSA, Campus Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona 08193, Spain","Morera-Pujol, V (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.; Morera-Pujol, V (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",morera.virginia@gmail.com,"Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Cerda, Marta/U-4534-2018; Morera-Pujol, Virginia/AAE-6412-2020; Perez-Mendez, Nestor/AAB-1505-2020; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/C-3942-2008; Ramos, Raul/S-3112-2016","Cerda, Marta/0000-0001-6842-1299; Morera-Pujol, Virginia/0000-0001-6500-5548; Perez-Mendez, Nestor/0000-0001-6264-2920; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/0000-0002-8691-9397; Ramos, Raul/0000-0002-0551-8605","Spanish INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [FAU2008-00012-C02-01]; MINECO [CGL2009-11278/BOS]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness programme [BES-2014-068025]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [JCI-2012-11848]","Legal permissions for the development of the fieldwork were obtained from the Dept. de Medi Ambient i Habitatge de la Generalitat de Catalunya, Conselleria de Medi Ambient i Mobilitat del Govern de les Illes Balears, Conselleria de Medi Ambient de la Generalitat Valenciana, Consejeria de Medio Ambiente de la Junta de Andalucia, Parc Natural del Delta de l'Ebre, Parc Natural del Montgri, les Illes Medes i el Baix Ter, Parc Natural Illes Columbretes and Parc Natural de Sa Dragonera.

Animals are thought to evolve smaller clutches of larger offspring on islands in response to release from predation pressure and interspecific competition, and the resulting increases in population density and intraspecific competition. These forces become more pronounced with diminishing island size, and life histories are thus expected to become slowest on small, isolated islands. We measured clutch sizes in 12 insular populations of Mediodactylus kotschyi, a small gecko from the Cyclades Archipelago, a set of land-bridge islands in the Aegean Sea (Greece). We analyse variation in clutch size in relation to island area, island age, maternal body size, the presence of putative competitors and nesting seabirds (which increase resource abundance in the form of marine subsidies), and richness of predators. Clutch size of M. kotschyi decreases with increasing island area, in departure from classic island syndrome predictions, suggesting the evolution of faster life histories on smaller islands. There are no relationships between clutch size and island age, maternal size, the presence of competitors or predator richness. Instead, larger clutches on small islands could simply reflect the beneficial effect of marine subsidies derived from resident seabird colonies. Indeed, populations of M. kotschyi on islands with nesting seabirds have clutch sizes 30.9 % larger (1.82 vs. 1.39 eggs) than populations on islands without nesting seabirds. Thus, our data suggest that bottom-up effects of marine subsidies may supersede the expression of a simple island syndrome in the Aegean M. kotschyi.","[Slavenko, Alex; Itescu, Yuval; Meiri, Shai] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Foufopoulos, Johannes] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pafilis, Panayiotis] Univ Athens, Sch Biol, Dept Zool & Marine Biol, Panepistimiopolis, Ilissia, Greece","Slavenko, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",slavenko@mail.tau.ac.il,"Slavenko, Alex/ABC-7200-2020; Meiri, Shai/D-2403-2010","Slavenko, Alex/0000-0002-3265-7715; Foufopoulos, Johannes/0000-0002-8341-8271; Meiri, Shai/0000-0003-3839-6330; Pafilis, Panayiotis/0000-0002-1832-4906",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1005/12],"We thank Nir Enav, Gaya Savyon, Stav Brown, Shani Levinkind, Amir Lewin, Maayan Mania and Rachel Schwarz for their invaluable help in the field.

Field surveys and manipulative experiments demonstrated that intraspecific density and sediment organic matter (SOM) content of sediments are among the factors that regulate the proportion of sand dollars that forage as deposit versus suspension feeders. High local density was associated with a lower proportion of deposit feeding animals in both field surveys and under controlled experimental conditions. Conversely, the proportion of deposit feeders was elevated in treatments in which SOM levels were subsidized, regardless of local density. These data fit Levinton's model of resource limitation in relation to deposit-and suspension-feeding communities, and expand the list of biological processes regulated through density dependence. Analyses of carbon stable isotope ratios (delta C-13) of sand dollars and their potential sources of primary production suggest individuals rely primarily on suspended particulate organic carbon (POC) or drift macroalgae. Sediment organic matter was not a substantial source of carbon for most individuals. There was a significant inverse relationship between size and delta C-13 values; smaller individuals depended to a greater extent on macroalgae. There was no consistent relationship between isotopic ratios, feeding mode and density, which may be due to the high mobility of the species, their ability to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions and the dynamic nature of their habitat. Our results suggest that biological interactions influence feeding mode of this species. This is a complementary mechanism to those described previously, in which physical factors such as flow and lift/washout have been shown to regulate sand dollar positioning. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The problem of hybridization has had different effects in different areas. In non-Mediterranean regions pure forms of wildcats became almost extinct, while in Mediterranean regions genetic introgression is a rare phenomenon. The study of the potential factors that prevent the gene flow in areas of lower hybridization may be key to wildcat conservation. We studied the population size and spatial segregation of wildcats and domestic cats in a typical Mediterranean area of ancient sympatry, where no evidence of hybridization had been detected by genetic studies. Camera trapping of wild-living cats and walking surveys of stray cats in villages were used for capture-recapture estimations of abundance and spatial segregation. Results showed (i) a low density of wildcats and no apparent presence of putative hybrids; (ii) a very low abundance of feral cats in spite of the widespread and large population sources of domestic cats inhabiting villages; (iii) strong spatial segregation between wildcats and domestic/feral cats; and (iv) no relationship between the size of the potential population sources and the abundance of feral cats. Hence, domestic cats were limited in their ability to become integrated into the local habitat of wildcats. Ecological barriers (habitat preferences, food limitations, intra-specific and intra-guild competition, predation) may explain the severe divergences of hybridization impact observed at a biogeographic level. This has a direct effect on key conservation strategies for wildcats (i.e., control of domestic cats). (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.","[Gil-Sanchez, J.

These measurements are used to quantify elements of 'community matrices', which are coefficients summarizing dynamics. In many cases, experimental manipulations are used to estimate certain interactions that are deemed to be likely to be of most dynamic significance (most 'intense'), while other relationships within the community are estimated by using correlative means. These data are then linked by using statistical methods such as path analysis. The two forms of data are gathered by using very different methods: (1) experiments, usually involving confinement (or exclosure); and (2) quadrat- or transect-based information. A major issue is whether information from these two different sources are 'compatible', especially in relation to whether they have similar scalar responses. Can they be reliably mixed? Here, quadrat- and enclosure-based information are derived for the same model systems to evaluate whether scalar responses are consistent between the two forms of information. Interactions between pairs of three forms of forager are considered. For two of these forms, biases are generally consistent between enclosure and quadrat data indicating that they have similar scalar responses. However, for a third foraging form that has more 'intelligent' foraging and decision-making behaviour, major inconsistencies in deductions and biases arise. These latter results are discussed in terms of the implications for construction of community matrices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two shrub species, Haplopappus ericoides and H. venetus var. sedoides, were found to have shallow root systems that occupied the same soil depths as those of C. edulis. In the presence of C. edulis, the normal rooting profiles of the shrubs were displaced downward, although partial overlap with C. edulis remained. Removal of C. edulis from around individuals of both shrub species resulted in higher predawn xylem pressure potentials in shrubs from the removal treatments as compared to controls, suggesting that the surrounding C. edulis was utilizing water that would otherwise have been available to these shrubs. In H. ericoides, predawn xylem pressure potentials of removal treatment shrubs remained higher than those of the controls throughout the remainder of the dry season even though these shrubs showed a marked increase in canopy area after removal of surrounding C. edulis. Removal of C. edulis from around H. venetus also initially led to higher predawn xylem pressure potentials in the removal shrubs as compared to the controls and increased production of new leaves. After this initial period the predawn xylem pressure potentials of the removal shrubs were not significantly different from those of controls, suggesting that the demand for water by the increased leaf areas eventually matched the enhanced water availability resulting from C. edulis removal. Also, the morphology of H. venetus shrubs changed to that more typical of unaffected individuals. Thus, C. edulis significantly affected not only the water relations of these two shrub species but also their shoot sizes and overall morphologies.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT BIOL SCI,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106",,,,,,,,47,165,170,1,71,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,COLUMBUS,"OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210",0002-9122,,,AM J BOT,Am.

We studied whether the abundance of red wood ants Formica rufa -group is related to the breeding habitat selection, fecundity and offspring quality in the Eurasian treecreeper Certhia familiaris, an old-growth forest passerine. The nest-box occupancy data were gathered over a five-year study period, whereas the breeding performance analyses were based on a two-year data set. The abundance of wood ants, measured within 50 m around the nest-boxes, was not related to nest-box occupancy rate, fecundity or the physiological stress of nestlings. In contrast, the abundance of wood ants was negatively related to the offspring quality and life-history traits, such as lowered body mass, subcutaneous fat reserves, and tarsus length at fledging. Our results suggest that exploitative competition between distantly related taxa may have considerable and adverse influences on nestling quality as measured by body mass, subcutaneous, fat and tarsus length. Red wood ants may decrease the fitness of treecreepers as the lower body condition of nestlings has the potential to impair recruitment into the breeding population and, additionally, impair the future reproductive effort.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Finnish Fprest Res Inst, Kolari Res Stn, FIN-95900 Kolari, Finland","Jantti, A (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",markku.kuitunen@jyu.fi,"Sorvari, Jouni/I-5375-2014","Sorvari, Jouni/0000-0003-2668-7771",,,,38,18,18,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0908-8857,1600-048X,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

For these reasons we tested the usefulness of the Hooded Crow, a bird easy to detect, as a surrogate for wetland bird species richness in Poland. Its primary habitats are situated in flooded river valleys and other wet areas where it is a nest predator of many water birds. What is more important, we found a significant correlation between this raw species density and our target group (r = 0.29, p < 0.001). Therefore, we suspected that on the whole country the Hooded Crow could potentially reflect wetland bird species richness. We analyzed factors affecting the Hooded Crow's density and wetland bird species using data from 776 1 km x 1 km study plots and a set of 22 environmental variables. Next we developed analysis where apart environmental variables we also used density of the Hooded Crow as an additional predictor of wetland bird species. Habitat and climatological predictors were aggregated using Principal Components Analyses, then related to the Fourier estimator of the Hooded Crow's density and the Jackknife estimator of wetland bird species richness by applying General Additive Models. Finally, competing models were assessed according to information theoretic criteria. The best-supported models for both the standardized Hooded Crow's density and wetland bird species richness covered 8 almost the same aggregated predictors. The models on wetland bird species could be further improved by including the standardized Hooded Crow density, showing the potential to use Hooded Crow as surrogate for wetland bird species richness (delta AIC = 10.5). Both groups prefer lowland water areas surrounded by meadows, where rivers are distributed rather evenly, and where precipitation is relatively high. The greatest differences between these groups appear on areas where farmland mechanization is high. Such areas are used by Hooded Crows, but avoided by wetland birds. Besides, unlike wetland species, Hooded Crows definitely avoids the north of Poland which is covered by large dense forests interspersed with rivers. Therefore, the Hooded Crow reflects wetland species richness only in open lowland habitats, dominated by wet meadows, where the landscape is interspersed with rivers and lakes, and hydrological conditions are repeatable from year to year. The Hooded Crow cannot be used as an indicator of wetland birds on a large area of intensively used farmland or in large deciduous forest interspersed with rivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Culex pipiens and Culex restuans were the first mosquito species to colonize ground-container habitats and were the dominant larval species throughout the study period, whereas Ae. albopictus was late to colonize ground habitats and accounted for less than 15% of weekly larval collections once established. Ae. albopictus had a much stronger community presence within treehole ovitraps; however, Ae. albopictus never reached the average larval densities of the expected primary colonizer, Ae. triseriatus. Throughout the study period, the weekly abundances of Ae. triseriatus and Ae. albopictus were positively correlated and there were no significant differences between the abundances of each species. The larval dominance of Ae. triseriatus appears to be enhanced by the presence of Toxorhynchites rutilus septentrionalis, a large predatory mosquito species. When Tx. rut. septentrionalis was present, mature larvae (3rd4th instar) of Ae. albopictus were also present in only 16.7% of collections, whereas mature larvae of Ae. triseriatus were collected concurrently with Tx. rut. septentrionalis in 53.8% of collections.

To infer species-specific preferences, we used logistic regression and AIC model selection to compare nest habitat of White-tailed (n = 43) and Rock Ptarmigan (n = 58). Only descriptive statistics were used for Willow Ptarmigan (n = 8 nests) because of smaller sample sizes. Modeling results indicate elevation, slope, and the ground cover of graminoids and lichens were the main variables separating White-tailed and Rock Ptarmigan breeding habitat. Average estimates for elevation and slope around nest sites of each species followed a pattern of White-tailed Ptarmigan (1,827 m, 30 degrees) > Rock Ptarmigan (1,728 m, 18 degrees) > Willow Ptarmigan (1,512 m, 6 degrees). White-tailed Ptarmigan tended to select drier habitats dominated by lichens, rock and dwarf shrubs, while Rock Ptarmigan were more common in meadows with graminoids and scattered woody shrubs. Willow Ptarmigan nested in areas with dense, woody shrubs. The three species display inter- and intraspecific territoriality, and while species-specific habitat preferences allow co-existence, the niche width of each is likely narrowed by the presence of congeners, particularly for White-tailed and Rock Ptarmigan. Within territories, all three species selected nest sites with more lateral cover than expected at random (24-50%). White-tailed and Rock Ptarmigan did not select specific cover types (vegetation or rock) for nest sites within territories, while most Willow Ptarmigan nests were located in patches of scrub birch (Betula glandulosa).","[Wilson, Scott; Martin, Kathy] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Martin, Kathy] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Delta, BC V4K 3N2, Canada","Wilson, S (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",wilsonwa@interchange.ubc.ca,"Wilson, Scott/AAC-7144-2021; Brainerd, Scott M./A-1172-2010",,Calgary Bird Banding Society; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Northern Scientific Training Program; Upland Birds Society; Isaac Walton Killam,"We thank C.

In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of the invasion mechanisms and ecological impacts of Gracilaria vermiculophylla, a red agarophyte native to Asia Northwest Pacific, which now has become a rapid and successful coastal invader in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. Eco-physiological and chemical studies have revealed that some ecological traits, including survival in dark condition (e.g. the ballast water), tolerance to grazing and extreme salinities and temperatures, insensitive to UVR and light intensity and nutrient levels, adaptation to a wide diversity of habitats, and chemical defense to potential predators, may provide G. vermiculophylla an unmatched advantage during its global invasion. The rapid growth, flexible reproduction through fragmentation, efficient recruitment on hard substratum, seeding success on various vectors, and interaction with local community organisms may also contribute to its rapid increase in abundance and effects on the invaded coastal ecosystems. G. vermiculophylla showed both negative and positive impacts to the marine ecosystems through changing interspecific competition, increasing habitat diversity, altering the community complex, and transforming biogeochemical cycles and estuarine food webs. Future surveys such as marine exotic genomics, transcriptome sequencing and epigenetic variation between native and invasive entities may provide insightful promise on molecular mechanisms of seaweed invasion.","[Hu, Zi-Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zi-Min; Juan, Lopez-Bautista] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Hu, ZM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",huzimin9712@163.com,"Hu, Zi-Min/A-7938-2011","Hu, Zi-Min/0000-0002-1313-1785","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31000103]; US National Science Foundation Assembling the Tree of Life ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1036495, DEB-0937978]","We thank everyone who shared with us observations from both experimental and field surveys.

Mixed effects models indicated that species partitioned use of water features spatially and temporally. Linear models indicated factors influencing relative activity at water features varied by species. For coyotes and bobcats, the water availability model, containing days since last rainfall and nearest-neighbor distance to water was best supported by the data, with relative activity increasing with time between rainfall and distance between waters. For gray foxes, the best approximating model indicated that relative activity was inversely correlated to coyote and bobcat activity indices, and positively correlated to topographical complexity. Encounters between carnivore species were low, with most occurring between coyotes and gray foxes, followed by coyotes and bobcats, and bobcats and gray foxes. These findings suggest a behavioral-environmental mechanism that may function to modulate resource partitioning by carnivores in the arid West.

Population densities of small rodents fluctuate greatly, providing a good study model to evaluate effects of competition on trophic niche. We studied resource use in five arctic small rodent populations of four species combining DNA metabarcoding of stomach contents and stable isotope analysis (SIA). Our results suggest that for small rodents, the most pronounced effect of competition on trophic niche is due to increased use of secondary habitats and to habitat-specific diets, rather than an expansion of trophic niche in primary habitat. DNA metabarcoding and SIA provided complementary information about the composition and temporal variation of herbivore diets. Combing these two approaches requires caution, as the underlying processes causing observed patterns may differ between methodologies due to different spatiotemporal scales.","[Soininen, Eeva M.; Ehrich, Dorothee; Lecomte, Nicolas; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway; [Tarroux, Arnaud; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Tarroux, Arnaud; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Gielly, Ludovic] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, Grenoble, France; [Brochmann, Christian; Gussarova, Galina] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Natl Ctr Biosystemat, Oslo, Norway; [Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Moncton, Canada Res Chair Polar & Boreal Ecol, Dept Biol, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada; [Tarroux, Arnaud] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Tromso, Norway","Soininen, EM (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway.",eeva.soininen@uit.no,"Gussarova, Galina/E-4758-2015; Ehrich, Dorothee/F-6492-2015; Tarroux, Arnaud/AAE-5173-2021; Soininen, Eeva/AAJ-5909-2021; Brochmann, Christian/A-4105-2009; Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Gussarova, Galina/0000-0001-5388-7491; Ehrich, Dorothee/0000-0002-3028-9488; Soininen, Eeva/0000-0003-4280-8350; Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985; Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Lecomte, Nicolas/0000-0002-8473-5375",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; Oskar Huttunen foundation; University of Tromso,"This study was funded by the Research Council of Norway (projects 'Ecosystem Finnmark', 'EcoFinn', 'Arctic Predators', 'BarFrost' and a Leiv Eiriksson mobility grant to EMS); Oskar Huttunen foundation (PhD Scolarship for EMS) and University of Tromso (mobility grant for EMS).

However, interspecific interactions did not differ significantly from the effects of intraspecific competition. Larval growth and survival were negatively correlated with the duration of water in the pond, and both species had similar mortality rates during two years of contrasting environmental extremes. Both species exhibited similar microhabitat usage when alone, When refugia were absent, both species suffered heavy mortality. Shifts in microhabitat use when refugia were present resulted in increased survivorship of larvae. Behaviors resulting in habitat partitioning and the use of refugia by larvae may be important components for the coexistence of A. maculatum and A. jeffersonianum in breeding ponds. These results indicate that A. maculatum is a more behaviorally variable species which is hypothesized to be a factor in the success of this widespread and common species.","KENT STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,KENT,OH 44242",,,,,,,,24,21,22,0,8,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS BUSINESS OFFICE,CARBONDALE,"SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT ZOOLOGY, CARBONDALE, IL 62901-6501",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,MAY 16,1996,,2,,,,,372,378,,10.2307/1446853,,,7,Zoology,Zoology,UM949,WOS:A1996UM94900012,,,,,2021-09-23,

Animals were monitored for > 7 days to examine spatial and temporal variation in their behaviour as the tides transited from a semi-diurnal to an almost diurnal pattern. Movement was synchronised with the tides, irrespective of the day-night cycles. Limpets rested low on the shore and were stimulated to move by the rising tide. Individuals moved up shore with the flooding tide, maintaining themselves in the awash zone, and then down shore on the ebbing tide, until they reached a resting height when the tide then fell beneath them, exhibiting 'zonal shuttling'. A tight coupling of limpet position to tide height persisted through the changing tidal pattern, and almost all animals displayed the same organisation of activity over all tides. Initiation of activity and maximum height reached were probably controlled by the tides, but the cessation of activity may have been controlled by an internal clock. The pattern observed is consistent with the threat of attack from aquatic predators coupled with the need to minimise physical stresses while exposed. It is also consistent with the avoidance of grazing lower on the shore where interspecific competition may be more intense. Limpets showed two peaks of activity per tide, corresponding to when the rate of change of tide height was the greatest, except when tides became much reduced during the transit to a diurnal pattern. Movement was triphasic: an initial rapid phase, followed by a slower phase in the high shore and then a rapid phase before the limpets stopped moving. This structure is common in limpets and in this case is likely to be a consequence of animals maintaining themselves within the awash zone. Tide height appears to determine foraging activity, but with modifications in the behaviour in response to factors operating at more local temporal and spatial scales.","Univ Sunderland, Sch Hlth Nat & Social Sci, Sunderland SR1 3SD, Durham, England; Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ecol & Biodivers, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Davies, MS (corresponding author), Univ Sunderland, Sch Hlth Nat & Social Sci, Sunderland SR1 3SD, Durham, England.",mark.davies@sunderland.ac.uk,"Williams, Gray/D-3139-2009",,,,,62,25,26,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

These enclosures allowed each species to experience environmental conditions within each lake without directly interacting with each other. In the four-species lake, two other sets of enclosures addressed the effects of intra- and interspecific competition. Changes in total biomass of enclosure stocks (from growth and mortality) indicated that in the absence of other species, perch did best in the lake containing the richest fish assemblage, intermediate in the two-species lake, and worst in the mudminnow-only lake. Mudminnow stocks similarly performed significantly better in the four-species lake than the mudminnow-only lake. These results suggest that the lakes' environmental conditions contribute to the patterns of presence and abundance of perch, but that interspecific interactions override a similar contribution for the mudminnow, which is regarded as a fugitive species. Perch performances were also sensitive to fish densities within enclosures, declining significantly when stocks were doubled, either by adding more perch or equal numbers of mudminnows.",,"PASZKOWSKI, CA (corresponding author), UNIV ALBERTA,DEPT ZOOL,EDMONTON T6G 2E9,ALBERTA,CANADA.",,"Tonn, William M/A-3765-2014","Tonn, William M/0000-0002-0509-3184",,,,19,1,1,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Associational effects (AE) can transpire through changes in herbivore or plant traits that affect herbivore movement, densities, and feeding behaviors to ultimately affect plant damage. While much work has focused on understanding the mechanisms that underlie associational effects, we know little about how these mechanisms are influenced by neighborhood composition, i.e., plant density or relative frequency which is necessary to make predictions about when AE should occur in nature. Using a series of field and greenhouse experiments, I examined how plant density and relative frequency affected plant damage to Solanum carolinense and four mechanisms that underlie AE; (i) accumulation of insect herbivores and arthropod predators, (ii) microclimate conditions, (iii) plant resistance, and (iv) specialist herbivore preference. I found a positive relationship between S. carolinense damage and the relative frequency of a non-focal neighbor (Solidago altissima) and all four AE mechanisms were influenced by one or multiple neighborhood components. Frequency-dependence in S. carolinense damage is most likely due to greater generalist herbivore load on S. carolinense (through spillover from S. altissima) with microclimate variables, herbivore preference, predation pressures, and plant resistance having relatively weaker effects. Associational effects may have long-term consequences for these two plant species during plant succession and understanding context-dependent herbivory has insect pest management implication for other plant species in agriculture and forestry.","[Kim, Tania N.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Kim, Tania N.] Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kim, TN (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Kim, TN (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",tania.kim@wisc.edu,,,National Science Foundation Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1110460],"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology #1110460.

In 2014, recruitment of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides was measured at high elevations in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the NW Atlantic coast in Nova Scotia, Canada. Values were considerably lower than previously reported for middle elevations in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the NE Atlantic and NE Pacific coasts. To determine if such differences in recruitment may have resulted from elevation influences, I did a field experiment in 2019 in wave-exposed intertidal habitats in Nova Scotia to test the hypothesis that recruitment is higher at middle than at high elevations, based on known environmental differences between both elevation zones. Based on data from 3 locations spanning 158 km of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, barnacle recruitment was, on average, nearly 200% higher (and recruits were larger) at middle than at high elevations. However, even with this increase, barnacle recruitment on this NW Atlantic coast is still lower than for comparable habitats on the NE Atlantic and NE Pacific coasts, and also lower than previously reported for wave-exposed locations farther south on the NW Atlantic coast, in Maine, USA. Therefore, barnacle recruitment in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia is moderate relative to other shores. This difference in the supply of barnacle recruits might influence the intensity of interspecific interactions involving barnacles.","[Scrosati, Ricardo A.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada","Scrosati, RA (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",rscrosat@stfx.ca,"Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"I am grateful to Matthew J.

Dispersal evolution is driven by a trade-off between costs and benefits, which is influenced by interindividual variability and local environmental conditions (context-dependent dispersal). Many studies have investigated how dispersal decisions may be influenced by environmental factors, including density, predation and interspecific competition. Yet few have attempted to examine how habitat disturbance may affect the dispersal process in spatially structured populations. In early successional species, one might expect individuals to adjust their dispersal decisions based on two main factors that potentially have an influence on reproductive success: patch size and the level of patch disturbance. In this study, we examined how these two factors affect breeding success and dispersal decisions in an early successional amphibian, the yellow-bellied toad, Bombina variegata. To this end, we used capture-recapture data collected on a spatially structured population occupying 28 breeding patches. We took advantage of recent developments in multievent capture-recapture models to detect signs of context-dependent dispersal. The results revealed that the probability of successful reproduction and the number of newly metamorphosed individuals increased with both the size and the proportion of disturbance of a patch. In addition, our results showed that the factors affecting breeding success also influenced breeding dispersal probability. Large patch size negatively influenced emigration probability; in contrast, it positively influenced immigration probability. Equally, higher disturbance had a strong negative influence on emigration probability and slightly positively affected immigration probability. These findings strongly suggest that individuals make context-dependent dispersal decisions, adjusted to maximize future fitness prospects in a patch, allowing them to better cope with rapid changes in environmental conditions resulting from the ecological succession process. This opens new areas of potential research into the role of dispersal in organism specialization along an ecological succession gradient. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The stress gradient hypothesis predicts that positive interactions expand realized niches in stressful habitats. We tested the predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis in a cobble beach model system across both physical and biological stress gradients. We transplanted seven common littoral species within, adjacent to, and below Spartina alterniflora cordgrass stands in control, cage control, predator exclusion cage, shade, and shaded predator exclusion cage treatments to test the hypothesis that cordgrass expands intertidal organism habitats. On cobble beaches, cordgrass ameliorates physical and predation stresses, expanding the distribution and realized niches of species to habitats in which they cannot live without facilitation, suggesting that niche theory and species distribution models should be amended to accommodate the role of positive interactions in community assembly.","[Crotty, Sinead M.; Bertness, Mark D.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Crotty, SM (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",sinead_crotty@brown.edu,,,Robert P.

Herbivores followed a humped pattern (n = 46), suggesting constrained foraging in which they balance the benefits of proximity to water with the costs of foraging where food is depleted near water and travelling to more abundant food distant from water; an exponentially decreasing pattern (n = 11), indicating strong attraction to water or vegetation near water; or a uniform (n = 3) pattern. The details rather than the types of these patterns varied between years. Herbivores concentrated farther from water and more tightly around locations of their peak densities in the ranches than the reserve. Herbivores were more abundant and widely distributed from water in the wet than the dry year, and segregated along the distance-to-water gradient, presumably to minimize interspecific competition for food. Pastoralism compressed herbivore distributions and partially excluded some species (warthog, hartebeest, topi, wildebeest, zebra, eland, buffalo and elephant) from, while attracting others (Grant's and Thomson's gazelles, impala, giraffe) to the ranches, relative to the reserve. Regulating cultivation, fencing, settlements and livestock stocking levels in the ranches would allow continued wildlife access to water, reduce competition with, displacement or harassment of wildlife by people, livestock and dogs near water.","[Ogutu, Joseph O.; Reid, Robin S.; Kruska, Russell L.; Worden, Jeffrey S.; Nyabenge, Meshack] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Ogutu, Joseph O.; Piepho, Hans-Peter] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Reid, Robin S.; Hobbs, Nicholas T.; Worden, Jeffrey S.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Rainy, Michael E.] Explore Mara Ltd, Nairobi 00200, Kenya","Ogutu, JO (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Fruwirthstr 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",jogutu2007@gmail.com; Robin.Reid@colostate.edu; piepho@uni-hohenheim.de; Tom.hobbs@colostate.edu; mikerainy@gmail.com; r.kruska@cgiar.org; jeffrey.worden@gmail.com; m.nyabenge@cgiar.org,"Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016","Piepho, Hans-Peter/0000-0001-7813-2992; Ogutu, Joseph O/0000-0002-7379-0387","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0342820]; Belgian Government [DGIC BEL011]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Research Fellowship at the Institute of Crop Science, Bioinformatics Unit, University of Hohenheim, GermanyAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","The data were collected by 22 vehicle- and 3 aircraft-counting teams, 20 organisations and 84 individuals in 1999 and 2002 (see http://www.masaimaracount.org for details).

In threatened species, such studies are essential for establishing effective conservation measures across the range. We analysed factors potentially influencing breeding in a declining peripheral population of a long-lived bird, the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra). We assessed reproductive success and the effects of infra- and interspecific competition, as well as predation by recording events at nests by remote cameras (camera traps and a webcam). Productivity of storks was low (1.1 fledglings per occupied nest) compared to the other parts of the range and resulted mainly from the lower proportion of successful nests (37% of occupied nests). The main reason for low breeding success was the occupancy ofmany nests (35%) by single non-reproductive birds. Breeders were often visited by non-local conspecifics, which harassed local birds but only seldomly caused direct damage. Impact of predators and interspecific nest-competitors on reproductive success was low. We suggest that many individuals have disappeared from the breeding population and shortage of mates is currently the most important factor lowering reproductive success of the Black Stork at its northern range margin. This mechanism could also limit the peripheral abundance and distribution in other long-lived birds.","[Konovalov, Annika; Vali, Ulo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Nellis, Rein; Nellis, Renno; Nurmla, Am; Sellis, Urmas; Vali, Ulo] Eagle Club, EE-63406 Valgjarve Vald, Polvamaa, Estonia; [Nellis, Rein] Estonian Environm Agcy, Mustamae Tee 33, EE-10616 Tallinn, Estonia","Vali, U (corresponding author), Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.; Vali, U (corresponding author), Eagle Club, EE-63406 Valgjarve Vald, Polvamaa, Estonia.",ulo.vali@emu.ee,"Vali, Ulo/G-8253-2017","Vali, Ulo/0000-0002-2247-0658","Estonian Environmental Board [IUT21-1]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia","Many people helped to set up and maintain cameras; even more people were following the web-camera online and participated in data gathering in a special web-based forum.

These differences give rise to different shell forms in different habitats. In those species which have non-planktotrophic development, differences in shell form among shores have been usually explained in terms of natural selection because exposure to waves supposedly favours light shells with large apertures, while predation by crabs on sheltered shores favours elongated, thick shells with smaller apertures. Differences in shell shape among species found at different heights on the shore have been explained in terms of resistance to desiccation and temperature. Such variables would tend to act on a relatively broad-scale, i.e. causing differences among heights on a shore or among shores. Rates of growth, which might vary at much smaller scales within a shore, have also been shown to affect the shapes of many shells. In this study, the shape and relative weight of shells of three species of co-existing littorinids (Littorina unifasciata, Bembicium nanum and Nodilittorina pyramidalis) were measured. These species all have planktotrophic development and they are found on many shores where there is no evidence that they are preyed upon by crabs. Before explanations of shell shape are proposed, it is necessary that patterns of variation, within different parts of a shore and among different shores are clearly documented. These patterns were measured at a number of different spatial scales within and among replicate shores with different amounts of wave exposure. Large and small specimens were included to allow intraspecific comparisons among snails of different sizes found at different heights on the shore. The results showed significant differences among shores in shape and relative weight of shells, but these differences could not be explained by exposure to waves. In addition, snails of different sizes and different species did not show the same patterns although they were collected from the same sites. Importantly, the shell shape of Littorina unifasciata varied significantly among sites at approximately the same height within a shore. These differences could not be clearly correlated with density, mean size nor exposure to waves. The only consistent pattern was a decrease in relative aperture size in specimens living higher on the shore. Models that have commonly been proposed to explain shape and relative weight of shells in other species of gastropods are not adequate to explain the small- and large-scale variation of the measurements described here. It is proposed that any selective advantage of shell morphology and the effects of any variables on the development of shell morphology in these species can only be identified after appropriately designed and replicated field experiments.",,"CHAPMAN, MG (corresponding author), UNIV SYDNEY,INST MARINE ECOL,MARINE ECOL LABS A11,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA.",,"Chapman, Maura/B-2287-2008",,,,,70,35,35,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0260-1230,,,J MOLLUS STUD,J.

I have reviewed the recent primary literature in order to assess quantitatively the frequency of studies of mutualism, the types of questions they address, and their general scientific approach. All articles appearing from 1986 to 1990 in nine major journals that publish ecological and evolutionary research were examined. It is clear that mutualism research is not in fact rare. Studies of interspecific interactions made up about 22% of the over 4500 articles published during this period; of these, about one-quarter investigated some form of mutualism. Over 90% of them investigated plant-animal interactions, primarily pollination (52 %) and seed dispersal (31 %), a bias probably related in part to the particular journals examined. The diversity of questions addressed in these articles was surprisingly low. The majority (63 %) focused simply on identifying the mutualists of some species of interest. Furthermore, almost all studies were unilateral, that is, they focused on only one of the interacting species, plants being studied much more frequently than their animal partners. Mutualism studies do not appear to have focused on mutualism as a form of interaction in the same way as studies of competition and predation. Rather, researchers have treated mutualism primarily as a life history attribute of one of the two partners. Consequently, although an impressive amount of information has accumulated about these interactions, we are still far from achieving an overall picture that transcends the boundaries of particular taxa or combinations of taxa. Three other obstacles have prevented data on mutualisms from being brought together: the historical isolation of studies of different kinds of mutualism, a nearly total disconnection between mutualism theories and empirical studies, and the unilateral approach almost always used to study these bilateral interactions. I identify eight research questions whose answers have the potential to reveal broad-based generalizations about the evolution and ecology of mutualism.",,"BRONSTEIN, JL (corresponding author), UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,,,,171,359,372,6,208,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0033-5770,1539-7718,,Q REV BIOL,Q.

The studied fossil material primarily included brachiopods and bivalves owing to their abundance throughout the section, but other subordinate taxonomic groups including ostracods and microgastropods were also integrated for discussion. Overall, a succession of three benthonic paleocommunities was recognized representing three connected ecological evolutionary stages across the Permian-Triassic transition. Both Stage 1 and Stage 2 paleocommunities predated the end-Permian boundary mass extinction, and were characterized by relatively high diversity of brachiopods and bivalves, with no or very rare other taxa. Approaching the end-Permian mass extinction and the PTB itself, the paleocommunity abruptly changed and was replaced by the Stage 2 paleocommunity that was characterized by a relatively low Shannon's diversity (H) coupled with a high Simpson's dominance index (D) and, most notably, a changeover from Neochonetes to Tethyochonetes (both are brachiopod genera) as the most significant ecological dominants. This Simpson's dominance index (D) shift correlates well with food shortage (i.e. much reduced terrestrial influx and acritarch abundance), and is therefore interpreted to signify, possibly, intensified interspecific competitions with Tethyochonetes seemingly outcompeting Neochonetes presumably due to its preadapted smaller body size. The post-extinction (Stage 3) paleocommunity is distinguished by a highly characteristic low-diversity and high-abundance fauna comprised mainly of lingulid brachiopods, Claraia bivalves, microgastropods and ostracods, suggesting a unique and highly stressful ecological regime. In this paleocommunity, Claraia might have acted like a disaster taxon and, as such, its ecological functional role in the paleocommunity was activated and elevated because of exceptional ecological conditions (e.g., anoxia, hyperthermal and/or severe food shortage). From the studied section, a number of ecological traits including species abundance distribution, Shannon's diversity (H), community dominance and body-size structure were identified as demonstrating significant changes accompanying community replacement prior to the end-Permian mass extinction. The fact that these changes preceded the mass extinction may suggest that these traits could represent some early warning signals for an impending ecological regime shift. This extended interpretation clearly has significant implications for modern ecological studies to predict future impending ecological regime shifts.","[Zhang, Yang] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Shi, G.

Mast seeding is an important resource pulse in deciduous forests; these boom and bust cycles of seed production generate strong lagged population responses by post-dispersal seed predators such as rodents, which then cascade through multiple trophic levels and regulate population dynamics of their predators and prey. However, similar interactions in another major pulsed system, coniferous forests, are inconsistent, and the effects of interannual variation in conifer seed production on many consumer populations are largely unknown. We used large-scale manipulation and intensive monitoring to examine the population dynamics of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in relation to fall seed production by two northern conifers, white spruce (Picea glauca) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Previous studies have shown that spruce seeds are a preferred food source of mice, while fir seeds are generally avoided if other foods are available. Therefore, we expected that there would be a positive relationship between mouse demography and previous spruce seed production, but no effect of fir mast seeding. Supplementation of a mouse population using spruce seeds indicated that increased fall spruce seed availability can enhance overwinter survival and population densities in the following spring, summer, and fall. However, long-term population monitoring indicated that mouse demography was not positively affected by spruce mast seeding, likely due to strong interspecific competition with the North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudoniscus), a dominant pre-dispersal spruce seed predator. Conversely, we observed an unexpected delayed effect of fir mast seeding, where increased fall fir seed production did not influence overwinter or spring mouse demography, but instead enhanced summer survival, body masses and pregnancy rates of overwintered adults. This led to increased summer population densities and may have been mediated by population responses of invertebrate post-dispersal seed predators to increased fir seed availability. Our results indicate that rodent responses to resource pulses in coniferous forests are more complex than in deciduous environments and reveal previously unobserved direct and indirect consumer-resource dynamics that require further examination. This system is ideal for the large-scale, integrative ecosystem studies that ecologists are encouraged to pursue.","[Lobo, Nikhil; Millar, John S.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Lobo, N (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",nlobo3@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We are grateful to the BC Ministry of Forests and Range Tree Seed Centre for donating the white spruce seeds used in this study, the graduate students and research assistants who helped collect data in the field, and L.

We selected a reservoir with a large population of exclusively wintering great cormorants and seasonal changes in stored water volume to test the relative influence of abiotic and biotic factors on otter foraging ecology. DNA metabarcoding of otter spraints revealed a dietary change from autumn to winter. Otters had a diet dominated by the exotic goldfish in autumn, but predated intensively on the native northern straight-mouth nase in winter. This change was likely caused by predation of cormorants on goldfish and to fish biology. Secondly, macroscopic analysis of spraints revealed that otters shifted from a diet dominated by fish (in terms of biomass) to a diet dominated by red swamp crayfish during spring-summer, when the latter became overabundant. As revealed by modelling, this second shift was most likely influenced by the sudden increase in stored water volume in spring, but also by the cumulative effect of cormorant predation on fish during autumn-winter. Macroscopic analyses of otter spraints collected in a second reservoir with no cormorants revealed a lack of seasonality. Hence, the combined influence of both biotic and abiotic factors explained otter diet seasonality in a lentic-water novel ecosystem.","[Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro; Veloy, Carlos; Amboage, Moraima; Guitian-Caamano, Amanda; Vila, Marta] Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Campus Zapateira, La Coruna 15008, Spain; [Mari-Mena, Neus; Vizcaino, Anton; Vierna, Joaquin] AllGenet & Biol SL, Edificio CICA,Campus Elvina, La Coruna 15008, Spain; [Key, Charlie] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales","Vila, M (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Campus Zapateira, La Coruna 15008, Spain.",mvila@udc.es,"Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/G-4522-2016; Vila, Marta/F-6118-2016","Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/0000-0001-8009-4331; Vila, Marta/0000-0002-8803-9174","Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission [GRC2014/050, ED431C 2018/57]; Universidade da Coruna","Fish samples to be used as positive controls for molecular analysis were kindly provided by Carlos Antunes, except for O. mykiss and Atlantic salmon S. salar that were purchased at a local fish market.

We evaluated if males of the South American tree frog (Hypsiboas pulchellus) select calling sites in undisturbed subtropical wetlands based on specific habitat cues. The study was designed to represent a snapshot of the male calling activity under low densities of intra-and interspecific competitors and little variation of climatic conditions. We characterized calling sites by measuring the vegetation attributes and flood levels of calling sites occupied by 59 males and comparing them to available microhabitats. We found that males exhibit some degree of selectivity for calling sites, often selecting microhabitats with greater density of vegetation > 50 cm tall. Calling site selection was not affected by water depth or area flooded. Most individuals vocalized in sites near the ground (<= 25 cm), a pattern that is the contrary to that expected to maximize sound propagation. We suggest that, due to the open habitat of the studied area, the choice of calling sites is more related to the need for shelter from predation and avoidance of desiccation and heat loss than to bioacoustic performance.","[Pio da Silva dos Santos, Nathalia Luiz; de Avila, Fernanda Rodrigues; de Oliveira, Mateus; Tozetti, Alexandro Marques] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Programa Posgrad Biol, Lab Ecol Vertebrados Terr, Ave Unisinos 950, BR-93022970 Sao Leopoldo, SP, Brazil; [Colombo, Patrick] Fdn Zoobot Rio Grande Sul, Museu Ciencias Nat, Secao Zool Vertebrados, Rua Doutor Salvador Franca 1-427, BR-90690000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","dos Santos, NLPD (corresponding author), Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Programa Posgrad Biol, Lab Ecol Vertebrados Terr, Ave Unisinos 950, BR-93022970 Sao Leopoldo, SP, Brazil.",alexandro.tozetti@gmail.com,"Colombo, Patrick/D-2989-2013","Rodrigues de Avila, Fernanda/0000-0002-1572-2722; Colombo, Patrick/0000-0003-3957-3255",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [446910/2014-7]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [2556/10]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do SulFundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS),"We thank many students from Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Laboratorio de Ecologia de Vertebrados Terrestres for their field assistance.

Intraspecific trophic variation, however, might be of key importance in understanding community organization. Here we study the variability of isotopic niche spaces of ground beetles and its consequences for the trophic structure of beetle assembly. Stable isotopes ratios (PC and o'5N) were measured in 1156 specimens of carabids belonging to 59 species inhabiting 20 island and two mainland sites of the Masuria Lakeland in northern Poland. Carabid species belonged to three different trophic guilds (named phytophages, decomposer feeders and generalist predators). However, this division is not sharp due to high intraspecific variability of i3otopic signatures, which indicates the use of very different types of resources by conspecific individuals inhabiting different sites. As a consequence, most species studied did not differ significantly in the isotopic niche space. This high niche overlap corroborates the view that resource competition is not a major factor shaping the composition of ground beetles communities. Future studies should take into account the complex trophic structure of beetle assemblages and explore the intraspecific niche variability of ground beetles.","[Zalewski, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Dudek, Dorota; Godeau, Jean-Francois] Polish Acad Sci, Ctr Ecol Res, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland; [Tiunov, Alexei V.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Ecol & Evolut, RU-119071 Moscow, Russia; [Okuzaki, Yutaka] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600811, Japan; [Ikeda, Hiroshi] Hirosaki Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368561, Japan; [Sienkiewicz, Pawel] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Entomol & Environm Protect, PL-60594 Poznan, Poland; [Ulrich, Werner] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Chair Ecol & Biogeog, PL-87100 Torun, Poland","Zalewski, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",zlewek@yahoo.com,"Okuzaki, Yutaka/P-2239-2018; Tiunov, Alexei V./F-7771-2013; Ikeda, Hiroshi/B-3940-2011","Okuzaki, Yutaka/0000-0002-9362-0078; Tiunov, Alexei V./0000-0003-2400-3559; Ulrich, Werner/0000-0002-8715-6619; Sienkiewicz, Pawel/0000-0003-4714-8873","Polish Science Committee [NN304 372839];  [NN 304 354538]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25891002] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank Ela Zalewska, Tadeusz Plewka, PaweI Koperslci and Ichiro Tayasu for technical help, and Helena Hereman, Magdalena Magdalena Maruszlciewicz, Pawel Le niak and Pawel Zawidzki for advice on isotopic analysis.

Protected areas are critical for conserving large carnivores, but increasing human-wildlife conflict, tourism, and human population growth near these sanctuaries may have negative effects on the carnivores within sanctuary borders. Our goals were to investigate how anthropogenic disturbance along the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, influences the demography and space-use of two large carnivore species that engage in intense interspecific competition. Here we document, in one disturbed region of the Reserve, a rapid increase in the population size of one large predator, the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), but a striking concurrent decline in numbers of another, the African lion (Panthera leo). Anthropogenic disturbances negatively affected lion populations, and decreasing lion numbers appear to have a positive effect on hyena populations, indicated here by an increase in juvenile survivorship. We also saw an increase in the number of livestock consumed by hyenas. Our results suggest human population growth and indirect effects of human activity along Reserve boundaries may be effecting a trophic cascade inside the Reserve itself. These results indicate both top-down and bottom-up processes are causing a shift in the carnivore community, and a major disruption of guild structure, inside the boundaries of one of the most spectacular protected areas in Africa.","[Green, D.

Behavioral consistency has been shown to affect dispersal, foraging, exploration, and antipredator responses, which may have an impact on parental and offspring survival. Despite increasing research in behavioral consistency, the repeatability of nest defense behavior has rarely been assessed in wild bird populations. Furthermore, previous studies investigating nest defense behavior have utilized laboratory studies or mounted predators to elicit defensive behavior. It is important to assess personality in wild populations to fully understand the fitness consequences of behavioral consistency across natural contexts and to utilize live predators or competitors for accurate assessment of defensive behavior. We used an ecologically relevant, live, invasive, nest site competitor, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), to elicit nest defense behavior in a wild population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) to determine if nest defense behavior is repeatable within and between years for males and females (males: 2009, N = 17; 2010, N = 18; both years, N = 9. Females: 2009, N = 22; 2010, N = 15; both years, N = 11). We also determined if individual behavior changes as a function of season, parental age, brood size, or the number of house sparrows around the nest site. We found that females demonstrated repeatable behavior both within and between years. Male nest defense behavior was only repeatable in 1 year and was influenced by season in the other year. Parental age, brood size, and the number of house sparrows around the nest site did not affect nest defense behavior. We conclude that Eastern bluebirds demonstrate consistent nest defense behavior, or personality, although males are more plastic than females.","[Burtka, Jennifer L.; Grindstaff, Jennifer L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Burtka, JL (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, 501 Life Sci West, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jay.burtka@okstate.edu,,,Bob and Julia Bollinger; Oklahoma Ornithological Society; Payne County Audubon Society; Department of Zoology at Oklahoma State University,"We would like to thank our field technicians and volunteers for help with this project, in particular Emily Clark, Erin LaVasque, and Brian Hidden.

All the potentially limiting resources (seasonal time, diel time, habitat and food) are analyzed as single niche dimensions, and then the real multidimensional niche is calculated. Resource states are objectively defined, using an algorithm that groups the significant resource categories. The larvae were segregated by prey, season, habitat, and water depth, in order of decreasing importance; their overlap was very low when their complete multidimensional niche was considered, and therefore they have few opportunities for present-day competition. The adults were largely segregated by season and water depth, and to a lesser degree by habitat and prey; their multidimensional niches overlapped to a certain degree, thus leaving conditions for ongoing competition. Considering all the species and the life stages together, the order of importance for segregation was season, prey, habitat, water depth and diel activity, with a low overlap in the complete niche. Differences in prey size were probably due to morphological constraints; differences in diel activity had very little effect on segregation, except in separating larvae from the adults, and were likely promoted by need to avoid mutual predation and cannibalism. It remains to be tested whether seasonal, habitat, and water depth differences are due to competitive pressures or to ecophysiological constraints.","DIPARTIMENTO BIOL ANIM, PIAZZA BOTTA 9, I-27100 PAVIA, ITALY",,,,"FASOLA, MAURO/0000-0002-7366-5893",,,,34,33,33,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,JAN-MAR,1993,16,1,,,,,73,81,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1993.tb00060.x,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KP391,WOS:A1993KP39100009,,,,,2021-09-23,

For arc-eye hawkfish, the numerically dominant species, recruitment (defined as the contribution of young-of-year to the benthic population within several months after settlement from the water column) varied 7-fold among years averaged over sites. Nonetheless, recruitment also differed spatially, with sites along the Kohala Peninsula comprising a high recruitment group. Spatial differences were persistent (some sites predictably low, others predictably high) and generally lacked demonstrable variation over time. Complementary em pirical data suggested that post-settlement processes (predation, interspecific competition) also affected recruitment. A dispersal model combined with currents from an oceanic circulation model (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, HYCOM) was used to simulate the spatial patterns of settlement by larvae released throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. These simulations generally agreed with observed spatial patterns of recruitment. Greater recruitment was also predicted near geomorphological features (headlands) on Hawaii Island most influenced by the flow of surface eddy currents generated by prevailing E-NE trade winds. Empirical data and simulations together suggest that the headlands of west Hawaii Island likely enhance recruitment by intercepting or concentrating larvae at greater rates, but that post-settlement processes dampen variations in settlement. We suggest that habitat geomorphology should be considered in the criteria used to select sites for no-take Marine Protected Areas at Hawaii Island.","[DeMartini, Edward E.] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Hawaii Res Ctr, Aiea, HI 96701 USA; [Wren, Johanna L.

However, quantifying habitat quality is problematic because it may comprise of abiotic components at different spatial scales and also be influenced by biotic processes. This study investigated the relationship between reef-associated Caribbean fishes and habitat quality at 2 spatial scales: (1) multiple characteristics of Montastraea annularis coral colonies (<1 m(2)) and (2) coral density in a 5 x 5 m plot around each microhabitat. Furthermore, the influence on habitat quality of 2 biotic factors (predation pressure and interactions between competitively superior territorial damselfishes and other species) was considered. A total of 102 M. annularis colonies within thirty 25 m(2) plots were surveyed on a Belizean forereef. Generalised linear mixed-effect models demonstrated that both damselfishes and other reef associated species were correlated with colony-scale habitat quality (more abundant on taller, refuge-rich colonies). Adult reef-associated species were also correlated with larger-scale habitat quality, being more abundant on colonies with high densities of other Montastraea colonies within 25 m(2) (probably higher quality home ranges). However, the presence of damselfishes was associated with reduced abundances of other reef-associated species on M. annularis colonies, reflecting the importance of both biotic and abiotic controls of habitat quality. On reefs, coral mortality will reduce the density of optimal colonies and potentially increase the proportion occupied by damselfishes. This may lead to smaller populations of inferior competitors as they are increasingly displaced onto sub-optimal microhabitats.","[Harborne, Alastair R.; Kennedy, Emma V.] Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Harborne, Alastair R.; Mumby, Peter J.; Ferrari, Renata] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Harborne, AR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Lab, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",a.r.harborne@ex.ac.uk,"Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010; Harborne, Alastair R/F-6155-2013; Ferrari, Renata/E-3109-2016; Kennedy, Emma V/M-3193-2014","Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053; Harborne, Alastair R/0000-0002-6818-8615; Ferrari, Renata/0000-0002-5056-1178; Kennedy, Emma V/0000-0003-1821-9740",Global Environment Facility; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/F015704/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G017344/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"This study was funded by the Global Environment Facility's Coral Reef Targeted Research, awarded to P.J.M.

Given the sexual function of such traits, studies generally focus on individual interactions (i.e., displays and contests) in explaining trait origin and persistence. We show that ecological factors can strongly influence the adaptive value of these traits, and changes to these factors can lead to rapid evolutionary change. We compared sexually selected traits in the small Indian mongoose (Urva auropunctata) between their sparsely populated native range and four tropical islands to which they were introduced within the last 150 years and where, due to a lack of interspecific competition and predation, they have become invasive and densely populated. Because of a likely increase in encounter rate, we predicted that selection on long-distance chemical advertisement by males would relax in the introduced range. Accordingly, male, but not female, anal pads (used in scent marking) decreased in size in relation to both time since introduction and population density, and their relationship to body size and condition weakened. Concurrently, as predicted by intensified sperm competition, testis size increased following introduction. The small Indian mongoose thus experienced an inversion in the relative contributions to fitness of two sexual traits, followed by their rapid evolution in line with ecological changes.","[Owen, M.

The size and demography of swamp antechinus (Antechinus minimus) populations located in a coastal mainland habitat and on a small offshore island in south-eastern Australia were investigated. Large demographic differences occurred between the two ecosystems, with the island population density often 100 times greater than that on the mainland. The swamp antechinus in the mainland habitat was influenced by extrinsic climatic forces, with juvenile recruitment, individual body mass and overall population size being affected by rainfall, a factor likely to influence food availability for the species. However, the island population did not appear to be affected by drought to the same degree where allochthonous marine nutrient inputs may have offset any drought-induced reduction in primary production. Significantly greater juvenile recruitment in the island habitats combined with restricted emigration and potentially reduced predation and interspecific competition are likely to be responsible for the high population densities on the island. Although island populations appear robust, future conservation efforts should focus on mainland populations given the genetic deficiencies in the island populations.","[Sale, Michael G.; Arnould, John P.

The aim of this study was to examine catfish movement and habitat selection within an invaded impoundment in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Acoustic telemetry data for 10 tagged catfish were analyzed to identify spatial patterns in home ranges and seasonal changes in habitat associations. Long-distance movements were observed for most catfish from common central release point, whereas short-distance movements defined their home ranges and utilization distributions that were categorized as localized within single or multiple habitats. Habitat selection was non-random with most catfish utilizing the shallow river mouth and upper section of the reservoir that were dominated by a rocky substratum interspersed with submerged trees. These localities were likely to be preferred for spawning and/or feeding. Utilization of these habitats by catfish is likely to be associated with probable impact due to predation and interference competition for feeding and breeding grounds with other species. Although most catfish maintained their home ranges throughout the study, seasonal shifts in habitat use, which was reflected by the utilization of deep and silt-dominated habitats, were also observed for some catfish. Non-random habitat use and homing behaviour within single and multiple habitats by non-native sharptooth catfish suggests that its impact within the invaded habitats may be associated with particular habitats both at broad spatial and temporal scales. Protection of habitats from catfish invasion should be considered as a management option to conserve native biota.","[Kadye, W. T.; Booth, A.

We used negative binomial generalized linear mixed models with fixed effects to estimate seasonal population-level resource selection at two spatial resolutions for female brown bears (Ursus arctos) and female American black bears (U. americanus) in southcentral Alaska during May-September 2000. Black bears selected areas occupied by brown bears during spring which may be related to spatially restricted (i.e., restricted to low elevations) but dispersed or patchy availability of food. In contrast, black bears avoided areas occupied by brown bears during summer. Brown bears selected areas near salmon streams during summer, presumably to access spawning salmon. Use of areas with high berry production by black bears during summer appeared in response to avoidance of areas containing brown bears. Berries likely provided black bears a less nutritious, but adequate food source. We suggest that during summer, black bears were displaced by brown bears, which supports distribution theory in that black bears appeared to be partially constrained from areas containing salmon, resulting in their use of areas containing less nutritious forage. Spatial segregation of brown and American black bears apparently occurs when high-quality resources are spatially restricted and alternate resources are available to the subordinate species. This and previous work suggest that individual interactions between species can result in seasonal population-level responses.","[Belant, Jerrold L.] Mississippi State Univ, Carnivore Ecol Lab, Forest & Wildlife Res Ctr, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Griffith, Brad] Univ Alaska, US Geol Survey, Alaska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Zhang, Yingte] Univ Alaska, Dept Math Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Follmann, Erich H.] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Adams, Layne G.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA","Belant, JL (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Carnivore Ecol Lab, Forest & Wildlife Res Ctr, Box 9690, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",jbelant@cfr.msstate.edu,,,"Denali National Park and Preserve; National Park Service Fee Demonstration Program; National Park Service Challenge Cost Share Program; Canon USA, Inc. through the National Park Foundation","This study was a cooperative effort involving several agencies including the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Alaska State Parks, National Park Service, US Geological Survey (Biological Resources Discipline), and University of Alaska Fairbanks.

A few species across bee families have evolved nocturnality, displaying remarkable adaptations to overcome limitations of their daylight-suited apposition eyes. Phase inversion to nocturnality in a minority of bees that co-exist with diurnal bees provides a unique opportunity to study ecological benefits that mediate total temporal niche shifts. While floral traits and sensory modalities associated with the evolution of classical nocturnal pollination syndromes, e.g. by bats and moths, are well-studied, nocturnality in bees represents a poorly understood, recently invaded, extreme niche. To test the competitive release hypothesis, we examine how nocturnality shapes foraging by comparing pollen loads, nest pollen, and flower visitation of sympatric nocturnal and diurnal carpenter bees. We predicted that nocturnal bees primarily use night-blooming flowers, show little/no resource overlap with diurnal species and competitive release favors night-time pollen collection for provisioning. Contrarily, we found substantial resource overlap between nocturnal and diurnal bees. Flower opening times, floral longevity and plant abundance did not define nocturnal flower use. Smaller pollen loads on nocturnal foragers suggest subsistence on resource leftovers largely from diurnal flowers. Greater pollen types/diversity on nocturnal foragers indicate lower floral constancy compared to diurnal congenerics. Reduced activity during new moon compared to full moon suggests constraints to nocturnal foraging. Invasion and sustenance within the nocturnal niche is characterized by: (i) opportunistic foraging on residual resources as indicated by smaller pollen loads, extensive utilization of day-blooming flowers and substantial overlap with diurnal bees, (ii) generalization at two levels-between and within foraging trips as indicated by lower floral constancy, (iii) reduced foraging on darker nights, indicating visual constraints despite sensitive optics. This together with smaller populations and univoltine breeding in nocturnal compared to multivoltine diurnal counterparts suggest that nocturnality imposes substantial fitness costs. In conclusion, the evolution of nocturnality in bees is accompanied by resource generalization instead of specialization. Reduced floral constancy suggests differences in foraging strategies of nocturnal and diurnal bees which merits further investigation. The relative roles of competition, floral rewards and predators should be examined to fully understand the evolution and maintenance of nocturnality in bees.","[Somanathan, Hema; Krishna, Shivani; Jos, Elsa M.] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Sch Biol, IISER TVM Ctr Res & Educ Ecol & Evolut ICREEE, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India; [Krishna, Shivani] Ashoka Univ, Dept Biol, Sonepat, India; [Gowda, Vishwas; Borges, Renee M.] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India; [Kelber, Almut] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden; [Jos, Elsa M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Gowda, Vishwas] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ USA","Somanathan, H (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Sch Biol, IISER TVM Ctr Res & Educ Ecol & Evolut ICREEE, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.",hsomanathan@iisertvm.ac.in,"Kelber, Almut/H-6216-2014","Kelber, Almut/0000-0003-3937-2808",Swedish International Development Agency; Wenner-Gren foundation; IISER Thiruvananthapuram,"We thank Kalu Kurade, Ganpat Lohkare, and Subhash Vangere for field assistance and the Maharashtra Forest Department for permissions.

Invasive crayfish alter invaded habitats causing community and population level impacts due to competition, predation and transmission of diseases. We experimentally evaluated the potential impacts of invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis) on native Piedmont crayfish (Cambarus sp. C) using size-matched pairs. We tested 1) species-specific aggressive behavior with aggression assays, and 2) survival in sympatry with survival analysis. Both invasive crayfish species tended to express higher levels of aggression compared to the native counterpart. However, we failed to detect any statistically significant differences. During survival experiments, the proportional survival of native Cambarus sp. C in sympatry with invasive O. virilis was significantly lower than that of invasive O. virilis. However, we did not find a significant difference in the proportional survival between invasive P. clarkii and native Cambarus sp. C. These experiments demonstrate inconsistent and limited negative impacts of two invasive crayfish species on a native species, when size-matched. Therefore, in order to make novel and effective decisions in managing these invasive species, it is critical to understand species-specific invasion dynamics and size-dependent potential impacts of invasive crayfish on native taxa.","[Hale, Patricia; Wilson, James; Henkanaththegedara, Sujan] Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA; [Loughman, Zachary] West Liberty Univ, Dept Nat Sci & Math, West Liberty, WV USA","Henkanaththegedara, S (corresponding author), Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",Henkanaththegedarasm@longwood.edu,,,Virginia Academy of Science Small Project Research Grant; Longwood University Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences; Longwood University Faculty Research Grant; Longwood University Perspectives on Research In Mathematics & Science (LU-PRISM) Summer Undergraduate Research Program,"We thank Bryan Ditursi and Jackson Wagstaff for helping with preliminary experiments which led to these experiments; Johnny Leder, Eric Salamon, Nicole Sadecky, Zachary Dillard and Samuel Hull for assistance in field sampling, setting up the experiments and crayfish care; Shawn Goodchild, Christoph Chucholl, Kit Magellan and two anonymous reviewers for reviewing an earlier draft of the manuscript; Virginia Academy of Science Small Project Research Grant, the Longwood University Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences, Longwood University Faculty Research Grant and Longwood University Perspectives on Research In Mathematics & Science (LU-PRISM) Summer Undergraduate Research Program for research funding.

Data were collected from January 2013 to January 2015 by positioning camera traps in 200 sample stations. During 3479 trap days, we collected 1048 independent videos of target carnivore species, which revealed a general spatial coexistence among carnivores with some differences in seasonal occurrence of species. The red fox and the European badger showed temporal segregation, as their activity patterns suggested a differential use of night-time in all seasons. Activity patterns of the red fox and the wolf revealed moderate-high overlap and similar density distributions in all seasons except during winter. Coexistence between these species may be allowed by temporal segregation during winter and spatial segregation during spring. Finally, results regarding the European badger and the wolf suggest a moderate temporal segregation with a marked avoidance effect for the European badger induced by the presence of tracks left by wolves. Programmes aimed at carnivore conservation, and management should treat the entire guild, as it has been demonstrated that populations of different carnivores interact with each other in complex ways and that fine-scale mechanisms regulating carnivore assemblage influence different aspects of natural communities.","[Torretta, E.] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Ferrata 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Torretta, E.; Serafini, M.; Puopolo, F.; Schenone, L.] Antola Reg Pk, Via Provvidenza 3, I-16029 Genoa, Italy; [Puopolo, F.; Schenone, L.] Aveto Reg Pk, Via Marre 75, I-16041 Genoa, Italy","Torretta, E (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Ferrata 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.; Torretta, E (corresponding author), Antola Reg Pk, Via Provvidenza 3, I-16029 Genoa, Italy.",torretta.elisa@gmail.com; teos.teos@libero.it; fpuopolo@libero.it; fpuopolo@libero.it,,,Regional Administration of Liguria (ROP/ERDF funds); Regional Administration of Liguria; Aveto Regional Park (RDP funds),"We are very grateful to A.

A trade-off between maintenance of energy balance and digestion efficiency has been recently proposed to affect thermoregulation in these animals. On the other hand, competition for basking sites has been described between Iberian turtles and the introduced red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). T. scripta negatively interferes with basking behavior of native turtles and benefits from a greater capacity to retain body heat, which may likely result in thermoregulatory advantages for the introduced sliders. Consequently, complex effects and alterations in metabolic rates of native turtles might derive from a deficient basking behavior. We compared the basking requirements of the endangered native Spanish terrapin (Mauremys leprosa) and those of the introduced red-eared slider, analyzing the upper set point temperature (LISP) (defined as the body temperature at which basking ceased) of both native and introduced turtles, under feeding and fasting conditions. We found higher values of LISP in the native species, and a reduction of this temperature associated with food deprivation in the two turtle species. This adjustment of thermoregulatory behavior to the nutritional status found in freshwater turtles suggests that ectotherms benefit from metabolic depression as an adaptive mechanism to preserve energy during periods of fasting. However, a reduction in metabolic rates induced by competition with sliders might lead M. leprosa to a prolonged deficiency of their physiological functions, thus incurring increased predation risk and health costs, and ultimately favoring the recession of this native species in Mediterranean habitats.

In particular, despite the importance of aggression in mediating social dominance, few studies have considered how heterospecific aggression might contribute to the maintenance or divergence of different colour morphs. To redress this gap, we carried out a field-based study in a Nicaraguan crater lake to investigate patterns of heterospecific aggression directed by the cichlid fish, Hypsophrys nicaraguensis, towards colour polymorphic cichlids in the genus Amphilophus. We found that H. nicaraguensis was the most frequent territorial neighbour of the colour polymorphic A. sagittae. Furthermore, when manipulating territorial intrusions using models, H. nicaraguensis were more aggressive towards the gold than dark colour morph of the sympatric Amphilophus species, including A. sagittae. Such a pattern of heterospecific aggression should be costly to the gold colour morph, potentially accounting for its lower than expected frequency and, more generally, highlighting the importance of considering heterospecific aggression in the context of morph frequencies and coexistence in the wild.","[Lehtonen, Topi K.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Lehtonen, Topi K.] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Biosci, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland; [Sowersby, Will; Wong, Bob B.

The interest has expanded to include ecologically significant groups and major biomass producers using mesocosm studies, emphasizing species interactions. This paper assesses the effects of UV-B radiation on dissolved organic matter, decomposers, primary and secondary producers, and briefly summarizes recent studies in freshwater and marine systems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) are degradation products of living organisms. These substances are of importance in the cycling of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. UV-B radiation has been found to break down high-molecular-weight substances and make them available to bacterial degradation. In addition, DOC is responsible for short-wavelength absorption in the water column. Especially in coastal areas and freshwater ecosystems, penetration of solar radiation is limited by high concentrations of dissolved and particulate matter. On the other hand, climate warming and acidification result in faster degradation of these substances and thus enhance the penetration of UV radiation into the water column. Several research groups have investigated light penetration into the water column. Past studies on UV penetration into the water column were based on temporally and spatially scattered measurements. The process of spectral attenuation of radiant energy in natural waters is well understood and straightforward to model. Less known is the spatial and temporal variability of in-water optical properties influencing UV attenuation and there are few long-term observations. In Europe, this deficiency of measurements is being corrected by a project involving the development of a monitoring system (ELDONET) for solar radiation using three-channel dosimeters (UV-A, W-B, PAR) that are being installed from Abisko (North Sweden, 68 degrees N, 19 degrees E) to Tenerife (Canary Islands, 27 degrees N, 17 degrees W). Some of the instruments have been installed in the water column (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Kattegat, East and Western Mediterranean, North Atlantic), establishing the first network of underwater dosimeters for continuous monitoring. Bacteria play a vital role in mineralization of organic matter and provide a trophic Link to higher organisms. New techniques have substantially changed our perception of the role of bacteria in aquatic ecosystems over the recent past and bacterioplankton productivity is far greater than previously thought, having high division and turnover rates. It has been shown that bacterioplankton play a central role in the carbon flux in aquatic ecosystems by taking up DOC and remineralizing the carbon. Bacterioplankton are more prone to W-B stress than larger eukaryotic organisms and, based on one study, produce about double the amount of cyclobutane dimers. Recently, the mechanism of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria has been shown to be affected by UV-B stress. Wetlands constitute important ecosystems both in the tropics and at temperate latitudes. In these areas, cyanobacteria form major constituents in microbial mats. The organisms optimize their position in the community by vertical migration in the mat, which is controlled by both visible and W-B radiation. Cyanobacteria are also important in tropical and sub-tropical rice paddy fields, where they contribute significantly to the availability of nitrogen. Solar UV radiation affects growth, development and several physiological responses of these organisms. On a global basis, phytoplankton are the most important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems. The organisms populate the top layers of the oceans and freshwater habitats where they receive sufficient solar radiation for photosynthetic processes. New research strengthens previous evidence that solar UV affects growth and reproduction, photosynthetic energy-harvesting enzymes and other cellular proteins, as well as photosynthetic pigment contents. The uptake of ammonium and nitrate is affected by solar radiation in phytoplankton, as well as in macroalgae. Damage to phytoplankton at the molecular, cellular, population and community levels has been demonstrated. In contrast, at the ecosystem level there are few convincing data with respect to the effects of ozone-related W-B increases and considerable uncertainty remains. Following UV-B irradiation, shifts in phytoplankton community structure have been demonstrated, which may have consequences for the food web. Macroalgae and seagrasses are important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems (but considerably smaller than phytoplankton). In contrast to phytoplankton, most of these organisms are sessile and can thus not avoid exposure to solar radiation at their growth site. Recent investigations showed a pronounced sensitivity to solar W-B radiation, and effects have been found throughout the top 10-15 m of the water column. Photoinhibition can be quantified by oxygen exchange or by PAM (pulse amplitude modulated) fluorescence. Surface-adapted macroalgae, such as several brown and green algae, show a maximum of oxygen production at or close to the surface; whereas algae adapted to lower irradiances usually thrive best when exposed deeper in the water column. Mechanisms of protection and repair are being investigated. UV effects on aquatic animals are of increased interest. Evidence for UV effects has been demonstrated in zooplankton activity. Other UVB-sensitive aquatic organisms include sea urchins, corals and amphibians. Solar UV radiation has been known to affect corals directly. In addition, photosynthesis in their symbiotic algae is impaired, resulting in reduced organic carbon supply. Amphibian populations are in serious decline in many areas of the world, and scientists are seeking explanations for this phenomenon. Most amphibian population declines are probably due to habitat destruction or habitat alteration. Some declines are probably the result of natural population fluctuations. Other explanations for the population declines and reductions in range include disease, pollution, atmospheric changes and introduced competitors and predators. W-B radiation is one agent that may act in conjunction with other stresses to affect amphibian populations adversely. The succession of algal communities is controlled by a complex array of external conditions, stress factors and interspecies influences. Freshwater ecosystems have a high turnover and the success of an individual species is difficult to predict, but the development of general patterns of community structure follows defined routes. There is a strong predictive relationship between DOC concentration and the depth to which UV radiation penetrates in lakes. Since DOC varies widely, freshwater systems display a wide range of sensitivity to UV penetration. In these systems, increased solar UV-B radiation is an additional stress factor that may change species composition and biomass productivity. The Arctic aquatic ecosystem is one of the most productive ecosystems on earth and is a source of fish and crustaceans for human consumption. Both endemic and migratory species breed and reproduce in this ocean in spring and early summer, at a time when recorded increases in W-B radiation are maximal. Productivity in the Arctic ocean has been reported to be higher and more heterogeneous than in the Antarctic ocean. In the Bering Sea, the sea-edge communities contribute about 40-50% of the total productivity. Because of the shallow water and the prominent stratification of the water layer, the phytoplankton are more exposed and affected by solar W-B radiation. In addition, many economically important fish (e.g., herring, pollock, cod and salmon) spawn in shallow waters where they are exposed to increased solar UV-B radiation. Many of the eggs and early larval stages are found at or near the surface. Consequently, reduced productivity of fish and other marine crops is possible but has not been demonstrated. There is increased consensus, covering a wide range of aquatic ecosystems, that environmental W-B, independent of ozone-related increases, is an important ecological stress that influences the growth, survival and distribution of phytoplankton. Polar ecosystems, where ozone-related UV-B increases are the greatest and which are globally significant ecosystems, are of particular concern. However, these ecosystems are characterized by large spatial and temporal variability, which makes it difficult to separate out UV-B-specific effects on single species or whole phytoplankton communities. There is clear evidence for short-term effects. In one study a 4-23% photoinhibition of photosystem II activity was measured under the ozone hole. However, extrapolation of short-term effects to long-term ecological consequences requires various complex effects to be accounted for and quantitative evaluation remains uncertain. (C) 1998 UNEP.

A small frog in eastern Brazil, Phyllodytes luteolus (Wied-Neuwied, 1824), is widely distributed in association with bromeliads. At the end of the last glaciation, parts of the mainland became islands due to rising sea levels, thereby isolating frog populations on these islands. If the island rule holds, we predicted that frogs on islands would tend to be larger than frogs on the mainland. We compared sizes (weight and length) of 30 randomly selected male frogs from the mainland with 30 from an island in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. We also sampled population density on the island and mainland because concurrent with changing sizes, depending on the causal relationship, density may also change. As predicted, island frogs tended to be larger (both in snout-vent length and weight) and were much more abundant. While not specifically addressed in this study, the absence of predators and interspecific competitors may explain both of these trends.","[Mageski, Marcio; Ferreira, Rodrigo B.; Jesus, Paulo R.; da Costa, Larissa C.; Roper, James J.] Univ Vila Velha, Dept Ecol Ecossistemas, BR-29102920 Vila Velha, ES, Brazil; [Ferreira, Paulo D.] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Gemol, BR-29075710 Vitoria, ES, Brazil","Mageski, M (corresponding author), Univ Vila Velha, Dept Ecol Ecossistemas, Rua Comissario Jose Dantas de Melo 21, BR-29102920 Vila Velha, ES, Brazil.",marcioherpetologia@gmail.com,"Roper, James Joseph/H-7986-2012","Roper, James Joseph/0000-0002-2947-5136; Ferreira, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6099-5116; Corteletti, Larissa/0000-0002-2821-2561",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Espirito Santo (FAPES); Universidade Vila Velha (UVV); Ecology Center at Utah State University; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [231020/2013-9],"We are grateful to Shai Meiri, Renato Feio and Rute Carvalho for their comments and great suggestions and Elaine Campinhos, Mariana Mageski, Rebeka Ferreira, Werther Krohling and Weslley Rangel for their help in the field.

The species responded differently to mixed-flocking. A change in feeding sites and/or techniques was found in six species, five of which increased their Feeding rates when foraging in heterospecific flocks. In mixed flocks, they tended to use similar substrates. That such interspecific convergence enhanced feeding rate might be explained by social learning, kleptoparasitism or a beating effect. Benefits gained through these effects were greatest in two species consistently acting as followers, Crested Drongo Dicrurus forficatus and Paradise Flycatcher Tersiphone mutata. Although as leaders, Newtonia Newtonia brunneicauda and Long-billed Greenbul Phyllastrephus madagascariensis often attracted other species, they also increased their Feeding rates through some mutualistic effects. Another leader, Rufous Vanga Shetba, rufa was the only species that neither changed foraging niche nor feeding efficiency in different social situations. Its participation in heterospecific associations probably resulted from other species exploiting the vanga's ability to detect predators. Therefore, the organization of multispecies flocks in Madagascar was mainly based on mutualism and commensalism which increased feeding efficiency.","Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kyoto 612, Japan","Hino, T (corresponding author), Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kyoto 612, Japan.",,,,,,,34,61,69,1,17,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0908-8857,,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

The most widely accepted hypothesis states that at smaller scales (such as patch scale), interspecific interactions are the major drivers structuring communities, whereas at larger regional scales, factors such as climate, topography and soil act as ecological filters that determine assemblage composition. The general aim of this-paper is to compare different exogenous drivers in terms of their relative dominance in structuring desert small mammal communities across a range of spatial scales, from patch to regional, and compare them with previous results on endogenous drivers. Our results show that as spatial scale increases, the explanatory power of exogenous factors also increases, e.g. from 17% at the patch scale (i.e. abundance) to 99% at the regional scale (i.e. diversity). Moreover, environmental drivers vary in type and strength depending on the community estimator across several spatial scales. On the other hand, endogenous drivers such as interspecific interactions are more important at the patch scale, diminishing in importance towards the regional scale. Therefore, the relative importance of exogenous versus endogenous drivers affects small mammal assemblage structure at different spatial scales. Our results fill up a knowledge gap concerning ecological drivers of assemblage structure at intermediate spatial scales for Monte desert small mammals, and highlight the importance of dealing with multi-causal factors in explaining ecological patterns of assemblages.

Alligator Gar Atractosteus spatula are being stocked as age-0 fish in efforts to re-establish extirpated populations. However, gars are known to be highly cannibalistic in hatcheries, suggesting that age-0 Alligator Gar introduced into natural habitats may face predation pressures from other gar species, limiting the likelihood of released fish recruiting to the population. Furthermore, introduced age-0 gar may not have the proper prey resources for rapid growth that would facilitate recruitment to adulthood. Texoma Reservoir, located on the Oklahoma-Texas border, hosts four native gar species, including the Alligator Gar, whose population is supported by supplemental stocking of age-0 fingerlings. We investigated feeding by age-0 gar to obtain a baseline level of trophic ecology for this group of fishes, including the potential for poststocking cannibalism. Food webs were reconstructed via analysis of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes using Bayesian mixing model approaches. Isotopic values for age-0 fish of all four gar species were similar. Invertebrates represented a large fraction of the diet for all gars, followed by Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella. Competitive interactions among Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, White Bass Morone chrysops, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, and young gar may occur for invertebrates, shads Dorosoma spp., and Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis but are likely short-lived due to the rapid growth of age-0 gar after their transition to piscivory. Trophic position of age-0 Alligator Gar, Longnose Gar Lepisosteus osseus, and Spotted Gar Lepisosteus oculatus was positively related to TL, but this relationship was not observed for Shortnose Gar Lepisosteus platostomus. In Texoma Reservoir, the four native gar species, including stocked Alligator Gar, appear to have adequate food resources for recruitment, with little indication of within-family or interspecific predation. This suggests that stocked Alligator Gar quickly acclimated to their new environment.","[Snow, Richard A.; Porta, Michael J.] Oklahoma Fishery Res Lab, Oklahoma Dept Wildlife Conservat, 500 East Constellat, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Stewart, David R.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Biol Sci, 500 Gold Ave Southwest, Albuquerque, NM 87103 USA; [Long, James M.] Oklahoma State Univ, US Geol Survey, Oklahoma Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 007 Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Snow, RA (corresponding author), Oklahoma Fishery Res Lab, Oklahoma Dept Wildlife Conservat, 500 East Constellat, Norman, OK 73072 USA.",richard.snow@odwc.ok.gov,,"Long, James/0000-0002-8658-9949; Stewart, David/0000-0003-3103-5372","U.S. Sportfish Restoration Grants [F-86-D-1, F-50-R-20]; Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (ODWC); Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (U.S. Geological Survey); Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (Wildlife Management Institute); Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cooperating)","We thank those individuals who assisted with field and laboratory work and analysis of forage, including J.

We tested the hypothesis that in Neotropical humid sites, reproductive activity in sympatric species will vary in the time of occurrence so that there is no complete temporal overlap. We also investigated whether the length of the breeding season was associated to relative testes size as a proxy for male-male competition. We inferred reproductive phenology from seasonal variation in the number of sexually active individuals, their gonad developmental stage, and male vocal activity from January 2003 to March 2004. Our data do not support the hypothesis of temporal segregation in reproduction for this assemblage because we found a prolonged reproductive pattern in the five species, but there was decreased breeding intensity in the cooler months (November-February). This deduction is supported by a drop in the weight of the ovaries and the number of vitellogenic follicles, absence of mature females or reduction of their abundance, and disappearance of male vocal activity in the winter. We found differences in relative testes size among species, which were not related to differences in the length of the breeding season, but rather to interspecific differences in sex ratio.","[Bignotte-Giro, Irelis; Fong, Ansel G.] Museo Hist Nat Tomas Romay, Ctr Oriental Ecosistemas & Biodiversidad BIOECO, Santiago De Cuba 90100, Cuba; [Lopez-Iborra, German M.] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol IMEM Ramon Margalef, Apdo Correos 99, Alicante 03080, Spain; [Ramirez-Pinilla, Martha P.] Univ Ind Santander, Lab Biol Reprod Vertebrados, Bucaramanga 68001000, Colombia","Bignotte-Giro, I (corresponding author), Museo Hist Nat Tomas Romay, Ctr Oriental Ecosistemas & Biodiversidad BIOECO, Santiago De Cuba 90100, Cuba.",irelis@bioeco.cu,,,Declining Amphibian Population Task Force; Universidad de Alicante,"We thank R.

We studied summer habitat use, stomach contents and stable isotopic compositions of the generalist feeder Arctic charr coexisting with its common resource competitor brown trout in five subarctic lakes in northern Norway to reveal population-level and individual-level niche plasticity. 3. Charr and trout showed partial niche segregation in all five lakes. Charr used all habitat types and a wide variety of invertebrate prey including zooplankton, whereas trout fed mainly on insects in the littoral zone. Hence, charr showed a higher potential to promote habitat and food-web coupling compared to littoral-dwelling trout. 4. The level of niche segregation between charr and trout and between pelagic-caught and littoral-caught charr depended on the prevailing patterns of interspecific and intraspecific resource competition. The two fish species had partially overlapping trophic niches in one lake where charr numerically dominated the fish community, whereas the most segregated niches occurred in lakes where trout were more abundant. 5. In general, pelagic-caught charr had substantially narrower dietary and isotopic niches and relied less on littoral carbon sources compared to littoral-caught conspecifics that included generalist as well as specialised benthivorous and planktivorous individuals. Despite the partially specialised planktivorous niche and thus reduced potential of pelagic-dwelling charr to promote benthicpelagic coupling, the isotopic compositions of both charr subpopulations suggested a significant reliance on both littoral and pelagic carbon sources in all five study lakes. 6. Our study demonstrates that both interspecific niche segregation between and individual trophic specialisation within generalist fish species can constrain food-web coupling and alter energy mobilisation to top consumers in subarctic lakes. Nevertheless, pelagic and littoral habitats and food-web compartments may still be highly integrated due to the potentially plastic foraging behaviour of top consumers.","[Eloranta, Antti P.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Knudsen, Rune; Amundsen, Per-Arne] Univ Tromso, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway","Eloranta, AP (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",antti.eloranta@jyu.fi,"Eloranta, Antti Pekka/AAA-1426-2020","Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216; Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135",Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Ellen and Artturi Nyyssonen Foundation; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission,"We are grateful to Cesilie Lien, Laina Dalsbo, Emmanuela Daza Secco and other people helping with the field and laboratory work.

Most studies that have examined the effect of season on the diel activity patterns of small mammals have been conducted in temperate climates where daily temperatures and day length are important predictors of activity. Extremely seasonal rainfall in northern Australia possibly exerts a strong influence on mammalian activity due to the influx of food resources. Using camera traps set over a 3-year period, we documented the diel activity patterns of 5 species of small mammals co-occurring on Groote Eylandt, in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. All species were strictly nocturnal but some responded differently to the effect of season. The northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) displayed a bimodal activity pattern that did not differ between the seasons. The northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus) displayed bimodal activity in the wet season and unimodal activity in the dry. The more sustained activity of I. macrourus in the dry season may be the result of this species utilizing more cellulose-rich food in times of lower insect abundance, whereas D. hallucatus possibly exhibits lower dietary plasticity. The northern hopping-mouse (Notomys aquilo) was consistently active throughout the night in both seasons. Conversely, the delicate mouse (Pseudomys delicatulus) showed great plasticity in its nocturnal activity which altered significantly depending on both season and habitat. The disparity in activity pattern between these 2 rodents possibly reflects differences in predation risks. The grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) was recorded only during the dry season in coastal grassland habitat, when its activity peaked sharply after nightfall. Our study highlights the interspecific variation in small mammal activity between the wet and dry seasons in northern Australia, which may be explained by differences in diet, habitat use, and predation risk in these species.","[Diete, Rebecca L.; Lisle, Allan; Leung, Luke K. -P.] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia; [Meek, Paul D.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Invas Plant & Anim Unit, Biosecur NSW, POB 530, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia; [Meek, Paul D.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Vertebrate Pest Res Unit, POB 530, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia; [Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Diete, RL (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia.",r.diete@uq.edu.au,,"Leung, Luke/0000-0002-8829-4925",Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; BHP Billiton,"The authors thank and acknowledge the traditional owners of Groote Eylandt for allowing access to their land for this study.

Initially, we focused on the role of biotic interactions including predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory in small mammal and plant components of the community. We utilized a reductionist approach with replicated 0.56 ha fenced grids that selectively excluded vertebrate predators and/or larger small mammal herbivores such as the degu, Octodon degas. Although we detected small transitory effects of predator exclusions on degu survival and numbers, other species failed to show responses. Similarly, interspecific competition (i.e., degus with other small mammals) had no detectable numerical effects (although some behavioral responses occurred), and degu-exclusions had relatively small effects on various plant components. Modeling approaches indicate that abiotic factors play a determining role in the dynamics of principal small mammal species such as O. degas and the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini). In turn, these are mainly related to aperiodic pulses of higher rainfall (usually during El Nino events) which trigger ephemeral plant growth; a food addition experiment. in 1997-2000 verified the importance of precipitation as a determinant of food availability. Since 2004, we have expanded long-term monitoring efforts to other important community components including birds and insects in order to understand effects of abiotic factors on them; we report some of the first results of comprehensive surveys on the former in this region. Finally, we recently shifted focus to documenting effects of exotic lagomorphs in the park. We installed additional treatments selectively excluding small mammals, lagomorphs, or both, from replicated grids in order to evaluate putative herbivore impacts. In conjunction with increased annual rainfall since 2000, we predict that introduced lagomorphs will have increasing impacts in this region, and that more frequent El Ninos in conjunction with global climatic change may lead to marked changes in community dynamics. The importance of long-term experimental studies is underscored by the fact that only now after 20 years of work are some patterns becoming evident.","[Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile; [Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas, La Serena, Chile; [Meserve, Peter L.; Previtali, M.

Hermit crabs are attracted specifically and in a manner similar to previously reported crab responses to odors from dead gastropods. Responses by C. vittatus to both kinds of odor are of three types: (1) aggregation/shell investigation responses (previously reported for odors from dead gastropods), characterized by increased locomotor activity, investigation of shells in the vicinity, and switching into empty shells; (2) alarm responses, in which crabs flee the area; and (3) withdrawal responses, in which crabs pull into their shells and do not come out. Studies with C. vittatus showed that the stimulatory chemicals originate from hemolymph, are less than 500 D, adsorb to octadecyl silica, and are recovered by elution with 20% methanol. Responses of C. vittatus are dependent upon crab size, type of shell occupied, and shell fit. Chemicals originating from dead conspecifics provide a forum for shell acquisition by crabs in relatively small shells and alarm by crabs in relatively large shells.","DUKE UNIV,MARINE LAB,BEAUFORT,NC 28516","RITTSCHOF, D (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,BEAUFORT,NC 28516, USA.",,,,,,,52,76,77,0,18,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013",0098-0331,,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

Through a pioneer study in North-West Africa based on a camera-trapping survey, we studied ecology features of a carnivores' community in the Middle Atlas Mountains, Morocco. We focused on how species shared (or not) the territory and their activity patterns. Camera trapping detected five carnivorous species: African golden wolf (Canis lupaster), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), genet (Genetta genetta) and African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica). Generalized Linear Models confirmed different habitat selection patterns between these species. The presence of a small protected area or prey availability apparently were not determinant factors in the abundance of these species. Spatial segregation patterns were observed between the red fox with the domestic dog and between the red fox with the genet. Kernel density estimates showed strong temporal segregation of red fox and African golden wolf with regard to domestic dog, and suggested avoidance mechanisms for the triad red fox, genet and African golden wolf. Despite the influence of interspecific competition in the assembly of the community, human pressure was apparently the most relevant factor related with the spatiotemporal segregation in this territory.","[Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria; Mana-Varela, Brais] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain; [Herrera-Sanchez, F.

Consequently, the structure of carnivore guilds can be critical to ecosystem patterns. Body size is a crucial influence on intraguild interactions, because it affects access to prey resources, effectiveness in scramble competition, and vulnerability to intraguild predation. Coyotes (Canis latrans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) occur sympatrically throughout much of North America and overlap in resource use, indicating potential for interspecific interactions. Although much is known about the autecology of the individual species separately, little is known about factors that facilitate coexistence and how interactions within this guild influence distribution, habitat use, and temporal activity of the smaller carnivores. To assess how habitat autecology and interspecific interactions affect the structure of this widespread carnivore guild, we conducted a large-scale, non-invasive carnivore survey using an occupancy modeling framework. We deployed remote cameras during 3-week surveys to detect carnivores at 1,118 camera locations in 357 2.6-km(2) sections (3-4 cameras/section composing a cluster) in the 16 southernmost counties of Illinois (16,058 km(2)) during January-April, 2008-2010. We characterized microhabitat at each camera location and landscape-level habitat features for each camera cluster. In a multistage approach, we used information-theoretic methods to evaluate competing models for detection, species-specific habitat occupancy, multispecies co-occupancy, and multiseason (colonization and extinction) occupancy dynamics. We developed occupancy models for each species to represent hypothesized effects of anthropogenic features, prey availability, landscape complexity, and vegetative land cover. We quantified temporal activity patterns of each carnivore species based on their frequency of appearance in photographs. Further, we assessed whether smaller carnivores shifted their diel activity patterns in response to the presence of potential competitors. Of the 102,711 photographs of endothermic animals, we recorded photographs of bobcats (n=412 photographs), coyotes (n=1,397), gray foxes (n=546), raccoons (n=40,029), red foxes (n=149), and striped skunks (n=2,467). Bobcats were active primarily during crepuscular periods, and their activity was reduced with precipitation and higher temperatures. The probability of detecting bobcats decreased after a bobcat photograph was recorded, suggesting avoidance of remote cameras after the first encounter. Across southern Illinois, bobcat occupancy at the camera-location and camera-cluster scale (local=0.240.04, camera cluster cluster=0.750.06) was negatively influenced by anthropogenic features and infrastructure. Bobcats had high rates of colonization (</mml:mover>=0.86) and low rates of extinction (E</mml:mover>=0.07), suggesting an expanding population, but agricultural land was less likely to be colonized. Nearly all camera clusters were occupied by coyotes (</mml:mover>cluster=0.95 +/- 0.03). At the local scale, coyote occupancy (</mml:mover>local=0.58 +/- 0.03) was higher in hardwood forest stands with open understories than in other areas. Compared to coyotes, gray foxes occupied a smaller portion of the study area (</mml:mover>local=0.13 +/- 0.01, </mml:mover>cluster=0. 29 +/- 0.03) at all scales. At the scale of the camera cluster, gray fox occupancy was highest in fragmented areas with high proportions of forest, and positively related to anthropogenic features within 100% home-range buffers. Red foxes occupied a similar proportion of the study area as gray foxes (</mml:mover>local=0.12 +/- 0.02, </mml:mover>cluster=0.26 +/- 0.04) but were more closely associated with anthropogenic features. Only anthropogenic feature models made up the 90% confidence set at all scales of analysis for red foxes. Extinction probabilities at the scale of the camera cluster were higher for both gray foxes (E</mml:mover>=0.57) and red foxes (E</mml:mover>=0.35) than their colonization rates (gray fox </mml:mover>=0.16, red fox </mml:mover>=0.06), suggesting both species may be declining in southern Illinois. Striped skunks occupied a large portion of the study area (</mml:mover>local=0.47 +/- 0.01, </mml:mover>cluster=0.79 +/- 0.03) and were associated primarily with anthropogenic features. Raccoons were essentially ubiquitous within the study area, being photographed in 99% of camera clusters. We observed little evidence for spatial partitioning based on interspecific interactions, with the exception of the gray fox-coyote pairs, and found that habitat preferences were more important in structuring the carnivore community. Habitat had a stronger influence on the occupancy of foxes than did the presence of bobcats. However, the level of red fox activity was negatively correlated with bobcat activity. Gray fox occupancy and the number of detections within occupied sites were reduced in camera clusters occupied by coyotes but not bobcat occupancy. Overall, gray fox occupancy was highest at camera locations with fewer hardwood and more conifer trees. However, gray foxes were more likely to occupy camera locations in hardwood stands than conifer stands if coyotes were also present indicating that hardwood stands may enhance gray fox-coyote coexistence. The 2 fox species appeared to co-occur with each other at the local scale more frequently than expected based on their individual selection of habitat. Similarly, occupancy of camera location by red foxes was higher when coyotes were present. These positive spatial associations among canids may be a response to locally high prey abundance or unmeasured habitat variables. Activity levels of raccoons, bobcats, and coyotes were all positively correlated. Overall, our co- occurrence and activity models indicate competitor-driven adjustments in space use among members of a carnivore community might be the exception rather than the norm. Nevertheless, although our results indicate that gray foxes and red foxes currently coexist with bobcats and coyotes, their distribution appears to be contracting on our study area. Coexistence of foxes with larger carnivores may be enhanced by temporal partitioning of activity and by habitat features that reduce vulnerability of intraguild predation. For instance, hardwood stands may contain trees with structure that enhances tree-climbing by gray foxes, a behavior that probably facilitates coexistence with coyotes. Efforts to enhance gray fox populations would likely benefit from increasing the amount of mature oak-hickory forest. Additionally, the varying results from different scales of analyses underscore the importance of considering multiple spatial scales in carnivore community studies.

In spite of the biological richness of the invaded area, no study ever addressed the evolution of the invasion process. We aimed to investigate the current distribution and status of the mink in NW Portugal and discuss some contributing factors to explain the rate of invasion. We detected mink presence using floating rafts as footprint tracking devices, and scats as a molecular tool aiding in species identification. Results demonstrate a clear range expansion southwards, with mink already occupying most of the region's hydrographic basins. After a first phase of slow expansion (55 km in 20 years), mink seems to have expanded its range quite rapidly in only 2 years (45 km). The initial delay could be due to local thriving otter populations, whereas the recent establishment of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in the area could be a plausible explanation for the acceleration in the mink's expansion.

Mink eradication is probably no longer feasible since well established populations near the border continue to function as sources for the Portuguese population.

Habitat use often changes in the course of the cycle. Higher densities can either lead to spill-over into secondary habitats or to increased habitat specificity because of interspecific competition. Here we investigate whether voles in the shrub tundra of southern Yamal exhibit density dependent habitat use. Voles were trapped at the Erkuta Tundra Monitoring Site (N 68.2 degrees, E 69.2 degrees) in three characteristic habitats over five years covering all phases of the population cycle. Our analyses focused on the two most numerous species Microtus gregalis (52% of individuals caught) and M. middendorffii (36%). A small-scale spill-over effect was observed for M. gregalis, which increasingly used the open habitat adjacent to their preferred willow thickets at high abundance. At a larger scale no such effect was observed for the two Microtus species - a result which is explained by the overall moderate densities of voles and the large spatial extent of the primary habitat of M. middendorffii: moist moss dwarf shrub tundra.

In the Great Lakes, competition with nonnative salmonids may be hindering the restoration efforts of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, a once-native top predator in Lake Ontario. We examined the effects of brown trout S. trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, two nonnative fishes in Lake Ontario, on the social dominance and growth rate of juvenile Atlantic salmon from three strains being used for reintroduction efforts in Lake Ontario. Using seminatural stream channels, we found that the presence of either rainbow trout or brown trout reduced aggression, dominance, and food consumption of the Atlantic salmon. Brown trout had the strongest effect, increasing aggression levels in the channels by a factor of two and sharply reducing the dominance of Atlantic salmon. When both nonnatives were present, initiated aggression by Atlantic salmon decreased by a factor of three and food consumption halved as compared with when the salmon were alone. Consequently, over a 7-d time period, standard growth rate of the Atlantic salmon dropped from no change in mass when alone to a value of -0.3% per day when with the nonnative species. Of the three strains tested, one strain was least affected by the nonnative trouts, implicating genetic differences among the strains and suggesting that one strain may have greater poststocking success in Lake Ontario tributaries with naturalized populations of brown trout and rainbow trout.","[Van Zwol, Jessica A.; Neff, Bryan D.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Wilson, Chris C.] Trent Univ, Aquat Res & Dev Sect, Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada","Neff, BD (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",bneff@uwo.ca,"Wilson, Chris C/J-4851-2012","Wilson, Chris C/0000-0002-9528-0652",World Wildlife Fund-Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We gratefully acknowledge the support of World Wildlife Fund-Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.

Such variation changes population dynamics via effects on the growth and reproduction of individuals. Also at the community level, theory predicts that animals can reduce competition for shared resources by changing diel activity in certain situations. However, the role of diel activity at the community-level has not been examined sufficiently. In this study, to examine whether the diel-scale temporal niche act as a competition-mitigating mechanism for stream fishes at the community level, we surveyed diel changes in microhabitat use and foraging, and the pattern of interspecific diet overlap in the middle reaches of a temperate stream where various fish species that seemed to be either nocturnal or diurnal coexisted. Our results suggest that the fishes forage during both daytime and night, but change their foraging mode at different times of the day, so that the foraging habits of these fish species cannot be divided simply into nocturnal and diurnal. Furthermore, fishes appeared to aggregate in the vicinity of common food resources during time zones with high availability of the resources, and therefore, inter-guild diet overlap was high during certain time zones. On the other hand, when inter-guild diet overlap was low, each fish species used foods or microhabitats that did not any have the potential to be used by species of another guild. Therefore, we conclude that variation in diel niche use is influenced by variation in the fundamental niche and food supply or availability rather than by competitive interaction between fishes in the stream fish community.","[Nakagawa, Hikaru; Yamane, Hideyuki; Yasugi, Masaki; Ashiwa, Hiroshi; Tominaga, Koji; Goto, Motoyasu] Kyoto Univ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Japan; [Fujita, Tomohiko] Civil Engn & Ecotechnol Consultants, Toyoshima Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Yokoi, Kenichi; Kitada, Naoki; Yamano, Hitomi; Ito, Takehiko] Kindai Univ, Nara 3327, Japan; [Takano, Hiroki] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Hikone, Shiga, Japan; [Suzuki, Noriyasu; Maruyama, Hiroaki; Hatakeyama, Emi] Mie Univ, Tsu, Mie 514, Japan; [Kishimoto, Junpei; Maeda, Hajime] Osaka Kyoiku Univ, Osaka 543, Japan; [Takahashi, Daisuke] Nagano Univ, Fac Tourism & Environm Studies, Nagano, Japan","Nakagawa, H (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Sakyo Ku, Oiwake Cho, Kyoto, Japan.",nakagawa@terra.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Yasugi, Masaki/0000-0001-7876-405X","Kansai Organization for Nature Conservation (KONC); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A06]","Katsutoshi Watanabe of Kyoto University provided valuable comments on the manuscript.

However, tests of this hypothesis usually use food-hoarding animals with a single load or a small load size. How multiple-load animals place their caches between food sources and nests remains largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that multiple-load animals, compared to single-load animals, may not necessarily sequester food items but adopt alternative hoarding strategies due to their multiple-load ability. In this study, we presented seeds at different distances from the nests of the multiple-loading Siberian chipmunk, Tamias sibiricus, and mapped the spatial distribution of their caches in multiple-compartment enclosures to test our hypothesis that a multiple-prey loader will consistently establish caches near nests rather than rapidly sequester near the seed source. By using multiple-compartment enclosures with different distances between the seed source and nests, and given potential intra- and interspecific competition, we found chipmunks consistently placed their caches near nests but away from the seed source. Cache placement near nests may serve as an alternative strategy that not only guarantees a maximum harvest rate at the seed source but also ensures effective cache defence near nests. Moreover, scatter-hoarding seeds near nests may alternatively guarantee a food supply if larder-hoarded seeds are depleted or lost. Unlike seeds sequestered near food sources, caches near nests imply long dispersal distances for seeds in our study. Therefore, scatter hoarding by multiple-prey loaders is expected to be ecologically important for the structure and function of tree communities, especially in ecosystems in which seeds depend on food-hoarding animals for dispersal and germination.

To examine the relative influence of these variables on juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Salmon River drainage (ID, USA), we examined diel differences in foraging microhabitats, behaviour and consumption in two areas with consistent differences in parr-to-smolt survival. In lower Big Creek (LBC, high-survival area) and upper Big Creek (UBC, low-survival area), we observed fish by snorkelling, recording length, behaviour (foraging rate and aggression) and physical (depth, velocity, cover, temperature) and biotic (density, size and species of neighbouring fish) microhabitat features. Stomach contents were extracted to estimate consumption. Depth and temperature were greater in LBC, where Chinook salmon were significantly larger and present at lower densities. Fish in LBC exhibited higher foraging activity during the day than night, but there were no size differences between day and night foragers. In UBC, a higher density area, foraging behaviour did not change between day and night, although the smallest size classes did not forage nocturnally. Regression models that integrated physical and biotic variables suggested that physical factors influenced foraging in both areas, but competition also affected foraging in UBC. Our results demonstrate that fish from low- and high-survival populations in Big Creek are exposed to different physical and biological influences during their first growth season, which are reflected in different diel foraging behaviours.","[Cromwell, Kara J.; Kennedy, Brian P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Cromwell, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, POB 441136, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",kara.cromwell@vandals.uidaho.edu,,,DeVlieg Foundation; NMFS-NWMF,"We thank three anonymous reviewers whose comments guided many improvements to the original manuscript.

Understanding interspecific interactions, and the influences of anthropogenic disturbance and environmental change on communities, are key challenges in ecology. Despite the pressing need to understand these fundamental drivers of community structure and dynamics, only 17% of ecological studies conducted over the past three decades have been at the community level. 2. Here, we assess the trophic structure of the procellariiform community breeding at South Georgia, to identify the factors that determine foraging niches and possible temporal changes. We collected conventional diet data from 13 sympatric species between 1974 and 2002, and quantified intra-and inter-guild, and annual variation in diet between and within foraging habits. In addition, we tested the reliability of stable isotope analysis (SIA) of seabird feathers collected over a 13-year period, in relation to those of their potential prey, as a tool to assess community structure when diets are diverse and there is high spatial heterogeneity in environmental baselines. 3. Our results using conventional diet data identified a four-guild community structure, distinguishing species that mainly feed on crustaceans; large fish and squid; a mixture of crustaceans, small fish and squid; or carrion. In total, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba represented 32%, and 14 other species a further 46% of the combined diet of all 13 predators, underlining the reliance of this community on relatively few types of prey. Annual variation in trophic segregation depended on relative prey availability; however, our data did not provide evidence of changes in guild structure associated with a suggested decline in Antarctic krill abundance over the past 40 years. 4. Reflecting the differences in delta N-15 of potential prey (crustaceans vs. squid vs. fish and carrion), analysis of delta N-15 in chick feathers identified a three-guild community structure that was constant over a 13-year period, but lacked the trophic cluster representing giant petrels which was identified using conventional diet data. 5. Our study is the first in recent decades to examine dietary changes in seabird communities over time. Conventional dietary analysis provided better resolution of community structure than SIA. However, delta N-15 in chick feathers, which reflected trophic (level) specialization, was nevertheless an effective and less time-consuming means of monitoring temporal changes.","[Moreno, Rocio; Stowasser, Gabriele; Phillips, Richard A.] British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [McGill, Rona A.

Although previous studies have demonstrated that habitat composition and configuration at large scales may affect the presence, survival and movement of carnivore species, no such analyses have been conducted for the gray fox Urocyon cinereoargenteus. We used a generalized correlative mapping approach to investigate the relationship of gray fox relative abundance to landscape variables at the county scale in Illinois, USA. Relative abundance of gray foxes was high in 37 of 102 (36%) counties. Four models were competitive based on Delta AIC(c) scores, and these models indicated that standard deviation of the perimeter-area ratio of agricultural patches, interspersion and juxtaposition index of grassland patches, coefficent of variation of the proximity index of forest patches and relative patch richness of the landscape affected gray fox relative abundance. The variables occurring in our competing models indicate that the relative abundance of the gray fox is higher in counties containing a high level of fragmentation of preferred habitat types (i.e. forests and grasslands) and lower dispersion of less preferred habitat types (i.e. agriculture). Our results reflect gray fox habitat use at smaller scales, and at the landscape scale, gray fox abundance is influenced by how cover-type patches are configured.","[Cooper, Susan E.; Nielsen, Clayton K.; McDonald, Patrick T.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Cooper, Susan E.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, US Dept Interior, Las Vegas, NV 89130 USA","Cooper, SE (corresponding author), So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",secooper5@yahoo.com; kezo92@siu.edu; Patrick.McDonald@illinois.gov,,,"Illinois Department of Natural Resources through the Illinois State Furbearer Fund; Cooperative Wildlife Research Laboratory, Department of Zoology and Graduate School at Southern Illinois University Carbondale","funding and support was provided by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources through the Illinois State Furbearer Fund.

Most of the studies on eco-evolutionary dynamics have been concerned with direct trophic interactions. However, community ecologists have shown that trait-mediated indirect effects play an important role in shaping the structure of natural communities. In particular, in terrestrial plant-insect systems, indirect effects mediated through herbivore-induced plant responses are common and have a great impact on the structure of herbivore communities. This review describes eco-evolutionary dynamics in herbivorous insect communities, and specifically focuses on the key role of herbivore-induced plant responses in eco-evolutionary dynamics. First, I review studies on the evolution of herbivore traits relevant to plant induction and discuss evolution in a community context mediated by induced plant responses. Second, I highlight how intraspecific genetic variation or evolution in herbivore traits can influence herbivore community structure. Finally, I propose the hypothetical model that induced plant responses supports eco-evolutionary feedback in herbivore communities. In this review, I argue that the application of the indirect interaction web approaches into studies on eco-evolutionary will provide profound insights into understanding of mechanisms of the generation and maintenance of biodiversity.","[Utsumi, Shunsuke] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Utsumi, Shunsuke] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Biol, Joensuu 80101, Finland; [Utsumi, Shunsuke] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Utsumi, S (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.",csutsumi@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Utsumi, Shunsuke/0000-0003-1558-8073","Global COE programMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A06]; Japan Society of the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22-9260]",I am grateful to Takayuki Ohgushi for providing me the opportunity to talk in the symposium in the 25th annual meeting of the Society of Population Ecology and write this manuscript.

Between 19 June and 19 July 2003, we collected 71 recently metamorphosed Rana areolata (Crawfish Frogs) and 69 recently metamorphosed R. sphenocephala (Southern Leopard Frogs) from a single pond In northeastern Oklahoma and compared their morphology and diet. We found that recently metamorphosed R. areolata and R. sphenocephala are morphologically similar. Further, diets of both species were similar: hemipterans predominated, prey Items were similarly sized, and dietary niche breadths overlapped, but R. areolata had significantly lower volumes of prey in their stomachs. Because of the high risk of desiccation, especially in Great Plains populations, newly metamorphosed Rana are not expected to disperse far from their natal ponds. During this first season, Rana also experience rapid growth. Dietary restrictions directly Influence growth rate, which in turn are known to have major consequences during later life stages, ultimately affecting fitness. Rana areolata Is a species of conservation concern across Its range. Competitive Interactions with other species of Rana have been proposed to be contributing to declines in R. areolata. Our results indicate that competitive Interactions with R. sphenocephala have the potential to negatively affect prey consumption, and ultimately fitness, in R. areolata.","[Crawford, John A.; Conner, Christopher A.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Shepard, Donald B.] Univ Oklahoma, Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum Nat Hist, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Shepard, Donald B.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73072 USA","Crawford, JA (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Med TH, 135 Holmstedt Hall, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",jcrawford10@isugw.indstate.edu; dshepard@ou.edu; caconner@hotmail.com,,"Shepard, Donald/0000-0002-1762-6283",University of Missouri; U.S. ArmyUnited States Department of Defense; Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation [3403]; University of Oklahoma Animal Care and Use Committee [1104-016],"We thank J.

The more abundant are supposed to be involved in crop pest regulation. However, the lack of knowledge about ecological interactions between ants and their habitat, including other ant species of the community, leaded to contradictory views on their efficiency as potential biological control agents. In the present study, we studied the impact of shade trees on the occurrence and spatial distribution of the most abundant ants of cocoa agroforestry systems of Southern Cameroon. We characterized shade of four traditional cocoa farms and described distribution patterns of numerically dominant ants through spatial analysis. Our results showed that the populations of the most abundant arboreal species, in our study Oecophylla longinoda, Tetramorium aculeatum, Crematogaster spp., Camponotus spp. were generally aggregated in plantations. However, the distribution structure of ant populations was variable between samples, suggesting that the normal development of ant colonies may interfere with ecological constraints like interspecific competition and abiotic factors. Distribution mapping as well as statistical analysis showed that highest densities of O. longinoda were sheltered by cocoa trees in the sunniest areas of plots. On the other hand, Crematogaster species were usually strongly aggregated in the most shaded areas. Mechanisms involved in ant/shade relationships were discussed and we suggested that a good management of shade may take into account ant communities, which could play a significant role in conservation biological control against cocoa pests.","[Tadu, Zephirin; Djieto-Lordon, Champlain; Yede; Youbi, Edith Messop; Alene, Chantal Desiree] Univ Yaounde I, Zool Lab, Fac Sci, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Fomena, Abraham] Univ Yaounde I, Lab Parasitol & Ecol, Fac Sci, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Babin, Regis] CIRAD, UPR Bioagresseurs Analyse & Maitrise Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Babin, Regis] ICIPE, Plant Hlth Div, Coffee Pest Project, Nairobi 00100, Kenya","Babin, R (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR Bioagresseurs Analyse & Maitrise Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",regis.babin@cirad.fr,"Babin, Regis/N-3682-2019; Babin, Regis/D-5322-2014","Babin, Regis/0000-0002-3753-1193",French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the REPARAC project,"We thank farmers of Bokito, Obala and Ngomedzap for allowing us to carry out the present study in their cocoa farms.

We compared annual censuses of orb-spider populations on 24 islands with diurnal lizards present, and on 20 islands with diurnal lizards absent, to rainfall over a 10-year period. A strong positive correlation (Pearson r=0.877) was found between mean spider density on nolizard islands and the number of days of rain that occurred 2 months prior to spider censuses; correlation coefficients declined with longer and shorter time periods prior to censuses. Correlation coefficients between mean spider density on lizard islands and rainfall showed a similar pattern but were generally lower than those for no-lizard islands. The strength of the impact of lizards on spiders, measured as the ratio of mean spider density on no-lizard islands to mean spider density on lizard islands, varied considerably and was positively correlated with rainfall; the correlation was highest with number of rain days 6 months prior to spider censuses (r-=0.741). Repeated-measures analysis of variance on the time series of spider densities showed that the lizard factor (present versus absent) varied significantly among years. Split-plot ANOVA with rainfall as a covariate indicated that spider density and the impact of lizards on spider density were both significantly correlated with rainfall. We discuss several hypotheses on the causal mechanisms that integrate abiotic and biotic factors.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS, CTR POPULAT BIOL, DIV BIOL SCI, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA","SPILLER, DA (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS, EVOLUT & ECOL SECT, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,39,28,33,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1995,103,2,,,,,133,139,,10.1007/BF00329072,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RN783,WOS:A1995RN78300001,28306765,,,,2021-09-23,

We also describe an experiment, using tortoise shells, that can allow to control, and eventually correct, the reliability of observed data by taking into account the detectability of the study species in the wild. On the basis of a suite of statistical analysis and GIS-based elaborations, we confirmed, and further uncovered, the remarkable ecological differences existing between S. pardalis and K. belliana. The habitat use was different interspecifically, with K. belliana being much more linked to dense vegetation spots, often nearby waterbodies, whereas S. pardalis being an habitat generalist, at both micro- and macmhabitat scale. Nonetheless, juveniles of both species were observed in areas with significantly higher % soil covered by vegetation taller than 200 cm than adults of both sexes. This different habitat selection is hypothesized to be due to antipredatory reasons. Overall, our data suggests that interspecific competition should be minimal between these species.","[Demaya, Gift Simon; Benansio, John Sebit] Univ Juba, Dept Wildlife, Juba, South Sudan; [Petrozzi, Fabio] Ecolobby, Via E Jenner 70, I-00151 Rome, Italy; [Di Vittorio, Massimiliano] Ecol Applicata Italia Srl, Termini Imerese, PA, Italy; [Fa, John E.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Div Biol & Conservat Ecol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Fa, John E.] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, CIFOR Headquarters, Bogor 16115, Indonesia; [Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] Univ Lome, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, BP 6057, Lome, Togo; [Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, PMB 5080, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; [Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] IDECC Inst Dev Ecol Conservat & Cooperat, Via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Univ Lome, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, BP 6057, Lome, Togo.",gftsimon@yahoo.co.uk; sebitbenansio@yahoo.co.uk; fapetrozzi@gmail.com; divittoriomassimiliano@gmail.com; jfa949@gmail.com; l.luiselli@ideccngo.org,"Dendi, Daniele/AAO-8569-2020","Dendi, Daniele/0000-0003-1417-9091","Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund [172515472, 182518886]; Rainforest Trust; Turtle Conservation Fund [TCF-0687]; National GeographicNational Geographic Society [NGS-52320C-18]; Quarters for Conservation Award","This study was supported by Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (grant no. 172515472 and 182518886), the Rainforest Trust, Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF-0687), National Geographic (NGS-52320C-18), and Quarters for Conservation Award (all funds to L.

Here we compared the foraging strategy of a pantropical seabird, the red-footed booby Sula sula, in 5 populations breeding in contrasted environmental conditions. The foraging strategy strongly differed between sites, from strictly diurnal short trips in Europa Island (Mozambique channel) to long trips including up to 5 nights at sea in Genovesa Island (Galapagos archipelago). The Expectation Maximisation binary Clustering (EMbC) algorithm was used to determine the different behaviours of individuals during their foraging trips (travelling, intensive foraging, resting and relocating). During the day, the activity budget was similar for all the breeding colonies. During the night, birds were primarily on the water, drifting with currents. At all sites, birds similarly performed intensive foraging in zones of area-restricted search (ARS), although the size and duration of ARS zones differed markedly. Red-footed boobies foraged over deep oceanic waters, with chlorophyll a concentrations varying between sites. Birds did not appear to target areas with higher productivity. We suggest that range differences between populations may be linked to other factors such as intra-and interspecific competition.","[Mendez, Loriane; de Grissac, Sophie; Hennicke, Janos; Lallemand, Joelle; Prudor, Aurelien; Weimerskirch, Henri] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS UMR7372, CEBC, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Mendez, Loriane; de Grissac, Sophie; Prudor, Aurelien; Weimerskirch, Henri] Univ la Reunion, UMR UR CNRS IRD ENTROPIE 9220, Fac Sci Technol, 15 Ave Rene Cassin CS 92003, F-97744 St Denis 9, La Reunion, France; [Borsa, Philippe] UMR 250 UR CNRS IRD ENTROPIE, 101 Promenade Roger Laroque, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Cruz, Sebastian] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Hennicke, Janos] Univ Hamburg, Inst Zool, Dept Ecol & Conservat, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Mendez, L (corresponding author), Univ La Rochelle, CNRS UMR7372, CEBC, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.; Mendez, L (corresponding author), Univ la Reunion, UMR UR CNRS IRD ENTROPIE 9220, Fac Sci Technol, 15 Ave Rene Cassin CS 92003, F-97744 St Denis 9, La Reunion, France.",loriane.mendez@cebc.cnrs.fr,"Borsa, Philippe/AAC-7915-2019; Mendez, Loriane/H-9712-2019; Weimerskirch, Henri/F-5562-2013; Weimerskirch, Henri/K-7306-2019; de Grissac, Sophie/Q-6666-2017; Borsa, Philippe/D-4967-2015","Mendez, Loriane/0000-0002-5844-3547; Weimerskirch, Henri/0000-0002-0457-586X; de Grissac, Sophie/0000-0002-1589-8066; Borsa, Philippe/0000-0001-9469-8304",France's 'Iles Eparses' program; CNRS-InEE; CNRS-Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers (INSU); Institut de recherche pour le developpement (IRD); Agence des aires marines protegees (AAMP); Commission nationale de la flotte cotiere; IRD; EARLYLIFE - European Research Council Advanced Grant under the European Community's Seven Framework Program FP7 [ERC-2012-ADG_20120314]; Universitat Hamburg; Mini Wunderland Hamburg; CI Island Trust; CI Territory Week Committee; CI Tourist Association; Marie Curie Research Fellowship from the European Union [PIEF-GA-2009-236295],"This research was supported by France's 'Iles Eparses' program (2011-2013) managed by the CNRS-Institut Ecologie et Environnement (InEE) with the financial support of the CNRS-InEE, CNRS-Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers (INSU), Institut de recherche pour le developpement (IRD), Agence des aires marines protegees (AAMP) and the logistic support of Terres Australes et Antarctiques Francaises (TAAF).

The present study analyses the interactions in trophic ecology between the endangered Iberian toothcarp Aphanius iberus and the highly invasive eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki at a sympatric site where they have been verified to coexist for more than 10 yr. The existence of a habitat gradient in the system, mainly determined by salinity and accompanied by different proportions of the 2 fish species, made it possible to analyse dietary variation along that gradient. Overall results from gut content analysis showed a high degree of similarity in the spring diets of both species. However, the mosquitofish appeared to be a better competitor for food resources, as individuals of this exotic species presented a lower proportion of empty guts and their guts contained more food. Possibly associated with a certain degree of spatial segregation, a shift in the diet composition of the toothcarp and the mosquitofish was observed among sites with different salinities and relative abundances of both species. In general, in sectors of the channel with lower salinity levels and mosquitofish as the dominant species, toothcarp seemed to display more benthic feeding and, consequently, the diets of both species were less overlapped. Under such conditions, the toothcarp diminished feeding intensity and diet diversity. Thus, this native species could be subjected to a decrease in its population viability as a direct consequence of trophic relationship with the invasive fish.","[Ruiz-Navarro, Ana; Torralva, Mar; Oliva-Paterna, Francisco J.] Univ Murcia, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Ruiz-Navarro, A (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",anaruiz@um.es,"Ruiz-Navarro, Ana/AAU-7982-2021; TORRALVA, MAR/R-5545-2019","Ruiz-Navarro, Ana/0000-0002-3872-6080; Oliva-Paterna, Francisco J./0000-0001-8288-5321",Spanish Ministry of EducationSpanish Government [FPU AP2006-01528],"We thank Institut d'Ecologia Aquatica of the University of Girona for the study of the invertebrate community and for help in prey identification, J.

However, the simultaneous assessment of the relative importance of both types of factors is rarely performed for multiple traits of a population, such as body size and abundance. Comparisons among different demographic rates are necessary for teasing apart the importance of species interactions and/or environmental conditions on both population and community structure. We tested whether biotic (e.g., larval competition) or abiotic factors influenced larval salamander density and body size in natural populations of two known salamander competitors, Ambystoma talpoideum and A. maculatum. Over six years, we surveyed 33 ponds where these species co-occur in western Kentucky, USA. We found that larval densities between species were positively correlated, and that habitat features had contrasting, species-specific effects. Larval sizes for each species showed negative intra-and interspecific relationships with larval densities of each species, but larval A. maculatum generally exerted the stronger relative interspecific effect. Overall, our study highlights that different characteristics of a population (i.e., body size or abundance) may be differentially affected by abiotic and biotic factors, even for ecologically similar, sympatric species. Understanding which traits are regulated by each component will advance our knowledge on how populations and communities are structured.","[Anderson, Thomas L.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.; Hartman, Bradley A.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, 2112 Biol Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Mott, Cy L.] Eastern Kentucky Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Moore 349, Richmond, KY 40475 USA; [Hartman, Bradley A.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 2112 Biol Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA.; Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, 2112 Biol Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA.",anderstl@gmail.com; cy.mott@eku.edu; bhartman@murraystate.edu; hwhiteman@murraystate.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354787]; Watershed Studies Institute; American Museum of Natural History Theodore Roosevelt Grant,"The authors thank C.

Depending upon the environmental context, saltmarsh plants can facilitate or suppress mangrove recruitment. A field study was conducted within a mosaic saltmarsh at the edge of a mangrove forest fringing Tampa Bay, FL, USA, to investigate whether mangrove recruitment is influenced by the species composition of saltmarsh patches within which mangroves develop. Propagules of Avicennia germinans were emplaced into experimental plots at the same tidal elevation representing 3 saltmarsh treatments: (1) Distichlis littoralis in monoculture, (2) Sporobolus virginicus in monoculture, and (3) polycultures containing D. littoralis, S. virginicus, and at least one other species. Significantly fewer seedlings established in S. virginicus monocultures than in D. littoralis monocultures. Seedling establishment within the saltmarsh polyculture was intermediate to the grass monoculture treatments. Herbivory was the most commonly observed source of mortality for mangrove propagules, and propagules were more susceptible to herbivory within monocultures of S. virginicus relative to D. littoralis monocultures. Our results suggest that patch-scale heterogeneity in saltmarsh groundcover may influence spatial patterns of mangrove herbivory and recruitment at landward forest margins. This study builds on prior investigations and demonstrates that interactions between the same mangrove and saltmarsh species may differ between sites. Understanding these context-dependent interactions among saltmarsh plants and mangrove recruits can be useful for forecasting distributional shifts of mangrove populations and for implementing mangrove restoration.","[Peterson, Jennifer M.; Bell, Susan S.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Bell, SS (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",sbell@usf.edu,,,,,,94,4,4,2,25,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Despite the wide-spread use of amphibians as experimental model organisms, there is a limited understanding of how multiple abiotic and biotic factors affect the variation in metamorphic traits under natural conditions. The aim of our study was to quantify the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on spatial variation in the body size of tadpoles and size at metamorphosis of the European common toad (Bufo b. spinosus). Our study population was distributed over the riverbed (active tract) and the fringing riparian forest of a natural floodplain. The riverbed had warm ponds with variable hydroperiod and few predators, whereas the forest had ponds with the opposite characteristics. Spatial variation in body size at metamorphosis was governed by the interactive effects of abiotic and biotic factors. The particular form of the interaction between water temperature and intraspecific tadpole density suggests that abiotic factors laid the foundation for biotic factors: intraspecific density decreased growth only at high temperature. Predation and intraspecific density jointly reduced metamorphic size. Interspecific density had a negligible affect on body size at metamorphosis, suggesting weak inter-anuran interactions in the larval stage. Population density at metamorphosis was about one to two orders of magnitudes higher in the riverbed ponds than in the forest ponds, mainly because of lower tadpole mortality. Based on our results, we conclude that ponds in the riverbed appear to play a pivotal role for the population because tadpole growth and survival is best in this habitat.","[Indermaur, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Indermaur, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolut Biol & Umweltwissensch, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] KARCH, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Tockner, Klement] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Schaub, Michael] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6203 Sempach, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Indermaur, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",lukas.indermaur@eawag.ch,"Tockner, Klement/G-9265-2011; Schmidt, Benedikt R./B-8491-2008","Schmidt, Benedikt R./0000-0002-4023-1001; Tockner, Klement/0000-0002-0038-8151",MAVA Foundation (Switzerland),"We are grateful to Simone Blaser, Pascal Meuwly and Ursina von Planta for field data collection.

This scale was large enough to allow line-transect estimates of lizard abundance, which were related to quantitative (and when possible multivariate) measurements of the structure and floristic composition of vegetation, the abundance of arthropod prey, the relative density of other lizard species, and the climatic data obtained from nearby meteorological stations. Neither the climate not the abundance of other lizards seemed to condition the quantitative distribution of the species. The positive influence of broad-leaved forests on the abundance of P. algirus appeared to be a consequence of structure attributes more directly related to the ecology of lizards than floristic composition per se. Thus, population levels were most highly correlated with the cover of shrubs over 20 cm in height, and once this structural requirement was met, they increased with the abundance of potential prey (itself conditioned by vegetation cover at the ground level and litter cover). We suggest that our results should be interpreted in the context of thermoregulatory, predator avoidance and movement minimization strategies whose influence on survival, and hence abundance, could probably be applied to other insectivorous lizards from temperate zones.","CSIC,MUSEO NACL CIENCIAS NAT,UEI VERTEBRADOS,E-28006 MADRID,SPAIN","DIAZ, JA (corresponding author), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,FAC BIOL,DEPT BIOL ANIM VERTEBRADOS,E-28040 MADRID,SPAIN.",,"Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008; Diaz, Jose A./H-5559-2015; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016","Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Diaz, Jose A./0000-0001-6047-5065; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531",,,,53,77,81,0,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Survey results indicated that wood frogs bred in both open- and closed-canopy ponds, whereas leopard frogs and toads did not, We conducted two experiments in 1.5-m(2) cages set in natural ponds to evaluate species' performance in open- and closed-canopy ponds, The first experiment was conducted in two open-canopy and two closed-canopy ponds and demonstrated that tadpole growth and survivorship for all three species were higher in open-canopy ponds, Wood frogs, however, also grew and survived well in closed-canopy ponds, whereas performance of leopard frogs and toads was very poor in closed-canopy ponds, Competition between species was asymmetrical; wood frogs affected leopard frogs, but the reverse effect was negligible. The second experiment was conducted in the two closed-canopy ponds with wood frog and leopard frog and indicated that food supplementation dramatically increased both survivorship and growth rate of leopard frogs, There was no effect of food addition on wood frog survivorship and a minimal effect on growth rate, Resource differences between open- and closed-canopy ponds therefore appear to have a strong influence on distributions of these species, Dissolved oxygen concentrations also were lower in closed- than in open-canopy ponds, which may interact with resource levels to influence species performance, Finally, we note the potentially widespread and important influence of forest and pond succession on the distribution of amphibian species.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Werner, EE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,41,179,189,0,32,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS,CHARLESTON,"UNIV CHARLESTON, GRICE MARINE LABORATORY, 205 FORT JOHNSON RD, CHARLESTON, SC 29412 USA",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 5,1999,,1,,,,,1,12,,10.2307/1447379,,,12,Zoology,Zoology,167TY,WOS:000078650400001,,,,,2021-09-23,

We describe the diet and patterns of use of food resources of four migratory shorebirds at Samborombon Bay, Argentina, one of the most important sites for shorebirds in the western hemisphere. The birds consumed items representing at least 15 taxa but only a few taxa comprised the main resources consumed. The four species of shorebird showed dietary flexibility influenced by season and tidal level. Co-occurring species showed complementary differentiation in two dimensions of their respective trophic niches (taxonomic composition, size-class). The greatest differences in taxonomic composition of the diet were between Red Knots, which fed mainly on molluscs, and the other three species, which fed mainly on polychaetes. Polychaete consumers that co-occurred during autumn (Hudsonian Godwit and White-rumped Sandpiper) focussed on different prey sizes. Alternatively, shorebirds that co-occurred during winter (Hudsonian Godwits and Two-banded Plovers) fed mainly on polychaete of similar size but showed differences in the taxonomic composition of their diets. Interspecific competition for food resources might shape the composition of the shorebird assemblage of our study area during the austral autumn and winter.","[Martinez-Curci, Natalia S.; Isacch, Juan P.] Univ Nacl Mar Plata UNMdP, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Lab Vertebrados, Inst Invest Marinas Costeras IIMyC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Azpiroz, Adrian B.] Inst Invest Biol Clemente Estable, Dept Biodiversidad & Genet, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay; [Elias, Rodolfo] Univ Nacl Mar Plata UNMdP, Inst Invest Marinas Costeras IIMyC, Lab Bioindicadores Bentonicos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Martinez-Curci, NS (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Mar Plata UNMdP, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Lab Vertebrados, Inst Invest Marinas Costeras IIMyC, Funes 3250,Mar Del Plata B7602AYJ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",nanusmc@gmail.com,"Martinez-Curci, Natalia/AAE-5093-2019",,Rufford Foundation; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata (UNMdP)National University of La Plata,"We thank L.

The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), the largest carnivorous marsupial, coexists with the smaller spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) in Tasmania, Australia. Quolls may be susceptible to interspecific competition from devils, because they utilise similar habitats, consume similar prey species and are displaced by devils at food sources. Such competition might cause quolls to spatially or temporally avoid devils. To investigate whether spatial or temporal avoidance occurred, we deployed GPS collars on sympatric devils and quolls and conducted a camera survey at a site in northwest Tasmania where the devil population was not affected by devil facial tumour disease. GPS tracking coincided with the lactation period when devils and quolls had young in dens and continued until weaning occurred. We found little spatial segregation of home range and core area placement between devils and quolls and among devils. Quolls showed more spatial segregation within the sexes than between them. Devils had larger home ranges than quolls. Male devils had larger home ranges than females, but there was no difference in home range size between the sexes of quolls. Females of both species travelled significantly further per night than did males. There was moderate temporal partitioning between the two species: devil activity peaked after dusk and devils remained active until the early morning, while quoll activity showed distinct peaks around dusk and dawn. In conclusion, quolls did not spatially avoid devils but moderate temporal partitioning occurred. It is plausible that quolls are active at different times of the diel cycle to reduce encountering devils, but further studies are needed to resolve the cause of this temporal partitioning.","[Andersen, Georgina E.; Johnson, Christopher N.; Jones, Menna E.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Johnson, Christopher N.] Univ Tasmania, Australian Res Council Ctr Australian Biodivers &, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Andersen, GE (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",georgina.andersen@utas.edu.au,,"Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022; Andersen, Georgina/0000-0001-9425-8296",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [ARC DP110103069]; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Dr. Eric Guiler Tasmanian devil research grant,"We thank the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service for permission to conduct this study in the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area and Westmore Pastoral Company for permission to conduct this research on their land.

We used a set of field methods to assess species presence and relative frequency of observation. The network of ponds was inhabited by six species of amphibians, two salamanders and four frogs. The breeding phenology of the six species did not vary remarkably among ponds, but there were significant differences among species in use of ponds. Factorial analysis of pond similarity drawn from percentage composition of the amphibian fauna, revealed that each of the four ponds was treatable as independent units, with no influence of relative inter-pond distance. PCA analysis allowed us to spatially arrange the amphibian species into three main groups: two were monospecific groups (i.e., Triturus Vulgaris and Bufo bufo) and the third consisted of those species that selected not only the largest-deepest ponds, but also the ephemeral ones (i.e., Triturus carnifex, Hyla intermedia, the green frogs and Rana dalmatina). Our results suggest that the inter-pond differences in riparian vegetation, water depth, aquatic vegetation structure/abundance, and soil composition may produce differences among pond ecological characteristics (i.e., water turbidity and temperature, shelter availability, abundance of oviposition micro-sites), which may in turn influence different patterns of use by amphibians. To our knowledge, this is the first study emphasizing the potential role of heterochrony in the maintenance of a high species richness in Mediterranean amphibian communities. Preservation of freshwater vertebrate biodiversity requires management and protection not only of the main ponds and water bodies but also the temporary and ephemeral shallow ponds.

The model provides insights into the manner in which self- and pathogen regulation combine in determining the coexistence or otherwise of hosts and the structure of biological communities generally. A number of outcomes are possible: coexistence of both hosts with the pathogen, coexistence of both hosts without the pathogen, the predictable elimination of one host by the other, which then remains with the pathogen, and the elimination of either host by the other, contingent on initial densities. However, whereas without self-regulation coexistence of both hosts with their shared pathogen can only be achieved by the partitioning of enemy-free space, with self-regulation there is a wider range of paths, including coexistence mediated by the hosts' resources (analogous to exploiter-mediated coexistence), coexistence mediated by interspecific transmission, and coexistence arising when elements of these other mechanisms are combined. Also, a more affected, regulated-alone host can eliminate a less affected, nonregulated-alone host, but not vice versa; whereas without self-regulation only the opposite outcome is possible. The incorporation of self-regulation adds a necessary element of realism.","NATL TECH UNIV ATHENS,DEPT MATH,GR-147 ATHENS,GREECE; UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT APPL MATH & THEORET PHYS,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND","BEGON, M (corresponding author), UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND.",,,"Bowers, Roger/0000-0001-8207-297X; Begon, Mike/0000-0003-1715-5327",,,,26,108,113,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

During this study, a drought occurred distinguishing two periods before and after the drought that differed markedly in availability of resources and fish biomass. In this study, differences in resource use between the two periods are presented together with their consequence on the partitioning of resources. A different approach is introduced into the calculation of niche breadth and niche overlap incorporating size-specific differences in resource use and interactions between resource dimensions. Comparison with conventional measures of niche breadth and niche overlap shows that conventional measures often misrepresent interactions between species. Condition and biomass were used as indicators of a species' fitness, and it is shown that fitness of most species is governed by the availability of resources and partitioning of these resources is an important mechanism allowing potential competitors to coexist.

We indicate as behavioral adaptation a mechanism, based on a kind of learning, which is not viewed in the evolutionary sense but is intended to occur over shorter time scales. We consider a competitive adaptive n species Lotka-Volterra system, n >= 3, in which one species is made ecologically differentiated with respect to the others by carrying capacity and intrinsic growth rate. The symmetry properties of the system and the existence of a certain class of invariant subspaces allow the introduction of a 7-dimensional reduced model, where n appears as a parameter, which gives full account of existence and stability of equilibria in the complete system. The reduced model is effective also in describing the time-dependent regimes for a large range of parameter values. The case in which one species has a strong ecological advantage (i.e. with a carrying capacity higher than the others), but with a varying growth rate, has been analyzed in detail, and time-dependent behaviors have been investigated in the case of adaptive competition among four species. Relevant questions, as species survival/exclusion, are addressed focusing on the role of adaptation. Interesting forms of species coexistence are found (i.e. competitive stable equilibria, periodic oscillations, strange attractors). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

However, the fitness benefits of different habitats may vary across ages and between sexes. By quantifying microhabitat choice in relation to age or sex, as well as the specific fitness consequences of habitat selection, we can better understand the factors that shape the way organisms distribute themselves across landscapes. Studies of Anolis lizards have provided critical insights into population and community structure, but most studies have focused on interspecific variation in habitat use, rather than intraspecific patterns. We quantified habitat use of Anolis sagrei at two scales (microhabitat and macrohabitat) for males and females of two distinct age classes (juvenile vs adult). We show that age, sex, size, and macrohabitat have significant effects on how A. sagrei utilize available microhabitat and that age, sex, size, and season influence macrohabitat use. In addition, large individuals of both age classes had increased survival during the breeding season. However, body size did not influence overwinter survival, but lizards that used relatively low perches had increased overwinter survival. Overall, this study demonstrates that the complex variation in habitat use by A. sagrei is explained by interactions among age, sex, size, season, and habitat scale. Habitat choice behaviors can have important effects on fitness, yet optimal habitat may vary across ages and between sexes. In this paper, we quantified microhabitat and macrohabitat use of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) and subsequently estimated selection on these behaviors via mark recapture. We show that the complex variation in habitat use by A. sagrei is explained by interactions among age, sex, size, season, and habitat scale. In addition, body size influenced survival of both age classes during the breeding season but not over winter. However, lizards that used relatively low perches had increased overwinter survival. These findings provide new insights into the factors that shape the way these organisms distribute themselves across landscapes and provide a rare assessment of selection on behavioral traits.","[Delaney, David M.; Warner, Daniel A.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Delaney, David M.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Warner, Daniel A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Delaney, DM (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.; Delaney, DM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dmdelane@iastate.edu,"Delaney, David/J-4135-2019","Delaney, David/0000-0002-7010-840X; Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785",UAB Department of Biology; UAB Graduate School; Sigma Xi; Alabama Academy of Science,"We thank Amanda Clark, Corey Cates, Albert Chung, Robin Costello, John David Curlis, Ethan Kahrl, Ariel Kahrl, Nick Galt, Darren Langkilde, Esther Langkilde, Tracy Langkilde, Phillip Pearson, Aaron Reedy, Luke Tinsley, and Frank Wideman for their assistance with field work.

We use otolith microstructure analysis to study the life history of 2 widespread and abundant Caribbean reef fishes, genetically identified here as the glass goby Coryphopterus hyalinus and masked goby C. personatus. Our analysis reveals that these species exhibit an extreme life history relative to other vertebrates due to their short lifespan, small adult body size, early maturity, and continuous growth in body length throughout reproductive age. We find that pelagic larval duration (PLD) varies widely, and average larval growth influences PLD where faster-growing larvae have shorter PLDs. We show that average daily growth substantially decreases during the settlement transition to reef habitat, approximately coinciding with reproductive maturity. Continuous somatic growth throughout reproductive age can serve to support greater fecundity in older, larger-bodied females and enhance survivorship. Several features of the ecology (i.e. broad depth range, planktivorous diet) and life history (i.e. small adult body size, quick generational turnover, short lifespan) of C. hyalinus and C. personatus indicate that they play a key trophic role in transferring nutrients from pelagic plankton to Caribbean reef predators and the reef benthos. Our analyses highlight why life history traits related to survival, reproduction, and population dynamics can enhance our understanding of ecosystem-scale processes and functioning on coral reefs.","[Beeken, Nicolette S.; Selwyn, Jason D.; Hogan, J.

Here we provide the first attempt to reconstruct the environmental distribution of these crinoids based on relatively complete material (mostly cups). Triassic forms are dominated by encrinids from outer carbonate ramps. Late Jurassic crinoids are dominated by cyrtocrinids, comatulids, millericrinids, and isocrinids, occurring either on sponge mounds and meadows or on soft substrates within middle to outer carbonate ramps. Aptian (Early Cretaceous) forms include nearly complete isocrinids which are found in extremely shallow environments represented by bioclastic carbonates and interspersed oyster-rich layers. Other Aptian occurrences come from more distal and deep environments and are composed solely of comatulids. Albian forms are dominated by cyrtocrinids and isocrinids associated with coral reefs. Late Cretaceous and Eocene crinoids include mostly bourgueticrinids (Comatulida) that are found either in outer ramp facies or associated with mid-ramp reef complexes. The later corresponds to one of the shallowest occurrence of bourgueticrinids in the Cenozoic. The palaeoecological data for fossil crinoids of northeast Spain contributes to reconstructing the history of the bathymetric distribution of articulate crinoids, supporting the idea that stalked crinoids were able to inhabit a wide range of shallow marine environments in the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic.","[Zamora, Samuel] Inst Geol & Minero Espana, C Manuel Lasala 44,9B, Zaragoza 50006, Spain; [Aurell, Marcos; Ferratges, Fernando A.] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Ciencias Tierra, Area Estratig, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Veitch, Margaret; Saulsbury, James; Baumiller, Tomasz K.] Univ Michigan, Museum Paleontol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Veitch, Margaret; Saulsbury, James; Baumiller, Tomasz K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lopez-Horgue, Mikel A.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Sci & Technol, Estratig & Paleontol Saila, Leioa Biscay 48940, Basque Country, Spain; [Arz, Jose Antonio] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Ciencias Tierra, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Arz, Jose Antonio] Univ Zaragoza, Inst Univ Invest Ciencias Ambientales Aragon, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain","Zamora, S (corresponding author), Inst Geol & Minero Espana, C Manuel Lasala 44,9B, Zaragoza 50006, Spain.",s.zamora@igme.es; maurell@unizar.es; maveitch@umich.edu; jgsauls@umich.edu; mikel.lopezhorgue@ehu.eus; nautilo_fer_1987@hotmail.com; josearz@unizar.es; tomaszb@umich.edu,"Aurell, Marcos/L-2059-2014","Aurell, Marcos/0000-0002-2430-7424; Saulsbury, James/0000-0002-5903-9220; Ferratges Kwekel, Fernando Ari/0000-0002-9532-6972","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2014-52096-P, CGL201787631, CGL2015-64422-P]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission; Ramon y Cajal GrantSpanish Government [RYC2012-10576]; Basque Government Research GroupBasque Government [IT-1044-16]; University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU Research Group [PPG17/05]; Government of AragonGobierno de Aragon [E18_17R]","We thank David Meyer (University of Cincinnati, USA) and anonymous reviewer for thorough and constructive comments that helped improve the manuscript.

Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and expansions of mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the top-down, releasing effect of extinctions of large apex predators. However, in the case of the northward expansion of the red fox into the arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased resource availability has been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey shortage in the low phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies both with marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved. 2. During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we investigated the seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use by red foxes across a coast to inland low arctic tundra gradient, Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two complementary methods of diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope analysis. 3. We found that inland red foxes primarily subsisted on reindeer carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle. Lemmings became the most important food item towards the peak phase of the rodent cycle, despite being less abundant than sympatric voles. Isotopic signatures of tissue from both predator and prey also revealed that red foxes near the coast used marine-derived subsidies in the winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to adult foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast. 4. Although more needs to be learned about the link between increasing primary productivity due to climatic warming and trophic dynamics in tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in reindeer management through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have paved the way towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra biome.","[Killengreen, Siw T.; Lecomte, Nicolas; Ehrich, Dorothee; Schott, Tino; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Killengreen, ST (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",siw.killengreen@uit.no,"Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014; Killengreen, Siw/G-9205-2016; Ehrich, Dorothee/F-6492-2015","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Ehrich, Dorothee/0000-0002-3028-9488; Lecomte, Nicolas/0000-0002-8473-5375",Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission,"We thank the field inspectors from the Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management, I.

In a greenhouse experiment, thrips reduced root biomass of seedlings, but not shoot biomass. No correlation was found between density of thrips and change in aboveground area of plants after monitoring for 3 yr in the field. Thrips fed on the phyllaries and corollas of flower heads, as well as on leaves, and were particularly damaging to ray petals. Placed in artificial arrays, flower heads with rays damaged by thrips were less likely to be visited by pollinators than were undamaged flower heads. Plants in a common garden were subjected to three seasons of feeding by either spittle-bugs, plume moth caterpillars, both, or neither. Survival, growth, and flower production were measured for those 3 yr and for an additional 3 yr following the herbivory treatments. Plant survival was unaffected by these insect herbivores, although gophers (Thomomys bottae) were a major source of mortality. Plants with caterpillars produced more rosettes than those without moths. By consuming apical buds the caterpillars released axillary buds, thereby causing plants to produce more side rosettes. This difference in architecture did not result in an increase in flower production. Plants that had experienced 3 yr of spittle-bug or caterpillar attack produced fewer flower heads than controls during their 3rd yr. One year later, and after the herbivory treatments were discontinued, plants that had been damaged by spittlebugs (but not plume moth caterpillars) still produced fewer flowers than those in other treatments. Thereafter, no long-term effects of herbivory could be detected. All three herbivores were found to adversely affect some components of plant growth and reproduction. Because they are consistently abundant at Bodega Bay, these herbivores may reduce the fitness of their host plant.",,"KARBAN, R (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,"Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085",,,,26,143,147,4,44,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,39,46,,10.2307/1939499,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500005,,,,,2021-09-23,

The South American fur seal (SAFS) and the South American sea lion (SASL) are two otariid species with similar ecology that coexist in sympatry in the Uruguayan coast. These two species have contrasting trends and widely different population sizes. The underlying reasons for these population trends, unique in their geographical ranges, remain unknown. We studied the foraging ecology of these otariid species over 2 years at the individual- and population levels using the isotopic ratios (delta C-13-delta N-15) in whiskers of both sexes. We compared the isotope ratios between species and sexes and used several metrics to characterise the degree of overlap and distinctiveness in the use of isotopic niche space at the individual- and population levels. Interspecific trophic niche overlap was minimal, thus ruling out interspecific competition as the cause for the contrasting population trends of both species. At the intraspecific level, both species had sexual segregation in their foraging areas, but each species had a large overlap in the isotopic niches between sexes. While SAFS had a wider niche and generalist individuals, SASL had the narrower niche with a higher degree of individual specialisation. Behavioural constraints during the breeding season, intraspecific competition and a major dependence on resources of the Uruguayan coastal shelf may explain why SASL had a higher trophic individual specialisation and a larger vulnerability in a heavily exploited habitat by fisheries and, by consequence, a locally declining population trend.","[Franco-Trecu, Valentina] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Secc Etol, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Aurioles-Gamboa, David] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Lab Ecol Pinnipedos Burney J Le Boeuf, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico; [Inchausti, Pablo] Univ Republ, Dept Ecol & Evolucin, CURE, Maldonado 20000, Uruguay","Inchausti, P (corresponding author), Univ Republ, Dept Ecol & Evolucin, CURE, Tacuarembo S-N, Maldonado 20000, Uruguay.",pablo.inchausti.f@gmail.com,"Franco-Trecu, Valentina/L-4649-2019; Franco-Trecu, Valentina/N-5266-2019","Franco-Trecu, Valentina/0000-0003-1791-010X; ","CSIC (Council for Scientific Research) of the Universidad de la Republica; Rufford Maurice Lain Foundation; ONG Yaqu-pacha; Heidelberg Zoo; ANII (National Agency for Research and Innovation, Uruguay); PEDECIBA (Programme for the Development of Basic Sciences, Uruguay)","We are very grateful with L.

As such, similar species breeding sympatrically are expected to have a high potential for competition and, thus, may have developed strategies to reduce niche overlap to allow coexistence. We combined GPS tracking and stable isotope analysis (delta N-15, delta C-13) to simultaneously compare multiple behavioral and dietary niche dimensions of common murres (Uria aalge) and razorbills (Alca torda) breeding at nearby colonies (55 km apart) on the northeastern Newfoundland coast under varying prey availability in 2017. Though foraging ranges of species had high potential overlap (5000 km(2)), foraging areas of the two species were spatially segregated. Dive characteristics also differed, as predicted based on body size and dive capacity. These differences contrasted a high degree of overlap in diet, habitat characteristics, and diurnal foraging patterns, suggesting that spatial segregation may be the most important factor to allow coexistence of these similar species for the same limited resources. As prey availability increased later in the breeding season, individual murres and razorbills foraged closer to their respective colonies and population-level diet composition changed, indicative of reduced energy costs and dietary plasticity to take advantage of highly available prey, capelin (Mallotus villosus). Foraging areas, however, remained segregated. Seabirds and marine systems face many potential threats, the greatest of which may be climate change. Thus, understanding variation in space, time, and habitat selection among similar species allowed for a more comprehensive view of the possible ways these species may partition their niche and how future changes to resource availability could impact interspecific relationships.","[Gulka, Julia; Davoren, Gail K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Ronconi, Robert A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N6, Canada","Gulka, J (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",juliagulka@gmail.com,,"Gulka, Julia/0000-0002-5695-233X","National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [2014-06290, 486208-2016, 501154-2017]; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support program; National Geographic Young Explorers GrantNational Geographic Society [WW-075ER-17]; World Wildlife Fund-Canada [G-0618-583-00-D]; Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service; Atlantic Ecosystems Initiative","Principal funding was provided by National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery (2014-06290) and Ship Time Grants (486208-2016 and 501154-2017 to GKD), along with University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support program grants (2016, 2017) to GKD.

Comparisons of cortisol levels during ontogeny can reveal physiological plasticity to species or population specific socioecological factors and in turn how these factors might ameliorate or exaggerate mother-offspring and sibling conflict. Here, we examine developmental patterns of cortisol levels in two wild chimpanzee populations (Budongo and Tai), with two and three communities each, and one wild bonobo population (LuiKotale), with two communities. Both species have similar juvenile life histories. Nonetheless, we predicted that key differences in socio-ecological factors, such as feeding competition, would lead to interspecific variation in mother-offspring and sibling conflict and thus variation in ontogenetic cortisol patterns. We measured urinary cortisol levels in 1394 samples collected from 37 bonobos and 100 chimpanzees aged up to 12 years. The significant differences in age-related variation in cortisol levels appeared population specific rather than species specific. Both bonobos and Tai chimpanzees had comparatively stable and gradually increasing cortisol levels throughout development; Budongo chimpanzees experienced declining cortisol levels before increases in later ontogeny. These age-related population differences in cortisol patterns were not explained by mother-offspring or sibling conflict specifically; instead, the comparatively stable cortisol patterns of bonobos and Tai chimpanzees likely reflect a consistency in experience of competition and the social environment compared with Budongo chimpanzees, where mothers may adopt more variable strategies related to infanticide risk and resource availability. The clear population-level differences within chimpanzees highlight potential intraspecific flexibility in developmental processes in apes, suggesting the flexibility and diversity in rearing strategies seen in humans may have a deep evolutionary history.

Interaction chains result from linked direct interactions between species pairs. Interaction modifications, emergent effects of a multispecies assemblage, result when a third species changes how a pair of other species interacts. Experiments and patterns of abundance in the upper zone of a rocky intertidal community provide examples of both types of indirect effects. By consuming limpets (Lottia digitalis), bird predators indirectly enhance acorn barnacle (Balanus glandula) abundance on horizontal rock benches because limpets dislodge or inadvertently consume young acorn barnacles, an example of an interaction chain. Because L. digitalis has a light-colored shell that is similar in color to barnacle shells, barnacles alter the bird-limpet interaction by changing the ability of birds to find limpets, an example of an interaction modification. Distinguishing between interaction chains and interaction modifications is important because interaction chains can be predicted with only a knowledge of pairwise species interactions while descriptions of interaction modifications require a knowledge of all species combinations involved, precluding a priori prediction. By classifying empirically determined indirect effects, the degree to which indirect effects can be predicted from a knowledge of pairwise interactions can be determined, and the mechanisms that cause interaction modifications can be identified to aid in future prediction.","UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT ZOOL, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",,,"Wootton, J.

Along the east coast of Australia, the alga can also persist in mangroves as a free-living form trapped amongst pneumatophores. We investigated (1) whether the alga has an effect on molluscan species richness and abundance in mangroves similar to that on rocky shores, and (2) whether, in mangroves, the source (phenotypically distinct estuarine or rocky shore populations) of H. banksii influences the outcome of its interspecific interactions. Sampling of 3 rocky shore and 3 mangrove sites along the east coast of Australia revealed that patches of H. banksii consistently supported a greater species richness of molluscs than adjacent substratum. Whereas the alga increased the abundance of molluscs in the mangrove forest, it had no effect or decreased molluscan abundance on the rocky shore. Transplant of H. banksii from rocky shores and estuarine tidal flats into the mangrove indicated that the source of the algae influenced the magnitude of effects. Although all algae enhanced molluscan abundance and species richness, estuarine H. banksii, which had larger vesicles and a longer thallus, supported more molluscs of more species than rocky shore H. banksii. These results support the growing consensus that the influence of foundation species at the community level is dependent on environmental conditions. As human activities place increasing pressure on coastal ecosystems, it will be important to understand the mechanisms and conditions that determine community-level effects of foundation species so that biodiversity may be conserved.","[Bishop, Melanie J.; Morgan, Tara; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Hardstaff, Lyndle K.; Evenden, Robert W.] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Bishop, Melanie J.; Morgan, Tara; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Hardstaff, Lyndle K.; Evenden, Robert W.] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environm Resource Management, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Coleman, Melinda A.] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Bishop, MJ (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",mbishop@bio.mq.edu.au,"Coleman, Melinda A/R-5563-2016; Kelaher, Brendan/P-3647-2017","Coleman, Melinda A/0000-0003-2623-633X; Kelaher, Brendan/0000-0002-7505-4412; Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"We thank B.

Lizards have much lower extinction rates than spiders, even for the same population sizes. Spiders naturally and experimentally become extinct more frequently in the presence than absence of lizards; islands with lizards have fewer spider species than no-lizard islands. The larger the island area, and (for no-lizard islands) the nearer to a potential source, the lower the extinction rate of spider species; both can be related to a tendency for smaller populations to become extinct more readily. Within particular spider species, population time series with higher variabilities in population size tend to have lower extinction rates. Mean population size of a series is positively correlated with temporal variability and negatively correlated with extinction rate; even when these correlations are taken into account in multiple regression, however, a negative relation of temporal variability and extinction rate often exists. A conceptual scheme including immigration and catastrophic mortality, in addition to normal stochastic birth and death rates, appears to accord at least qualitatively with these results. Insular spider populations in the Bahamas appear much closer to a BOORMAN-LEVITT metapopulation than to a LEVINS metapopulation, a similarity that seems to hold for organisms in general.

In Western Europe, several amphibian species have been introduced in recent decades, among them Discoglossus pictus, impact of which in native amphibian communities is still unknown. We studied the potential impact of D. pictus by analysing the degree of niche overlap, assuming the possible existence of competitive interactions with native species. We have studied the structure of the anuran assemblage at local level, defining the morphospace occupied by native species and the habitat occupied by the different ecomorphs. The analysis of distance matrices suggested that there was a covariation between morphological characters and habitat selection. We determined the position of D. pictus within the morphospace of the native anuran community, patterns of co-occurrence among alien, and native species and habitat selection. The potential effect of climate on local assemblages had been controlled based on data obtained from climate models. These analysis showed that D. pictus was clustered with the benthic guild, selected positively small ephemeral ponds and was a thermophilic species. Based on these results, a greater degree of niche overlap was expected with Bufo calamita and Pelodytes punctatus. The definition of morphological groups can be useful to understand the invaded assemblage structure and the potential effect of an alien frog on native communities.","[Escoriza, Daniel; Boix, Dani] Univ Girona, Inst Aquat Ecol, Fac Sci, Girona 17071, Spain; [Escoriza, Daniel; Boix, Dani] Univ Girona, Dept Environm Sci, Fac Sci, Girona 17071, Spain","Escoriza, D (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Inst Aquat Ecol, Fac Sci, Campus Montilivi, Girona 17071, Spain.",daniel_escoriza@hotmail.com,"Boix, Dani/L-5190-2014; Escoriza, Daniel/AAP-9813-2021","Boix, Dani/0000-0001-5468-2236; Escoriza, Daniel/0000-0002-6853-0134",Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [GL2008 05778/BOS],"We want to thank to the Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia, Programa de Investigacion Fundamental which funded the research performed in Spanish territory (ref.

Fishes were captured by angling, surgically implanted with radio transmitters, and tracked actively from June through September. Most brook trout (96%) and landlocked salmon (72%) displayed long distance movements (>1 km) to open water bodies (28 June to 4 July) followed by periods of time spent in presumed thermal refugia (5 July to 16 September). Summer water temperature rose above 25 degrees C, near the reported lethal limits for these coldwater species. In contrast, the majority of smallmouth bass (68%), a warmwater species, did not make long distance movements from areas of initial capture, remaining in mainstem sections of the river (28 June to 16 September). Spatial overlap of smallmouth bass and brook trout in the summer is unlikely because brook trout presumably move to thermal refugia during this time. However, interspecific competition between brook trout and landlocked salmon may occur since they select similar habitats June through September.","[Jackson, Casey A.

Overcompensation can contribute to the Hydra effect, wherein added mortality increases equilibrium population size. One hypothesis for overcompensation is that added mortality eases density dependence, increasing survival to adulthood (temporal separation of mortality and density dependence). Mortality early in the life cycle is therefore predicted to cause overcompensation, whereas mortality later in the life cycle is not. Another hypothesis for overcompensation is that threat of mortality (e.g., from predation) causes behavioral changes that reduce overexploitation of resources, allowing resource recovery, and increasing production of adults (prudent resource exploitation). Behaviorally active predation cues alone are therefore predicted to cause overcompensation. We tested these predictions in two experiments with larvae of two species of Aedes. As predicted, early mortality yielded greater production of adults, and of adult females, and greater estimated rate of population increase than did later mortality. Addition of water-borne predation cues usually reduced browsing on surfaces in late-stage larvae, but contrary to prediction, resulted in neither significantly greater production of adult mosquitoes nor significantly greater estimated rate of increase. Thus we have strong evidence that timing of mortality contributes to overcompensation and the Hydra effect in mosquitoes. Evidence that predation cues alone can result in overcompensation via prudent resource exploitation is lacking. We expect the overcompensation in response to early mortality will be common in organisms with complex life cycles, density dependence among juveniles, and developmental control of populations.","[McIntire, Kristina M.; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Juliano, SA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",sajulian@ilstu.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553; McIntire, Kristina/0000-0002-1387-5637","NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [1R15AI094322-01A1, 1R15AI124005-01]; Illinois State University's office of Research and Sponsored Programs; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322, R15AI124005] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank K.

The seasonal activity patterns and food habits of these tortoises are studied in the present paper. K. erosa and K. homeana have similar activity patterns, with peaks occurring during the wet season. Kinixys belliana was found only during the wet months. There was no evidence of any specific effect of humidity of the air on their activity intensity, and it seems likely that, more than absolute values of air humidity, the crucial factor to force tortoises into high activity is the sudden change between dry days and very wet days at the onset of the rainy season (end of March - early April). K. homeana was significantly more active in the early phase of the wet season. Common items, which were consumed by all three predator species, were: plant matters, fruits and berries, fungi, Oligochaeta, and Gastropoda Pulmonata, whereas Araneidae were also consumed by all species, but much more rarely. Common prey items, which were consumed by K. homeana and not by K. erosa were: Coleoptera larvae, Dermaptera, and termites. K. homeana appeared more generalist than K. erosa, and the respective diets diverged considerably both in dry and in wet seasons. On the other hand, the diets of K. erosa and K. belliana were more similar (at least in wet season).","FIZV, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, I-00198 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), FIZV, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,58,21,21,0,11,NATURALIS BIODIVERSITY CENTER,LEIDEN,"DARWINWEG 2, LEIDEN, 2333 CR, NETHERLANDS",1383-4517,1875-9866,,CONTRIB ZOOL,Contrib.

As such, they may serve as sentinel species, warning humans of alterations in habitat and ecosystem integrity in a region that is undergoing vast change due to climate warming. Here, we characterized the abundance and habitat use of four arctic breeding species of loons in the plains and surrounding mountains of western Chukotka, Russia. Loon surveys were conducted on foot and by boat from 2009-2015. Loon species differed in their use of the four lacustrine habitat types within the study area. In yedoma habitat, the yellow-billed loon (Gavia. adamsii) was the most abundant (0.593 birds/km(2)); on fluvial plain habitat, Pacific loons (G. pacifica) outnumbered other loons (0.701 birds/km(2)); mountain valleys were inhabited similarly by pacifica (0.354 birds/km(2)) and red-throated loons (G.stellata; 0.307); and maritime tundra was used only by pacifica (1.13) and Arctic loons (G. arctica; 0.553). G. adamsii was not observed in mountain valleys or maritime tundra. Mountainous portions of rivers were predominantly occupied by stellata and pacifica, and lowland rivers by stellata, pacifica and arctica. There was a significant difference in the size of lakes occupied by the four congeners. The largest loon, adamsii, occupied the largest lakes (0.69 km(2)), 80% larger than lakes utilized by pacifica (0.39 km(2)) and arctica (0.38 km(2)), and 35 times larger than stellata (0.02 km(2)).

We studied the influence of the shrubs Buxus sempervirens and Juniperus communis on Q. humilis establishment, and of Buxus on the growth of established Q. humilis individuals. 2 Percentage germination of experimentally planted Q. humilis was higher under shrubs than in nearby open areas and higher on the north than the south side of the canopy. Germination where part of the canopy has been removed was similar to that away from the shrubs, suggesting that the facilitation mechanism is related to changes in microclimate rather than to a soil effect. 3 When exposed to sheep for 1 month, 100% of 326 unprotected oak seedlings were grazed, causing 44% mortality. The presence of Buxus and Juniperus improved seedling survival by protecting them against sheep grazing and summer drought. Predation by rodents was however greater under shrub cover. 4 The highest leaf dry mass of oak seedlings was recorded under Juniperus where light conditions seem more favourable for growth than under Buxus (direct effect) or in grassland (indirect effect). The growth of naturally established individuals of Q. humilis (in terms of total leaf mass per annual branch and width of rings) was lower under Buxus than in grassland but the values became similar once the canopy was overtopped. 5 The balance between positive and negative interactions varied in relation to the life stage of Q. humilis and the two shrub species. Regeneration of Q. humilis in open grassland was prevented by grazing. The protection offered by shrubs continues to offset the negative interference on growth, particularly under Buxus, so that plants could survive to overtop the shrub canopy and reach maturity. The succession pathway therefore depends closely on the distribution of shrubs in the grassland.","Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UPR 9056, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Lepart, J (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UPR 9056, 1919 Route de Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,50,165,182,3,54,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

When parasite populations are at relatively low abundance, the negative effects on host populations may be insignificant, but when parasite abundance increases beyond critical thresholds, they can have population limiting effects on the host. Here, we used data from a 40-yr demographic study on breeding Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) and avian brood parasitic Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) in the mid-Atlantic United States to disentangle host-parasite interactions. The relative abundance for these two species has changed both locally and regionally over this time period with a reduction in host abundance coincident with an increase in the parasite population. We detected a fivefold increase in Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism rates of Wood Thrushes over the 40-yr time period leading to a reduction in Wood Thrush fitness (i.e.,adult survival, fecundity, and recruitment). After accounting for the effects of Wood Thrush age, individual, and annual and within-season variation in reproduction, we found that Wood Thrushes exhibited increased reproductive effort (produced more nests per year) as nest parasitism rates increased. Additionally, we found that as parasitism rates increased, both Wood Thrush clutch size and fecundity declined. In conjunction with widespread habitat loss and land use change on both wintering and breeding ranges, increasing rates of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism are reducing Wood Thrush fitness, and are likely contributing to observed regional Wood Thrush population declines. Coordinated local and regional efforts to reduce Brown-headed Cowbird populations, particularly in fragmented landscapes, may help reduce the decline for Wood Thrushes, and likely other parasitized Neotropical migratory species.","[Ladin, Zachary S.] Univ Delaware, Dept Entomol & Wildlife Ecol, 264 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [D'Amico, Vincent] US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, 531 South Coll Ave,Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Baetens, Jan M.] Univ Ghent, Dept Math Modeling Stat & Bioinformat, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Roth, Roland R.; Shriver, W.

Heteromyids cache seeds throughout their home ranges, either concentrated in I location (larder hoard) or in multiple, small seed piles (scatter hoards). To minimize cache pilferage by other rodents, coexisting species may scatter hoard seeds in distinct microhabitats. We examined interspecific differences in caching and pilfering behaviors of 3 coexisting heteromyid rodents, Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami), the pale kangaroo mouse (Microdipodops pallidus), and the little pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris), to determine if caching microhabitat affects likelihood of pilferage. In outdoor enclosures we tracked cache placement and measured pilferage of artificial caches using radiolabeled Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) seeds. M. pallidus and P. longimembris placed seed caches mostly under shrubs, whereas D. merriami placed caches predominately in open microhabitat. However, D. merriami showed a significant preference for pilfering caches under shrubs, whereas P. longimembris did not show a significant preference for pilfering caches in either open or undershrub microhabitats. The 2 species pilfered similar numbers of caches. Coexisting heteroymid rodent species may contribute to spatial heterogeneity of available resources by caching in different microhabitats, thereby reducing but not eliminating cache pilferage by other species.

Abundant recruitment up to 80 m from the wood margins and from isolated oak trees in grassland shows that acorns are dispersed effectively. At the three study sites, the density of Q. humilis individuals was higher under shrubs than in grassland, suggesting that facilitation may occur. This density difference was much higher in the grazed sites than in the ungrazed site. Moreover, before grazing by livestock, the distribution of first-year seedlings is independent of vegetation cover. Thus, shrubs improve Q. humilis regeneration by protecting individuals from grazing. The high density of individuals at the northern edge of shrubs suggests that a second facilitation mechanism may exist, probably related to improved germination conditions. Facilitation by shrubs appears to be very important for Q. humilis dynamics.","CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Lepart, J (corresponding author), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,55,81,86,1,30,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,UPPSALA,"BOX 25137, S 752 25 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Aside from the unequal sample sizes involved with using this abundance-limited method, confounding factors potentially associated with levels of social interactions may also be introduced. The alternative, volume-limited method, i.e., varying the volume while maintaining equal numbers of animals, can provide a test for the presence of potentially confounding factors. Using tadpoles of Fowler's Toad, Anaxyrus fowleri, we examined the effect of density on growth rate, timing of metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis in both abundance-limited and volume-limited experiments. We found no difference in tadpole growth rate or timing of metamorphosis between these two methods, but the metamorphs emerging from abundance-limited low density treatments were significantly smaller when compared to those in volume-limited low density treatments. Because toad tadpoles may naturally form social aggregations and schools, this suggests that the actual number of animals present may be important for normal social behavior and optimizing feeding rate. If volume-limited and abundance-limited methods of manipulating density are not equivalent, treatment method may itself be a factor that can differentially affect growth variables.","[Yagi, Katharine T.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21111 Lakeshore Rd,Ste Anne Bellevue, Quebec City, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Yagi, Katharine T.; Green, David M.] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada","Green, DM (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada.",katharine.yagi@mail.mcgill.ca; david.m.green@mcgill.ca,,,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF); Wildlife Preservation Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Financial support for this research came from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF), Wildlife Preservation Canada, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grants to DMG).

However, considering individual variation over short timescales can help us better understand the interaction between invaders and native species. We compared trophic traits of the non-native guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and the native Brazilian poeciliid Phalloceros harpagos using experiments simulating the early stages of an invasive process. We used short-term mesocosms to simulate an early invasion scenario, where the two species were placed together, and a pre-invasion scenario, where species were kept separated, and analyzed interspecific and intraspecific trophic variability. We also compared the foraging efficiency of species in laboratory experiments. We found no differences on the mean diet of both species between pre and early invasion treatments. At the individual level, in the early invasion scenario, individuals of both species reduced their trophic niche as a probable effect of the presence of the heterospecific. Phalloceros harpagos had higher consumption rates than guppies indicating greater efficiency in feeding on invertebrates. Our results suggest that non-native species were not intrinsically better consumers of high-quality resources. Instead, intraspecific variation might be playing an overlooked role in shaping interactions between species during the early stages of invasion.","[Amaral, Jeferson R.; Manna, Luisa R.; Mazzoni, Rosana; Neres-Lima, Vinicius; Marques, Piata S.; Zandona, Eugenia] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [El-Sabaawi, Rana W.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Cunningham Bldg 202, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada","Zandona, E (corresponding author), Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",eugenia.zandona@gmail.com,"Zandona, Eugenia/ABG-8207-2020; Neres-Lima, Vinicius/S-9152-2016","Zandona, Eugenia/0000-0003-4754-5326; Neres-Lima, Vinicius/0000-0003-3802-3438; Amaral, Jeferson Ribeiro/0000-0002-4454-1066","Prociencia UERJ [FAPERJ/CNE/E-26-202.762/2018, CNPq/Pq1D-301463/2017-4, FAPERJ JCNE E-26/203.213/2017, CNPq/Pq2-308261/2017-8]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [PrInt 88887.369182/2019-00, 001];  [FAPERJ E-26/202.782/2016];  [E-26/202.783/2016]","We thank field assistants from the Stream Ecology and Fish Ecology labs at the State University of Rio de Janeiro.

With warming temperatures, lake ecosystems in the Arctic are predicted to change in terms of hydrologic flow, water levels, and connectivity with other lakes. We surveyed lakes in northern Alaska to understand how shifts in the distribution or availability of fish may affect the occupancy and breeding success of Pacific (Gavia pacifica) and Yellow-billed Loons (G. adamsii). We then modeled the influence of the presence and abundance of five fish species and the physical characteristics of lakes (e.g., hydrologic connectivity) on loon lake occupancy and chick production. The presence of Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) had a positive influence on Pacific Loon occupancy and chick production, which suggests that small-bodied fish species provide important prey for loon chicks. No characteristics of fish species abundance affected Yellow-billed Loon lake occupancy. Instead, Yellow-billed Loon occupancy was influenced by the physical characteristics of lakes that contribute to persistent fish populations, such as the size of the lake and the proportion of the lake that remained unfrozen over winter. Neither of these variables, however, influenced chick production. The probability of an unoccupied territory becoming occupied in a subsequent year by Yellow-billed Loons was low, and no loon chicks were successfully raised in territories that were previously unoccupied. In contrast, unoccupied territories had a much higher probability of becoming occupied by Pacific Loons, which suggests that Yellow-billed Loons have strict habitat requirements and suitable breeding lakes may be limited. Territories that were occupied had high probabilities of remaining occupied for both loon species.","[Uher-Koch, Brian D.; Wright, Kenneth G.; Uher-Koch, Hannah R.; Schmutz, Joel A.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Uher-Koch, Hannah R.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK USA","Uher-Koch, BD (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",buher-koch@usgs.gov,,,Biodiversity Research Institute; Bureau of Land Management Arctic Office; Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative of the U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area,"We thank the following individuals for field assistance: H.

Correlations between body size and the use of foraging sites in trees are well described for European tits. Our results indicate that similar correlations exist in this Korean guild. There were significant differences among species in frequency of use of five foraging site categories in trees: trunks, branches, twigs, leaves, needles. The larger the species, the more often it used trunks and branches for foraging. There was a positive correlation between body-size difference and the difference in the foraging sites between species, indicating that species of similar body sizes foraged in similar sites in trees. For four species not specialized in using conifers (Parus varius, P. major, P. palustris, Aegithalos caudatus), there was a negative correlation between body size difference between species and the difference in the frequency of foraging in conifers, suggesting that birds of similar body sizes foraged in different tree species. We suggest a possible role of dominance in creating this relationship. This is one of the few reports of foraging niche differences among tits in temperate forests in Asia. This report is important in that it shows, for the first time, foraging niche differences in a previously unstudied guild of tits, and that the differences are correlated with size differences, just as in the well studied guild of tits in Europe.","Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland; Korea Environm Inst, Seoul 156090, South Korea","Jablonski, PG (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland.",piotrjab@manduca.neurobio.arizona.edu; Leesd@keins.kei.re.kr,"Jablonski, Piotr/K-4231-2012",/0000-0002-8333-0106,,,,50,13,13,0,10,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,1999,76,1,,,,,17,23,,,,,7,Ornithology,Zoology,214XT,WOS:000081353400002,,,,,2021-09-23,

If indirect effects have strong ecological effects, then they must also have strong evolutionary effects through natural selection. We consider how indirect effects, both positive and negative, combine with positive and negative direct effects to influence evolution between interacting species. Any one species can evolve in response to direct interactions with other species by changing its ''response'' to the presence of the other species or changing its ''effect'' on the species. We argue that the direction (positive or negative) of the direct and indirect effects will determine whether traits related to ''response'' or ''effect'' are most likely to be subject to natural selection. Further, covariance patterns of species in the same community should increase when direct and indirect effects between species act in the same direction, resulting in greater compartmentalization of such communities.",,"Miller, TE (corresponding author), FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, B-157, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA.",,,,,,,56,79,80,3,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1996,77,5,,,,,1329,1335,,10.2307/2265530,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UX396,WOS:A1996UX39600003,,,,,2021-09-23,

Repetition of experiments in space and time provides an estimate of this variability at specific scales, but does not explain how changes in variance generate structure in assemblages and the extent to which variance and mean intensity interact. This paper seeks to identify suitable procedures for empirical analyses on the influence of variance and mean intensity of predictor ecological variables on spatial and temporal patterns in natural populations. A survey of the ecological literature indicates that temporal variability in studies of disturbance and in analyses of consumer-resource interactions is generally expressed in terms of frequency of events. This is inappropriate, as frequency confounds the variance with the mean effect size of a process. A possible solution to the problem involves experimental designs in which levels of intensity and those of variability are chosen independently over explicit spatial or temporal scales and treated as fixed, orthogonal factors. Examples are offered for various scenarios of consumer-resource interactions along with indications for statistical tests of hypotheses. Such novel approaches have important ramifications for understanding variability in a wide range of ecological contexts and for predicting the response of assemblages to increased environmental fluctuations, including those expected under modified climate conditions.","Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","Benedetti-Cecchi, L (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, Via A Volta 6, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",bencecc@discuit.unipi.it,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012; Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/J-8225-2019","Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/0000-0001-5244-5202",,,,75,144,147,2,84,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2003,84,9,,,,,2335,2346,,10.1890/02-8011,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,719VQ,WOS:000185226100010,,,,,2021-09-23,

Such assemblages may be organized at the level of guilds rather than at the finer species level. In a ten-year study of assemblages of fish at One Tree Reef, Great Barrier Reef, we found species composition and the number of fish on a given lagoonal patch reef vary greatly across time (Sale and Douglas 1984; Sale et al. in preparation). The mean average proportional similarity of a reef's assemblage to itself at different times (censuses) is usually low at a value of around 0.5. This apparent variability may be ecologically irrelevant noise if organization is at the higher guild level. We have recast our database at the guild level to test this possibility. Thirteen guilds were defined by the diets, foraging habitats and times of the individual species comprising them. Similarity of an assemblage to itself at successive censuses was re-calculated using the number of individuals in each guild instead of the numbers in each species. This analysis yielded significantly higher levels of similarity (P<0.01) among censuses. To test whether this increase in similarity was due solely to the smaller number of categories used to calculate the similarity indices, 5 sets of randomly generated guilds were constructed using a Monte Carlo approach. No significant difference (P>0.05) was found between the average similarity among censuses when assemblages were classified into these null guilds and when they were classified according to the real guilds. These results indicate that shifting to the larger taxonomic scale of guilds does not reveal a significantly more persistent assemblage structure than that revealed when analysis is at the smaller scale of species.

Biogeographical processes that influence speciation and extinction rates determine the size and composition of this regional species pool. Community ecologists are beginning to recognize the importance of these biogeographical processes in influencing diversity patterns among local communities, but the potential for local interactions to influence biogeographical processes, especially speciation, has been little considered. In this paper I discuss one mechanism by which variation in the strengths of local interactions can influence the potential for population differentiation and thus for influencing speciation rates in the allopatric model of speciation. When more than one selective agent acts on the phenotype, the shape of the overall fitness surface depends critically on the relative strengths of the various selective agents. If one selective agent, which imparts strong selection, acts in all populations of a species, population differentiation via adaptation to local ecological conditions or via differentiation of sexual systems is retarded because the overall fitness surface in all populations strongly resembles the shape of the strongest selective agent. Consequently, the potential for speciation is reduced. Alternatively, if selective agents in various populations impart relatively equitable strengths of selection, the potential for differences in the overall fitness surfaces among populations is enhanced, which will enhance the potential for population differentiation and thus speciation. Analogous results obtain when multiple selective agents impact genetically correlated characters. Because the strength of selection generated by a species interaction should increase with the strength of the interaction, and because fewer species can usually coexist when the strengths of interactions are greater, the number of coexisting species and the potential for speciation in component taxa may covary among communities. This analysis indicates that the relative strengths of interactions can be as important to diversification in communities as the number of niche dimensions along which differentiation can occur.",,"McPeek, MA (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Comparison of resource use at multiple locations with differing resource availability can allow fundamental specialists to be distinguished from species that simply feed predominantly on prey types that are locally abundant. This study investigates geographic variation in the feeding ecology of coral-feeding butterflyfishes to examine whether patterns of resource use and levels of dietary specialisation vary among distinct locations, corresponding with changes in resource availability. Our specific aims were to investigate whether the dietary niche breadth of four butterflyfishes varies among five geographically separated locations and assess whether each species utilises similar resources in each location. Resource availability and dietary composition of four butterflyfishes were quantified at three sites across each of five geographic locations throughout the Pacific. Niche breadth, niche overlap, and resource selection functions were calculated for each species at each site and compared among locations. Availability of dietary resources varied significantly among locations and sites. Chaetodon vagabundus, C. citrinellus and C. lunulatus had low levels of dietary specialisation and used different resources in each location. Chaetodon trifascialis had high levels of dietary specialisation and used the same few resources in each location. Our results indicate that relative levels of dietary specialisation among different butterflyfishes do hold at larger spatial scales, however, geographical variation in the dietary composition of all butterflyfishes indicates that prey availability has a fundamental influence on dietary composition. Highly specialised species such as C. trifascialis will be highly vulnerable to coral loss as they appear to be largely inflexible in their dietary composition. However, the increased feeding plasticity observed here for C. trifascialis suggests this species may have a greater capacity to respond to coral loss than previously assumed.","[Lawton, Rebecca J.; Cole, Andrew J.; Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Lawton, Rebecca J.; Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia","Lawton, RJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",rebecca.lawton@my.jcu.edu.au,"cole, andrew J/L-5764-2013; Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020; Cole, Andrew/G-5220-2011; Berumen, Michael L/F-7745-2011; Lawton, Rebecca/E-5711-2014; Lawton, Rebecca/A-6149-2012; Pratchett, Morgan S/A-9256-2010","Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Berumen, Michael L/0000-0003-2463-2742; Lawton, Rebecca/0000-0001-6296-6415; Pratchett, Morgan S/0000-0002-1862-8459",Queensland Government; Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia; American Australian Association; Lizard Island Research Station (a facility of The Australian Museum); Project Aware; Australian Coral Reef Society,"We thank D.

For wetland-dependent amphibians, forested buffers may mitigate timber-harvest impacts, but little empirical research has focused on buffers around lentic habitats. We conducted a landscape experiment to examine how spotted salamander and wood frog reproductive output (i.e., eggmass and metamorph production) respond to clearcutting mediated by buffers of different widths (i.e., uncut, 30 m buffer, 100 m buffer) at ephemeral pools in an industrial forest. We found complex interactions between buffer treatment and reproductive output, which were strongly mediated by hydroperiod. Overall, reproductive output was most sensitive at 30 m-buffer pools and for salamanders, but responses diverged across productivity metrics even within these categories. Notably, for both cut treatments over time, while salamander eggmass abundance decreased, metamorph productivity (i.e., snout-vent length [SVL] and abundance) tended to increase. For example, average metamorph SVLs were predicted to lengthen between 0.2 and 0.4 mm per year post-cut. Additionally, typical relationships between reproductive output and hydroperiod (as indicated by the reference treatment) were disrupted for both species in both cut treatments. For example, long-hydroperiod pools produced more salamander metamorphs than short-hydroperiod pools in both the reference and 30 m-buffer treatments, but the rate of increase was lower in the 30 m-buffer treatment such that a long-hydroperiod pool in the reference treatment was predicted to produce, on average, 24 more metamorphs than a similar pool in the 30 m-buffer treatment. From a conservation perspective, our results highlight the importance of evaluating both terrestrial and aquatic responses to terrestrial habitat disturbance, since responses may be reinforcing (i.e., exert similarly positive or negative effects, with the potential for amplification in the aquatic habitat) or decoupled (i.e., operate independently or be negatively correlated, with responses in the aquatic habitat potentially dampening or counteracting responses in the terrestrial habitat).","[Powell, Jessica S.

Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance from active woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 kHz. Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-kHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies <1.0 kHz and >4.0 kHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%. Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464. 5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing militry-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment. We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds. We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year. Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels [dB]) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubation-phase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with >= 2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites. Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, incrased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training.
